We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.834113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333204","","Intelligent networks;Network topology;Vehicle dynamics;Communication switching;Protocols;Control systems;Convergence;Laplace equations;Automatic control;Communication system control","","10555","7","39","IEEE","13 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The underlying techniques exploit space diversity available through cooperating terminals' relaying signals for one another. We outline several strategies employed by the cooperating radios, including fixed relaying schemes such as amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward, selection relaying schemes that adapt based upon channel measurements between the cooperating terminals, and incremental relaying schemes that adapt based upon limited feedback from the destination terminal. We develop performance characterizations in terms of outage events and associated outage probabilities, which measure robustness of the transmissions to fading, focusing on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Except for fixed decode-and-forward, all of our cooperative diversity protocols are efficient in the sense that they achieve full diversity (i.e., second-order diversity in the case of two terminals), and, moreover, are close to optimum (within 1.5 dB) in certain regimes. Thus, using distributed antennas, we can provide the powerful benefits of space diversity without need for physical arrays, though at a loss of spectral efficiency due to half-duplex operation and possibly at the cost of additional receive hardware. Applicable to any wireless setting, including cellular or ad hoc networks-wherever space constraints preclude the use of physical arrays-the performance characterizations reveal that large power or energy savings result from the use of these protocols.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.838089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1362898","Diversity techniques;fading channels;outage probability;relay channel;user cooperation;wireless networks","Wireless networks;Wireless application protocol;Relays;Fading;Decoding;Feedback;Robustness;Signal to noise ratio;Receiving antennas;Antenna arrays","","10294","68","42","IEEE","30 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement, and uses the same order of calculations as linearization.

This approach realizes a dynamical system that supplies each vehicle with a common reference to be used for cooperative motion. We prove a separation principle that decomposes formation stability into two components: Stability of this is achieved information flow for the given graph and stability of an individual vehicle for the given controller.

Clustering sensor nodes is an effective topology control approach. We propose a novel distributed clustering approach for long-lived ad hoc sensor networks. Our proposed approach does not make any assumptions about the presence of infrastructure or about node capabilities, other than the availability of multiple power levels in sensor nodes. We present a protocol, HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of the node residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED terminates in O(1) iterations, incurs low message overhead, and achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. We prove that, with appropriate bounds on node density and intracluster and intercluster transmission ranges, HEED can asymptotically almost surely guarantee connectivity of clustered networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting scalable data aggregation.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2004.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347100","Index Terms- Sensor networks;clustering;network lifetime;energy efficiency;fault tolerance.","Energy efficiency;Energy consumption;Chemical sensors;Scalability;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Network topology;Delay;Routing protocols;Availability;Fault tolerance","","3482","3","45","IEEE","25 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style ""push -relabel"" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style ""augmenting paths."" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation.

First, we propose a theoretical discussion and experimental analysis aimed at understanding and assessing the potentialities of SVM classifiers in hyperdimensional feature spaces. Then, we assess the effectiveness of SVMs with respect to conventional feature-reduction-based approaches and their performances in hypersubspaces of various dimensionalities. To sustain such an analysis, the performances of SVMs are compared with those of two other nonparametric classifiers (i.e., radial basis function neural networks and the K-nearest neighbor classifier). Finally, we study the potentially critical issue of applying binary SVMs to multiclass problems in hyperspectral data. In particular, four different multiclass strategies are analyzed and compared: the one-against-all, the one-against-one, and two hierarchical tree-based strategies. Different performance indicators have been used to support our experimental studies in a detailed and accurate way, i.e., the classification accuracy, the computational time, the stability to parameter setting, and the complexity of the multiclass architecture. The results obtained on a real Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer hyperspectral dataset allow to conclude that, whatever the multiclass strategy adopted, SVMs are a valid and effective alternative to conventional pattern recognition approaches (feature-reduction procedures combined with a classification method) for the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.831865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323134","","Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Remote sensing;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Performance analysis;Radial basis function networks;Stability;Computer architecture;Infrared imaging","","3349","3","48","IEEE","16 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method can be used in computer analyses of retinal images, e.g., in automated screening for diabetic retinopathy. The system is based on extraction of image ridges, which coincide approximately with vessel centerlines. The ridges are used to compose primitives in the form of line elements. With the line elements an image is partitioned into patches by assigning each image pixel to the closest line element. Every line element constitutes a local coordinate frame for its corresponding patch. For every pixel, feature vectors are computed that make use of properties of the patches and the line elements. The feature vectors are classified using a kNN-classifier and sequential forward feature selection. The algorithm was tested on a database consisting of 40 manually labeled images. The method achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.952. The method is compared with two recently published rule-based methods of Hoover et al. and Jiang et al. .

Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this article we present a survey of state-of-the-art routing techniques in WSNs. We first outline the design challenges for routing protocols in WSNs followed by a comprehensive survey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into three categories based on the underlying network structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Furthermore, these protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based, QoS-based, and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation. We study the design trade-offs between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the advantages and performance issues of each routing technique.

Instead, an image covariance matrix is constructed directly using the original image matrices, and its eigenvectors are derived for image feature extraction. To test 2DPCA and evaluate its performance, a series of experiments were performed on three face image databases: ORL, AR, and Yale face databases.

The challenge in such multiuser systems is designing transmit vectors while considering the co-channel interference of other users. Typical optimization problems of interest include the capacity problem - maximizing the sum information rate subject to a power constraint-or the power control problem-minimizing transmitted power such that a certain quality-of-service metric for each user is met. Neither of these problems possess closed-form solutions for the general multiuser MIMO channel, but the imposition of certain constraints can lead to closed-form solutions. This paper presents two such constrained solutions. The first, referred to as ""block-diagonalization,"" is a generalization of channel inversion when there are multiple antennas at each receiver. It is easily adapted to optimize for either maximum transmission rate or minimum power and approaches the optimal solution at high SNR. The second, known as ""successive optimization,"" is an alternative method for solving the power minimization problem one user at a time, and it yields superior results in some (e.g., low SNR) situations. Both of these algorithms are limited to cases where the transmitter has more antennas than all receive antennas combined. In order to accommodate more general scenarios, we also propose a framework for coordinated transmitter-receiver processing that generalizes the two algorithms to cases involving more receive than transmit antennas. While the proposed algorithms are suboptimal, they lead to simpler transmitter and receiver structures and allow for a reasonable tradeoff between performance and complexity.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261332","","Downlink;MIMO;Receiving antennas;Closed-form solution;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Multiaccess communication;Wireless communication;Throughput;Interchannel interference","","2535","129","30","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It provides a sufficient condition under which both OMP and Donoho's basis pursuit (BP) paradigm can recover the optimal representation of an exactly sparse signal. It leverages this theory to show that both OMP and BP succeed for every sparse input signal from a wide class of dictionaries. These quasi-incoherent dictionaries offer a natural generalization of incoherent dictionaries, and the cumulative coherence function is introduced to quantify the level of incoherence. This analysis unifies all the recent results on BP and extends them to OMP. Furthermore, the paper develops a sufficient condition under which OMP can identify atoms from an optimal approximation of a nonsparse signal. From there, it argues that OMP is an approximation algorithm for the sparse problem over a quasi-incoherent dictionary. That is, for every input signal, OMP calculates a sparse approximant whose error is only a small factor worse than the minimal error that can be attained with the same number of terms.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.834793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337101","","Approximation algorithms;Matching pursuit algorithms;Dictionaries;Greedy algorithms;Sufficient conditions;Iterative algorithms;Approximation methods;Linear programming;Signal processing;Iterative methods","","2438","20","32","IEEE","27 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Region filling and object removal by exemplar-based image inpainting","A. Criminisi; P. Perez; K.

The challenge is to fill in the hole that is left behind in a visually plausible way. In the past, this problem has been addressed by two classes of algorithms: 1) ""texture synthesis"" algorithms for generating large image regions from sample textures and 2) ""inpainting"" techniques for filling in small image gaps. The former has been demonstrated for ""textures""-repeating two-dimensional patterns with some stochasticity; the latter focus on linear ""structures"" which can be thought of as one-dimensional patterns, such as lines and object contours. This paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm that combines the advantages of these two approaches. We first note that exemplar-based texture synthesis contains the essential process required to replicate both texture and structure; the success of structure propagation, however, is highly dependent on the order in which the filling proceeds. We propose a best-first algorithm in which the confidence in the synthesized pixel values is propagated in a manner similar to the propagation of information in inpainting. The actual color values are computed using exemplar-based synthesis. In this paper, the simultaneous propagation of texture and structure information is achieved by a single , efficient algorithm. Computational efficiency is achieved by a block-based sampling process. A number of examples on real and synthetic images demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in removing large occluding objects, as well as thin scratches. Robustness with respect to the shape of the manually selected target region is also demonstrated. Our results compare favorably to those obtained by existing techniques.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.833105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323101","","Filling;Digital images;Image generation;Computational efficiency;Image sampling;Robustness;Shape;Humans;Two dimensional displays;Water resources","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Hypermedia;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Paintings;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","2390","76","27","IEEE","16 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, to efficiently control the local search and convergence to the global optimum solution, time-varying acceleration coefficients (TVAC) are introduced in addition to the time-varying inertia weight factor in particle swarm optimization (PSO). From the basis of TVAC, two new strategies are discussed to improve the performance of the PSO. First, the concept of ""mutation"" is introduced to the particle swarm optimization along with TVAC (MPSO-TVAC), by adding a small perturbation to a randomly selected modulus of the velocity vector of a random particle by predefined probability. Second, we introduce a novel particle swarm concept ""self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimizer with TVAC (HPSO-TVAC)"". Under this method, only the ""social"" part and the ""cognitive"" part of the particle swarm strategy are considered to estimate the new velocity of each particle and particles are reinitialized whenever they are stagnated in the search space. In addition, to overcome the difficulties of selecting an appropriate mutation step size for different problems, a time-varying mutation step size was introduced. Further, for most of the benchmarks, mutation probability is found to be insensitive to the performance of MPSO-TVAC method. On the other hand, the effect of reinitialization velocity on the performance of HPSO-TVAC method is also observed. Time-varying reinitialization step size is found to be an efficient parameter optimization strategy for HPSO-TVAC method. The HPSO-TVAC strategy outperformed all the methods considered in this investigation for most of the functions. Furthermore, it has also been observed that both the MPSO and HPSO strategies perform poorly when the acceleration coefficients are fixed at two.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.826071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304846","","Particle swarm optimization;Acceleration;Optimization methods;Genetic mutations;Manufacturing;Power engineering and energy;Automation;Automatic control;Personnel;Scholarships","","2363","16","40","IEEE","14 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.","","0-7695-2102-9","10.1109/CGO.2004.1281665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281665","","Information analysis;Program processors;Performance analysis;High level languages;Virtual machining;Runtime;Arithmetic;Application software;Software safety;Algorithm design and analysis","","2313","33","44","IEEE","24 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph.

This enables us to carry out probabilistic modeling and achieves an asymptotically unique decomposition of the data. It reduces problems of interpretation, as each final independent component is now much more likely to be due to only one physical or physiological process. We also describe other improvements to standard ICA, such as temporal prewhitening and variance normalization of timeseries, the latter being particularly useful in the context of dimensionality reduction when weak activation is present. We discuss the use of prior information about the spatiotemporal nature of the source processes, and an alternative-hypothesis testing approach for inference, using Gaussian mixture models. The performance of our approach is illustrated and evaluated on real and artificial FMRI data, and compared to the spatio-temporal accuracy of results obtained from classical ICA and GLM analyses.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.822821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263605","","Independent component analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Testing;Magnetic analysis;Gaussian noise;Signal analysis;Image analysis;Signal processing;Biomedical imaging;Noise reduction","Algorithms;Brain;Cerebral Cortex;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Neurons;Phantoms, Imaging;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes;Vision","2222","18","49","IEEE","6 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the typical BCI system is designed specifically for one particular BCI method and is, therefore, not suited to the systematic studies that are essential for continued progress. In response to this problem, we have developed a documented general-purpose BCI research and development platform called BCI2000. BCI2000 can incorporate alone or in combination any brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the BCI2000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful BCI implementations using this system. To date, we have used BCI2000 to create BCI systems for a variety of brain signals, processing methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function well in online operation and that BCI2000 satisfies the stringent real-time requirements of BCI systems. By substantially reducing labor and cost, BCI2000 facilitates the implementation of different BCI systems and other psychophysiological experiments.

The combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 249 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 b/mm/sup 2/ over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence. The high confidence levels are important because they allow very large databases to be searched exhaustively (one-to-many ""identification mode"") without making false matches, despite so many chances.

Using ultrasonic focused beams, it is possible to remotely generate mechanical vibration sources radiating low-frequency, shear waves inside tissues. Relying on this concept, SSI proposes to create such a source and make it move at a supersonic speed. In analogy with the ""sonic boom"" created by a supersonic aircraft, the resulting shear waves will interfere constructively along a Mach cone, creating two intense plane shear waves. These waves propagate through the medium and are progressively distorted by tissue heterogeneities. An ultrafast scanner prototype is able to both generate this supersonic source and image (5000 frames/s) the propagation of the resulting shear waves. Using inversion algorithms, the shear elasticity of medium can be mapped quantitatively from this propagation movie. The SSI enables tissue elasticity mapping in less than 20 ms, even in strongly viscous medium like breast. Modalities such as shear compounding are implementable by tilting shear waves in different directions and improving the elasticity estimation. Results validating SSI in heterogeneous phantoms are presented. The first in vivo investigations made on healthy volunteers emphasize the potential clinical applicability of SSI for breast cancer detection.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1295425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320804","","Biological tissues;Elasticity;Ultrasonic imaging;Visualization;Viscosity;Focusing;Vibrations;Aircraft manufacture;Prototypes;Motion pictures","Adult;Algorithms;Breast;Connective Tissue;Connective Tissue;Elasticity;Feasibility Studies;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Shear Strength;Ultrasonography, Mammary;Ultrasonography, Mammary;Vibration","1984","66","16","IEEE","9 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gazebo is designed to fill this niche by creating a 3D dynamic multi-robot environment capable of recreating the complex worlds that would be encountered by the next generation of mobile robots. Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization, simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of blackbox systems are all possible applications. Gazebo is developed in cooperation with the Player and Stage projects (Gerkey, B. P., et al., July 2003), (Gerkey, B. P., et al., May 2001), (Vaughan, R.

Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with nodes remaining largely inactive for long time, but becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in several ways: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses a few novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. It enables low-duty-cycle operation in a multihop network. Nodes form virtual clusters based on common sleep schedules to reduce control overhead and enable traffic-adaptive wake-up. S-MAC uses in-channel signaling to avoid overhearing unnecessary traffic. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for applications that require in-network data processing. The paper presents measurement results of S-MAC performance on a sample sensor node, the UC Berkeley Mote, and reveals fundamental tradeoffs on energy, latency and throughput. Results show that S-MAC obtains significant energy savings compared with an 802.11-like MAC without sleeping.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2004.828953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306496","","Media Access Protocol;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Wireless sensor networks;Delay;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Communication system traffic control;Wireless application protocol;Access protocols;Computer networks","","1919","16","24","IEEE","21 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This places severe requirements on sensitivity, linearity and dynamic range of the circuitry in the RF front-end. To improve radio sensitivity of the sensing function through processing gain we investigated three digital signal processing techniques: matched filtering, energy detection and cyclostationary feature detection. Our analysis shows that cyclostationary feature detection has advantages due to its ability to differentiate modulated signals, interference and noise in low signal to noise ratios. In addition, to further improve the sensing reliability, the advantage of a MAC protocol that exploits cooperation among many cognitive users is investigated.","","0-7803-8622-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2004.1399240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1399240","","Cognitive radio;Computer vision;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless networks;Bandwidth;Linearity;Dynamic range;Circuits;Radio frequency;Digital signal processing","","1543","112","12","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Designing very high speed wireless links that offer good quality-of-service and range capability in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments constitutes a significant research and engineering challenge. Ignoring fading in NLOS environments, we can, in principle, meet the 1 Gb/s data rate requirement with a single-transmit single-receive antenna wireless system if the product of bandwidth (measured in hertz) and spectral efficiency (measured in bits per second per hertz) is equal to 10/sup 9/. A variety of cost, technology and regulatory constraints make such a brute force solution unattractive, if not impossible. The use of multiple antennas at transmitter and receiver, popularly known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless, is an emerging cost-effective technology that offers substantial leverages in making 1 Gb/s wireless links a reality.

In this paper, we examine the basic building block of cooperative diversity systems, a simple fading relay channel where the source, destination, and relay terminals are each equipped with single antenna transceivers. We consider three different time-division multiple-access-based cooperative protocols that vary the degree of broadcasting and receive collision. The relay terminal operates in either the amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) modes. For each protocol, we study the ergodic and outage capacity behavior (assuming Gaussian code books) under the AF and DF modes of relaying. We analyze the spatial diversity performance of the various protocols and find that full spatial diversity (second-order in this case) is achieved by certain protocols provided that appropriate power control is employed. Our analysis unifies previous results reported in the literature and establishes the superiority (both from a capacity, as well as a diversity point-of-view) of a new protocol proposed in this paper. The second part of the paper is devoted to (distributed) space-time code design for fading relay channels operating in the AF mode. We show that the corresponding code design criteria consist of the traditional rank and determinant criteria for the case of colocated antennas, as well as appropriate power control rules. Consequently space-time codes designed for the case of colocated multiantenna channels can be used to realize cooperative diversity provided that appropriate power control is employed.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.830922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1321222","","Fading;Relays;Signal design;Protocols;Power control;Space time codes;Transmitting antennas;Antenna arrays;Diversity methods;Transceivers","","1491","13","36","IEEE","9 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Performance analysis is important since segmentation algorithms often have limited accuracy and precision. Interactive drawing of the desired segmentation by human raters has often been the only acceptable approach, and yet suffers from intra-rater and inter-rater variability. Automated algorithms have been sought in order to remove the variability introduced by raters, but such algorithms must be assessed to ensure they are suitable for the task. The performance of raters (human or algorithmic) generating segmentations of medical images has been difficult to quantify because of the difficulty of obtaining or estimating a known true segmentation for clinical data. Although physical and digital phantoms can be constructed for which ground truth is known or readily estimated, such phantoms do not fully reflect clinical images due to the difficulty of constructing phantoms which reproduce the full range of imaging characteristics and normal and pathological anatomical variability observed in clinical data. Comparison to a collection of segmentations by raters is an attractive alternative since it can be carried out directly on the relevant clinical imaging data. However, the most appropriate measure or set of measures with which to compare such segmentations has not been clarified and several measures are used in practice. We present here an expectation-maximization algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE). The algorithm considers a collection of segmentations and computes a probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation and a measure of the performance level represented by each segmentation. The source of each segmentation in the collection may be an appropriately trained human rater or raters, or may be an automated segmentation algorithm. The probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation is formed by estimating an optimal combination of the segmentations, weighting each segmentation depending upon the estimated performance level, and incorporating a prior model for the spatial distribution of structures being segmented as well as spatial homogeneity constraints. STAPLE is straightforward to apply to clinical imaging data, it readily enables assessment of the performance of an automated image segmentation algorithm, and enables direct comparison of human rater and algorithm performance.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.828354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1309714","","Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Humans;Radiology;Hospitals;Imaging phantoms;Performance analysis;Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Pathology","Algorithms;Brain;Decision Making, Computer-Assisted;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Infant, Newborn;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Markov Chains;Models, Statistical;Observer Variation;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","1491","19","62","IEEE","6 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining.

It covers different approaches to exploiting the benefits of multihop communications via relays, such as solutions for radio range extension in mobile and wireless broadband cellular networks (trading range for capacity), and solutions to combat shadowing at high radio frequencies. Furthermore, relaying is presented as a means to reduce infrastructure deployment costs. It is also shown that through the exploitation of spatial diversity, multihop relaying can enhance capacity in cellular networks.

We first consider multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems based on Alamouti diversity schemes, which have good spectral efficiency but also more circuitry that consumes energy. We then extend our energy-efficiency analysis of MIMO systems to individual single-antenna nodes that cooperate to form multiple-antenna transmitters or receivers. By transmitting and/or receiving information jointly, we show that tremendous energy saving is possible for transmission distances larger than a given threshold, even when we take into account the local energy cost necessary for joint information transmission and reception.

PeerTrust model has two main features. First, we introduce three basic trust parameters and two adaptive factors in computing trustworthiness of peers, namely, feedback a peer receives from other peers, the total number of transactions a peer performs, the credibility of the feedback sources, transaction context factor, and the community context factor. Second, we define a general trust metric to combine these parameters. Other contributions of the paper include strategies used for implementing the trust model in a decentralized P2P environment, evaluation mechanisms to validate the effectiveness and cost of PeerTrust model, and a set of experiments that show the feasibility and benefit of our approach.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.1318566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318566","","Peer to peer computing;Feedback;Communities;Costs;Electronic commerce;Consumer electronics;Computer Society;Data security;Information security;Computer applications","","1263","14","36","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, small image patches in the lowand high-resolution images form manifolds with similar local geometry in two distinct feature spaces. As in LLE, local geometry is characterized by how a feature vector corresponding to a patch can be reconstructed by its neighbors in the feature space. Besides using the training image pairs to estimate the high-resolution embedding, we also enforce local compatibility and smoothness constraints between patches in the target high-resolution image through overlapping.

Data was obtained from the 44 nonpacemaker recordings of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The data was split into two datasets with each dataset containing approximately 50 000 beats from 22 recordings. The first dataset was used to select a classifier configuration from candidate configurations. Twelve configurations processing feature sets derived from two ECG leads were compared. Feature sets were based on ECG morphology, heartbeat intervals, and RR-intervals. All configurations adopted a statistical classifier model utilizing supervised learning. The second dataset was used to provide an independent performance assessment of the selected configuration. This assessment resulted in a sensitivity of 75.9%, a positive predictivity of 38.5%, and a false positive rate of 4.7% for the SVEB class. For the VEB class, the sensitivity was 77.7%, the positive predictivity was 81.9%, and the false positive rate was 1.2%.

In this paper, we adapt SBL to the signal processing problem of basis selection from overcomplete dictionaries, proving several results about the SBL cost function that elucidate its general behavior and provide solid theoretical justification for this application. Specifically, we have shown that SBL retains a desirable property of the /spl lscr//sub 0/-norm diversity measure (i.e., the global minimum is achieved at the maximally sparse solution) while often possessing a more limited constellation of local minima. We have also demonstrated that the local minima that do exist are achieved at sparse solutions. Later, we provide a novel interpretation of SBL that gives us valuable insight into why it is successful in producing sparse representations. Finally, we include simulation studies comparing sparse Bayesian learning with basis pursuit and the more recent FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (FOCUSS) class of basis selection algorithms.

The results demonstrate that there exist ideal binary time-frequency masks that can separate several speech signals from one mixture. While determining these masks blindly from just one mixture is an open problem, we show that we can approximate the ideal masks in the case where two anechoic mixtures are provided. Motivated by the maximum likelihood mixing parameter estimators, we define a power weighted two-dimensional (2-D) histogram constructed from the ratio of the time-frequency representations of the mixtures that is shown to have one peak for each source with peak location corresponding to the relative attenuation and delay mixing parameters.

In this paper we propose a new approach to retrieve aerosol properties over surfaces such as arid, semiarid, and urban areas, where the surface reflectance is usually very bright in the red part of visible spectrum and in the near infrared, but is much darker in the blue spectral region (i.e., wavelength <500 nm). In order to infer atmospheric properties from these data, a global surface reflectance database of 0.1/spl deg/ latitude by 0.1/spl deg/ longitude resolution was constructed over bright surfaces for visible wavelengths using the minimum reflectivity technique (e.g., finding the clearest scene during each season for a given location). The aerosol optical thickness and aerosol type are then determined simultaneously in the algorithm using lookup tables to match the satellite observed spectral radiances. Examples of aerosol optical thickness derived using this algorithm over the Sahara Desert and Arabian Peninsula reveal various dust sources, which are important contributors to airborne dust transported over long distances. Comparisons of the satellite inferred aerosol optical thickness and the values from ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun/sky radiometer measurements indicate good agreement (i.e., within 30%) over the sites in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. This new algorithm, when applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS), and Global Imager (GLI) satellite data, will provide high spatial resolution (/spl sim/1 km) global information of aerosol optical thickness over bright surfaces on a daily basis.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.824067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273587","","Aerosols;Optical surface waves;Sea surface;Optical sensors;Satellite broadcasting;Surface waves;Reflectivity;MODIS;Remote sensing;Land surface","","1047","","39","USGov","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate travel-time prediction also is crucial to the development of intelligent transportation systems and advanced traveler information systems. We apply support vector regression (SVR) for travel-time prediction and compare its results to other baseline travel-time prediction methods using real highway traffic data. Since support vector machines have greater generalization ability and guarantee global minima for given training data, it is believed that SVR will perform well for time series analysis. Compared to other baseline predictors, our results show that the SVR predictor can significantly reduce both relative mean errors and root-mean-squared errors of predicted travel times. We demonstrate the feasibility of applying SVR in travel-time prediction and prove that SVR is applicable and performs well for traffic data analysis.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2004.837813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1364002","Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs);support vector machines;support vector regression (SVR);time series analysis;travel-time prediction","Intelligent transportation systems;Time measurement;Machine intelligence;Information systems;Prediction methods;Road transportation;Support vector machines;Training data;Time series analysis;Performance analysis","","1042","2","31","IEEE","6 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a general approach is presented to identify the power transfer capability and bifurcation phenomena (multiple operating modes) for such systems. This is achieved using a high order mathematical model consisting of both primary and secondary resonant circuits. The primary compensation is deliberately designed to make the primary zero phase angle frequency equal the secondary resonant frequency to achieve maximum power with minimum VA rating of the supply. A contactless electric vehicle battery charger was used to validate the theory by comparing the measured and calculated operational frequency and power transfer. For bifurcation-free operation, the power transfer capability and controllability are assured by following the proposed bifurcation criteria. Where controllable operation within the bifurcation region is achievable, a significant increase in power is possible.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.822038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265794","","Bifurcation;Air gaps;Magnetic resonance;Coupling circuits;Mathematical model;RLC circuits;Resonant frequency;Electric vehicles;Batteries;Current measurement","","1030","2","10","IEEE","19 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two key reasons behind may be: 1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and 2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these traditional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses the input weights and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide the best generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed.

For wider bandwidth applications such as wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA) or wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (W-OFDM), PA memory effects can no longer be ignored, and memoryless predistortion has limited effectiveness. In this paper, instead of focusing on a particular PA model and building a corresponding predistorter, we focus directly on the predistorter structure.

Unlike beamforming, which presumes a high correlation between signals either transmitted or received by an array, the MIMO concept exploits the independence between signals at the array elements. In conventional radar, target scintillations are regarded as a nuisance parameter that degrades radar performance. The novelty of MIMO radar is that it takes the opposite view; namely, it capitalizes on target scintillations to improve the radar's performance. We introduce the MIMO concept for radar. The MIMO radar system under consideration consists of a transmit array with widely-spaced elements such that each views a different aspect of the target. The array at the receiver is a conventional array used for direction finding (DF). The system performance analysis is carried out in terms of the Cramer-Rao bound of the mean-square error in estimating the target direction. It is shown that MIMO radar leads to significant performance improvement in DF accuracy.","","0-7803-8234-X","10.1109/NRC.2004.1316398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1316398","","MIMO;Radar antennas;Sensor arrays;Transmitting antennas;Radar cross section;Array signal processing;Sonar;Maximum likelihood estimation;Spaceborne radar;Directive antennas","","979","12","14","IEEE","26 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information obtained by the monitoring nodes needs to be routed to a set of designated gateway nodes. In these networks, every node is capable of sensing, data processing, and communication, and operates on its limited amount of battery energy consumed mostly in transmission and reception at its radio transceiver. If we assume that the transmitter power level can be adjusted to use the minimum energy required to reach the intended next hop receiver then the energy consumption rate per unit information transmission depends on the choice of the next hop node, i.e., the routing decision. We formulate the routing problem as a linear programming problem, where the objective is to maximize the network lifetime, which is equivalent to the time until the network partition due to battery outage. Two different models are considered for the information-generation processes. One assumes constant rates and the other assumes an arbitrary process. A shortest cost path routing algorithm is proposed which uses link costs that reflect both the communication energy consumption rates and the residual energy levels at the two end nodes. The algorithm is amenable to distributed implementation. Simulation results with both information-generation process models show that the proposed algorithm can achieve network lifetime that is very close to the optimal network lifetime obtained by solving the linear programming problem.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2004.833122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331424","","Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Batteries;Energy consumption;Linear programming;Costs;Mobile ad hoc networks;Sensor systems;Data processing","","953","4","36","IEEE","3 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The total transmit power is limited and channel information (possibly statistical) is available at the transmitter. The design goal: jointly adjust the beamformers and transmission powers according to individual SINR requirements. In this context, there are two closely related optimization problems. P1: maximize the jointly achievable SINR margin under a total power constraint. P2: minimize the total transmission power while satisfying a set of SINR constraints. In this paper, both problems are solved within a unified analytical framework. Problem P1 is solved by minimizing the maximal eigenvalue of an extended crosstalk matrix. The solution provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the feasibility of the SINR requirements. Problem P2 is a variation of problem P1. An important step in our analysis is to show that the global optimum of the downlink beamforming problem is equivalently obtained from solving a dual uplink problem, which has an easier-to-handle analytical structure. Then, we make use of the special structure of the extended crosstalk matrix to develop a rapidly converging iterative algorithm.

Also, the potential payload size that can be embedded into a host image is discussed, and a feedback system for controlling this size is developed. In addition, to maximize the amount of data that can be hidden into an image, the embedding algorithm can be applied recursively across the color components.

This paper examines (and improves upon) the local image descriptor used by SIFT. Like SIFT, our descriptors encode the salient aspects of the image gradient in the feature point's neighborhood; however, instead of using SIFT's smoothed weighted histograms, we apply principal components analysis (PCA) to the normalized gradient patch. Our experiments demonstrate that the PCA-based local descriptors are more distinctive, more robust to image deformations, and more compact than the standard SIFT representation.

Its effectiveness contributes not only to the introduction of fuzziness for belongingness of each pixel but also to exploitation of spatial contextual information. Although the contextual information can raise its insensitivity to noise to some extent, FCM/spl I.bar/S still lacks enough robustness to noise and outliers and is not suitable for revealing non-Euclidean structure of the input data due to the use of Euclidean distance (L/sub 2/ norm). In this paper, to overcome the above problems, we first propose two variants, FCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 1/ and FCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 2/, of FCM/spl I.bar/S to aim at simplifying its computation and then extend them, including FCM/spl I.bar/S, to corresponding robust kernelized versions KFCM/spl I.bar/S, KFCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 1/ and KFCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 2/ by the kernel methods. Our main motives of using the kernel methods consist in: inducing a class of robust non-Euclidean distance measures for the original data space to derive new objective functions and thus clustering the non-Euclidean structures in data; enhancing robustness of the original clustering algorithms to noise and outliers, and still retaining computational simplicity. The experiments on the artificial and real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithms, especially with spatial constraints, are more effective.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2004.831165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315771","","Image segmentation;Clustering algorithms;Noise robustness;Kernel;Clustering methods;Magnetic resonance imaging;Euclidean distance;Extraterrestrial measurements;Pixel;Computer science","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Fuzzy Logic;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","895","1","33","IEEE","19 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to regularize solutions and keep the complexity of the algorithm bounded, we use a sequential sparsification process that admits into the kernel representation a new input sample only if its feature space image cannot be sufficiently well approximated by combining the images of previously admitted samples. This sparsification procedure allows the algorithm to operate online, often in real time.

We propose the concept of virtual control for microscopic dynamics throughout the process with different pinning schemes for both random networks and scale-free networks. We explain the main reason why significantly less local controllers are required by specifically pinning the most highly connected nodes in a scale-free network than those required by the randomly pinning scheme, and why there is no significant difference between specifically and randomly pinning schemes for controlling random dynamical networks.

It is based on a novel learning algorithm that recursively updates TS model structure and parameters by combining supervised and unsupervised learning. The rule-base and parameters of the TS model continually evolve by adding new rules with more summarization power and by modifying existing rules and parameters. In this way, the rule-base structure is inherited and up-dated when new data become available. By applying this learning concept to the TS model we arrive at a new type adaptive model called the Evolving Takagi-Sugeno model (ETS). The adaptive nature of these evolving TS models in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules makes them a promising candidate for online modeling and control of complex processes, competitive to neural networks. The approach has been tested on data from an air-conditioning installation serving a real building. The results illustrate the viability and efficiency of the approach.

Elucidating the patterns hidden in gene expression data offers a tremendous opportunity for an enhanced understanding of functional genomics. However, the large number of genes and the complexity of biological networks greatly increases the challenges of comprehending and interpreting the resulting mass of data, which often consists of millions of measurements. A first step toward addressing this challenge is the use of clustering techniques, which is essential in the data mining process to reveal natural structures and identify interesting patterns in the underlying data. Cluster analysis seeks to partition a given data set into groups based on specified features so that the data points within a group are more similar to each other than the points in different groups. A very rich literature on cluster analysis has developed over the past three decades. Many conventional clustering algorithms have been adapted or directly applied to gene expression data, and also new algorithms have recently been proposed specifically aiming at gene expression data. These clustering algorithms have been proven useful for identifying biologically relevant groups of genes and samples. In this paper, we first briefly introduce the concepts of microarray technology and discuss the basic elements of clustering on gene expression data. In particular, we divide cluster analysis for gene expression data into three categories. Then, we present specific challenges pertinent to each clustering category and introduce several representative approaches. We also discuss the problem of cluster validation in three aspects and review various methods to assess the quality and reliability of clustering results. Finally, we conclude this paper and suggest the promising trends in this field.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339264","Index Terms- Microarray technology;gene expression data;clustering.","Gene expression;Clustering algorithms;DNA;Monitoring;Biological processes;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Data mining;Data analysis;Partitioning algorithms","","837","4","77","IEEE","4 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed control technique, based on the droop control method, uses only locally measurable feedback signals. This method is usually applied to achieve good active and reactive power sharing when communication between the inverters is difficult due to its physical location. However, the conventional voltage and frequency droop methods of achieving load sharing have a slow and oscillating transient response. Moreover, there is no possibility to modify the transient response without the loss of power sharing precision or output-voltage and frequency accuracy. In this work, a great improvement in transient response is achieved by introducing power derivative-integral terms into a conventional droop scheme. Hence, better controllability of the system is obtained and, consequently, correct transient performance can be achieved. In addition, an instantaneous current control loop is also included in the novel controller to ensure correct sharing of harmonic components when supplying nonlinear loads. Simulation and experimental results are presented to prove the validity of this approach, which shows excellent performance as opposed to the conventional one.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.833451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331481","","Control systems;Inverters;Distributed control;Communication system control;Transient response;Frequency;Feedback;Reactive power;Voltage;Controllability","","832","1","21","IEEE","3 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional type-1 fuzzy logic controller (FLC) using precise type-1 fuzzy sets cannot fully handle such uncertainties. A type-2 FLC using type-2 fuzzy sets can handle such uncertainties to produce a better performance. In this paper, we present a novel reactive control architecture for autonomous mobile robots that is based on type-2 FLC to implement the basic navigation behaviors and the coordination between these behaviors to produce a type-2 hierarchical FLC. In our experiments, we implemented this type-2 architecture in different types of mobile robots navigating in indoor and outdoor unstructured and challenging environments.

The MIMO systems consist of interconnected subsystems, with couplings in the forms of unknown nonlinearities and/or parametric uncertainties in the input matrices, as well as in the system interconnections without any bounding restrictions. Using the block-triangular structure properties, the stability analyses of the closed-loop MIMO systems are shown in a nested iterative manner for all the states. By exploiting the special properties of the affine terms of the two classes of MIMO systems, the developed neural control schemes avoid the controller singularity problem completely without using projection algorithms. Semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) of all the signals in the closed-loop of MIMO nonlinear systems is achieved. The outputs of the systems are proven to converge to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectories. The control performance of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by suitably choosing the design parameters.

"Estimation of number of spectrally distinct signal sources in hyperspectral imagery","Chein-I Chang; Qian Du","Remote Sensing Signal and Image Processing Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Texas A and M University, Kingsville, TX, USA",IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"15 Mar 2004","2004","42","3","608","619","With very high spectral resolution, hyperspectral sensors can now uncover many unknown signal sources which cannot be identified by visual inspection or a priori. In order to account for such unknown signal sources, we introduce a new definition, referred to as virtual dimensionality (VD) in this paper. It is defined as the minimum number of spectrally distinct signal sources that characterize the hyperspectral data from the perspective view of target detection and classification. It is different from the commonly used intrinsic dimensionality (ID) in the sense that the signal sources are determined by the proposed VD based only on their distinct spectral properties. These signal sources may include unknown interfering sources, which cannot be identified by prior knowledge. With this new definition, three Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods are developed to determine the VD of hyperspectral imagery, where eigenvalues are used to measure signal energies in a detection model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, two information criteria, an information criterion (AIC) and minimum description length (MDL), and the factor analysis-based method proposed by Malinowski, are considered for comparative analysis. As demonstrated in computer simulations, all the methods and criteria studied in this paper may work effectively when noise is independent identically distributed. This is, unfortunately, not true when some of them are applied to real image data. Experiments show that all the three eigenthresholding based methods (i.e., the Harsanyi-Farrand-Chang (HFC), the noise-whitened HFC (NWHFC), and the noise subspace projection (NSP) methods) produce more reliable estimates of VD compared to the AIC, MDL, and Malinowski's empirical indicator function, which generally overestimate VD significantly. In summary, three contributions are made in this paper, 1) an introduction of the new definition of VD, 2) three Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods, HFC, NWHFC, and NSP derived for VD estimation, and 3) experiments that show the AIC and MDL commonly used in passive array processing and the second-order statistic-based Malinowski's method are not effective measures in VD estimation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.819189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273593","","Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Hybrid fiber coaxial cables;Signal processing;Information analysis;Performance analysis;Signal resolution;Inspection;Object detection;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","778","","27","IEEE","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A Bayes decision rule is derived for background and foreground classification based on the statistics of principal features. Principal feature representation for both the static and dynamic background pixels is investigated. A novel learning method is proposed to adapt to both gradual and sudden ""once-off"" background changes. The convergence of the learning process is analyzed and a formula to select a proper learning rate is derived. Under the proposed framework, a novel algorithm for detecting foreground objects from complex environments is then established. It consists of change detection, change classification, foreground segmentation, and background maintenance. Experiments were conducted on image sequences containing targets of interest in a variety of environments, e.g., offices, public buildings, subway stations, campuses, parking lots, airports, and sidewalks.

The proposed technique is implemented by using two different sets of data generated at low (multilook data) and full (single-look data) spatial resolution, respectively. The former is used to identify and estimate, via the conventional SBAS technique, large spatial scale deformation patterns, topographic errors in the available digital elevation model, and possible atmospheric phase artifacts; the latter allows us to detect, on the full-resolution residual phase components, structures highly coherent over time (buildings, rocks, lava, structures, etc.), as well as their height and displacements.

However, it is also a difficult problem since the mining may have to generate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences. Most of the previously developed sequential pattern mining methods, such as GSP, explore a candidate generation-and-test approach [R. Agrawal et al. (1994)] to reduce the number of candidates to be examined. However, this approach may not be efficient in mining large sequence databases having numerous patterns and/or long patterns. In this paper, we propose a projection-based, sequential pattern-growth approach for efficient mining of sequential patterns. In this approach, a sequence database is recursively projected into a set of smaller projected databases, and sequential patterns are grown in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent fragments. Based on an initial study of the pattern growth-based sequential pattern mining, FreeSpan [J. Han et al. (2000)], we propose a more efficient method, called PSP, which offers ordered growth and reduced projected databases. To further improve the performance, a pseudoprojection technique is developed in PrefixSpan. A comprehensive performance study shows that PrefixSpan, in most cases, outperforms the a priori-based algorithm GSP, FreeSpan, and SPADE [M. Zaki, (2001)] (a sequential pattern mining algorithm that adopts vertical data format), and PrefixSpan integrated with pseudoprojection is the fastest among all the tested algorithms. Furthermore, this mining methodology can be extended to mining sequential patterns with user-specified constraints. The high promise of the pattern-growth approach may lead to its further extension toward efficient mining of other kinds of frequent patterns, such as frequent substructures.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339268","Index Terms- Data mining algorithm;sequential pattern;frequent pattern;transaction database;sequence database;scalability;performance analysis.","Data mining;Sequences;Transaction databases;Pattern analysis;Association rules;Computer Society;Time factors;Application software;Explosives;Sequential analysis","","757","10","31","IEEE","4 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A constraint on their application in remote sensing has been their binary nature, requiring multiclass classifications to be based upon a large number of binary analyses. Here, an approach for multiclass classification of airborne sensor data by a single SVM analysis is evaluated against a series of classifiers that are widely used in remote sensing, with particular regard to the effect of training set size on classification accuracy. In addition to the SVM, the same datasets were classified using a discriminant analysis, decision tree, and multilayer perceptron neural network. The accuracy statements of the classifications derived from the different classifiers were compared in a statistically rigorous fashion that accommodated for the related nature of the samples used in the analyses. For each classification technique, accuracy was positively related with the size of the training set. In general, the most accurate classifications were derived from the SVM approach, and with the largest training set the SVM classification was significantly (p < 0.05)more accurate (93.75%) than that derived from the discriminant analysis (90.00%) and decision tree algorithms (90.31%). Although each classifier could yield a very accurate classification, > 90% correct, the classifiers differed in the ability to correctly label individual cases and so may be suitable candidates for an ensemble-based approach to classification.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.827257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304900","","Image classification;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Classification tree analysis;Remote sensing;Decision trees;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Multi-layer neural network;Algorithm design and analysis","","753","","45","IEEE","14 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A hybrid of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization for recurrent network design","Chia-Feng Juang","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan","IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","22 Mar 2004","2004","34","2","997","1006","An evolutionary recurrent network which automates the design of recurrent neural/fuzzy networks using a new evolutionary learning algorithm is proposed in this paper. This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), and is thus called HGAPSO. In HGAPSO, individuals in a new generation are created, not only by crossover and mutation operation as in GA, but also by PSO. The concept of elite strategy is adopted in HGAPSO, where the upper-half of the best-performing individuals in a population are regarded as elites. However, instead of being reproduced directly to the next generation, these elites are first enhanced. The group constituted by the elites is regarded as a swarm, and each elite corresponds to a particle within it. In this regard, the elites are enhanced by PSO, an operation which mimics the maturing phenomenon in nature. These enhanced elites constitute half of the population in the new generation, whereas the other half is generated by performing crossover and mutation operation on these enhanced elites. HGAPSO is applied to recurrent neural/fuzzy network design as follows.

This offers the advantages of a ""converter-per-panel"" approach without the cost or efficiency penalties of individual dc-ac grid connected inverters. Buck, boost, buck-boost, and Cu/spl acute/k converters are considered as possible dc-dc converters that can be cascaded. Matlab simulations are used to compare the efficiency of each topology as well as evaluating the benefits of increasing cost and complexity. The buck and then boost converters are shown to be the most efficient topologies for a given cost, with the buck best suited for long strings and the boost for short strings. While flexible in voltage ranges, buck-boost, and Cu/spl acute/k converters are always at an efficiency or alternatively cost disadvantage.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.830090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310401","","Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Inverters;Topology;Costs;Power electronics;Fuel cells;Batteries;Low voltage;Power systems","","746","274","13","IEEE","12 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a particle swarm optimizer is implemented and compared to a genetic algorithm for phased array synthesis of a far-field sidelobe notch, using amplitude-only, phase-only, and complex tapering. The results show that some optimization scenarios are better suited to one method versus the other (i.e., particle swarm optimization performs better in some cases while genetic algorithms perform better in others), which implies that the two methods traverse the problem hyperspace differently. The particle swarm optimizer shares the ability of the genetic algorithm to handle arbitrary nonlinear cost functions, but with a much simpler implementation it clearly demonstrates good possibilities for widespread use in electromagnetic optimization.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2004.825102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288473","","Phased arrays;Particle swarm optimization;Genetic algorithms;Optimization methods;Flowcharts;Genetic mutations;Evolutionary computation;Stochastic processes;Electromagnetics;Cost function","","731","6","54","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerical results reveal that retransmissions at the data link layer relieve stringent error control requirements at the physical layer, and thereby enable considerable spectral efficiency gain. This gain is comparable with that offered by diversity, provided that the maximum number of transmissions per packet equals the diversity order.

The functions of inverters in distributed power generation (DG) systems include dc-ac conversion, output power quality assurance, various protection mechanisms, and system controls. Unique requirements for small distributed power generation systems include low cost, high efficiency and tolerance for an extremely wide range of input voltage variations. These requirements have driven the inverter development toward simpler topologies and structures, lower component counts, and tighter modular design. Both single-stage and multiple-stage inverters have been developed for power conversion in DG systems. Single-stage inverters offer simple structure and low cost, but suffer from a limited range of input voltage variations and are often characterized by compromised system performance. On the other hand, multiple-stage inverters accept a wide range of input voltage variations, but suffer from high cost, complicated structure and low efficiency. Various circuit topologies are presented, compared, and evaluated against the requirements of power decoupling and dual-grounding, the capabilities for grid-connected or/and stand-alone operations, and specific DG applications in this paper, along with the identification of recent development trends of single-phase inverters for distributed power generators.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.833460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331492","","Topology;Inverters;Distributed power generation;Power generation;Costs;Voltage;Quality assurance;Power system protection;Control systems;Power conversion","","703","32","24","IEEE","3 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We describe the Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB), a publicly available database of polygonal models collected from the World Wide Web and a suite of tools for comparing shape matching and classification algorithms. One feature of the benchmark is that it provides multiple semantic labels for each 3D model. For instance, it includes one classification of the 3D models based on function, another that considers function and form, and others based on how the object was constructed (e.g., man-made versus natural objects). We find that experiments with these classifications can expose different properties of shape-based retrieval algorithms. For example, out of 12 shape descriptors tested, extended Gaussian images by B. Horn (1984) performed best for distinguishing man-made from natural objects, while they performed among the worst for distinguishing specific object types. Based on experiments with several different shape descriptors, we conclude that no single descriptor is best for all classifications, and thus the main contribution of this paper is to provide a framework to determine the conditions under which each descriptor performs best.","","0-7695-2075-8","10.1109/SMI.2004.1314504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1314504","","Shape;Benchmark testing;Spatial databases;Performance evaluation;Web sites;Information retrieval;Software tools;Computer science;Classification algorithms;Biological system modeling","","692","2","40","IEEE","4 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, the study of multi-user MIMO systems has emerged recently as an important research topic. Such systems have the potential to combine the high capacity achievable with MIMO processing with the benefits of space-division multiple access. In this article we review several algorithms that have been proposed with this goal in mind. We describe two classes of solutions.

One is the creation of a highly effective antenna diversity system; the other is the use of the multiple antennas for the transmission of several parallel data streams to increase the capacity of the system. This article presented an overview of MIMO systems with antenna selection. The transmitter, the receiver, or both use only the signals from a subset of the available antennas. This allows considerable reductions in the hardware expense.","1557-9581","","10.1109/MMW.2004.1284943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284943","","MIMO;Diversity reception;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Transmitters;Dipole antennas;Radio frequency;Computer simulation;Cellular networks;Multiaccess communication","","678","117","66","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The desire to place engine control units on the engine and transmission control units either on or in the transmission will push the ambient temperature above 125/spl deg/C. However, extreme cost pressures, increasing reliability demands (10 year/241 350 km) and the cost of field failures (recalls, liability, customer loyalty) will make the shift to higher temperatures occur incrementally. The coolest spots on engine and in the transmission will be used. These large bodies do provide considerable heat sinking to reduce temperature rise due to power dissipation in the control unit. The majority of near term applications will be at 150/spl deg/C or less and these will be worst case temperatures, not nominal. The transition to X-by-wire technology, replacing mechanical and hydraulic systems with electromechanical systems will require more power electronics. Integration of power transistors and smart power devices into the electromechanical actuator will require power devices to operate at 175/spl deg/C to 200/spl deg/C. Hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles will also drive the demand for higher temperature power electronics. In the case of hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles, the high temperature will be due to power dissipation. The alternates to high-temperature devices are thermal management systems which add weight and cost. Finally, the number of sensors in vehicles is increasing as more electrically controlled systems are added. Many of these sensors must work in high-temperature environments. The harshest applications are exhaust gas sensors and cylinder pressure or combustion sensors. High-temperature electronics use in automotive systems will continue to grow, but it will be gradual as cost and reliability issues are addressed. This work examines the motivation for higher temperature operation, the packaging limitations even at 125/spl deg/C with newer package styles and concludes with a review of challenges at both the semiconductor device and packaging level as temperatures push beyond 125/spl deg/C.","1558-0822","","10.1109/TEPM.2004.843109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1393072","Automotive;extreme-environment electronics","Automotive engineering;Costs;Engines;Temperature control;Temperature sensors;Semiconductor device packaging;Power dissipation;Power electronics;Fuel cell vehicles;Gas detectors","","674","1","39","IEEE","14 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The methodology developed is valid for those problem that are characterized by hard constraints on the state-battery state-of-charge (SOC) in this application-and by an arc cost-fuel consumption rate-which is not an explicit function of the state. A suboptimal control is found with a proper definition of a cost function to be minimized at each time instant. The ""instantaneous"" cost function includes the fuel energy and the electrical energy, the latter related to the state constraints. In order to weight the two forms of energy, a new definition of the equivalence factors has been derived. The strategy has been applied to the ""Hyper"" prototype of DaimlerChrysler, obtained from the hybridization of the Mercedes A-Class.

It then proposes a specific fixed gain relay that benefits from the knowledge of the first hop's average fading power and compares its performance with previously proposed relay gains that in contrast require knowledge of the instantaneous channel state information of the first hop. Finally, the letter investigates the effect of the relay saturation on the performance of the systems under consideration.

The data were measured and modeled in three parts: 1) capsule stiffness, a nonlinear spring model; 2) friction, a modified Karnopp model; and 3) cutting, a constant for a given tissue. In addition, we characterized the effects of needle diameter and tip type on insertion force using a silicone rubber phantom. In comparison to triangular and diamond tips, a bevel tip causes more needle bending and is more easily affected by tissue density variations.

To address this limitation, the concept of cooperation diversity has been introduced, where mobiles achieve uplink transmit diversity by relaying each other's messages. A particularly powerful variation of this principle is coded cooperation. Instead of a simple repetition relay, coded cooperation partitions the codewords of each mobile and transmits portions of each codeword through independent fading channels. This paper presents two extensions to the coded cooperation framework. First, we increase the diversity of coded cooperation in the fast-fading scenario via ideas borrowed from space-time codes. We calculate bounds for the bit- and block-error rates to demonstrate the resulting gains. Second, since cooperative coding contains two code components, it is natural to apply turbo codes to this framework. We investigate the application of turbo codes in coded cooperation and demonstrate the resulting gains via error bounds and simulations.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261324","","Wireless communication;Iterative decoding;Relays;Space time codes;Mobile antennas;Transmitting antennas;Fading;Turbo codes;Transmitters;System performance","","647","17","29","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic idea is that local sharp variation points, denoting the appearing or vanishing of an important image structure, are utilized to represent the characteristics of the iris. The whole procedure of feature extraction includes two steps: 1) a set of one-dimensional intensity signals is constructed to effectively characterize the most important information of the original two-dimensional image; 2) using a particular class of wavelets, a position sequence of local sharp variation points in such signals is recorded as features. We also present a fast matching scheme based on exclusive OR operation to compute the similarity between a pair of position sequences.

Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second.","1063-6919","0-7695-2158-4","10.1109/CVPR.2004.1315150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315150","","Learning systems;Object recognition;Testing;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Azimuth;Animals;Humans;Airplanes;Gray-scale","","613","28","26","IEEE","19 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Implanted antennas inside a human body: simulations, designs, and characterizations","Jaehoon Kim; Y.

To make practical use of antennas inside a human body, resonance characteristics of the implanted antennas and their radiation signature outside the body must be evaluated through numerical analysis and measurement setup. Most importantly, the antenna must be designed with an in-depth consideration given to its surrounding environment. In this paper, the spherical dyadic Green's function (DGF) expansions and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) code are applied to analyze the electromagnetic characteristics of dipole antennas and low-profile patch antennas implanted in the human head and body. All studies to characterize and design the implanted antennas are performed at the biomedical frequency band of 402-405 MHz. By comparing the results from two numerical methodologies, the accuracy of the spherical DGF application for a dipole antenna at the center of the head is evaluated. We also consider how much impact a shoulder has on the performance of the dipole inside the head using FDTD. For the ease of the design of implanted low-profile antennas, simplified planar geometries based on a real human body are proposed. Two types of low-profile antennas, i.e., a spiral microstrip antenna and a planar inverted-F antenna, with superstrate dielectric layers are initially designed for medical devices implanted in the chest of the human body using FDTD simulations. The radiation performances of the designed low-profile antennas are estimated in terms of radiation patterns, radiation efficiency, and specific absorption rate. Maximum available power calculated to characterize the performance of a communication link between the designed antennas and an exterior antenna show how sensitive receivers are required to build a reliable telemetry link.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.832018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318789","","Humans;Biological system modeling;Dipole antennas;Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Microstrip antennas;Head;Receiving antennas;Hyperthermia;Biomedical telemetry","","609","16","18","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues, and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem.

This allows for designing wide-band impedance-matching amplifiers with NF well below 3 dB, without suffering from instability issues. An amplifier realized in 0.25-/spl mu/m standard CMOS shows NF values below 2.4 dB over more than one decade of bandwidth (i.e., 150-2000 MHz) and below 2 dB over more than two octaves (i.e., 250-1100 MHz).

Current authentication systems based on physiological and behavioral characteristics of persons (known as biometrics), such as fingerprints, inherently provide solutions to many of these problems and may replace the authentication component of traditional cryptosystems. We present various methods that monolithically bind a cryptographic key with the biometric template of a user stored in the database in such a way that the key cannot be revealed without a successful biometric authentication. We assess the performance of one of these biometric key binding/generation algorithms using the fingerprint biometric. We illustrate the challenges involved in biometric key generation primarily due to drastic acquisition variations in the representation of a biometric identifier and the imperfect nature of biometric feature extraction and matching algorithms.

Regions are selected based on a nonlinear integration of low-level visual cues, mimicking processing in primate occipital, and posterior parietal cortex. A dynamic foveation filter then blurs every frame, increasingly with distance from salient locations. Sixty-three variants of the algorithm (varying number and shape of virtual foveas, maximum blur, and saliency competition) are evaluated against an outdoor video scene, using MPEG-1 and constant-quality MPEG-4 (DivX) encoding. Additional compression radios of 1.1 to 8.5 are achieved by foveation. Two variants of the algorithm are validated against eye fixations recorded from four to six human observers on a heterogeneous collection of 50 video clips (over 45 000 frames in total). Significantly higher overlap than expected by chance is found between human and algorithmic foveations. With both variants, foveated clips are, on average, approximately half the size of unfoveated clips, for both MPEG-1 and MPEG-4.

We first demonstrate how minimum mean-square error (MMSE) scaling along with dithering (lattice randomization) techniques can transform the power-constrained AWGN channel into a modulo-lattice additive noise channel, whose effective noise is reduced by a factor of /spl radic/(1+SNR/SNR). For the resulting channel, a uniform input maximizes mutual information, which in the limit of large lattice dimension becomes 1/2 log (1+SNR), i.e., the full capacity of the original power constrained AWGN channel. We then show that capacity may also be achieved using nested lattice codes, the coarse lattice serving for shaping via the modulo-lattice transformation, the fine lattice for channel coding. We show that such pairs exist for any desired nesting ratio, i.e., for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, for the modulo-lattice additive noise channel lattice decoding is optimal.

Since the number of minimal siphons grows in general exponentially with respect to a Petri net size, their disadvantages lie in that they often add too many additional places to the net, thereby making the resulting net model much more complex than the original one. This paper explores ways to minimize the new additions of places while achieving the same control purpose. It proposes for the first time the concept of elementary siphons that are a special class of siphons. The set of elementary siphons in a Petri net is generally a proper subset of the set of all SMS. Its smaller cardinality becomes evident in large Petri net models. This paper proves that by adding a control place for each elementary siphon to make sure that it is marked, deadlock can be successfully prevented. Compared with the existing methods, the new method requires a much smaller number of control places and, therefore, is suitable for large-scale Petri nets. An FMS example is used to illustrate the proposed concepts and policy, and show the significant advantage over the previous methods.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2003.820576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259433","","Petri nets;System recovery;Flexible manufacturing systems;Control systems;Workstations;Large-scale systems;Computer aided manufacturing;Materials handling;Fixtures;Job production systems","","578","1","28","IEEE","14 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper sets out an analytical basis for their design and comparison, verified against full time-domain simulations. Most reported microgenerators are classified as either velocity-damped resonant generators (VDRGs) or Coulomb-damped resonant generators (CDRGs) and a unified analytical structure is provided for these generator types. Reported generators are shown to have operated at well below achievable power densities and design guides are given for optimising future devices. The paper also describes a new class-the Coulomb-force parametric generator (CFPG)-which does not operate in a resonant manner. For all three generators, expressions and graphs are provided showing the dependence of output power on key operating parameters. The optimization also considers physical generator constraints such as voltage limitation or maximum or minimum damping ratios. The sensitivity of each generator architecture to the source vibration frequency is analyzed and this shows that the CFPG can be better suited than the resonant generators to applications where the source frequency is likely to vary. It is demonstrated that mechanical resonance is particularly useful when the vibration source amplitude is small compared to the allowable mass-to-frame displacement. The CDRG and the VDRG generate the same power at resonance but give better performance below and above resonance respectively. Both resonant generator types are unable to operate when the allowable mass frame displacement is small compared to the vibration source amplitude, as is likely to be the case in some MEMS applications. The CFPG is, therefore, required for such applications.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2004.830151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303621","","Resonance;Vibrations;Power generation;Micromechanical devices;Frequency;Computer architecture;Ubiquitous computing;Time domain analysis;Computational modeling;Analytical models","","574","18","28","IEEE","7 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most general version of our results can be used to treat NCS with data packet dropouts. The model of NCS and, in particular, of the scheduling protocol that we use appears to be novel and we believe that it will be useful in further study of these systems.

During controlled plantar flexion, a biomimetic torsional spring control is applied where orthotic joint stiffness is actively adjusted to minimize forefoot collisions with the ground. Throughout late stance, joint impedance is minimized so as not to impede powered plantar flexion movements, and during the swing phase, a torsional spring-damper control lifts the foot to provide toe clearance. To assess the clinical effects of variable-impedance control, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on two drop-foot participants wearing the AAFO. For each participant, zero, constant, and variable impedance control strategies were evaluated and the results were compared to the mechanics of three age, weight, and height matched normals. We find that actively adjusting joint impedance reduces the occurrence of slap foot allows greater powered plantar flexion and provides for less kinematic difference during swing when compared to normals. These results indicate that a variable-impedance orthosis may have certain clinical benefits for the treatment of drop-foot gait compared to conventional ankle-foot orthoses having zero or constant stiffness joint behaviors.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2003.823266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273519","","Adaptive control;Foot;Orthotics;Impedance;Kinematics;Muscles;Rehabilitation robotics;Medical treatment;Prosthetics;Knee","Aged;Ankle;Elasticity;Electric Impedance;Equipment Failure Analysis;Feedback;Female;Foot;Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Orthotic Devices;Prosthesis Design;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Treatment Outcome","570","80","49","IEEE","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has now been slightly more than 25 years since the 1978 seminal paper of Bennett and Ross, which summarized UWB's early applications. It thus seems appropriate, given the tremendous increase in interest in the technology since the Federal Communications Commission modified its Part 15 rules to accommodate UWB transmissions, to take a look at more recent system applications of this unique technology. This paper provides a brief historical perspective of UWB, discusses recent techniques for the generation and reception of short-pulse electromagnetic waveforms, and examines a number of recently developed UWB systems in the communications, radar, and precision-positioning fields.

The sum capacity is achieved using a precoding strategy for Gaussian channels with additive side information noncausally known at the transmitter. The optimal precoding structure is shown to correspond to a decision-feedback equalizer that decomposes the broadcast channel into a series of single-user channels with interference pre-subtracted at the transmitter.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.833336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327794","","Broadcasting;Transmitters;Mutual information;Gaussian noise;Decision feedback equalizers;Decoding;Covariance matrix;Gaussian channels;Interference;Minimax techniques","","569","43","36","IEEE","30 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Phase-noise reduction due to range correlation was experimentally evaluated, and the measured residual phase noise was within 5 dB of predicted values on average.

The main idea is to measure the distance between two shapes as the minimum extent of deformation necessary for one shape to match the other. Since the space of deformations is very high-dimensional, three steps are taken to make the search practical: 1) define an equivalence class for shapes based on shock-graph topology, 2) define an equivalence class for deformation paths based on shock-graph transitions, and 3) avoid complexity-increasing deformation paths by moving toward shock-graph degeneracy. Despite these steps, which tremendously reduce the search requirement, there still remain numerous deformation paths to consider. To that end, we employ an edit-distance algorithm for shock graphs that finds the optimal deformation path in polynomial time. The proposed approach gives intuitive correspondences for a variety of shapes and is robust in the presence of a wide range of visual transformations. The recognition rates on two distinct databases of 99 and 216 shapes each indicate highly successful within category matches (100 percent in top three matches), which render the framework potentially usable in a range of shape-based recognition applications.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.1273924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273924","","Electric shock;Shape measurement;Topology;Polynomials;Robustness;Visual databases;Rendering (computer graphics);Application software;Object recognition;Dynamic programming","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","561","3","54","IEEE","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EXIT functions are defined using the model, and several properties of such functions are proved for erasure channels. One property expresses the area under an EXIT function in terms of a conditional entropy. A useful consequence of this result is that the design of capacity-approaching codes reduces to a curve-fitting problem for all the aforementioned codes. A second property relates the EXIT function of a code to its Helleseth-Klove-Levenshtein information functions, and thereby to the support weights of its subcodes. The relation is via a refinement of information functions called split information functions, and via a refinement of support weights called split support weights. Split information functions are used to prove a third property that relates the EXIT function of a linear code to the EXIT function of its dual.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.836693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347354","","Transfer functions;Iterative decoding;Parity check codes;Mutual information;Concatenated codes;Convergence;Entropy;Curve fitting;Statistics","","557","5","60","IEEE","25 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the exact image formulation for the fields of elementary sources above impedance surfaces, it is shown that a purely reactive impedance plane with a specific surface reactance can minimize the interaction between the elementary source and its image in the RIS substrate. An RIS can be tuned anywhere between perfectly electric and magnetic conductor (PEC and PMC) surfaces offering a property to achieve the optimal bandwidth and miniaturization factor. It is demonstrated that RIS can provide performance superior to PMC when used as substrate for antennas. The RIS substrate is designed utilizing two-dimensional periodic printed metallic patches on a metal-backed high dielectric material. A simplified circuit model describing the physical phenomenon of the periodic surface is developed for simple analysis and design of the RIS substrate. Also a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) full-wave analysis in conjunction with periodic boundary conditions and perfectly matched layer walls is applied to provide comprehensive study and analysis of complex antennas on such substrates. Examples of different planar antennas including dipole and patch antennas on RIS are considered, and their characteristics are compared with those obtained from the same antennas over PEC and PMC. The simulations compare very well with measured results obtained from a prototype /spl lambda//10 miniaturized patch antenna fabricated on an RIS substrate. This antenna shows measured relative bandwidth, gain, and radiation efficiency of BW=6.7, G=4.5 dBi, and e/sub r/=90, respectively, which constitutes the highest bandwidth, gain, and efficiency for such a small size thin planar antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2004.834135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331627","","Bandwidth;Surface impedance;Planar arrays;Dielectric substrates;Dipole antennas;Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Patch antennas;Antenna measurements;Conducting materials","","549","10","17","IEEE","3 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The pursuit framework is particularly simple in that the n identical vehicles are ordered such that vehicle i pursues vehicle i+1 modulo n. In this paper, we assume each vehicle has the same constant forward speed. We show that the system's equilibrium formations are generalized regular polygons and it is exposed how the multivehicle system's global behavior can be shaped through appropriate controller gain assignments.

Two classifications are discussed: decoded relaying versus amplified relaying, and multihop channels versus multihop diversity channels. The channel models are compared, through analysis and simulations, with the ""singlehop"" (direct transmission) reference channel on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio, probability of outage, probability of error, and optimal power allocation. Each of the four channel models is shown to outperform the singlehop reference channel under the condition that the set of intermediate relaying terminals is selected intelligently. Multihop diversity channels are shown to outperform multihop channels. Amplified relaying is shown to outperform decoded relaying despite noise propagation. This is attributed to the fact that amplified relaying does not suffer from the error propagation which limits the performance of decoded relaying channels to that of their weakest link.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2004.836447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1350931","Ad-hoc networks;cooperative diversity;diversity techniques;mesh networks;multihop channels;multihop diversity;wireless relaying","Relays;Decoding;Protocols;Wireless communication;Spread spectrum communication;Cellular networks;Mobile communication;Physical layer;Signal analysis;Analytical models","","539","6","32","IEEE","1 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Protection scheme for distribution system, primarily consisting of fuses and reclosers and, in some cases, relays, has traditionally been designed assuming the system to be radial. After connecting distributed generation (DG), part of the system may no longer be radial, which means the coordination might not hold. The effect of DG on coordination will depend on size, type, and placement of DG. This paper explores the effect of high DG penetration on protective device coordination and suggests an adaptive protection scheme as a solution to the problems identified.

We present an improvement to the watershed transform that enables the introduction of prior information in its calculation. We propose to introduce this information via the use of a previous probability calculation. Furthermore, we introduce a method to combine the watershed transform and atlas registration, through the use of markers.

A standard technique for computing such descriptions is principal component analysis. However, principal component analysis is limited in that it only works for data lying in a Euclidean vector space. While this is certainly sufficient for geometric models that are parameterized by a set of landmarks or a dense collection of boundary points, it does not handle more complex representations of shape. We have been developing representations of geometry based on the medial axis description or m-rep. While the medial representation provides a rich language for variability in terms of bending, twisting, and widening, the medial parameters are not elements of a Euclidean vector space. They are in fact elements of a nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. In this paper, we develop the method of principal geodesic analysis, a generalization of principal component analysis to the manifold setting. We demonstrate its use in describing the variability of medially-defined anatomical objects.

Some recent studies on the choice of local search method employed have shown that this choice significantly affects the efficiency of problem searches. Given the restricted theoretical knowledge available in this area and the limited progress made on mitigating the effects of incorrect local search method choice, we present strategies for MA control that decide, at runtime, which local method is chosen to locally improve the next chromosome. The use of multiple local methods during a MA search in the spirit of Lamarckian learning is here termed Meta-Lamarckian learning. Two adaptive strategies for Meta-Lamarckian learning are proposed in this paper. Experimental studies with Meta-Lamarckian learning strategies on continuous parametric benchmark problems are also presented. Further, the best strategy proposed is applied to a real-world aerodynamic wing design problem and encouraging results are obtained. It is shown that the proposed approaches aid designers working on complex engineering problems by reducing the probability of employing inappropriate local search methods in a MA, while at the same time, yielding robust and improved design search performance.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2003.819944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288050","","Search methods;Design engineering;Genetics;Runtime;Biological cells;Aerodynamics;Robustness;Design optimization;Convergence;Collaborative work","","531","2","37","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Any deviation from this PRF will result in a nonuniform sampling of the synthetic aperture. This letter derives an innovative reconstruction algorithm and shows that an unambiguous reconstruction of a SAR signal is possible for nonuniform sampling of the synthetic aperture. This algorithm will also have great potential for multistatic satellite constellations as well as the dual receive antenna mode in Radarsat 2 and TerraSAR-X.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2004.832700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1347118","","Signal reconstruction;Sampling methods;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar antennas;Nonuniform sampling;Azimuth;Signal resolution;Frequency;Spaceborne radar;Reconstruction algorithms","","524","9","15","IEEE","25 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This spectral allocation has initiated an extremely productive activity for industry and academia. Wireless communications experts now consider UWB as available spectrum to be utilized with a variety of techniques, and not specifically related to the generation and detection of short RF pulses as in the past. There are many differences between real-world behavior of narrow-band and UWB systems. All wireless systems must be able to deal with the challenges of operating over a multipath propagation channel, where objects in the environment can cause multiple reflections to arrive at the receiver (RX). For narrow-band systems, these reflections will not be resolvable by the RX when the narrow-band system bandwidth is less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. The large bandwidth of UWB waveforms, instead, significantly increases the ability of the RX to resolve the different reflections in the channel. The UWB channel model developed by the IEEE 802.15.3a standard body is described in this paper. For highly dispersive channels, an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) RX is more efficient at capturing multipath energy than an equivalent single-carrier system using the same total bandwidth. OFDM systems possess additional desirable properties, such as high spectral efficiency, inherent resilience to narrow-band RF interference, and spectral flexibility, which is important because the regulatory rules for UWB devices have not been finalized throughout the entire world. This paper describes the design of a UWB system optimized for very high bit-rate, low-cost, and low-power wireless networks for personal computing (PC), consumer electronics (CE), and mobile applications. The system combines OFDM modulation technique with a multibanding approach, which divides the spectrum into several sub-bands, whose bandwidth is approximately 500 MHz. The system described in this paper has been selected by several key industry organizations [Mulitband OFDM Alliance, WiMedia, Wireless Universal Serial Bus (USB)] because of its very good technical characteristics for the diverse set of high performance short-range applications that are eagerly anticipated for CE, PC, and mobile applications.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.834184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327872","","OFDM;Bandwidth;Narrowband;Reflection;Universal Serial Bus;FCC;Ultra wideband technology;Wireless communication;Pulse generation;Radio frequency","","524","14","17","IEEE","30 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Realizing the great promise of sensor networks requires more than a mere advance in individual technologies. It relies on many components working together in an efficient, unattended, comprehensible, and trustworthy manner. One of the enabling technologies in sensor networks is the distributed source coding (DSC), which refers to the compression of the multiple correlated sensor outputs that does not communicate with each other. DSC allows a many-to-one video coding paradigm that effectively swaps encoder-decoder complexity with respect to conventional video coding, thereby representing a fundamental concept shift in video processing. This article has presented an intensive discussion on two DSC techniques, namely Slepian-Wolf coding and Wyner-Ziv coding. The Slepian and Wolf coding have theoretically shown that separate encoding is as efficient as joint coding for lossless compression in channel coding.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2004.1328091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1328091","","Channel coding;Source coding;Wireless sensor networks;Video compression;Decoding;Video coding;Chemical and biological sensors;Biosensors;Temperature sensors;Vibration measurement","","515","18","50","IEEE","30 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A probabilistic model is developed to model human fatigue and to predict fatigue based on the visual cues obtained. The simultaneous use of multiple visual cues and their systematic combination yields a much more robust and accurate fatigue characterization than using a single visual cue.

Tracking needs modeling interframe motion and appearance changes, whereas recognition needs modeling appearance changes between frames and gallery images. In conventional tracking algorithms, the appearance model is either fixed or rapidly changing, and the motion model is simply a random walk with fixed noise variance. Also, the number of particles is typically fixed. All these factors make the visual tracker unstable. To stabilize the tracker, we propose the following modifications: an observation model arising from an adaptive appearance model, an adaptive velocity motion model with adaptive noise variance, and an adaptive number of particles. The adaptive-velocity model is derived using a first-order linear predictor based on the appearance difference between the incoming observation and the previous particle configuration. Occlusion analysis is implemented using robust statistics. Experimental results on tracking visual objects in long outdoor and indoor video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our tracking algorithm. We then perform simultaneous tracking and recognition by embedding them in a particle filter. For recognition purposes, we model the appearance changes between frames and gallery images by constructing the intra- and extrapersonal spaces. Accurate recognition is achieved when confronted by pose and view variations.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.836152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344039","","Particle tracking;Particle filters;Laboratories;State estimation;Noise robustness;Image recognition;Filtering;Kinematics;Training data;Predictive models","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Feedback;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Male;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Motion;Movement;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","511","4","37","IEEE","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since in a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem, the resulting Pareto-optimal set is expected to change with time (or, iteration of the optimization process), a suite of five test problems offering different patterns of such changes and different difficulties in tracking the dynamic Pareto-optimal front by a multiobjective optimization algorithm is presented. Moreover, a simple example of a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem arising from a dynamic control loop is presented. An extension to a previously proposed direction-based search method is proposed for solving such problems and tested on the proposed test problems.

Clustering sensor nodes is an effective technique for achieving these goals. In this work, we propose a new energy-efficient approach for clustering nodes in ad-hoc sensor networks. Based on this approach, we present a protocol, HEED (hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of their residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED does not make any assumptions about the distribution or density of nodes, or about node capabilities, e.g., location-awareness. The clustering process terminates in O(1) iterations, and does not depend on the network topology or size. The protocol incurs low overhead in terms of processing cycles and messages exchanged. It also achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. A careful selection of the secondary clustering parameter can balance load among cluster heads. Our simulation results demonstrate that HEED outperforms weight-based clustering protocols in terms of several cluster characteristics. We also apply our approach to a simple application to demonstrate its effectiveness in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting data aggregation.","0743-166X","0-7803-8355-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354534","","Intelligent networks;Energy efficiency;Chemical sensors;Energy consumption;Network topology;Media Access Protocol;Routing protocols;Computer networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Batteries","","506","14","39","IEEE","22 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Later, ten Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) implantation participated in gait measurements using our device. They walked one to three times on a 20-m walkway. Patients did the test twice: once STN-DBS was ON and once 180 min after turning it OFF. A group of ten age-matched normal subjects were also measured as controls. For each gait cycle, spatio-temporal parameters such as stride length (SL), stride velocity (SV), stance (ST), double support (DS), and gait cycle time (GC) were calculated. We found that PD patients had significantly different gait parameters comparing to controls. They had 52% less SV, 60% less SL, and 40% longer GC. Also they had significantly longer ST and DS (11% and 59% more, respectively) than controls. STN-DBS significantly improved gait parameters. During the stim ON period, PD patients had 31% faster SV, 26% longer SL, 6% shorter ST, and 26% shorter DS. GC, however, was not significantly different. Some of the gait parameters had high correlation with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) subscores including SL with a significant correlation (r=-0.90) with UPDRS gait subscore.

In this study, a novel approach to prepare magnetic polymeric nanoparticles with magnetic core and polymeric shell using inverse microemulsion polymerization process is reported. Poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG)-modified superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with specific shape and size have been prepared inside the aqueous cores of AOT/n-Hexane reverse micelles and characterized by various physicochemical means such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. The inverse microemulsion polymerization of a polymerizable derivative of PEG and a cross-linking agent resulted in a stable hydrophilic polymeric shell of the nanoparticles. The results taken together from TEM and AFM studies showed that the particles are spherical in shape with core-shell structure.

One possibility is to use multiple antennas at base stations and terminals to get very high spectral efficiencies in rich scattering environments. Such multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) channels can then be used in conjunction with scheduling and rate-feedback algorithms to further increase channel throughput. This paper provides an analysis of the expected gains due to scheduling and bits needed for rate feedback. Our analysis requires an accurate approximation of the distribution of the MIMO channel mutual information. Because the exact distribution of the mutual information in a Rayleigh-fading environment is difficult to analyze, we prove a central limit theorem for MIMO channels with a large number of antennas. While the growth in average mutual information (capacity) of a MIMO channel with the number of antennas is well understood, it turns out that the variance of the mutual information can grow very slowly or even shrink as the number of antennas grows. We discuss implications of this ""channel-hardening"" result for data and voice services, scheduling, and rate feedback. We also briefly discuss the implications when shadow fading effects are included.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.833345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327795","","Feedback;MIMO;Mutual information;Information analysis;Base stations;Rayleigh scattering;Scheduling algorithm;Throughput;Rayleigh channels;Antenna theory","","501","26","20","IEEE","30 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed LPR technique consists of two main modules: a license plate locating module and a license number identification module. The former characterized by fuzzy disciplines attempts to extract license plates from an input image, while the latter conceptualized in terms of neural subjects aims to identify the number present in a license plate. Experiments have been conducted for the respective modules. In the experiment on locating license plates, 1088 images taken from various scenes and under different conditions were employed. Of which, 23 images have been failed to locate the license plates present in the images; the license plate location rate of success is 97.9%.

In order to search for the optimal switching instants, the derivatives of the optimal cost with respect to the switching instants need to be known. The most important contribution of the paper is a method which first transcribes an optimal control problem into an equivalent problem parameterized by the switching instants and then obtains the values of the derivatives based on the solution of a two point boundary value differential algebraic equation formed by the state, costate, stationarity equations, the boundary and continuity conditions, along with their differentiations. This method is applied to general switched linear quadratic problems and an efficient method based on the solution of an initial value ordinary differential equation is developed. An extension of the method is also applied to problems with internally forced switching.

BCI technology could therefore provide a new communication and control option for individuals who cannot otherwise express their wishes to the outside world.

We made these data sets (i.e., labeled training sets and unlabeled test sets) and their descriptions available on the Internet.

This approach involves two steps. First, to find spectrally unique signatures of pure ground components, usually known as endmembers, and, second, to express mixed pixels as linear combinations of endmember materials. Over the past years, several algorithms have been developed for autonomous and supervised endmember extraction from hyperspectral data. Due to a lack of commonly accepted data and quantitative approaches to substantiate new algorithms, available methods have not been rigorously compared by using a unified scheme. In this paper, we present a comparative study of standard endmember extraction algorithms using a custom-designed quantitative and comparative framework that involves both the spectral and spatial information. The algorithms considered in this study represent substantially different design choices. A database formed by simulated and real hyperspectral data collected by the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) is used to investigate the impact of noise, mixture complexity, and use of radiance/reflectance data on algorithm performance. The results obtained indicate that endmember selection and subsequent mixed-pixel interpretation by a linear mixture model are more successful when methods combining spatial and spectral information are applied.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.820314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273597","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Hyperspectral imaging;Image databases;Spatial databases;Infrared imaging;Infrared spectra;Spectroscopy;Reflectivity;Diversity reception","","483","14","30","IEEE","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While there exist many algorithms for clustering, the important issue of feature selection, that is, what attributes of the data should be used by the clustering algorithms, is rarely touched upon. Feature selection for clustering is difficult because, unlike in supervised learning, there are no class labels for the data and, thus, no obvious criteria to guide the search. Another important problem in clustering is the determination of the number of clusters, which clearly impacts and is influenced by the feature selection issue. In this paper, we propose the concept of feature saliency and introduce an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate it, in the context of mixture-based clustering. Due to the introduction of a minimum message length model selection criterion, the saliency of irrelevant features is driven toward zero, which corresponds to performing feature selection. The criterion and algorithm are then extended to simultaneously estimate the feature saliencies and the number of clusters.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1316850","Index Terms- Feature selection;clustering;unsupervised learning;mixture models;minimum message length;EM algorithm.","Clustering algorithms;Unsupervised learning;Supervised learning;Partitioning algorithms;Image segmentation;Degradation;Data analysis;Computer vision;Information retrieval","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","481","2","63","IEEE","26 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The correlation is primarily caused by mutual coupling between the elements of the antenna arrays on both the receiving and transmitting sides. Similarly, diversity antennas can be characterized by a diversity gain that also is affected by mutual coupling between the antennas. We explain how such MIMO and diversity antennas with mutual coupling can be analyzed by classical embedded element patterns that can be computed by standard computer codes. In the MIMO example under investigation, the mutual coupling reduces both correlation, which increases the capacity, and radiation efficiency, which decreases it, and the combined effect is a net capacity reduction. We also explain how the radiation efficiency, diversity gain, correlation, and channel capacity can be measured in a reverberation chamber. The measurements show good agreement with simulations.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2004.1367562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1367562","","MIMO;Mutual coupling;Diversity methods;Antenna measurements;Gain measurement;Reverberation chamber;Embedded computing;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Antenna arrays","","475","8","11","IEEE","20 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Yet, the paper proposes a new calibration technique using 1D objects (points aligned on a line), thus filling the missing dimension in calibration. In particular, we show that camera calibration is not possible with free-moving 1D objects, but can be solved if one point is fixed. A closed-form solution is developed if six or more observations of such a 1D object are made. For higher accuracy, a nonlinear technique based on the maximum likelihood criterion is then used to refine the estimate. Singularities have also been studied. Besides the theoretical aspect, the proposed technique is also important in practice especially when calibrating multiple cameras mounted apart from each other, where the calibration objects are required to be visible simultaneously.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300559","Camera calibration;calibration taxonomy;calibration apparatus;1D objects;singularity;degenerate configuration.","Cameras;Calibration;Layout;Computer vision;Maximum likelihood estimation;Filling;Closed-form solution;Taxonomy;Data mining;Geometry","Algorithms;Calibration;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Photography;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;United States","473","13","25","IEEE","24 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To study these questions, we formulate a model of wireless networks that particularly takes into account the distances between nodes, and the resulting attenuation of radio signals, and study a performance measure that weights information by the distance over which it is transported. Consider a network with the following features. I) n nodes located on a plane, with minimum separation distance /spl rho//sub min/>0. II) A simplistic model of signal attenuation e/sup -/spl gamma//spl rho////spl rho//sup /spl delta// over a distance /spl rho/, where /spl gamma//spl ges/0 is the absorption constant (usually positive, unless over a vacuum), and /spl delta/>0 is the path loss exponent. III) All receptions subject to additive Gaussian noise of variance /spl sigma//sup 2/. The performance measure we mainly, but not exclusively, study is the transport capacity C/sub T/:=sup/spl Sigma/on/sub /spl lscr/=1//sup m/R/sub /spl lscr///spl middot//spl rho//sub /spl lscr//, where the supremum is taken over m, and vectors (R/sub 1/,R/sub 2/,...,R/sub m/) of feasible rates for m source-destination pairs, and /spl rho//sub /spl lscr// is the distance between the /spl lscr/th source and its destination. It is the supremum distance-weighted sum of rates that the wireless network can deliver. We show that there is a dichotomy between the cases of relatively high and relatively low attenuation. When /spl gamma/>0 or /spl delta/>3, the relatively high attenuation case, the transport capacity is bounded by a constant multiple of the sum of the transmit powers of the nodes in the network. However, when /spl gamma/=0 and /spl delta/<3/2, the low-attenuation case, we show that there exist networks that can provide unbounded transport capacity for fixed total power, yielding zero energy priced communication. Examples show that nodes can profitably cooperate over large distances using coherence and multiuser estimation when the attenuation is low. These results are established by developing a coding scheme and an achievable rate for Gaussian multiple-relay channels, a result that may be of interest in its own right.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.826631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291725","","Information theory;Wireless communication;Wireless networks;Conferences;Attenuation measurement;Weight measurement;Particle measurements;Absorption;Additive noise;Gaussian noise","","473","2","27","IEEE","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the presence of a fault, a nominal controller guarantees the boundedness of all the system signals until the fault is detected. Then the controller is reconfigured after fault detection and also after fault isolation, to improve the control performance by using the fault information generated by the diagnosis module.

It considers both the dynamic part and the output part of T-S fuzzy model which guarantees that the controller without any delay information can stabilize time-delay T-S fuzzy systems. Based on delay-dependent Lyapunov functional approach, some sufficient conditions for the existence of state feedback controller are provided via parallel distributed compensation (PDC) first. Second, the corresponding conditions are extended into the generalized dynamic output feedback closed-loop system via so-called generalized PDC technique. The upper bound of time-delay can be obtained using convex optimization such that the system can be stabilized for all time-delays whose sizes are not larger than the bound.

The kernel P(I)DE is then converted into an equivalent integral equation and by applying the method of successive approximations, the equation's well posedness and the kernel's smoothness are established. It is shown how to extend this approach to design optimally stabilizing controllers. An adaptation mechanism is developed to reduce the conservativeness of the inverse optimal controller, and the performance bounds are derived.

The salient feature of the EPLL-based synchronization method over conventional synchronization methods is its frequency adaptivity which permits satisfactory operation when the centre frequency of the base signal varies. The proposed EPLL-based method of synchronization is also capable of coping with the unbalanced system scenarios. Structural simplicity of the EPLL-based method greatly simplifies its implementation in digital software and/or hardware environments as an integral part of a digital control platform for power electronic converters.

The operation of these filters is described with respect to the design and system limitations. The operating constraints are then superimposed. The development of this approach shows that there are design limitations and large system changes or modifications can result in higher distortion or even damage to filters in extreme cases.

Recent experimental studies have shown that real deployments have a ""transitional region"" with highly unreliable links, and that therefore the idealized perfect-reception-within-range models used in common network simulation tools can be very misleading. In this paper, we use mathematical techniques from communication theory to model and analyze the low power wireless links. The primary contribution of this work is the identification of the causes of the transitional region, and a quantification of their influence. Specifically, we derive expressions for the packet reception rate as a function of distance, and for the width of the transitional region. These expressions incorporate important channel and radio parameters such as the path loss exponent and shadowing variance of the channel; and the modulation and encoding of the radio. A key finding is that for radios using narrow-band modulation, the transitional region is not an artifact of the radio non-ideality, as it would exist even with perfect-threshold receivers because of multi-path fading. However, we hypothesize that radios with mechanisms to combat multi-path effects, such as spread-spectrum and diversity techniques, can reduce the transitional region.","","0-7803-8796-1","10.1109/SAHCN.2004.1381954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381954","","Wireless sensor networks;Wireless application protocol;Routing;Intelligent networks;Power system modeling;Mathematical model;Shadow mapping;Narrowband;Receivers;Fading","","460","1","14","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Very simple and insightful sets of noise parameter expressions are newly introduced for the SNIM and PCSNIM techniques. Based on the noise parameter equations, this paper provides clear understanding of the design principles, fundamental limitations, and advantages of the four reported LNA design techniques so that the designers can get the overall LNA design perspective.

The proposed system uses a ""fuse-then-decompose"" technique realized through a novel, fusion/decomposition system architecture. In particular, information fusion is performed on a multiresolution gradient map representation domain of image signal information. At each resolution, input images are represented as gradient maps and combined to produce new, fused gradient maps. Fused gradient map signals are processed, using gradient filters derived from high-pass quadrature mirror filters to yield a fused multiresolution pyramid representation. The fused output image is obtained by applying, on the fused pyramid, a reconstruction process that is analogous to that of conventional discrete wavelet transform. This new gradient fusion significantly reduces the amount of distortion artefacts and the loss of contrast information usually observed in fused images obtained from conventional multiresolution fusion schemes. This is because fusion in the gradient map domain significantly improves the reliability of the feature selection and information fusion processes. Fusion performance is evaluated through informal visual inspection and subjective psychometric preference tests, as well as objective fusion performance measurements. Results clearly demonstrate the superiority of this new approach when compared to conventional fusion systems.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.823821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1278337","","Image resolution;Image fusion;Signal resolution;Filters;Discrete wavelet transforms;Distortion;Signal processing;Mirrors;Image reconstruction;Inspection","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","455","3","24","IEEE","30 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the main advantages of this communication technique is that it distributes the use of power throughout the hops. This implies longer battery life and lower interference introduced to the rest of the network. In this context, this paper investigates the optimal allocation of power over these links/hops for a given power budget. All hops are assumed to be subject to independent Rayleigh fading. Outage probability which is the probability that the link quality from source to destination falls below a certain threshold is used as the optimization criterion. Numerical results show that optimizing the allocation of power enhances the system performance, especially if the links are highly unbalanced in terms of their average fading power or if the number of hops is large. Interestingly, they also show that nonregenerative systems with optimum power allocation can outperform regenerative systems with no power optimization.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.833447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374908","Collaborative/cooperative/multiuser diversity;outage probability;Rayleigh fading;transmission with relays","Relays;Rayleigh channels;Power system relaying;Batteries;Interference;Context;Base stations;System performance;Transmitters;Resource management","","454","1","22","IEEE","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effectiveness of the scheme was verified experimentally on a bearing test bed, using both supervised and unsupervised defect classification approaches. The objective of the study was to identify the severity level of bearing defects, where no a priori knowledge on the defect conditions was available. The proposed scheme has shown to provide more accurate defect classification with fewer feature inputs than using all features initially considered relevant.

Islanding operations of DG usually occur when power supply from the main utility is interrupted due to several reasons but the DG keeps supplying power into the distribution networks. These kinds of islanding conditions cause negative impacts on protection, operation, and management of distribution systems; therefore, it is necessary to effectively detect the islanding conditions and swiftly disconnect DG from distribution network. Generally, if there are large changes in loading for DG after loss of the main power supply, then islanding conditions are easily detected by monitoring several parameters: voltage magnitude, phase displacement, and frequency change. However, in case of small changes in loading for DG, the conventional methods have some difficulty in detecting such a particular islanding condition. This paper presents a new islanding detection algorithm for DG effectively working in the most of DG loading conditions. This paper proposes two new parameters for detecting islanding operation of DG: voltage unbalance and total harmonic distortion of current. The proposed method effectively combines the conventional parameters with the newly proposed parameters for detecting the islanding conditions. The proposed methods were verified using the radial distribution network of IEEE 34 bus.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2003.822964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1278435","","Distributed control;Voltage;Total harmonic distortion;Power supplies;Power system protection;Power system management;Phase detection;Phase frequency detector;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms","","448","9","11","IEEE","30 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, it poses a more challenging problem than stabilization. For over a decade, the nonlinear output regulation problem has been one of the focuses in nonlinear control research, and active research on this problem has generated many fruitful results. Nevertheless, there are two hurdles that impede the further progress of the research on the output regulation problem. The first one is the assumption that the solution or the partial solution of the regulator equations is polynomial. The second one is the lack of a systematic mechanism to handle the global robust output regulation problem. We establish a general framework that systematically converts the robust output regulation problem for a general nonlinear system into a robust stabilization problem for an appropriately augmented system. This general framework, on one hand, relaxes the polynomial assumption, and on the other hand, offers a greater flexibility to incorporate recent new stabilization techniques, thus setting a stage for systematically tackling the robust output regulation with global stability.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.839236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369396","Internal model principle;nonlinear systems;output regulation;robust control","Robustness;Nonlinear systems;Regulators;Nonlinear equations;Polynomials;Robust control;Automation;Asymptotic stability;Robust stability;Linear systems","","447","","38","IEEE","20 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the first method, referred to as the indirect approach, the high-dimensional image feature is transformed to a lower dimensional space by generating what we call the frame to exemplar (FED) distance. The FED vector captures both structural and dynamic traits of each individual. For compact and effective gait representation and recognition, the gait information in the FED vector sequences is captured in a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the second method, referred to as the direct approach, we work with the feature vector directly (as opposed to computing the FED) and train an HMM. We estimate the HMM parameters (specifically the observation probability B) based on the distance between the exemplars and the image features. In this way, we avoid learning high-dimensional probability density functions. The statistical nature of the HMM lends overall robustness to representation and recognition.

A single-path deterministic routing between the cores places high bandwidth demands on the links. The bandwidth requirements can be significantly reduced by splitting the traffic between the cores across multiple paths. In this paper, we present NMAP, a fast algorithm that maps the cores onto a mesh NoC architecture under bandwidth constraints, minimizing the average communication delay. The NMAP algorithm is presented for both single minimum-path routing and split-traffic routing. The algorithm is applied to a benchmark DSP design and the resulting NoC is built and simulated at cycle accurate level in SystemC using macros from the /spl times/pipes library.

This paper provides a short tutorial on how robots are currently used in urban search and rescue (USAR) and discusses the HRI issues encountered over the past eight years. A domain theory of the search activity is formulated. The domain theory consists of two parts: 1) a workflow model identifying the major tasks, actions, and roles in robot-assisted search (e.g., a workflow model) and 2) a general information flow model of how data from the robot is fused by various team members into information and knowledge. The information flow model also captures the types of situation awareness needed by each agent in the rescue robot system. The article presents a synopsis of the major HRI issues in reducing the number of humans it takes to control a robot, maintaining performance with geographically distributed teams with intermittent communications, and encouraging acceptance within the existing social structure.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2004.826267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291662","","Human robot interaction;Cognitive robotics;Robot sensing systems;Intelligent robots;Mobile robots;Teamwork;Robot control;Communication system control;Mobile communication;Human factors","","435","3","54","IEEE","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is nonintrusive as it does not require any modifications to the core logic such as the insertion of test points or logic bounding unknown states. The EDT scheme consists of logic embedded on a chip and a new deterministic test-pattern generation technique. The main contributions of the paper are test-stimuli compression schemes that allow us to deliver test data to the on-chip continuous-flow decompressor. In particular, it can be done by repeating certain patterns at the rates, which are adjusted to the requirements of the test cubes.

The optimal performance of the network can only be achieved by simultaneous optimization of routing and resource allocation. In this paper, we formulate the simultaneous routing and resource allocation (SRRA) problem, and exploit problem structure to derive efficient solution methods. We use a capacitated multicommodity flow model to describe the data flows in the network. We assume that the capacity of a wireless link is a concave and increasing function of the communications resources allocated to the link, and the communications resources for groups of links are limited. These assumptions allow us to formulate the SRRA problem as a convex optimization problem over the network flow variables and the communications variables. These two sets of variables are coupled only through the link capacity constraints. We exploit this separable structure by dual decomposition. The resulting solution method attains the optimal coordination of data routing in the network layer and resource allocation in the radio control layer via pricing on the link capacities.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2004.831346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315914","","Routing;Resource management;Radio control;Bandwidth;Optimization methods;Communication system control;Pricing;Communications Society;Contracts;Military computing","","428","5","53","IEEE","19 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In fuzzy set theory, an important class of triangular norms and conorms is the class of continuous Archimedean nilpotent triangular norms and conorms. It has been shown that for such t-norms T there exists a permutation /spl phi/ of [0,1] such that T is the /spl phi/-transform of the Lukasiewicz t-norm.

These materials, which are arranged in periodic configurations, are applied for the design of novel EM structures with applications in the VHF-UHF bands. The utility of these materials is demonstrated by considering two challenging problems, namely, design of miniaturized electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures and antennas in the VHF-UHF bands. A woodpile EBG made up of magneto-dielectric material is proposed. It is shown that the magneto-dielectric woodpile not only exhibits band-gap rejection values much higher than the ordinary dielectric woodpile, but also for the same physical dimensions it shows a rejection band at a much lower frequency. The higher rejection is a result of higher effective impedance contrasts between consecutive layers of the magneto-dielectric woodpile structure. Composite magneto-dielectrics are also shown to provide certain advantages when used as substrates for planar antennas. These substrates are used to miniaturize antennas while maintaining a relatively high bandwidth and efficiency. An artificial anisotropic meta-substrate having /spl mu//sub r/>/spl epsiv//sub r/, made up of layered magneto-dielectric and dielectric materials is designed to maximize the bandwidth of a miniaturized patch antenna. Analytical and numerical approaches, based on the anisotropic effective medium theory (AEMT) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique, are applied to carry out the analyzes and fully characterize the performance of finite and infinite periodic magneto-dielectric meta-materials integrated into the EBG and antenna designs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2004.829413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303873","","Electromagnetics;Magnetic anisotropy;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Periodic structures;Magnetic materials;Dielectric materials;Metamaterials;Dielectric substrates;Bandwidth;Anisotropic magnetoresistance","","425","5","20","IEEE","7 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is based on multidimensional scaling (MDS), an efficient data analysis technique that takes O(n/sup 3/) time for a network of n nodes. Unlike previous approaches, MDS takes full advantage of connectivity or distance information between nodes that have yet to be localized. Two methods are presented: a simple method that builds a global map using MDS and a more complicated one that builds small local maps and then patches them together to form a global map. Furthermore, least-squares optimization can be incorporated into the methods to further improve the solutions at the expense of additional computation. Through simulation studies on uniform as well as irregular networks, we show that the methods achieve more accurate solutions than previous methods, especially when there are few anchor nodes.

The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently, enhance the genetic algorithm. Therefore, the HTGA can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. The proposed HTGA is effectively applied to solve 15 benchmark problems of global optimization with 30 or 100 dimensions and very large numbers of local minima. The computational experiments show that the proposed HTGA not only can find optimal or close-to-optimal solutions but also can obtain both better and more robust results than the existing algorithm reported recently in the literature.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.826895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324697","","Robustness;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Optimization methods;Design optimization;Design engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Algorithm design and analysis;Parallel processing","","421","1","22","IEEE","24 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast, this paper develops neural-network-based models for predicting bearing failures. An experimental setup is developed to perform accelerated bearing tests where vibration information is collected from a number of bearings that are run until failure. This information is then used to train neural network models on predicting bearing operating times. Vibration data from a set of validation bearings are then applied to these network models. Resulting predictions are then used to estimate the bearing failure time. These predictions are then compared with the actual lives of the validation bearings and errors are computed to evaluate the effectiveness of each model. For the best model, we find that 64% of predictions are within 10% of actual bearing life, while 92% of predictions are within 20% of the actual life.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2004.824875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302346","","Degradation;Neural networks;Vibrations;Predictive models;Condition monitoring;Frequency;Performance evaluation;Life estimation;Testing;Fatigue","","420","3","23","IEEE","1 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, frequency-domain BSS involves a permutation problem: the permutation ambiguity of ICA in each frequency bin should be aligned so that a separated signal in the time-domain contains frequency components of the same source signal. This paper presents a robust and precise method for solving the permutation problem. It is based on two approaches: direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sources and the interfrequency correlation of signal envelopes. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches, and integrate them to exploit their respective advantages. Furthermore, by utilizing the harmonics of signals, we make the new method robust even for low frequencies where DOA estimation is inaccurate. We also present a new closed-form formula for estimating DOAs from a separation matrix obtained by ICA. Experimental results show that our method provided an almost perfect solution to the permutation problem for a case where two sources were mixed in a room whose reverberation time was 300 ms.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2004.832994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323089","","Robustness;Blind source separation;Independent component analysis;Source separation;Frequency domain analysis;Direction of arrival estimation;Time domain analysis;Finite impulse response filter;Frequency estimation;Discrete Fourier transforms","","420","21","33","IEEE","16 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They often, however, have moving components that allow physical or analytical functions to be performed by the device. Although MEMS can be aseptically fabricated and hermetically sealed, biocompatibility of the component materials is a key issue for MEMS used in vivo. Interest in MEMS for biological applications (BioMEMS) is growing rapidly, with opportunities in areas such as biosensors, pacemakers, immunoisolation capsules, and drug delivery. The key to many of these applications lies in the leveraging of features unique to MEMS (for example, analyte sensitivity, electrical responsiveness, temporal control, and feature sizes similar to cells and organelles) for maximum impact. In this paper, we focus on how the biological integration of MEMS and other implantable devices can be improved through the application of microfabrication technology and concepts. Innovative approaches for improved physical and chemical integration of systems with the body are reviewed. An untapped potential for MEMS may lie in the area of nervous and endocrine system actuation, whereby the ability of MEMS to deliver potent drugs or hormones, combined with their precise temporal control, may provide new treatments for disorders of these systems.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.820534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1258169","","Micromechanical devices;Integrated circuit technology;Microelectromechanical devices;Integrated circuit manufacture;Performance analysis;Hermetic seals;Biological materials;Sealing materials;In vivo;Biosensors","","417","78","164","IEEE","8 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MDS-MAP is a recent localization method based on multidimensional scaling (MDS). It uses connectivity information - who is within communications range of whom - to derive the locations of the nodes in the network, and can take advantage of additional data, such as estimated distances between neighbors or known positions for certain anchor nodes, if they are available. However, MDS-MAP is an inherently centralized algorithm and is therefore of limited utility in many applications. In this paper, we present a new variant of the MDS-MAP method, which we call MDS-MAP(P) standing for MDS-MAP using patches of relative maps, that can be executed in a distributed fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that the new algorithm not only preserves the good performance of the original method on relatively uniform layouts, but also performs much better than the original on irregularly-shaped networks. The main idea is to build a local map at each node of the immediate vicinity and then merge these maps together to form a global map. This approach works much better for topologies in which the shortest path distance between two nodes does not correspond well to their Euclidean distance. We also discuss an optional refinement step that improves solution quality even further at the expense of additional computation.","0743-166X","0-7803-8355-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354683","","Acoustic sensors;Temperature sensors;Global Positioning System;Multidimensional systems;Euclidean distance;Computer science;Communication networks;Network topology;Large-scale systems;Actuators","","409","9","16","IEEE","22 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They also result in leakage currents which act as sources of conducted electromagnetic interference in the drive system. The common mode voltage generated by a conventional three-level inverter can be eliminated by switching only the voltage space vectors which do not produce the common mode voltage. This paper presents a PWM switching strategy to eliminate common mode voltage using the open-end winding configuration for the induction motor. The switching strategy presented in this paper, does not generate any alternating common mode voltages in the drive system and hence the electrostatic coupling of the common mode voltage, which results in the bearing currents and the leakage currents, is avoided. The proposed scheme is devoid of neutral point voltage fluctuations and does not require neutral point clamping diodes, when compared to the common mode elimination scheme based on the conventional three-level inverter topology. Also, the present scheme uses a single dc-link with half the voltage compared to the conventional three-level inverter based scheme.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.826514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1296756","","Voltage;Induction motor drives;Pulse width modulation inverters;Induction generators;Induction motors;Leakage current;Pulse width modulation;Pulse inverters;Pulse generation;Electromagnetic interference","","408","2","11","IEEE","10 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the criterion of a vertical handoff protocol: a handoff protocol for users that move between different types of networks. Traditional operations for handoff detection policies, decision metrics, and radio link transfer are not able to adapt to dynamic handoff criteria or react to user inputs and changing network availabilities. Nor are they able to deliver context-aware services or ensure network interoperability. Thus, new techniques are needed to manage user mobility between different types of networks. This article presents a tutorial on the design and performance issues for vertical hand-off in an envisioned multinetwork fourth-generation environment. Various network architectures and technologies for 3G and beyond are described, including wireless LANs, cellular, satellite, and Mobile IP. Then the problem of vertical handoff is defined in the context of such a diverse network environment.

These challenges clearly make a case for building multifence security solutions that achieve both broad protection and desirable network performance. In this article we focus on the fundamental security problem of protecting the multihop network connectivity between mobile nodes in a MANET. We identify the security issues related to this problem, discuss the challenges to security design, and review the state-of-the-art security proposals that protect the MANET link- and network-layer operations of delivering packets over the multihop wireless channel. The complete security solution should span both layers, and encompass all three security components of prevention, detection, and reaction.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2004.1269716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269716","","Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Peer to peer computing;Communication system security;Data security;Spread spectrum communication;Routing protocols;Mobile communication;Wireless application protocol","","405","2","25","IEEE","16 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we improved the recently developed approach of Lambot et al. whose success relies on a stepped-frequency continuous-wave (SFCW) radar combined with an off-ground monostatic transverse electromagnetic horn antenna. This radar configuration enables realistic and efficient forward modeling. We included in the initial model: 1) the multiple reflections occurring between the antenna and the soil surface using a positive feedback loop in the antenna block diagram and 2) the frequency dependence of the electric properties using a local linear approximation of the Debye model. The model was validated in laboratory conditions on a tank filled with a two-layered sand subject to different water contents. Results showed remarkable agreement between the measured and modeled Green's functions. Model inversion for the dielectric permittivity further demonstrated the accuracy of the method. Inversion for the electric conductivity led to less satisfactory results. However, a sensitivity analysis demonstrated the good stability properties of the inverse solution and put forward the necessity to reduce the remaining clutter by a factor 10. This may partly be achieved through a better characterization of the antenna transfer functions and by performing measurements in an environment without close extraneous scatterers.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.834800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356068","Frequency domain;ground-penetrating radar (GPR);inverse modeling;linear systems;soil dielectric properties;soil water content","Ground penetrating radar;Radar antennas;Reflector antennas;Antenna feeds;Antenna measurements;Inverse problems;Horn antennas;Electromagnetic reflection;Soil;Feedback loop","","403","6","67","IEEE","15 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the case of a multiple-input multiple-output channel, feedback can be used to specify a precoding matrix at the transmitter, which activates the strongest channel modes. In situations where the feedback is severely limited, important issues are how to quantize the information needed at the transmitter and how much improvement in associated performance can be obtained as a function of the amount of feedback available. We give an overview of some recent work in this area. Methods are presented for constructing a set of possible precoding matrices, from which a particular choice can be relayed to the transmitter.

"Gabor-based kernel PCA with fractional power polynomial models for face recognition","Chengjun Liu","Department of Computer Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA",IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,"15 Mar 2004","2004","26","5","572","581","This paper presents a novel Gabor-based kernel principal component analysis (PCA) method by integrating the Gabor wavelet representation of face images and the kernel PCA method for face recognition. Gabor wavelets first derive desirable facial features characterized by spatial frequency, spatial locality, and orientation selectivity to cope with the variations due to illumination and facial expression changes. The kernel PCA method is then extended to include fractional power polynomial models for enhanced face recognition performance. A fractional power polynomial, however, does not necessarily define a kernel function, as it might not define a positive semidefinite Gram matrix. Note that the sigmoid kernels, one of the three classes of widely used kernel functions (polynomial kernels, Gaussian kernels, and sigmoid kernels), do not actually define a positive semidefinite Gram matrix either. Nevertheless, the sigmoid kernels have been successfully used in practice, such as in building support vector machines. In order to derive real kernel PCA features, we apply only those kernel PCA eigenvectors that are associated with positive eigenvalues. The feasibility of the Gabor-based kernel PCA method with fractional power polynomial models has been successfully tested on both frontal and pose-angled face recognition, using two data sets from the FERET database and the CMU PIE database, respectively. The FERET data set contains 600 frontal face images of 200 subjects, while the PIE data set consists of 680 images across five poses (left and right profiles, left and right half profiles, and frontal view) with two different facial expressions (neutral and smiling) of 68 subjects. The effectiveness of the Gabor-based kernel PCA method with fractional power polynomial models is shown in terms of both absolute performance indices and comparative performance against the PCA method, the kernel PCA method with polynomial kernels, the kernel PCA method with fractional power polynomial models, the Gabor wavelet-based PCA method, and the Gabor wavelet-based kernel PCA method with polynomial kernels.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.1273927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273927","","Kernel;Principal component analysis;Polynomials;Face recognition;Image databases;Spatial databases;Wavelet analysis;Facial features;Frequency;Lighting","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Principal Component Analysis;Principle-Based Ethics;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","403","1","51","IEEE","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, the new strategy called spectrum pooling is considered. It aims at enabling public access to these spectral ranges without sacrificing the transmission quality of the actual license owners. Unfortunately, using OFDM modulation in a spectrum pooling system has some drawbacks. There is an interaction between the licensed system and the OFDM based rental system due to the non-orthogonality of their respective transmit signals. This interaction is described mathematically, providing a quantitative evaluation of the mutual interference that leads to an SNR loss in both systems. However, this interference can be mitigated by windowing the OFDM signal in the time domain or by the adaptive deactivation of adjacent subcarriers providing flexible guard bands between licensed and rental system. It is obvious that both approaches sacrifice bandwidth of the rental system. A quantitative comparison of both approaches is given as a tradeoff between interference reduction and throughput in the rental system.","1550-2252","0-7803-8255-2","10.1109/VETECS.2004.1390598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1390598","","Interference;Bandwidth;Wireless LAN;Spectral shape;Land mobile radio;OFDM modulation;Throughput;Propagation losses;Airports;Technological innovation","","402","15","14","IEEE","14 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such cases, the classical symbol estimation schemes, e.g., minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) and zero-forcing (ZF) estimation, require matrix inversion that is prohibitively complex for large symbol lengths. An analysis of the ICI generation mechanism leads us to propose a novel two-stage equalizer whose complexity (apart from the FFT) is linear in the OFDM symbol length. The first stage applies optimal linear preprocessing to restrict ICI support, and the second stage uses iterative MMSE estimation to estimate finite-alphabet frequency-domain symbols. Simulation results indicate that our equalizer has significant performance and complexity advantages over the classical linear MMSE estimator in doubly selective channels.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.823503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275673","","OFDM;Interference;Fading;Frequency division multiplexing;Equalizers;Frequency estimation;Application software;Bandwidth;Frequency domain analysis;Dispersion","","400","22","36","IEEE","22 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Linear observability techniques were employed to demonstrate improvements in transient oxygen regulation when the FCS voltage is included as a measurement for the feedback controller. The FCS voltage signal contains high frequency information about the FC oxygen utilization, and thus, is a natural and valuable output for feedback. We used linear optimal control design to identify the frequencies at which there is a severe tradeoff between the transient system net power performance and the stack starvation control. The limitation arises when the FCS system architecture dictates that all auxiliary equipment is powered directly from the FC with no secondary power sources. This plant configuration is preferred due to its simplicity, compactness, and low cost. The FCS impedance given the closed-loop air flow and perfect humidification and temperature regulation captures the FC current-voltage dynamic relationship. It is expected that the closed-loop FCS impedance will provide the basis for the systematic design of FC stack electronic components.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2004.1275430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275430","","Fuel cells;Frequency;Optimal control;Impedance;Protection;Steady-state;Cathodes;Observability;Adaptive control;Voltage","","400","","41","IEEE","21 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A new interest measure, a participation index, is also proposed for spatial colocation patterns. The participation index is used as the measure of prevalence of a colocation for two reasons. First, this measure is closely related to the cross-K function, which is often used as a statistical measure of interaction among pairs of spatial features. Second, it also possesses an antimonotone property which can be exploited for computational efficiency. Furthermore, we design an algorithm to discover colocation patterns. This algorithm includes a novel multiresolution pruning technique. Finally, experimental results are provided to show the strength of the algorithm and design decisions related to performance tuning.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1350759","Index Terms- Colocation patterns;spatial association rules;participation index.","Data mining;Computer Society;Association rules;Environmental factors;Symbiosis;Particle measurements;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational efficiency;Spatial resolution;Shape","","391","17","20","IEEE","1 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed system automatically synthesizes simple problem-specific feature extractors from a training set of face and nonface patterns, without making any assumptions or using any hand-made design concerning the features to extract or the areas of the face pattern to analyze. The face detection procedure acts like a pipeline of simple convolution and subsampling modules that treat the raw input image as a whole. We therefore show that an efficient face detection system does not require any costly local preprocessing before classification of image areas. The proposed scheme provides very high detection rate with a particularly low level of false positives, demonstrated on difficult test sets, without requiring the use of multiple networks for handling difficult cases. We present extensive experimental results illustrating the efficiency of the proposed approach on difficult test sets and including an in-depth sensitivity analysis with respect to the degrees of variability of the face patterns.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.97","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335446","Index Terms- Face detection;neural networks;machine learning;convolutional networks.","Face detection;Robustness;Feature extraction;Testing;Convolutional codes;Pattern analysis;Pipelines;Convolution;Neural networks;Humans","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Handwriting;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reading;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","387","23","39","IEEE","20 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Routing based on a connected dominating set is a promising approach, where the search space for a route is reduced to the hosts in the set. A set is dominating if all the hosts in the system are either in the set or neighbors of hosts in the set. The efficiency of dominating-set-based routing mainly depends on the overhead introduced in the formation of the dominating set and the size of the dominating set. In this paper, we first review a localized formation of a connected dominating set called marking process and dominating-set-based routing. Then, we propose a dominant pruning rule to reduce the size of the dominating set. This dominant pruning rule (called Rule k) is a generalization of two existing rules (called Rule 1 and Rule 2, respectively). We prove that the vertex set derived by applying Rule k is still a connected dominating set. Rule k is more effective in reducing the dominating set derived from the marking process than the combination of Rules 1 and 2 and, surprisingly, in a restricted implementation with local neighborhood information, Rule k has the same communication complexity and less computation complexity. Simulation results confirm that Rule k outperforms Rules 1 and 2, especially in networks with relatively high vertex degree and high percentage of unidirectional links. We also prove that an upper bound exists on the average size of the dominating set derived from Rule k in its restricted implementation.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2004.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327595","Ad hoc wireless networks;dominant pruning;dominating sets;routing;probabilistic analysis;simulation.","Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Upper bound;Analytical models;Energy states;Maintenance","","382","","26","IEEE","30 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These novel techniques lead to a classifier which requires fewer weak classifiers than AdaBoost yet achieves lower error rates in both training and testing, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

The Kepler scientific workflow system provides domain scientists with an easy-to-use yet powerful system for capturing scientific workflows (SWFs). SWFs are a formalization of the ad-hoc process that a scientist may go through to get from raw data to publishable results. Kepler attempts to streamline the workflow creation and execution process so that scientists can design, execute, monitor, re-run, and communicate analytical procedures repeatedly with minimal effort. Kepler is unique in that it seamlessly combines high-level workflow design with execution and runtime interaction, access to local and remote data, and local and remote service invocation. SWFs are superficially similar to business process workflows but have several challenges not present in the business workflow scenario. For example, they often operate on large, complex and heterogeneous data, can be computationally intensive and produce complex derived data products that may be archived for use in reparameterized runs or other workflows. Moreover, unlike business workflows, SWFs are often dataflow-oriented as witnessed by a number of recent academic systems (e.g., DiscoveryNet, Taverna and Triana) and commercial systems (Scitegic/Pipeline-Pilot, Inforsense). In a sense, SWFs are often closer to signal-processing and data streaming applications than they are to control-oriented business workflow applications.","1099-3371","0-7695-2146-0","10.1109/SSDM.2004.1311241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311241","","Prototypes;Business;Web services;Runtime;Java;Plugs;Yarn;Supercomputers;Biological system modeling;Power system modeling","","379","7","10","IEEE","19 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Signal constellations for quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes with full diversity","Weifeng Su; X. -g.

However, the maximum symbol transmission rate of an STBC from complex orthogonal designs for complex signals is only 3/4 for three and four transmit antennas, and it is difficult to construct complex orthogonal designs with rate higher than 1/2 for more than four transmit antennas. Recently, Jafarkhani, Tirkkonen-Boariu-Hottinen, and Papadias-Foschini proposed STBCs from quasi-orthogonal designs, where the orthogonality is relaxed to provide higher symbol transmission rates. With the quasi-orthogonal structure, the quasi-orthogonal STBCs still have a fast ML decoding, but do not have the full diversity. The performance of these codes is better than that of the codes from orthogonal designs at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but worse at high SNR. This is due to the fact that the slope of the performance curve depends on the diversity. It is desired to have the quasi-orthogonal STBCs with full diversity to ensure good performance at high SNR. In this paper, we achieve this goal by properly choosing the signal constellations. Specifically, we propose that half of the symbols in a quasi-orthogonal design are chosen from a signal constellation set A and the other half of them are chosen from a rotated constellation e/sup j/spl phi// A. The resulting STBCs can guarantee both full diversity and fast ML decoding. Moreover, we obtain the optimum selections of the rotation angles /spl phi/ for some commonly used signal constellations. Simulation results show that the proposed codes outperform the codes from orthogonal designs at both low and high SNRs.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.834740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337107","","Constellation diagram;Block codes;Maximum likelihood decoding;Signal design;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless communication;Gallium nitride;Modulation coding","","379","8","44","IEEE","27 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The motivation for this study is twofold, limiting multiuser interference to increase single-hop throughput and reducing power consumption to prolong battery life. We focus on next neighbor transmissions where nodes are required to send information packets to their respective receivers subject to a constraint on the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The multiple access problem is solved via two alternating phases, namely scheduling and power control. The scheduling algorithm is essential to coordinate the transmissions of independent users in order to eliminate strong levels of interference (e.g., self-interference) that cannot be overcome by power control. On the other hand, power control is executed in a distributed fashion to determine the admissible power vector, if one exists, that can be used by the scheduled users to satisfy their single-hop transmission requirements. This is done for two types of networks, namely time-division multiple-access (TDMA) and TDMA/code-division multiple-access wireless ad hoc networks.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2003.819032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259401","","Power control;Mobile ad hoc networks;Time division multiple access;Cross layer design;Throughput;Energy consumption;Batteries;Interference constraints;Scheduling algorithm;Interference elimination","","374","7","37","IEEE","14 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A figure of merit indicates that an input dc level of 0.7 V/sub DD/ is optimal regarding speed and yield. Experimental results in 130-nm CMOS technology confirm that the yield can be significantly improved by lowering the input DC voltage to about 70% of the supply voltage.

We characterize the P2P traffic observed at a single ISP and its impact on the underlying network. We observe very skewed distribution in the traffic across the network at different levels of spatial aggregation (IP, prefix, AS). All three P2P systems exhibit significant dynamics at short time scale and particularly at the IP address level.

The proposed filter design methodology incorporates some recently appeared results, such as Moon's new version of the upper bound for the inner product of two vectors and de Oliveira's idea of parameter-dependent stability, which greatly reduce the overdesign introduced in the derivation process. In addition to the full-order filtering problem, the challenging reduced-order case is also addressed by using different linearization procedures. Both full- and reduced-order filters can be obtained from the solution of convex optimization problems in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved via efficient interior-point algorithms.

However, increased power densities (hence temperatures) and other scaling effects have an adverse impact on long-term processor lifetime reliability. This paper represents a first attempt at quantifying the impact of scaling on lifetime reliability due to intrinsic hard errors, taking workload characteristics into consideration. For our quantitative evaluation, we use RAMP (Srinivasan et al., 2004), a previously proposed industrial-strength model that provides reliability estimates for a workload, but for a given technology. We extend RAMP by adding scaling specific parameters to enable workload-dependent lifetime reliability evaluation at different technologies. We show that (1) scaling has a significant impact on processor hard failure rates - on average, with SPEC benchmarks, we find the failure rate of a scaled 65nm processor to be 316% higher than a similarly pipelined 180nm processor; (2) time-dependent dielectric breakdown and electromigration have the largest increases; and (3) with scaling, the difference in reliability from running at worst-case vs. typical workload operating conditions increases significantly, as does the difference from running different workloads. Our results imply that leveraging a single microarchitecture design for multiple remaps across a few technology generations will become increasingly difficult, and motivate a need for workload specific, microarchitectural lifetime reliability awareness at an early design stage.","","0-7695-2052-9","10.1109/DSN.2004.1311888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311888","","CMOS technology;Dynamic voltage scaling;Threshold voltage;CMOS process;Dielectric breakdown;Electromigration;Microarchitecture;Thermal stresses;Rivers;Computer science","","364","6","17","IEEE","26 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whereas Kalman filters are restricted to Gaussian distributions, particle filters can propagate more general distributions, albeit only approximately. This is of particular benefit in visual tracking because of the inherent ambiguity of the visual world that stems from its richness and complexity. One important advantage of the particle filtering framework is that it allows the information from different measurement sources to be fused in a principled manner. Although this fact has been acknowledged before, it has not been fully exploited within a visual tracking context. Here we introduce generic importance sampling mechanisms for data fusion and discuss them for fusing color with either stereo sound, for teleconferencing, or with motion, for surveillance with a still camera. We show how each of the three cues can be modeled by an appropriate data likelihood function, and how the intermittent cues (sound or motion) are best handled by generating proposal distributions from their likelihood functions. Finally, the effective fusion of the cues by particle filtering is demonstrated on real teleconference and surveillance data.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.823147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271403","","Particle tracking;Teleconferencing;Surveillance;Image sequences;Gaussian distribution;Particle filters;Information filtering;Information filters;Particle measurements;Monte Carlo methods","","364","39","59","IEEE","8 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Grid-connection mode with current control is also enabled for the case of isolated local grid involving other dispersed power generators such as other wind turbines or diesel generators. A novel automatic mode switch method based on a phase-locked loop controller is developed in order to detect the grid failure or recovery and switch the operation mode accordingly. A flexible digital signal processor (DSP) system that allows user-friendly code development and online tuning is used to implement and test the different control strategies. The back-to-back power conversion configuration is chosen where the generator converter uses a built-in standard flux vector control to control the speed of the turbine shaft while the grid-side converter uses a standard pulse-width modulation active rectifier control strategy implemented in a DSP controller.

The measured parameters are then used to estimate the transmitter location. Since the AOA/TOA measurements are done at each base station separately, without using the constraint that all measurements must correspond to the same transmitter, they are suboptimal. We propose a technique that uses exactly the same data as the common methods, except that the estimation of location is based on exact maximum likelihood, and the location determination is direct. Although there are many stray parameters, including the attenuation coefficients and the signal waveform, the method requires only a two-dimensional search. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the accuracy is equivalent to AOA, TOA, and their combination for high SNR, while for low SNR, the accuracy of the proposed method is superior.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2004.826501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288121","","Narrowband;Radio frequency;Radio transmitters;Sensor arrays;Array signal processing;Base stations;Underwater acoustics;Maximum likelihood estimation;RF signals;Cost function","","362","1","10","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The swimming speed of the robotic fish is adjusted by modulating joint's oscillating frequency, and its orientation is tuned by different joint's deflections. Since the motion control of a robotic fish involves both hydrodynamics of the fluid environment and dynamics of the robot, it is very difficult to establish a precise mathematical model employing purely analytical methods. Therefore, the fish's motion control task is decomposed into two control systems. The online speed control implements a hybrid control strategy and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm. The orientation control system is based on a fuzzy logic controller. In our experiments, a point-to-point (PTP) control algorithm is implemented and an overhead vision system is adopted to provide real-time visual feedback.

Unlike other algorithms that classify pixels statistically and ignore their scattering characteristics, this algorithm not only uses a statistical classifier, but also preserves the purity of dominant polarimetric scattering properties. This algorithm uses a combination of a scattering model-based decomposition developed by Freeman and Durden and the maximum-likelihood classifier based on the complex Wishart distribution. The first step is to apply the Freeman and Durden decomposition to divide pixels into three scattering categories: surface scattering, volume scattering, and double-bounce scattering. To preserve the purity of scattering characteristics, pixels in a scattering category are restricted to be classified with other pixels in the same scattering category. An efficient and effective class initialization scheme is also devised to initially merge clusters from many small clusters in each scattering category by applying a merge criterion developed based on the Wishart distance measure. Then, the iterative Wishart classifier is applied. The stability in convergence is much superior to that of the previous algorithm using the entropy/anisotropy/Wishart classifier. Finally, an automated color rendering scheme is proposed, based on the classes' scattering category to code the pixels to resemble their natural color. This algorithm is also flexible and computationally efficient. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's AIRSAR and the German Aerospace Center's (DLR) E-SAR L-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.819883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288367","","Radar scattering;Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;Iterative algorithms;Classification algorithms;Stability;Convergence;Clustering algorithms;Entropy;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Propulsion","","359","3","22","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the two concepts are strictly defined, the CoP with respect to ground-feet contact forces, the ZMP with respect to gravity plus inertia forces. Then, the coincidence of CoP and ZMP is proven, and related control aspects are examined. Finally, a virtual CoP-ZMP is defined, allowing us to extend the concept when walking on uneven terrain.

Since the path of the camera motion can be arbitrary, deblurring of motion blurred images is a hard problem. Previous methods to deal with this problem have included blind restoration of motion blurred images, optical correction using stabilized lenses, and special CMOS sensors that limit the exposure time in the presence of motion. In this paper, we exploit the fundamental trade off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution to construct a hybrid camera that can measure its own motion during image integration. The acquired motion information is used to compute a point spread function (PSF) that represents the path of the camera during integration. This PSF is then used to deblur the image. To verify the feasibility of hybrid imaging for motion deblurring, we have implemented a prototype hybrid camera. This prototype system was evaluated in different indoor and outdoor scenes using long exposures and complex camera motion paths. The results show that, with minimal resources, hybrid imaging outperforms previous approaches to the motion blur problem. We conclude with a brief discussion on how our ideas can be extended beyond the case of global camera motion to the case where individual objects in the scene move with different velocities.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288519","Sharpening and deblurring;inverse filtering;motion;motion blur;point spread function;resolution;hybrid imaging.","Cameras;Optical sensors;CMOS image sensors;Spatial resolution;Optical imaging;Prototypes;Layout;Degradation;Image restoration;Lenses","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Feasibility Studies;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Motion;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","358","4","46","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The systems may possess a wide class of uncertainties referred to as unstructured uncertainties, which are not linearly parameterized and do not have any prior knowledge of the bounding functions. The Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the uncertainties. A unified and systematic procedure is employed to derive two kinds of novel robust adaptive tracking controllers by use of the input-to-state stability (ISS) and by combining the backstepping technique and generalized small gain approach. One is the robust adaptive fuzzy tracking controller (RAFTC) for the system without input gain uncertainty. The other is the robust adaptive fuzzy sliding tracking controller (RAFSTC) for the system with input gain uncertainty. Both algorithms have two advantages, those are, semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of adaptive control system in the presence of unstructured uncertainties and the adaptive mechanism with minimal learning parameterizations. Four application examples, including a pendulum system with motor, a one-link robot, a ship roll stabilization with actuator and a single-link manipulator with flexible joint, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of proposed schemes.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2004.824870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288352","","Backstepping;Robust control;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Fuzzy control;Nonlinear systems;Uncertainty;Control systems;Robust stability;Fuzzy systems","","356","","55","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is based on a nonparametric extension of scatter matrices. There are at least two advantages to using the proposed nonparametric scatter matrices. First, they are generally of full rank. This provides the ability to specify the number of extracted features desired and to reduce the effect of the singularity problem. This is in contrast to parametric discriminant analysis, which usually only can extract L-1 (number of classes minus one) features. In a real situation, this may not be enough. Second, the nonparametric nature of scatter matrices reduces the effects of outliers and works well even for nonnormal datasets. The new method provides greater weight to samples near the expected decision boundary. This tends to provide for increased classification accuracy.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.825578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1298979","","Feature extraction;Covariance matrix;Scattering;Pattern recognition;Availability;Labeling;Focusing;Mathematics;Computer science education;Hyperspectral imaging","","354","","29","IEEE","18 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some published simulation results ignore this initialization discrepancy. For those results that attempt to account for this discrepancy, the practice is to discard an initial sequence of observations from a simulation in the hope that the remaining values will closely represent the stationary distribution. This approach is inefficient and not always reliable. However, if the initial locations and speeds of the nodes are chosen from the stationary distribution, convergence is immediate and no data need be discarded. We derive the stationary distributions for location, speed, and pause time for the random waypoint mobility model. We then show how to implement the random waypoint mobility model in order to construct more efficient and reliable simulations for mobile ad hoc networks. Simulation results, which verify the correctness of our method, are included.

We introduce the concept of dynamic convoy tree-based collaboration, and formalize it as a multiple objective optimization problem which needs to find a convoy tree sequence with high tree coverage and low energy consumption. We propose an optimal solution which achieves 100% coverage and minimizes the energy consumption under certain ideal situations. Considering the real constraints of a sensor network, we propose several practical implementations: the conservative scheme and the prediction-based scheme for tree expansion and pruning; the sequential and the localized reconfiguration schemes for tree reconfiguration. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the practical implementations and the optimal solution. The results show that the prediction-based scheme outperforms the conservative scheme and it can achieve similar coverage and energy consumption to the optimal solution. The experiments also show that the localized reconfiguration scheme outperforms the sequential reconfiguration scheme when the node density is high, and the trend is reversed when the node density is low.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.833443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1343904","","Collaboration;Target tracking;Intelligent networks;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Collaborative work;Wireless communication;Robustness","","353","","23","IEEE","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We derive the optimal balance between the amount of Fourier and wavelet regularization by optimizing an approximate mean-squared error (MSE) metric and find that signals with more economical wavelet representations require less Fourier shrinkage. ForWaRD is applicable to all ill-conditioned deconvolution problems, unlike the purely wavelet-based wavelet-vaguelette deconvolution (WVD); moreover, its estimate features minimal ringing, unlike the purely Fourier-based Wiener deconvolution.

In order to be transparent, the exoskeleton must determine the user's intent, apply forces when and where appropriate, and present low impedance to the wearer. We present a one degree of freedom exoskeleton called the RoboKnee which achieves a high level of transparency. User intent is determined through the knee joint angle and ground reaction forces. Torque is applied across the knee in order to allow the user's quadriceps muscles to relax. Low impedance is achieved through the use of series elastic actuators. The RoboKnee allows the wearer to climb stairs and perform deep knee bends while carrying a significant load in a backpack. The device provides most of the energy required to work against gravity while the user stays in control, deciding when and where to walk, as well as providing balance and control.

The dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation derived from Hodgkin and Huxley's (1952) membrane equation. There are only local lateral connections among neurons. The robot path is autonomously generated from the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network and the previous robot location.

Our hypothesis is that the change patterns can be used to recommend potentially relevant source code to a developer performing a modification task.

Grossglauser and Tse (2001) showed that when nodes are mobile it is possible to have a constant or /spl otimes/(1) throughput scaling per source-destination pair. The focus of this paper is on characterizing the delay and determining the throughput-delay trade-off in such fixed and mobile ad hoc networks. For the Gupta-Kumar fixed network model, we show that the optimal throughput-delay trade-off is given by D(n) = /spl otimes/(nT(n)), where T(n) and D(n) are the throughput and delay respectively. For the Grossglauser-Tse mobile network model, we show that the delay scales as /spl otimes/(n/sup 1/2//v(n)), where v(n) is the velocity of the mobile nodes. We then describe a scheme that achieves the optimal order of delay for any given throughput. The scheme varies (i) the number of hops, (ii) the transmission range and (iii) the degree of node mobility to achieve the optimal throughput-delay trade-off. The scheme produces a range of models that capture the Gupta-Kumar model at one extreme and the Grossglauser-Tse model at the other.

The observed effects include the breaching of intracellular granule membranes without permanent damage to the cell membrane, abrupt rises in intracellular free calcium levels, and enhanced expression of genes. At increased electric fields, the application of submicrosecond pulses induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in biological cells, an effect that has been shown to reduce the growth of tumors.

We assume that the receiver has perfect channel knowledge while the transmitter has only knowledge of either the mean or the covariance of the channel coefficients. The channel is modeled at the transmitter as a matrix of complex jointly Gaussian random variables with either a zero mean and a known covariance matrix (covariance information), or a nonzero mean and a white covariance matrix (mean information). For both cases, we develop a necessary and sufficient condition for when the Shannon capacity is achieved through beamforming; i.e., the channel can be treated like a scalar channel and one-dimensional codes can be used to achieve capacity. We also provide a waterpouring interpretation of our results and find that less channel uncertainty not only increases the system capacity but may also allow this higher capacity to be achieved with scalar codes which involves significantly less complexity in practice than vector coding.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.830822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310307","","Transmitters;Array signal processing;Transmitting antennas;Covariance matrix;Sufficient conditions;Narrowband;Receiving antennas;Additive noise;Gaussian noise;Random variables","","334","25","16","IEEE","12 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An adversary can compromise our privacy and safety by maliciously modifying the memory contents of these embedded devices. In this paper, we propose a softWare-based attestation technique (SWATT) to verify the memory contents of embedded devices and establish the absence of malicious changes to the memory contents. SWATT does not need physical access to the device's memory, yet provides memory content attestation similar to TCG or NGSCB without requiring secure hardware. SWATT can detect any change in memory contents with high probability, thus detecting viruses, unexpected configuration settings, and Trojan Horses. To circumvent SWATT, we expect that an attacker needs to change the hardware to hide memory content changes. We present an implementation of SWATT in off-the-shelf sensor network devices, which enables us to verify the contents of the program memory even while the sensor node is running.","1081-6011","0-7695-2136-3","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301329","","Hardware;Costs;Printers;Home appliances;Privacy;Safety devices;Computer security;Embedded computing;Java;Cellular phones","","333","26","16","IEEE","1 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method is based on the preliminary detection of the main retinal vessels. All retinal vessels originate from the OD and their path follows a similar directional pattern (parabolic course) in all images. To describe the general direction of retinal vessels at any given position in the image, a geometrical parametric model was proposed, where two of the model parameters are the coordinates of the OD center. Using as experimental data samples of vessel centerline points and corresponding vessel directions, provided by any vessel identification procedure, model parameters were identified by means of a simulated annealing optimization technique. These estimated values provide the coordinates of the center of OD. A Matlab/spl reg/ prototype implementing this method was developed. An evaluation of the proposed procedure was performed using the set of 81 images from the STARE project, containing images from both normal and pathological subjects. The OD position was correctly identified in 79 out of 81 images (98%), even in rather difficult pathological situations.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.829331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339426","","Optical detectors;Geometrical optics;Structural discs;Retina;Solid modeling;Mathematical model;Retinal vessels;Pathology;Parametric statistics;Simulated annealing","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Fluorescein Angiography;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Optic Disk;Optic Disk;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Retinal Vessels;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","332","2","16","IEEE","4 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, turbulence in the atmosphere leads to fades of varying depths, some of which may lead to heavy loss of data. We consider spatial diversity at both the transmitter and receiver, as well as time diversity as a means to mitigate the short-term loss of signal strength. Using direct detection receivers and binary pulse position modulation as an example, we derive the outage probability of spatial diversity and time diversity systems that use equal gain combining (EGC), optimal combining, and select-max combining. The power gain of using these diversity systems is found to be substantial, and the performance of equal gain combining is found to be almost as good as optimal combining. Hence, we feel diversity should be considered as one of the system techniques to improve channel performance in clear atmospheric optical channels.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.835751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1355985","Atmospheric communication;diversity;optical communication;outage probability","Optical fiber communication;Diversity reception;Optical transmitters;Optical receivers;Performance gain;Bit error rate;Atmosphere;Propagation losses;Pulse modulation;Optical refraction","","332","","5","IEEE","15 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time is divided into small scheduling intervals, and the channel rates for the various users are available at the start of the intervals. Since the rates vary randomly, in selecting the current user there is a conflict between full use (by selecting the user with the highest current rate) and fairness (which entails consideration for users with poor throughput to date). The proportional fair scheduler of the Qualcomm High Data Rate system and related algorithms are designed to deal with such conflicts. The aim here is to put such algorithms on a sure mathematical footing and analyze their behavior. The available analysis, while obtaining interesting information, does not address the actual convergence for arbitrarily many users under general conditions. Such algorithms are of the stochastic approximation type and results of stochastic approximation are used to analyze the long-term properties. It is shown that the limiting behavior of the sample paths of the throughputs converges to the solution of an intuitively reasonable ordinary differential equation, which is akin to a mean flow. We show that the ordinary differential equation (ODE) has a unique equilibrium and that it is characterized as optimizing a concave utility function, which shows that PFS is not ad-hoc, but actually corresponds to a reasonable maximization problem. These results may be used to analyze the performance of PFS. The results depend on the fact that the mean ODE has a special form that arises in problems with certain types of competitive behavior. There is a large set of such algorithms, each one corresponding to a concave utility function. This set allows a choice of tradeoffs between the current rate and throughout. Extensions to multiple antenna and frequency systems are given. Finally, the infinite backlog assumption is dropped and the data is allowed to arrive at random. This complicates the analysis, but the same results hold.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.830826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310314","","Convergence;Algorithm design and analysis;Throughput;Stochastic processes;Differential equations;Base stations;Transmitters;Mobile communication;Scheduling algorithm;Information analysis","","331","13","11","IEEE","12 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CC Steer is the first to compute paths with: 1) continuous curvature; 2) upper-bounded curvature; and 3) upper-bounded curvature derivative. CC Steer also verifies a topological property that ensures that when it is used within a general motion-planning scheme, it yields a complete collision-free path planner. The coupling of CC Steer with a general planning scheme yields a path planner that computes collision-free paths verifying the properties mentioned above. Accordingly, a car-like vehicle can follow such paths without ever having to stop in order to reorient its front wheels. Besides, such paths can be followed with a nominal speed which is proportional to the curvature derivative limit. The paths computed by CC Steer are made up of line segments, circular arcs, and clothoid arcs. They are not optimal in length. However, it is shown that they converge toward the optimal ""Reeds and Shepp"" paths when the curvature derivative upper bound tends to infinity. The capabilities of CC Steer to serve as an efficient steering method within two general planning schemes are also demonstrated.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2004.833789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1362698","Nonholonomic vehicles;smooth path planning","Vehicles;Path planning;Wheels;Robots;Motion-planning;Upper bound;H infinity control;Kinematics;Axles;Turning","","330","14","40","IEEE","30 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the PNN classifies these extracted features to identify the disturbance type according to the transient duration and the energy features. Since the proposed methodology can reduce a great quantity of the distorted signal features without losing its original property, less memory space and computing time are required.

Each drop refracts and reflects the environment, producing sharp intensity changes in an image. A group of such falling drops creates a complex time varying signal in images and videos. In addition, due to the finite exposure time of the camera, intensities due to rain are motion blurred and hence depend on the background intensities. Thus, the visual manifestations of rain are a combination of both the dynamics of rain and the photometry of the environment. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the visual effects of rain on an imaging system. We develop a correlation model that captures the dynamics of rain and a physics-based motion blur model that explains the photometry of rain. Based on these models, we develop efficient algorithms for detecting and removing rain from videos. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated using experiments on videos of complex scenes with moving objects and time-varying textures.

Corresponding to these goals, novel evaluation indices are defined which are named ""reproducibility"" and ""operationality"", respectively. Moreover, control stability must be satisfied. After all, bilateral teleoperation must satisfy three conditions such as reproducibility, operationality and stability. Using defined evaluation indices, bilateral controller is designed.

Instead of assuming the same role for all the sensors, we envision a hierarchical sensor network that is composed of 1) a static backbone of sparsely placed high-capability sensors which assume the role of a cluster head (CH) upon triggered by certain signal events and 2) moderately to densely populated low-end sensors whose function is to provide sensor information to CHs upon request. A cluster is formed and a CH becomes active, when the acoustic signal strength detected by the CH exceeds a predetermined threshold. The active CH then broadcasts an information solicitation packet, asking sensors in its vicinity to join the cluster and provide their sensing information. We address and devise solution approaches (with the use of Voronoi diagram) to realize dynamic clustering: (I1) how CHs operate with one another to ensure that only one CH (preferably the CH that is closes to the target) is active with high probability, (I2) when the active CH solicits for sensor information, instead of having all the sensors in its vicinity reply, only a sufficient number of sensors respond with nonredundant, essential information to determine the target location, and (I3) both the packets that sensors send to their CHs and packets that CHs report to subscribers do not incur significant collision. Through both probabilistic analysis and ns-2 simulation, we use with the use of Voronoi diagram, the CH that is usually closes to the target is (implicitly) selected as the leader and that the proposed dynamic clustering algorithm effectively eliminates contention among sensors and renders more accurate estimates of target locations as a result of better quality data collected and less collision incurred.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2004.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318595","Index Terms- Dynamic clustering;tracking;localization;sensor networks.","Target tracking;Wireless sensor networks;Acoustic sensors;Clustering algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Spine;Signal detection;Acoustic signal detection;Broadcasting;Algorithm design and analysis","","327","1","24","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A wide array of model-based evaluation techniques is now available, ranging from combinatorial methods, which are useful for quick, rough-cut analyses, to state-based methods, such as Markov reward models, and detailed, discrete-event simulation. The use of quantitative techniques for security evaluation is much less common, and has typically taken the form of formal analysis of small parts of an overall design, or experimental red team-based approaches. Alone, neither of these approaches is fully satisfactory, and we argue that there is much to be gained through the development of a sound model-based methodology for quantifying the security one can expect from a particular design. In this work, we survey existing model-based techniques for evaluating system dependability, and summarize how they are now being extended to evaluate system security.

The samples provide the ability to excite and measure the channel that consists of the transmit/receive propagation paths, the target and incidental scattering or clutter. These signals may be processed and combined to form an adaptive coherent transmit beam, or to search an extended area with high resolution in a single dwell.

In this paper, we will first provide a complete analysis of a norm constrained Capon beamforming (NCCB) approach, which uses a norm constraint on the weight vector to improve the robustness against array steering vector errors and noise. Our analysis of NCCB is thorough and sheds more light on the choice of the norm constraint than what was commonly known. We also provide a natural extension of the SCB, which has been obtained via covariance matrix fitting, to the case of uncertain steering vectors by enforcing a double constraint on the array steering vector, viz. a constant norm constraint and a spherical uncertainty set constraint, which we refer to as the doubly constrained robust Capon beamformer (DCRCB). NCCB and DCRCB can both be efficiently computed at a comparable cost with that of the SCB.

Typically, the interface between the grid and rectifier is either an inductor or an LCL-filter. The use of an LCL-filter mitigates the switching ripple injected in the grid by a three-phase active rectifier. However, stability problems can arise in the current control loop. In order to overcome them, a damping resistor can be inserted, at the price of a reduction of efficiency. The use of active damping by means of control may seem attractive but it is often limited by the use of more sensors compared to the standard control and also by a complex tuning procedure of the controllers. This paper introduces a new active damping method that does not require the use of more sensors. It consists of adding a filter on the reference voltage for the modulator. The tuning process of this filter is easily done, for a wide range of sampling frequencies, with the use of genetic algorithms. This method is used only for the optimum choice of the parameters in the filter and an on-line implementation is not needed. Thus the resulting active damping solution does not need new sensors or complex calculations. Moreover, in the paper particular attention is devoted to the susceptibility of the system in a high polluting environment.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.820540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262055","","Genetics;Algorithm design and analysis;Damping;Rectifiers;Filters;Power system stability;Tuning;Inverters;Inductors;Current control","","323","3","24","IEEE","30 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Increasing the number of transmit and receive antennas enables to improve system performance at the price of higher hardware costs and computational burden. For systems with a large number of antennas, there is a strong motivation to develop techniques with reduced hardware and computational costs. An efficient approach to achieve this goal is the optimal antenna subset selection. In this paper, we propose a fast antenna selection algorithm for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Our algorithm achieves almost the same outage capacity as the optimal selection technique while having lower computational complexity than the existing nearly optimal antenna selection methods. The optimality of the proposed technique is established in several important specific cases.

Sensitive loads such as computers will fail even if the voltage returns within a few seconds. A semiconductor circuit breaker, however, is able to switch fast enough to keep voltage disturbance within acceptable limits. The optimization and selection of power electronic switch topologies is critical.

A new sliding-mode control method is proposed for mobile robots with kinematics in two-dimensional polar coordinates. In the proposed method, two controllers are designed to asymptotically stabilize the tracking errors in position and heading direction, respectively. By combining these controllers together, both asymptotic posture (position and heading direction) stabilization and trajectory tracking are achieved for reference trajectories at global regions except the arbitrary small region around the origin. In particular, constraints on the desired linear and angular velocities as well as the posture of the mobile robot are eliminated unlike the previous studies based on kinematics expressed in polar coordinates. Accordingly, arbitrary trajectories including a circle and a straight line in various forms can be followed even with large initial tracking errors and bounded disturbances.

When processing SAR images, there is a strong need for statistical models of scattering to take into account multiplicative noise and high dynamics. For instance, the classification process needs to be based on the use of statistics. Our main contribution is the choice of an accurate model for high-resolution SAR images over urban areas and its use in a Markovian classification algorithm. Clutter in SAR images becomes non-Gaussian when the resolution is high or when the area is man-made. Many models have been proposed to fit with non-Gaussian scattering statistics (K, Weibull, Log-normal, Nakagami-Rice, etc.), but none of them is flexible enough to model all kinds of surfaces in our context. As a consequence, we use a mathematical model that relies on the Fisher distribution and the log-moment estimation and which is relevant for one-look data. This estimation method is based on the second-kind statistics, which are detailed in the paper. We also prove its accuracy for urban areas at high resolution.

Signal strength approaches are attractive because they are widely applicable to wireless sensor networks and do not require additional localization hardware. We show that although a broad spectrum of algorithms can trade accuracy for precision, none has a significant advantage in localization performance. We found that using commodity 802.11 technology over a range of algorithms, approaches and environments, one can expect a median localization error of 10 ft and 97th percentile of 30 ft. We present strong evidence that these limitations are fundamental and that they are unlikely to transcend without a fundamentally more complex environmental models or additional localization infrastructure.","","0-7803-8796-1","10.1109/SAHCN.2004.1381942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381942","","Hardware;Wireless LAN;Indoor environments;Sampling methods;Computer science;Wireless sensor networks;Level control;Transfer functions;Monitoring;Routing","","317","5","21","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Sequencing-by-hybridization revisited: the analog-spectrum proposal","F. P. Preparata","Computer Science Department, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,"24 Aug 2004","2004","1","1","46","52","All published approaches to DNA sequencing by hybridization (SBH) consist of the biochemical acquisition of the spectrum of a target sequence (the set of its subsequences conforming to a given probing pattern) followed by the algorithmic reconstruction of the sequence from its spectrum. In the ""standard"" or ""uniform"" approach, the probing pattern is a string of length L and the length of reliably reconstructible sequences is known to be m/sub len/ = O(2/sup L/). For a fixed microarray area, higher sequencing performance can be achieved by inserting nonprobing gaps (""wild-cards"") in the probing pattern. The reconstruction, however, must cope with the emergence of fooling probes due to the gaps and algorithmic failure occurs when the spectrum becomes too densely populated, although we can achieve m/sub comp/ = O(4/sup L/). Despite the combinatorial success of gapped probing, all current approaches are based on a biochemically unrealistic spectrum-acquisition model (digital-spectrum). The reality of hybridization is much more complex. Departing from the conventional model, in this paper, we propose an alternative, called the analog-spectrum model, which more closely reflects the biochemical process. This novel modeling reestablishes probe length as the performance-governing factor, adopting ""semidegenerate bases"" as suitable emulators of currently inadequate universal bases. One important conclusion is that accurate biochemical measurements are pivotal to the success of SBH. The theoretical proposal presented in this paper should be a convincing stimulus for the needed biotechnological work.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2004.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324619","Index Terms- DNA sequencing;sequencing-by-hybridization;microarrays;gapped probes;thermodynamics of hybridization;analog spectrum;semidegenerate bases.","Proposals;Sequences;DNA;Probes;Libraries;Thermodynamics;Optical wavelength conversion;Laboratories;Labeling;Visualization","Algorithms;Computational Biology;DNA;DNA;Nucleic Acid Hybridization;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Thermodynamics;Transition Temperature","315","","20","IEEE","24 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key problem, and still not sufficiently investigated, is the need to balance the confidentiality of the disclosed data with the legitimate needs of the data users. Every disclosure limitation method affects, in some way, and modifies true data values and relationships. We investigate confidentiality issues of a broad category of rules, the association rules. In particular, we present three strategies and five algorithms for hiding a group of association rules, which is characterized as sensitive. One rule is characterized as sensitive if its disclosure risk is above a certain privacy threshold. Sometimes, sensitive rules should not be disclosed to the public since, among other things, they may be used for inferring sensitive data, or they may provide business competitors with an advantage. We also perform an evaluation study of the hiding algorithms in order to analyze their time complexity and the impact that they have in the original database.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.1269668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269668","","Association rules;Protection;Databases;Data security;Information security;Government;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Privacy;Performance evaluation","","314","","11","IEEE","3 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such definitions have found limited application in engineering, unlike Shannon's statistical entropy. In this paper, it is shown that the problem of communication-limited stabilization is related to the concept of topological entropy, introduced by Adler et al. as a measure of the information rate of a continuous map on a compact topological space. Using similar open cover techniques, the notion of topological feedback entropy (TFE) is defined in this paper and proposed as a measure of the inherent rate at which a map on a noncompact topological space with inputs generates stability information. It is then proven that a topological dynamical plant can be stabilized into a compact set if and only if the data rate in the feedback loop exceeds the TFE of the plant on the set. By taking appropriate limits in a metric space, the concept of local TFE (LTFE) is defined at fixed points of the plant, and it is shown that the plant is locally uniformly asymptotically stabilizable to a fixed point if and only if the data rate exceeds the plant LTFE at the fixed point. For continuously differentiable plants in Euclidean space, real Jordan forms and volume partitioning arguments are then used to derive an expression for LTFE in terms of the unstable eigenvalues of the fixed point Jacobian.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.834105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333209","","Entropy;Communication system control;Information rates;Extraterrestrial measurements;Control systems;Stability;Feedback loop;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Jacobian matrices;Information theory","","314","","31","IEEE","13 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, the location of an object is known with certainty only at the time of the update. The uncertainty in its location increases until the next update. In this environment, it is possible for queries to produce incorrect results based upon old data. However, if the degree of uncertainty is controlled, then the error of the answers to queries can be reduced. More generally, query answers can be augmented with probabilistic estimates of the validity of the answer. We study the execution of probabilistic range and nearest-neighbor queries. The imprecision in answers to queries is an inherent property of these applications due to uncertainty in data, unlike the techniques for approximate nearest-neighbor processing that trade accuracy for performance. Algorithms for computing these queries are presented for a generic object movement model and detailed solutions are discussed for two common models of uncertainty in moving object databases.

According to the extent of an eavesdropper's knowledge, three kinds of secrecy capacity are considered: secret key (SK), private key (PK), and wiretap secret key (WSK) capacity. The characterizations of the SK and PK capacities highlight the innate connections between secrecy generation and multiterminal source coding without secrecy requirements. A general upper bound for WSK capacity is derived which is tight in the case when the eavesdropper can wiretap noisy versions of the components of the underlying multiple source, provided randomization is permitted at the terminals. These secrecy capacities are seen to be achievable with noninteractive communication between the terminals.

The task of designing and ensuring the correctness of applications in these environments is similarly becoming more complex. The unified goal of much of the research in distributed wireless systems is to provide higher-level abstractions of complex low-level concepts to application programmers, easing the design and implementation of applications. A new and growing class of applications for wireless sensor networks require similar complexity encapsulation. However, sensor networks have some unique characteristics, including dynamic availability of data sources and application quality of service requirements, that are not common to other types of applications. These unique features, combined with the inherent distribution of sensors, and limited energy and bandwidth resources, dictate the need for network functionality and the individual sensors to be controlled to best serve the application requirements. In this article, we describe different types of sensor network applications and discuss existing techniques for managing these types of networks. We also overview a variety of related middleware and argue that no existing approach provides all the management tools required by sensor network applications. To meet this need, we have developed a new middleware called MiLAN. MiLAN allows applications to specify a policy for managing the network and sensors, but the actual implementation of this policy is effected within MiLAN. We describe MiLAN and show its effectiveness through the design of a sensor-based personal health monitor.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2004.1265828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265828","","Middleware;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks;Distributed computing;Programming profession;Encapsulation;Availability;Quality of service;Bandwidth;Monitoring","","313","5","33","IEEE","28 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The low-per node cost allows these wireless networks of sensors and actuators to be densely distributed. The nodes in these dense networks coordinate to perform the distributed sensing and actuation tasks. Moreover, as described in this paper, the nodes can also coordinate to exploit the redundancy provided by high density so as to extend overall system lifetime. The large number of nodes deployed in this systems preclude manual configuration, and the environmental dynamics precludes design-time preconfiguration. Therefore, nodes have to self-configure to establish a topology that provides communication under stringent energy constraints. ASCENT builds on the notion that, as density increases, only a subset of the nodes is necessary to establish a routing forwarding backbone. In ASCENT, each node assesses its connectivity and adapts its participation in the multihop network topology based on the measured operating region. This paper motivates and describes the ASCENT algorithm and presents analysis, simulation, and experimental measurements. We show that the system achieves linear increase in energy savings as a function of the density and the convergence time required in case of node failures while still providing adequate connectivity.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2004.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318596","Index Terms- Wireless sensor networks;adaptive topology;topology control;energy conservation.","Adaptive systems;Network topology;Intelligent sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Microsensors;Monitoring;Costs;Actuators;Routing;Spine","","313","6","34","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of the distance involved in wide-area interconnections, communication delay cannot be ignored. Long time delay may be detrimental to system stability and may degrade system performance. The time delay tolerance of a centralized controller and the associated performance tradeoff is analyzed using a small gain criterion. Special attention is paid to the choice of weighting functions in a robust control design. As expected, it is found that time delay tolerance decreases when the system bandwidth increases, while the nominal system time-domain performance is concomitantly improved. Several approaches which can maintain a good system performance while increasing the time delay tolerance are suggested and compared. A modern controller design technique, like gain scheduling via linear matrix inequalities, is evaluated for the design of the supervisory power system stabilizer accounting for various time delays.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.836272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1350833","Gain scheduling;linear matrix inequality (LMI);power system stabilizer (PSS);robust control;small gain theorem;time delay;wide-area","Delay effects;Power systems;Power system interconnection;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Centralized control;System performance;Power system analysis computing;Power system control;Degradation","","310","1","20","IEEE","1 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The majority of these algorithms can be applied only to data described by discrete numerical or nominal attributes (features). In the case of continuous attributes, there is a need for a discretization algorithm that transforms continuous attributes into discrete ones. We describe such an algorithm, called CAIM (class-attribute interdependence maximization), which is designed to work with supervised data. The goal of the CAIM algorithm is to maximize the class-attribute interdependence and to generate a (possibly) minimal number of discrete intervals. The algorithm does not require the user to predefine the number of intervals, as opposed to some other discretization algorithms. The tests performed using CAIM and six other state-of-the-art discretization algorithms show that discrete attributes generated by the CAIM algorithm almost always have the lowest number of intervals and the highest class-attribute interdependency. Two machine learning algorithms, the CLIP4 rule algorithm and the decision tree algorithm, are used to generate classification rules from data discretized by CAIM. For both the CLIP4 and decision tree algorithms, the accuracy of the generated rules is higher and the number of the rules is lower for data discretized using the CAIM algorithm when compared to data discretized using six other discretization algorithms. The highest classification accuracy was achieved for data sets discretized with the CAIM algorithm, as compared with the other six algorithms.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.1269594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269594","","Machine learning algorithms;Decision trees;Data mining;Discrete transforms;Algorithm design and analysis;Spatial databases;Testing;Performance evaluation;Classification tree analysis;Internet","","310","","29","IEEE","3 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and magnetic resonance imaging measurements indicate that pH gradients of up to 1.0 pH unit can exit within 1-cm distance. Although measurement of blood pH can indicate systemic problems, it cannot pinpoint the lesion or quantitatively assess the magnitude of excursion from normal pHe. Hence, there is need to develop pHe measurement methods with high spatiotemporal resolution. The two major approaches being investigated include magnetization transfer (MT) methods and relaxation methods. pH-dependent MT effects can be observed with endogenous signals or exogenously applied chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents. While endogenous signals have the advantage of being fully noninvasive and relatively straightforward to apply, they lack a full biophysical characterization and dynamic range that might be afforded by future CEST agents. pH-dependent relaxivity also requires the injection or infusion of exogenous contrast reagents. In both MT and relaxographic approaches, the magnitude of the effect, and thus, the ability to quantify pHe, depends on a spatially and temporally varying concentration of the CR. A number of approaches have been proposed to solve this problem and once it is solved, pH imaging methods will be applicable to human clinical pathologies.","1937-4186","","10.1109/MEMB.2004.1360409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1360409","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Cancer;Magnetic resonance;Spectroscopy;Blood;Lesions;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Signal resolution;Magnetization;Relaxation methods","Acid-Base Equilibrium;Animals;Contrast Media;Fluorine;Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Neoplasms;Organometallic Compounds;Phosphorus Isotopes","308","6","70","IEEE","30 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper reports practical test results obtained on a medium voltage (10 kV) level using a DVR at a distribution test facility in Kyndby, Denmark. The DVR was designed to protect a 400-kVA load from a 0.5-p.u. maximum voltage sag. The reported DVR verifies the use of a combined feed-forward and feed-back technique of the controller and it obtains both good transient and steady-state responses. The effect of the DVR on the system is experimentally investigated under both faulted and nonfaulted system states, for a variety of linear and nonlinear loads. Variable duration voltage sags were created using a controllable LV breaker fed by a 630 kVA distribution transformer placed upstream of the sensitive load. The fault currents in excess of 12 kA were designed and created to obtain the required voltage sags. It is concluded the DVR works well in all operating conditions.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.826504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1296757","","Voltage control;Testing;Medium voltage;Power quality;Voltage fluctuations;Costs;Low voltage;Test facilities;Power system protection;Feedforward systems","","308","1","15","IEEE","10 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using a piecewise-linear approximation for the Gaussian function, a simple and efficient way of computing this significance has been derived for uniformly distributed input data. In the GAP-RBF algorithm, the growing and pruning are based on the significance of the ""nearest"" neuron.

An overview is given of the necessary changes, including time and frequency synchronization, channel estimation, synchronization tracking, and MIMO detection. As a test case, the OFDM-based wireless local area network (WLAN) standard IEEE 802.11a is considered, but the results are applicable more generally.

The goal of the observations was to quantify the water column variability in order to understand the along and across-shore low-frequency acoustic propagation in shallow water. The moorings were deployed from April 21-May 19, 2001 and sampled at 1-5 min intervals to capture the full range of temporal variability without aliasing the internal wave field. The dominant oceanographic signal by far was in fact the highly nonlinear internal waves (or solitons) which were generated near the Batan Islands in the Luzon Strait and propagated 485 km across deep water to the observation region. Dubbed trans-basin waves, to distinguish them from other, smaller nonlinear waves generated locally near the shelf break, these waves had amplitudes ranging from 29 to greater than 140 m and were among the largest such waves ever observed in the world's oceans. The waves arrived at the most offshore mooring in two clusters lasting 7-8 days each separated by five days when no waves were observed. Within each cluster, two types of waves arrived which have been named type-a and type-b. The type-a waves had greater amplitude than the type-b waves and arrived with remarkable regularity at the same time each day, 24 h apart. The type-b waves were weaker than the type-a waves, arrived an hour later each day, and generally consisted of a single soliton growing out of the center of the wave packet. Comparison with modeled barotropic tides from the generation region revealed that: 1) The two clusters were generated around the time of the spring tides in the Luzon strait; and 2) The type-a waves were generated on the strong side of the diurnal inequality while the type-b waves were generated on the weaker beat. The position of the Kuroshio intrusion into the Luzon Strait may modulate the strength of the waves being produced. As the waves shoaled, the huge lead solitons first split into two solitons then merged together into a broad region of thermocline depression at depths less than 120 m. Elevation waves sprang up behind them as they continued to propagate onshore. The elevation waves also grew out of regions where the locally-generated internal tide forced the main thermocline down near the bottom. The ""critical point"" /spl alpha/ where the upper and lower layers were equal was a good indicator of when the depression or elevation waves would form, however this was not a static point, but rather varied in both space and time according to the presence or absence of the internal tides and the incoming trans-basin waves themselves.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2004.840839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388606","Baroclinic tides;nonlinear internal waves;ocean currents","Solitons;Water resources;Tides;Sensor arrays;Acoustic propagation;Temperature sensors;Ocean temperature;Conductivity;Acoustic sensors;Underwater acoustics","","305","","52","IEEE","31 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using a linearized model of the system dynamics, we present a simple rule to design the parameters of the AVQ algorithm. We then compare its performance through simulation with several well-known AQM schemes such as RED, REM, Proportional Integral (PI) controller, and a nonadaptive virtual queue algorithm. With a view toward implementation, we show that AVQ can be implemented as a simple token bucket using only a few lines of code.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2004.826291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288133","","Robust stability;Pi control;Proportional control;Quality of service;Feedback;Delay;Mice;Algorithm design and analysis;Web and internet services;Force control","","305","11","20","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different configurations of each architecture, which include a number of novel 4-2 and 5-2 compressor designs, are prototyped and simulated to evaluate their performance in speed, power dissipation and power-delay product. The newly developed circuits are based on various configurations of the novel 5-2 compressor architecture with the new carry generator circuit, or existing architectures configured with the proposed circuit for the exclusive OR (XOR) and exclusive NOR ( XNOR) [XOR-XNOR] module. The proposed new circuit for the XOR-XNOR module eliminates the weak logic on the internal nodes of pass transistors with a pair of feedback PMOS-NMOS transistors. Driving capability has been considered in the design as well as in the simulation setup so that these 4-2 and 5-2 compressor cells can operate reliably in any tree structured parallel multiplier at very low supply voltages. Two new simulation environments are created to ensure that the performances reflect the realistic circuit operation in the system to which these cells are integrated. Simulation results show that the 4-2 compressor with the proposed XOR-XNOR module and the new fast 5-2 compressor architecture are able to function at supply voltage as low as 0.6 V, and outperform many other architectures including the classical CMOS logic compressors and variants of compressors constructed with various combinations of recently reported superior low-power logic cells.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2004.835683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344222","","Compressors;Arithmetic;Low voltage;CMOS logic circuits;Circuit simulation;CMOS process;Semiconductor device modeling;Virtual prototyping;Power dissipation;Feedback circuits","","303","2","19","IEEE","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the current controlled inverter is connected to the grid, the phase error results in a power factor decrement and the limited disturbance rejection capability leads to the need of grid feed-forward compensation. However the imperfect compensation action of the feed-forward control results in high harmonic distortion of the current and consequently noncompliance with international standards. In this paper a new control strategy aimed to mitigate these problems is proposed. Stationary-frame generalized integrators are used to control the fundamental current and to compensate the grid harmonics providing disturbance rejection capability without the need of feed-forward grid compensation. Moreover the use of a grid LCL-filter is investigated with the proposed controller.

In this paper, we propose a new framework for implementing ant colony optimization algorithms called the hyper-cube framework for ant colony optimization. In contrast to the usual way of implementing ant colony optimization algorithms, this framework limits the pheromone values to the interval [0,1]. This is obtained by introducing changes in the pheromone value update rule. These changes can in general be applied to any pheromone value update rule used in ant colony optimization. We discuss the benefits coming with this new framework. The benefits are twofold. On the theoretical side, the new framework allows us to prove that in the ant system, the ancestor of all ant colony optimization algorithms, the average quality of the solutions produced increases in expectation over time when applied to unconstrained problems. On the practical side, the new framework automatically handles the scaling of the objective function values. We experimentally show that this leads on average to a more robust behavior of ant colony optimization algorithms.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.821450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275547","","Ant colony optimization;Runtime;Robustness;Chemicals;Humans;Optimization methods;Character generation","Algorithms;Animals;Ants;Behavior, Animal;Computer Simulation;Cybernetics;Models, Biological;Pheromones;Population Dynamics","302","","32","IEEE","22 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Registration based on intensity values usually requires optimization of some similarity metric between the images. Local optimization techniques frequently fail because functions of these metrics with respect to transformation parameters are generally nonconvex and irregular and, therefore, global methods are often required. In this paper, a new evolutionary approach, particle swarm optimization, is adapted for single-slice 3D-to-3D biomedical image registration. A new hybrid particle swarm technique is proposed that incorporates initial user guidance. Multimodal registrations with initial orientations far from the ground truth were performed on three volumes from different modalities. Results of optimizing the normalized mutual information similarity metric were compared with various evolutionary strategies. The hybrid particle swarm technique produced more accurate registrations than the evolutionary strategies in many cases, with comparable convergence. These results demonstrate that particle swarm approaches, along with evolutionary techniques and local methods, are useful in image registration, and emphasize the need for hybrid approaches for difficult registration problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.826068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304849","","Biomedical imaging;Particle swarm optimization;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical treatment;Ultrasonic imaging;Image registration;Biomedical computing;Computed tomography;Positron emission tomography;Computer science","","302","15","42","IEEE","14 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An agent in MAGA represents a candidate solution to the optimization problem in hand. All agents live in a latticelike environment, with each agent fixed on a lattice-point. In order to increase energies, they compete or cooperate with their neighbors, and they can also use knowledge. Making use of these agent-agent interactions, MAGA realizes the purpose of minimizing the objective function value. Theoretical analyzes show that MAGA converges to the global optimum. In the first part of the experiments, ten benchmark functions are used to test the performance of MAGA, and the scalability of MAGA along the problem dimension is studied with great care. The results show that MAGA achieves a good performance when the dimensions are increased from 20-10,000. Moreover, even when the dimensions are increased to as high as 10,000, MAGA still can find high quality solutions at a low computational cost. Therefore, MAGA has good scalability and is a competent algorithm for solving high dimensional optimization problems. To the best of our knowledge, no researchers have ever optimized the functions with 10,000 dimensions by means of evolution.

DSA refers to the analysis required to determine whether or not a power system can meet specified reliability and security criteria in both transient and steady-state time frames for all credible contingencies. Ensuring security in the new environment requires the use of advanced power system analysis tools capable of comprehensive security assessment with due consideration to practical operating criteria. These tools must be able to model the system appropriately, compute security limits in a fast and accurate manner, and provide meaningful displays to system operators. Online dynamics security assessment can provide the first line of defense against widespread system disturbances by quickly scanning the system for potential problems and providing operators with actionable results.

Meta-heuristic methods overcome this limitation, and offer a practical way to solve large instances of the relaxed RAP where different components can be placed in parallel. The ant colony method has not yet been used in reliability design, yet it is a method that is expressly designed for combinatorial problems with a neighborhood structure, as in the case of the RAP. An ant colony optimization algorithm for the RAP is devised & tested on a well-known suite of problems from the literature.

Compared to conventional solutions based on stationary-frame current control, this approach allows full compensation of selected frequencies, even if the active filter has limited bandwidth. Compared to synchronous-frame harmonic regulations on line currents, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of compensated harmonics.

This technique is based on a study of the spectral properties of related Hamiltonian matrices. The formulation is applicable in case the system input-output transfer function is in admittance, impedance, hybrid, or scattering form. A standard test for passivity is first performed by checking the existence of imaginary eigenvalues of the associated Hamiltonian matrix. In the presence of imaginary eigenvalues the system is not passive. In such a case, a new result based on first-order perturbation theory is presented for the precise characterization of the frequency bands where passivity violations occur. This characterization is then used for the design of an iterative perturbation scheme of the state matrices, aimed at the displacement of the imaginary eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix. The result is an effective algorithm leading to the compensation of the passivity violations. This procedure is very efficient when the passivity violations are small, so that first-order perturbation is applicable. Several examples illustrate and validate the procedure.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2004.834527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333225","","Frequency;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Scattering;Circuit testing;Transfer functions;Admittance;Impedance;Performance evaluation;Iterative algorithms","","300","5","24","IEEE","13 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the lack of an efficient portable lock-free method for the reclamation of the memory occupied by dynamic nodes removed from such objects is a major obstacle to their wide use in practice. We present hazard pointers, a memory management methodology that allows memory reclamation for arbitrary reuse. It is very efficient, as demonstrated by our experimental results. It is suitable for user-level applications - as well as system programs - without dependence on special kernel or scheduler support. It is wait-free. It requires only single-word reads and writes for memory access in its core operations. It allows reclaimed memory to be returned to the operating system. In addition, it offers a lock-free solution for the ABA problem using only practical single-word instructions. Our experimental results on a multiprocessor system show that the new methodology offers equal and, more often, significantly better performance than other memory management methods, in addition to its qualitative advantages regarding memory reclamation and independence of special hardware support. We also show that lock-free implementations of important object types, using hazard pointers, offer comparable performance to that of efficient lock-based implementations under no contention and no multiprogramming, and outperform them by significant margins under moderate multiprogramming and/or contention, in addition to guaranteeing continuous progress and availability, even in the presence of thread failures and arbitrary delays.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2004.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291819","Lock-free;synchronization;concurrent programming;memory management;multiprogramming;dynamic data structures.","Hazards;Memory management;Kernel;Read-write memory;Operating systems;Multiprocessing systems;Quality management;Hardware;Availability","","300","87","30","IEEE","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Modeling and experimental results show that the flux and torque ripples are greatly reduced when compared with those of the basic DTC. With the new scheme, very short sampling time is not essential. All the advantages of the basic DTC are still retained. In addition, fixed switching frequency at different operating conditions becomes possible.

It consists of a library of soft macros (switches, network interfaces and links) that are design-time composable and tunable so that domain-specific heterogeneous architectures can be instantiated and synthesized. Links can be pipelined with a flexible number of stages to decouple link throughput from its length and to get arbitrary topologies. Moreover, a tool called XpipesCompiler, which automatically instantiates a customized NoC from the library of soft network components, is used in this paper to test the Xpipes-based synthesis flow for domain-specific communication architectures.","1558-0830","","10.1109/MCAS.2004.1330747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1330747","","Network-on-a-chip;Communication switching;Network synthesis;Packet switching;Telecommunication network reliability;Software libraries;Switches;Network interfaces;Throughput;Network topology","","299","14","35","IEEE","3 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA",IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,"19 Feb 2004","2004","51","1","31","46","Errors in requirements specifications have been identified as a major contributor to costly software project failures. It would be highly beneficial if information systems developers could verify requirements by predicting workplace acceptance of a new system based on user evaluations of its specifications measured during the earliest stages of the development project, ideally before building a working prototype. However, conventional wisdom among system developers asserts that prospective users must have direct hands-on experience with at least a working prototype of a new system before they can provide assessments that accurately reflect future usage behavior after workplace implementation. The present research demonstrates that this assumption is only partially true. Specifically, it is true that stable and predictive assessments of a system's perceived ease of use should be based on direct behavioral experience using the system. However, stable and behaviorally predictive measures of perceived usefulness can be captured from target users who have received information about a system's functionality, but have not had direct hands-on usage experience. This distinction is key because, compared to ease of use, usefulness is generally much more strongly linked to future usage intentions and behaviors in the workplace. Two longitudinal field experiments show that preprototype usefulness measures can closely approximate hands-on based usefulness measures, and are significantly predictive of usage intentions and behavior up to six months after workplace implementation. The present findings open the door toward research on how user acceptance testing may be done much earlier in the system development process than has traditionally been the case. Such preprototype user acceptance tests have greater informational value than their postprototype counterparts because they are captured when only a relatively small proportion of project costs have been incurred and there is greater flexibility to modify a new system's design attributes. Implications are discussed for future research to confirm the robustness of the present findings and to better understand the practical potential and limitations of preprototype user acceptance testing.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2003.822468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266852","","Software management;Project management;Information systems;Information technology;Software prototyping;Technology forecasting","","299","","76","IEEE","19 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A three-loop control scheme, consisting of a common output voltage loop, individual inner current loops, and individual input voltage loops, is proposed to achieve input voltage and load current sharing. The output voltage loop provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is modified by the respective input voltage loops. The average of converter input voltages, which is dynamically varying, is chosen as the reference for input voltage loops. This choice of reference eliminates interaction among different control loops. The input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is analyzed using the incremental negative resistance model of DC/DC converters. Based on the analysis, design methods for input voltage controller are developed.

Assuming local translation among low-resolution images, this paper is the first attempt to determine the explicit limits of reconstruction-based algorithms, under both real and synthetic conditions.

Proceedings. 2004","1 Jun 2004","2004","","","211","225","Attackers routinely perform random portscans of IP addresses to find vulnerable servers to compromise. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) attempt to detect such behavior and flag these portscanners as malicious. An important need in such systems is prompt response: the sooner a NIDS detects malice, the lower the resulting damage. At the same time, a NIDS should not falsely implicate benign remote hosts as malicious. Balancing the goals of promptness and accuracy in detecting malicious scanners is a delicate and difficult task. We develop a connection between this problem and the theory of sequential hypothesis testing and show that one can model accesses to local IP addresses as a random walk on one of two stochastic processes, corresponding respectively to the access patterns of benign remote hosts and malicious ones. The detection problem then becomes one of observing a particular trajectory and inferring from it the most likely classification for the remote host. We use this insight to develop TRW (Threshold Random Walk), an online detection algorithm that identifies malicious remote hosts. Using an analysis of traces from two qualitatively different sites, we show that TRW requires a much smaller number of connection attempts (4 or 5 in practice) to detect malicious activity compared to previous schemes, while also providing theoretical bounds on the low (and configurable) probabilities of missed detection and false alarms. In summary, TRW performs significantly faster and also more accurately than other current solutions.","1081-6011","0-7695-2136-3","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301325","","Sequential analysis;Intrusion detection;Web server;Probes;Laboratories;Internet;Network servers;Reconnaissance;Search engines;Computer science","","292","19","9","IEEE","1 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the highly variable nature of batteries (e.g., 2.7-4.2 V for Li-ion), systems often require supply voltages to be both higher and lower than the battery voltage (e.g., power amplifier for CDMA applications), while supplying significant current, which is most efficiently generated by a noninverting buck-boost switching converter. In this paper, the design and experimental results of a new dynamic, noninverting, synchronous buck-boost converter for low voltage, portable applications is reported. The converter's output voltage is dynamically adjustable (on-the-fly) from 0.4 to 4.0 V, while capable of supplying a maximum load current of 0.65 A from an input supply of 2.4-3.4 V. The worst-case response time of the converter for a 0.4 to 4 V step change in its output voltage (corresponding to a 0.2 to 2 V step at its reference input) is less than 300 /spl mu/sec and to a load-current step of 0 to 0.5 A is within 200 /spl mu/sec, yielding only a transient error of 40 mV in the output voltage.

Unfortunately, most approaches to correlation concentrate on just a few components of the process, providing formalisms and techniques that address only specific correlation issues. This paper presents a general correlation model that includes a comprehensive set of components and a framework based on this model. A tool using the framework has been applied to a number of well-known intrusion detection data sets to identify how each component contributes to the overall goals of correlation. The results of these experiments show that the correlation components are effective in achieving alert reduction and abstraction.

Radio waves do not pass through some ethereal medium called ""spectrum""; they are the medium. What is licensed by governments is not a piece of a finite pie but simply the right to deploy transmitters and receivers that operate in particular ways. Moreover, interference is not some inherent property of spectrum. It is a property of devices. A better receiver will pick up a transmission where an earlier one heard only static. Whether a new radio system ""interferes"" with existing ones is entirely dependent on the equipment involved. Consequently, the extent to which there appears to be a spectrum shortage largely depends not on how many frequencies are available but on the technologies that can be deployed.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2004.1270548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1270548","","Radio frequency;Government;Licenses;Satellite broadcasting;Wireless sensor networks;Millimeter wave technology;Cellular phones;FCC;Business;Propulsion","","291","4","4","IEEE","8 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The studies show that the contribution of a WECS to the reliability performance of a generation system can be quantified and is highly dependent on the wind site conditions.

Several congestion control proposals have been suggested to remedy this problem. The existing protocols consider mainly two properties: TCP friendliness and bandwidth scalability. That is, a protocol should not take away too much bandwidth from standard TCP flows while utilizing the full bandwidth of high-speed networks. This work presents another important constraint, namely, RTT (round trip time) unfairness where competing flows with different RTTs may consume vastly unfair bandwidth shares. Existing schemes have a severe RTT unfairness problem because the congestion window increase rate gets larger as the window grows ironically the very reason that makes them more scalable. RTT unfairness for high-speed networks occurs distinctly with drop tail routers for flows with large congestion windows where packet loss can be highly synchronized. After identifying the RTT unfairness problem of existing protocols, This work presents a new congestion control scheme that alleviates RTT unfairness while supporting TCP friendliness and bandwidth scalability. The proposed congestion control algorithm uses two window size control policies called additive increase and binary search increase. When the congestion window is large, additive increase with a large increment ensures square RTT unfairness as well as good scalability. Under small congestion windows, binary search increase supports TCP friendliness. The simulation results confirm these properties of the protocol.","0743-166X","0-7803-8355-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354672","","Bandwidth;Scalability;High-speed networks;Access protocols;Remote monitoring;Computer science;Bit error rate;Network interfaces;Tail;Internet","","286","2","23","IEEE","22 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the first module, an edge image of the scene is analyzed to obtain the candidates for the left and right road borders and to delimit the area that will subsequently be used to compute the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution, assumed to be obeyed by the color components of road surfaces. The second module effectively extracts the road area and reinforces boundaries that most appropriately fit the road-extraction result. The combination of these modules can overcome basic problems due to inaccuracies in edge detection based on the intensity image alone and due to the computational complexity of segmentation algorithms based on color images.

These torque pulsations vary periodically with rotor position and are reflected as speed ripple, which degrades the PMSM drive performance, particularly at low speeds. Because of the periodic nature of torque ripple, iterative learning control (ILC) is intuitively an excellent choice for torque ripple minimization. In this paper, first we propose an ILC scheme implemented in time domain to reduce periodic torque pulsations. A forgetting factor is introduced in this scheme to increase the robustness of the algorithm against disturbance. However, this limits the extent to which torque pulsations can be suppressed. In order to eliminate this limitation, a modified ILC scheme implemented in frequency domain by means of Fourier series expansion is presented. Experimental evaluations of both proposed schemes are carried out on a DSP-controlled PMSM drive platform. Test results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes in reducing torque ripple by a factor of approximately three under various operating conditions.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.820537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271309","","Synchronous motors;Torque control;Magnetic variables control;Air gaps;Permanent magnet motors;Current measurement;Magnetic flux;Stators;Rotors;Degradation","","285","2","18","IEEE","8 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In spite of the current extensive use of metrics, if used in isolation metrics are oftentimes too fine grained to quantify comprehensively an investigated design aspect (e.g., distribution of system's intelligence among classes). To help developers and maintainers detect and localize design problems in a system, we propose a novel mechanism - called detection strategy - for formulating metrics-based rules that capture deviations from good design principles and heuristics. Using detection strategies an engineer can directly localize classes or methods affected by a particular design flaw (e.g., God Class), rather than having to infer the real design problem from a large set of abnormal metric values. We have defined such detection strategies for capturing around ten important flaws of object-oriented design found in the literature and validated the approach experimentally on multiple large-scale case-studies.","1063-6773","0-7695-2213-0","10.1109/ICSM.2004.1357820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1357820","","Software design;Diseases;Software maintenance;Software systems;Large-scale systems;Object oriented modeling;Computer science;Intelligent systems;Maintenance engineering;Design engineering","","285","3","29","IEEE","22 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A new algorithm for rapid tracking of approximate maximum power point in photovoltaic systems","S. Jain; V.

This is a fast tracking algorithm, where an initial approximation of maximum power point is (MPP) quickly achieved using a variable step-size. Subsequently, the exact maximum power point can be targeted using any conventional method like the hill-climbing or incremental conductance method. Thus, the drawback of a fixed small step-size over the entire tracking range is removed, resulting in reduced number of iterations and much faster tracking compared to conventional methods. The strength of the algorithm comes from the fact that instead of tracking power, which does not have a one-to-one relationship with duty cycle, it tracks an intermediate variable /spl beta/, which has a monotonically increasing, one-to-one relationship. The algorithm has been verified on a photovoltaic system modeled in Matlab-Simulink software. The algorithm significantly improves the efficiency during the tracking phase as compared to a conventional algorithm. It is especially suitable for fast changing environmental conditions. The proposed algorithm can be implemented on any fast controller such as the digital signal processor. All the details of this study are presented.","1558-3767","","10.1109/LPEL.2004.828444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302114","","Photovoltaic systems;Signal processing algorithms;Target tracking;Solar power generation;Phased arrays;Approximation algorithms;Software algorithms;Mathematical model;Power system modeling;Computer languages","","284","3","6","IEEE","1 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing user behavior, the content of the pages, and the order of the URLs that tend to be accessed. Web structure mining plays an important role in this approach. Two page ranking algorithms, HITS and PageRank, are commonly used in Web structure mining. Both algorithms treat all links equally when distributing rank scores. Several algorithms have been developed to improve the performance of these methods. The weighted PageRank algorithm (WPR), an extension to the standard PageRank algorithm, is introduced. WPR takes into account the importance of both the inlinks and the outlinks of the pages and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the pages.

A major problem for these systems is their inability to deal with the high-frequency part of speech. Psychoacoustic evidence suggests that different perceptual mechanisms are involved in handling resolved and unresolved harmonics. We propose a novel system for voiced speech segregation that segregates resolved and unresolved harmonics differently. For resolved harmonics, the system generates segments based on temporal continuity and cross-channel correlation, and groups them according to their periodicities. For unresolved harmonics, it generates segments based on common amplitude modulation (AM) in addition to temporal continuity and groups them according to AM rates. Underlying the segregation process is a pitch contour that is first estimated from speech segregated according to dominant pitch and then adjusted according to psychoacoustic constraints. Our system is systematically evaluated and compared with pervious systems, and it yields substantially better performance, especially for the high-frequency part of speech.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2004.832812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333078","","Amplitude modulation;Interference;Speech analysis;Speech enhancement;Image analysis;Power harmonic filters;Sensor arrays;Hidden Markov models;Psychology;Automatic speech recognition","","280","15","35","IEEE","13 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It would be desirable to have an image-to-image transform, which uncovers only the structure of an object for an efficient matching. In this context the contribution of our work is two-fold. First, we introduce illumination invariant local structure features for object detection. For an efficient computation we propose a modified census transform which enhances the original work of Zabih and Woodfill. We show some shortcomings and how to get over them with the modified version. S6econdly, we introduce an efficient four-stage classifier for rapid detection. Each single stage classifier is a linear classifier, which consists of a set of feature lookup-tables. We show that the first stage, which evaluates only 20 features filters out more than 99% of all background positions. Thus, the classifier structure is much simpler than previous described multi-stage approaches, while having similar capabilities. The combination of illumination invariant features together with a simple classifier leads to a real-time system on standard computers (60 msec, image size: 288/spl times/384, 2GHi Pentium). Detection results are presented on two commonly used databases in this field namely the MIT+CMU set of 130 images and the BioID set of 1526 images.

The computations of earlier simple echo representations have shown that the spectrum representation domain results does not belong in the frequency or time domain. Bogert et al. (1963) chose to refer to it as quefrency domain and later termed the spectrum of the log of a time waveform as the cepstrum. The article also recounts the analysis of Al Oppenheim in relation to the cepstrum. It was in his theory for nonlinear signal processing, referred to as homomorphic systems, that the realization of the characteristic system of homomorphic convolution was reminiscent of the cepstrum. To retain both the relationship to the work of Bogart et al. and the distinction, the term power cepstrum was eventually applied to the nonlinear mapping in homomorphic deconvolution .

Our experiments show that the proposed 3D floorplan algorithm with CBA representation can reduce the wirelength by 29% compared with a recent published result from (Hsiu et al., 2004). In addition, compared to a nonthermal-driven 3D floorplanning algorithm, the thermal-driven 3D floorplanning algorithm can reduce the maximum on-chip temperature by 56%.","1092-3152","0-7803-8702-3","10.1109/ICCAD.2004.1382591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382591","","Thermal conductivity;Three-dimensional integrated circuits;Thermal resistance;Integrated circuit interconnections;Delay;Circuit synthesis;System-on-a-chip;Radio frequency;Integrated circuit packaging;Rapid thermal processing","","279","1","28","IEEE","31 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SDT junctions were patterned and connected with one layer of metal lines using photolithography techniques. These junctions have a typical stack structure of Si(100)-Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/-Ru-CoFeB-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/-CoFeB-Ru-FeCo-CrMnPt with the antiferromagnet CrMnPt layers for pinning at the top. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals that the CoFeB has an amorphous structure and a smooth interface with the Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ tunnel barrier. Although it is difficult to pin the amorphous CoFeB directly from the top, the use of a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) pinned layer structure allows sufficient rigidity of the reference CoFeB layer. The tunnel junctions were annealed at 250/spl deg/C for 1 h and tested for magneto-transport properties with tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) values as high as 70.4% at room temperature, which is the highest value ever reported for such a sandwich structure. This TMR value translates to a spin polarization of 51% for CoFeB, which is likely to be higher at lower temperatures. These junctions also have a low coercivity (Hc) and a low parallel coupling field (Hcoupl). The combination of a high TMR, a low Hc, and a low Hcoupl is ideal for magnetic field sensor applications.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2004.830219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1325474","","Temperature;Tunneling magnetoresistance;Amorphous magnetic materials;Antiferromagnetic materials;Amorphous materials;Magnetic sensors;Sputtering;Lithography;Transmission electron microscopy;Annealing","","278","23","13","IEEE","24 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This methodology has two steps. In the first step, tensor product (TP) model transformation is applied, which is capable of transforming a dynamic system model, given over a bounded domain, into TP model form, including polytopic or Takagi-Sugeno model forms. Then, in the second step, Lyapunov's controller design theorems are utilized in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The main novelty of this paper is the development of the TP model transformation of the first step. It does not merely transform to TP model form, but it automatically prepares the transformed model to all the specific conditions required by the LMI design. The LMI design can, hence, be immediately executed on the result of the TP model transformation. The secondary objective of this paper is to discuss that representing a dynamic model in TP model form needs to consider the tradeoff between the modeling accuracy and computational complexity. Having a controller with low computational cost is highly desired in many cases of real implementations. The proposed TP model transformation is developed and specialized for finding a complexity minimized model according to a given modeling accuracy. Detailed control design examples are given.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.822037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282027","","Design methodology;Takagi-Sugeno model;Linear matrix inequalities;Tensile stress;Singular value decomposition;Automatic control;Computational modeling;Computational complexity;Computational efficiency;Control design","","278","1","30","IEEE","5 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MUP works with standard-compliant IEEE 802.11 hardware, does not require changes to applications or higher-level protocols, and can be deployed incrementally. The primary usage scenario for MUP is a multihop community wireless mesh network, where cost of the radios and battery consumption are not limiting factors.

However, some modules degrade or even fail when operating outdoors for extended periods. To reduce the degradation, and the number of failures, extensive research is needed on the performance of PV modules. The aim of this study was to establish a photovoltaic degradation and failure assessment procedure. This procedure should assess all parameters of PV modules to completely analyze any observed degradation or failure. In this paper some degradation modes of PV modules are discussed and a procedure used to assess these degradation modes is then presented. Results obtained by subjecting Copper Indium Diselenide (CIS), single and triple junction amorphous silicon (a-Si and a-SiGe), Edge-defined Film-fed Growth (EFG) silicon and mono-crystalline silicon (mono-Si) modules to the assessment procedure are presented and discussed. Results obtained indicate that the thin-film modules degrade by up to 50% in performance after an initial outdoor exposure of 130 kWh/m/sup 2/. Visual inspection revealed that both crystalline modules had cracked cells. The mismatch due to the cracked cell in the EFG-Si module, however, was limited by the interconnect busbars. This paper accentuates the importance of characterizing all module performance parameters in order to analyze observed degradation and failure modes.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2004.824831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282165","","Degradation;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Failure analysis;Copper;Indium;Computational Intelligence Society;Amorphous silicon;Transistors;Inspection","","274","","23","IEEE","5 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inference algorithms based on graph cuts and belief propagation yield accurate results, but despite recent advances are often still too slow for practical use. In this paper we present new algorithmic techniques that substantially improve the running time of the belief propagation approach. One of our techniques reduces the complexity of the inference algorithm to be linear rather than quadratic in the number of possible labels for each pixel, which is important for problems such as optical flow or image restoration that have a large label set. A second technique makes it possible to obtain good results with a small fixed number of message passing iterations, independent of the size of the input images. Taken together these techniques speed up the standard algorithm by several orders of magnitude. In practice we obtain stereo, optical flow and image restoration algorithms that are as accurate as other global methods (e.g., using the Middlebury stereo benchmark) while being as fast as local techniques.","1063-6919","0-7695-2158-4","10.1109/CVPR.2004.1315041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315041","","Belief propagation;Image restoration;Image motion analysis;Optical sensors;Costs;Inference algorithms;Markov random fields;Robustness;Pixel;Labeling","","273","14","11","IEEE","19 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose an abstraction based on the definition of a map from the configuration space Q of the robots to a lower dimensional manifold A, whose dimension is independent of the number of robots. In this paper, we focus on planar fully actuated robots. We require that the manifold A has a product structure A=G/spl times/S, where G is a Lie group, which captures the position and orientation of the ensemble in the chosen world coordinate frame, and S is a shape manifold, which is an intrinsic characterization of the team describing the ""shape"" as the area spanned by the robots. We design decoupled controllers for the group and shape variables. We derive controllers for individual robots that guarantee the desired behavior on A. These controllers can be realized by feedback that depends only on the current state of the robot and the state of the manifold A. This has the practical advantage of reducing the communication and sensing that is required and limiting the complexity of individual robot controllers, even for large numbers of robots.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2004.829498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339386","","Robot kinematics;Orbital robotics;Communication system control;Shape control;Robot sensing systems;Robot control;Automatic control;Control systems;Robotics and automation;Motion control","","269","3","22","IEEE","4 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The soil dielectric models commonly used in microwave remote sensing algorithms rarely apply intrinsic bound soil water (BSW) dielectric properties. However, models incorporating these properties could offer additional applicability and accuracy. This paper describes a technique developed for estimating the complex dielectric constant (CDC) for both the BSW and the free soil water (FSW) as separate water constituents present in moist soil. For this purpose, it has been shown that there exist two specific soil moisture regions where alteration in soil dielectric property is generated, exclusively, by either BSW or FSW increments, with their CDCs being constant values. The CDCs of the BSW and FSW are derived through straight line fitting with the help of a measured soil complex refractive index (CRI) as a function of moisture. The term CRI is understood here as a square root of the CDC. In order to distinguish between the two moisture regions, the maximum bound water fraction (MBWF) parameter was introduced, which also can be obtained through straight line fitting, using measured CRIs as a function of moisture over both specific moisture regions. Thus, obtained fittings are known in the literature as the refractive mixing dielectric model (RMDM). Finally, a method for deducing the Debye relaxation parameters for both types of soil water was proposed, with their CDCs being input parameters. It was shown that the soil water CDCs measured only at two frequencies are sufficient for deriving the Debye relaxation parameters. A set of equations representing the RMDM, the Debye formula, and the formulas proposed for deriving the Debye relaxation parameters is designated as the generalized refractive mixing dielectric model (GRMDM). In contrast to all previously known soil dielectric models, the GRMDM allows for CDC prediction beyond the frequency range where the initial soil CDC data are acquired.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.823288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288372","","Frequency;Water;Dielectric measurements;Soil measurements;Soil moisture;Moisture measurement;Microwave bands;Minerals;Remote sensing;Dielectric constant","","268","","38","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

TCC provides a model in which atomic transactions are always the basic unit of parallel work, communication, memory coherence, and memory reference consistency. TCC greatly simplifies parallel software by eliminating the need for synchronization using conventional locks and semaphores, along with their complexities. TCC hardware must combine all writes from each transaction region in a program into a single packet and broadcast this packet to the permanent shared memory state atomically as a large block. This simplifies the coherence hardware because it reduces the need for small, low-latency messages and completely eliminates the need for conventional snoopy cache coherence protocols, as multiple speculatively written versions of a cache line may safely coexist within the system. Meanwhile, automatic, hardware-controlled rollback of speculative transactions resolves any correctness violations that may occur when several processors attempt to read and write the same data simultaneously. The cost of this simplified scheme is higher interprocessor bandwidth. To explore the costs and benefits of TCC, we study the characteristics of an optimal transaction-based memory system, and examine how different design parameters could affect the performance of real systems. Across a spectrum of applications, the TCC model itself did not limit available parallelism. Most applications are easily divided into transactions requiring only small write buffers, on the order of 4-8 KB. The broadcast requirements of TCC are high, but are well within the capabilities of CMPs and small-scale SMPs with high-speed interconnects.","1063-6897","0-7695-2143-6","10.1109/ISCA.2004.1310767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310767","","Computer architecture","","267","28","38","IEEE","12 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response. In this article we present a survey on the work that has been done in the area of intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2004.1269717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269717","","Intrusion detection;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Spread spectrum communication;Network topology;Monitoring;Data security;Computer crime","","267","16","21","IEEE","16 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The problem addressed is the design of a linear filter such that, for all admissible parameter uncertainties and all probabilistic sensor delays, the error state of the filtering process is mean square bounded, and the steady-state variance of the estimation error for each state is not more than the individual prescribed upper bound. We show that the filtering problem under consideration can effectively be solved if there are positive definite solutions to a couple of algebraic Riccati-like inequalities or linear matrix inequalities.

For many applications, a large number of inexpensive sensors is preferable to a few expensive ones. The large number of sensors in a sensor network and most application scenarios preclude hand placement of the sensors. Determining the physical location of the sensors after they have been deployed is known as the problem of localization. We present a localization technique based on a single mobile beacon aware of its position (e.g. by being equipped with a GPS receiver). Sensor nodes receiving beacon packets infer proximity constraints to the mobile beacon and use them to construct and maintain position estimates. The proposed scheme is radio-frequency based, and thus no extra hardware is necessary. The accuracy (on the order of a few meters in most cases) is sufficient for most applications. An implementation is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.","","0-7803-8815-1","10.1109/MAHSS.2004.1392104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392104","","Wireless sensor networks;Global Positioning System;Radio frequency;Computer networks;Pervasive computing;Application software;Hardware;Production;Protocols;Surveillance","","264","","35","IEEE","14 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moisture measurement in oil sample generally gives inconclusive information since oil/paper moisture equilibrium is temperature dependent and takes a long time to be in equilibrium. Direct moisture measurement of paper sample is not practicable for in-service transformers. The measurement and evaluation of the ""dielectric response"" and conductivity is one possible way of diagnosing a transformer insulation condition. In a recent research project, polarization and depolarization current measurement has been used for assessing the condition of oil/paper insulation. The polarization and depolarization current (PDC) analysis is a nondestructive dielectric testing method for determining the conductivity and moisture content of insulation materials in a transformer. On the basis of this analysis it is possible to take further actions like oil-refurbishment, drying or replacement of the winding of the transformer. This paper presents a description of the PDC technique with the physical and mathematical background and some results of PDC measurements on several transformers. Analyses and interpretation of the field test data are also presented in this paper.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2004.1266329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266329","","Polarization;Current measurement;Oil insulation;Power transformer insulation;Aging;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Petroleum;Moisture measurement;Conductivity;Power transformers","","264","","21","IEEE","19 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The frequency estimator is derived from ad hoc reasoning, whereas the timing estimator is based on the maximum-likelihood criterion. Both schemes rely on the repetition of a fixed pilot symbol. Their main feature is that they provide feedforward estimates and allow synchronization in only two OFDM blocks. In contrast to other existing methods, they do not require that the subcarriers of a given user occupy adjacent positions in the signal bandwidth. This makes it possible to interleave subcarriers of different users so as to optimally exploit the frequency diversity of the channel. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are used to assess the performance of the proposed synchronizers. It is found that the degradations due to residual frequency and timing errors are negligible at signal-to-noise ratios of practical interest.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.822699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269978","","Timing;Frequency synchronization;Frequency estimation;Maximum likelihood estimation;OFDM;Bandwidth;Frequency diversity;Performance analysis;Computer simulation;Degradation","","263","3","15","IEEE","3 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we extend the previously presented two-dimensional space-time beamformer design to three-dimensional (3-D), and demonstrate its efficacy using experimental data obtained with a multilayer breast phantom. The breast phantom consists of a homogeneous normal breast tissue simulant covered by a thin layer of skin simulant. A small synthetic malignant tumor is embedded in the breast phantom. We have developed several tumor simulants that yield the range of dielectric contrasts between normal and malignant tissue that are expected in clinical scenarios. A microwave sensor comprised of a synthetic planar array of compact ultrawide-band (UWB) antennas is immersed in a coupling medium above the breast tissue phantom. At each position in the array, the antenna transmits a synthetically generated pulse (1-11 GHz) into the phantom. The received backscatter signals are processed by a data-adaptive algorithm that removes the artifact caused by antenna reverberation and backscatter from the skin-breast interface, followed by 3-D space-time beamforming to image backscattered energy as a function of location. Our investigation includes a numerical (finite difference time domain) and experimental study of the UWB antenna performance in the immersion medium, as well as a study of the influence of malignant-to-normal breast tissue dielectric contrast on dynamic range requirements and tumor detectability. This paper represents the first experimental demonstration of 3-D MIST beamforming in multilayer breast phantoms with malignant-to-normal dielectric contrasts down to 1.5 : 1 for a 4-mm synthetic tumor.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.832686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318781","","Microwave imaging;Array signal processing;Tumors;Nonhomogeneous media;Imaging phantoms;Breast tissue;Breast neoplasms;Dielectrics;Cancer;Ultra wideband antennas","","260","3","37","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While progress has been made in developing miniaturized diagnostic systems, samples are generally processed off-device using labor-intensive and time-consuming traditional sample preparation methods. We present the concept of an integrated programmable general-purpose sample analysis processor (GSAP) architecture where raw samples are routed to separation and analysis functional blocks contained within a single device. Several dielectrophoresis-based methods that could serve as the foundation for building GSAP functional blocks are reviewed including methods for cell and particle sorting, cell focusing, cell ac impedance analysis, cell lysis, and the manipulation of molecules and reagent droplets.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.820535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1258170","","Dielectrophoresis;Instruments;Diseases;Testing;Application software;Cancer;Costs;Paper technology;Performance analysis;Buildings","","259","13","119","IEEE","8 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is commonly defined as an optimization problem involving covariance matrices that represent the scatter within and between clusters. The requirement that one of these matrices be nonsingular limits its application to data sets with certain relative dimensions. We examine a number of optimization criteria, and extend their applicability by using the generalized singular value decomposition to circumvent the nonsingularity requirement. The result is a generalization of discriminant analysis that can be applied even when the sample size is smaller than the dimension of the sample data. We use classification results from the reduced representation to compare the effectiveness of this approach with some alternatives, and conclude with a discussion of their relative merits.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1307007","Linear discriminant analysis;latent semantic indexing;principal component analysis;generalized singular value decomposition;QR decomposition;trace optimization.","Singular value decomposition;Scattering;Vectors;Covariance matrix;Samarium;Data mining;Feature extraction;Matrix decomposition;Indexing;Principal component analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Discriminant Analysis;Documentation;Information Storage and Retrieval;MEDLINE;Natural Language Processing;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sample Size;Sensitivity and Specificity","259","1","21","IEEE","21 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For instance, network security applications must drop packets containing certain malicious Internet worms or computer viruses carried in a packet payload. Content forwarding applications look at the hypertext transport protocol headers and distribute the requests among the servers for load balancing. Packet inspection applications, when deployed at router ports, must operate at wire speeds. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software-based packet monitors to keep up with the line rates. We describe a hardware-based technique using Bloom filters, which can detect strings in streaming data without degrading network throughput. A Bloom filter is a data structure that stores a set of signatures compactly by computing multiple hash functions on each member of the set. This technique queries a database of strings to check for the membership of a particular string. The answer to this query can be false positive but never a false negative. An important property of this data structure is that the computation time involved in performing the query is independent of the number of strings in the database provided the memory used by the data structure scales linearly with the number of strings stored in it. Furthermore, the amount of storage required by the Bloom filter for each string is independent of its length.","1937-4143","","10.1109/MM.2004.1268997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268997","","Inspection;Application software;Data structures;Databases;Information filtering;Information filters;Protocols;Computer security;IP networks;Computer worms","","259","94","12","IEEE","3 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The sea floor at the site is gradually sloped at depths less than 90 m, but the deeper area is steppy, having gradual slopes over large areas that are near critical for diurnal internal waves and steep steps between those areas that account for much of the depth change. Large-amplitude nonlinear internal gravity waves incident on the site from the east were observed to change amplitude, horizontal length scale, and energy when shoaling. Beginning as relatively narrow solitary waves of depression, these waves continued onto the shelf much broadened in horizontal scale, where they were trailed by numerous waves of elevation (alternatively described as oscillations) that first appeared in the continental slope region. Internal gravity waves of both diurnal and semidiurnal tidal frequencies (internal tides) were also observed to propagate into shallow water from deeper water, with the diurnal waves dominating. The internal tides were at times sufficiently nonlinear to break down into bores and groups of high-frequency nonlinear internal waves.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2004.836998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388603","Baroclinic tides;internal waves;nonlinear waves","Tides;Acoustic measurements;Sea measurements;Gravity;Acoustic propagation;Oceans;Water;Sea floor;Frequency;Boring","","259","","29","IEEE","31 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two most common distance metrics in hyperspectral processing are the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and the Euclidean minimum distance (EMD), and each metric possesses distinct mathematical and physical properties. In this paper, we enumerate the characteristics of both metrics, and, based on an exact decomposition of SAM, we derive a technique called band add-on (BAO) that iteratively selects bands to increase the angular separation between two spectra. Unlike other feature selection algorithms, BAO exploits a mathematical decomposition of SAM to incrementally add bands. We extend BAO to the more practical problem of increasing the angular separability between two classes of spectra. This scenario parallels the material identification problem where quite often only a small number (<10) of ground-truth measurements are collected for each material class, and statistical classification methods are inapplicable. Two algorithms for selecting bands and class templates are presented to increase the angular separation between two classes. The techniques are compared with several other metric-based approaches in binary discrimination tests with real data. The results demonstrate that band selection can improve the discrimination of very similar targets, while using only a fraction of the available spectral bands.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.830549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315839","","Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wavelength measurement;Sensor systems;Software libraries;Atmospheric measurements;Algorithm design and analysis;Iterative algorithms;Testing","","259","","31","IEEE","19 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, in the context of lookup table, cluster-based island-style FPGAs (Betz et al. 1997) we look at the effect of lookup table (LUT) size and cluster size (number of LUTs per cluster) on the speed and logic density of an FPGA. We use a fully timing-driven experimental flow (Betz et al. 1997), (Marquardt, 1999) in which a set of benchmark circuits are synthesized into different cluster-based (Betz and Rose, 1997, 1998) and (Marquardt, 1999) logic block architectures, which contain groups of LUTs and flip-flops. Across all architectures with LUT sizes in the range of 2 to 7 inputs, and cluster size from 1 to 10 LUTs, we have experimentally determined the relationship between the number of inputs required for a cluster as a function of the LUT size (K) and cluster size (N). Second, contrary to previous results, we have shown that clustering small LUTs (sizes 2 and 3) produces better area results than what was presented in the past. However, our results also show that the performance of FPGAs with these small LUT sizes is significantly worse (by almost a factor of 2) than larger LUTs. Hence, as measured by area-delay product, or by performance, these would be a bad choice. Also, we have discovered that LUT sizes of 5 and 6 produce much better area results than were previously believed. Finally, our results show that a LUT size of 4 to 6 and cluster size of between 3-10 provides the best area-delay product for an FPGA.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2004.824300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281800","","Table lookup;Field programmable gate arrays;Design automation;Delay;Logic circuits;Very large scale integration;Circuit synthesis;Flip-flops;Area measurement;Logic design","","259","1","30","IEEE","5 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In procedures such as gall bladder removal (laparoscopic cholesystectomy), surgeons insert a camera and long slender tools into the abdomen through small skin incisions to explore the internal cavity and manipulate organs from outside the body as they view their actions on a video display.

One of the most motivating reasons to use simulation is the difficulty of creating a real implementation. In a simulator, the code is contained within a single logical component, which is clearly defined and accessible. On the other hand, creating an implementation requires use of a system with many components, including many that have little or no documentation. The implementation developer must understand not only the routing protocol, but all the system components and their complex interactions. Further, since ad hoc routing protocols are significantly different from traditional routing protocols, a new set of features must be introduced to support the routing protocol. In this paper we describe the event triggers required for AODV operation, the design possibilities and the decisions for our ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol implementation, AODV-UCSB.

We present, BIDE, an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed sequences without candidate maintenance. We adopt a novel sequence closure checking scheme called bidirectional extension, and prunes the search space more deeply compared to the previous algorithms by using the BackScan pruning method and the Scan-Skip optimization technique.

Using fault injection, we determined that fewer than 15% of single bit corruptions in processor state result in software visible errors. These failures were analyzed to identify the most vulnerable portions of the processor, which were then protected using simple low-overhead techniques. This resulted in a 75% reduction in failures. Building upon the failure modes seen in the microarchitecture, fault injections into software were performed to investigate the level of masking that the software layer provides.

That is, given a desired fundamental output voltage, the problem is to find the switching times (angles) that produce the fundamental while not generating specifically chosen harmonics. In contrast to the well known work of Patel and Hoft and others, here all possible solutions to the problem are found. This is done by first converting the transcendental equations that specify the harmonic elimination problem into an equivalent set of polynomial equations. Then, using the mathematical theory of resultants, all solutions to this equivalent problem can be found. In particular, it is shown that there are new solutions that have not been previously reported in the literature. The complete solutions for both unipolar and bipolar switching patterns to eliminate the fifth and seventh harmonics are given. Finally, the unipolar case is again considered where the fifth, seventh, 11th, and 13th harmonics are eliminated along with corroborative experimental results.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.823207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271333","","Equations;Pulse width modulation inverters;Switching converters;Power system harmonics;Pulse width modulation;Voltage;Polynomials;Switching loss;Power generation","","256","1","13","IEEE","8 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An approach to this data management problem is the use of sensor database systems, exemplified by TinyDB and Cougar, which allow users to perform aggregation queries such as MIN, COUNT and AVG on a sensor network. Due to power and range constraints, centralized approaches are generally impractical, so most systems use in-network aggregation to reduce network traffic. However, these aggregation strategies become bandwidth-intensive when combined with the fault-tolerant, multipath routing methods often used in these environments. For example, duplicate-sensitive aggregates such as SUM cannot be computed exactly using substantially less bandwidth than explicit enumeration. To avoid this expense, we investigate the use of approximate in-network aggregation using small sketches. Our contributions are as follows: 1) we generalize well known duplicate-insensitive sketches for approximating COUNT to handle SUM, 2) we present and analyze methods for using sketches to produce accurate results with low communication and computation overhead, and 3) we present an extensive experimental validation of our methods.","1063-6382","0-7695-2065-0","10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320018","","Sensor systems;Fault tolerant systems;Data mining;Power system management;Database systems;Telecommunication traffic;Fault tolerance;Routing;Aggregates;Bandwidth","","255","1","23","IEEE","9 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An interleaved subcarrier-assignment scheme is preferred because it provides maximum frequency diversity and increases the capacity in frequency-selective fading channels. The subcarriers are overlapping, but orthogonal to each other such that there is no intercarrier interference (ICI). Carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) between the transmitter and the receiver destroy the orthogonality and introduces ICI, resulting in multiple-access interference. This paper exploits the inner structure of the signals for CFO estimation in the uplink of interleaved OFDMA systems. A new uplink signal model is presented, and an estimation algorithm based on the signal structure is proposed for estimating the CFOs of all users using only one OFDMA block. Diversity schemes are also presented to improve the estimation performance.

For construction, we argue that an expander can he maintained dynamically with constant operations per addition. The key technical ingredient of our approach is a deep result of stochastic processes indicating that samples taken from consecutive steps of a random walk can achieve statistical properties similar to independent sampling (if the second eigenvalue of the transition matrix is hounded away from 1, which translates to good expansion of the network; such connectivity is desired, and believed to hold, in every reasonable network and network model).

In simulations, all algorithms have adapted the gait pattern toward the desired one, which led to a greater than 40% reduction of interaction torques.

"Morphology and experimental hydrodynamics of fish fin control surfaces","G. V. Lauder; E. G.

This diversity includes thousands of different fin designs which are largely the product of natural selection for locomotor performance. Fish fins can be grouped into two major categories: median and paired fins. Fins are typically supported at their base by a series of segmentally arranged bony or cartilaginous elements, and fish have extensive muscular control over fin conformation. Recent experimental hydrodynamic investigation of fish fin function in a diversity of freely swimming fish (including sharks, sturgeon, trout, sunfish, and surfperch) has demonstrated the role of fins in propulsion and maneuvering. Fish pectoral fins generate either separate or linked vortex rings during propulsion, and the lateral forces generated by pectoral fins are of similar magnitudes to thrust force during slow swimming. Yawing maneuvers involve differentiation of hydrodynamic function between left and right fins via vortex ring reorientation. Low-aspect ratio pectoral fins in sharks function to alter body pitch and induce vertical maneuvers through conformational changes of the fin trailing edge. The dorsal fin of fish displays a diversity of hydrodynamic function, from a discrete thrust-generating propulsor acting independently from the body, to a stabilizer generating only side forces. Dorsal fins play an active role in generating off-axis forces during maneuvering. Locomotor efficiency may be enhanced when the caudal fin intercepts the dorsal fin wake. The caudal fin of fish moves in a complex three-dimensional manner and evidence for thrust vectoring of caudal fin forces is presented for sturgeon which appear to have active control of the angle of vortices shed from the tail. Fish are designed to be unstable and are constantly using their control surfaces to generate opposing and balancing forces in addition to thrust. Lessons from fish for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) design include: 1) location of multiple control surfaces distributed widely about the center of mass, 2) design of control surfaces that have a high degree of three-dimensional motion through a flexible articulation with the body, 3) the ability to modulate fin surface conformation, and 4) the simultaneous use of numerous control surfaces including locating some fin elements in the downstream wake generated by other fins. The ability to manufacture an AUV that takes advantage of these design features is currently limited by the nature of available materials and mechanical drive trains. But future developments in polymer artificial muscle technology will provide a new approach to propulsor design that will permit construction of biomimetic propulsors with conformational and articulational flexibility similar to that of fish fins.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2004.833219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353410","Fin;fish;hydrodynamics;locomotion;particle image velocimetry","Hydrodynamics;Marine animals;Surface morphology;Motion control;Weight control;Propulsion;Force control;Displays;Tail;Underwater vehicles","","250","","83","IEEE","8 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spontaneous emission from inline optical amplifiers is assumed to be the dominant noise source in all cases. Coherent detection allows use of two degrees of freedom per polarization, and its spectral efficiency limits are several b/s/Hz in typical terrestrial systems, even considering nonlinear effects. Using either constant-intensity modulation or direct detection, only one degree of freedom per polarization can be used, significantly reducing spectral efficiency. Using binary modulation, regardless of detection technique, spectral efficiency cannot exceed 1 b/s/Hz per polarization. When the number of signal and/or noise photons is small, the particle nature of photons must be considered. The quantum-limited spectral efficiency for coherent detection is slightly smaller than the classical capacity, but that for direct detection is 0.3 b/s/Hz higher than its classical counterpart. Various binary and nonbinary modulation techniques, in conjunction with appropriate detection techniques, are compared in terms of their spectral efficiencies and signal-to-noise ratio requirements, assuming amplified spontaneous emission is the dominant noise source. These include a) pulse-amplitude modulation with direct detection, b) differential phase-shift keying with interferometric detection, c) phase-shift keying with coherent detection, and d) quadrature-amplitude modulation with coherent detection.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2004.826575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303574","","Wavelength division multiplexing;Phase detection;Pulse modulation;Spontaneous emission;Optical noise;Polarization;Signal to noise ratio;Phase modulation;Optical propagation;Nonlinear optics","","250","7","79","IEEE","7 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proceedings.","7 Jun 2004","2004","","","224","","Summary form only given. In many sensor network applications the major traffic pattern consists of data collected from several source nodes to a sink through a unidirectional tree. We propose DMAC, an energy efficient and low latency MAC that is designed and optimized for such data gathering trees in wireless sensor networks. We first show that previously proposed MAC protocols for sensor networks that utilize activation/sleep duty cycles suffer from a data forwarding interruption problem, whereby not all nodes on a multihop path to the sink are notified of data delivery in progress, resulting in significant sleep delay. DMAC is designed to solve the interruption problem and allow continuous packet forwarding by giving the sleep schedule of a node an offset that depends upon its depth on the tree. DMAC also adjusts the duty cycles adaptively according to the traffic load in the network. We further propose a data prediction mechanism and the use of more-to-send (MTS) packets in order to alleviate problems pertaining to channel contention and collisions. Our simulation results show that by exploiting the application-specific structure of data gathering trees in sensor networks, DMAC provides significant energy savings and latency reduction while ensuring high data reliability.","","0-7695-2132-0","10.1109/IPDPS.2004.1303264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1303264","","Energy efficiency;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Delay;Telecommunication traffic;Media Access Protocol;Sleep;Fires;Access protocols;Throughput","","250","9","13","IEEE","7 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The obstruction phenomenon due to the human bodies is characterized in duration and amplitude from the propagation characteristics (attenuation, coherence bandwidth) by means of an appropriate method. The results highlight and quantify the problems due to the human activity for high data rate communication systems. When the direct path is shadowed by a person, the attenuation generally increases by more than 20 dB, for a median duration of about 100 ms for an activity of one to five persons and 300 ms for 11-15 persons. Globally, the channel is ""unavailable"" for about 1% or 2% of the time in the presence of one to five persons.

Asymptotic statistical results are derived for all the estimated parameters. The amplitude estimate is seen to be optimal, whereas the phase parameters are, in general, suboptimal. Of the four phase parameter estimates, two approach optimality as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity. The other two have mean-square errors that are within 50% of the theoretical lower bounds for high SNR. Simulations are provided to support the theoretical results.

Within this framework, developing some ideas sprang in the 1960s, during the 1980s, the positive realization problem was reformulated in terms of a geometric condition which was recently exploited as a tool for finding the solution to the existence problem and providing partial answers to the minimality problem.

G-NPC, which derives from a natural extension of NPC, has a neural-like architecture and also features the presence of constraint neurons modeled by ideal diodes with infinite slope in the conducting region. By using the Clarke's generalized gradient of the involved functions, G-NPC is shown to obey a gradient system of differential inclusions, and its dynamical behavior and optimization capabilities, both for convex and nonconvex problems, are rigorously analyzed in the framework of nonsmooth analysis and the theory of differential inclusions. In the special important case of linear and quadratic programming problems, salient dynamical features of G-NPC, namely the presence of sliding modes , trajectory convergence in finite time, and the ability to compute the exact optimal solution of the problem being modeled, are uncovered and explained in the developed analytical framework.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2004.834493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333224","","Neural networks;Functional programming;Dynamic programming;Neurons;Diodes;Quadratic programming;Analog circuits;Computational modeling;Circuit simulation","","244","","26","IEEE","13 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The point target response is first modeled in the space-time domain and then transformed to the frequency domain by the method of stationary phase giving the point target reference spectrum. In the reference spectrum, two phasor functions can be identified, the first one resembling some quasi-monostatic contribution and the second one being a bistatic deformation phasor transforming into an elliptic arc in the spatial domain. The multiplication of the two phasors in the frequency domain transforms into a convolution like operation in the space-time domain, indicating that the bistatic dataset can be expressed as a convolution like (range and azimuth variant) mapping of a monostatic dataset. In this regard, the paper extends the solution for the constant offset case known from the geophysical literature (associated with ""Rocca's smile operator"") showing that this case is a specialization of the more general one considered in this work.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.835295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344155","","Transmitters;Azimuth;Synthetic aperture radar;Geometry;Frequency domain analysis;Solid modeling;History;Target tracking;Convolution;Principal component analysis","","243","2","8","IEEE","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time- and frequency-domain simulation of a 90-W LDMOS PA output using this novel neural-network model exhibit a good agreement between the RVTDNN behavioral model's predicted results and measured ones along with a good generality. Moreover, dynamic AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics obtained using the proposed model demonstrated that the RVTDNN can track and account for the memory effects of the PAs well. These characteristics also point out that the small-signal response of the LDMOS PA is more affected by the memory effects than the PAs large-signal response when it is driven by 3G signals. This RVTDNN model requires a significantly reduced complexity and shorter processing time in the analysis and training procedures, when driven with complex modulated and highly varying envelope signals such as 3G signals, than previously published neural-network-based PA models.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.823583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1273746","","Power amplifiers;Neural networks;Autoregressive processes;Power system modeling;Predictive models;Frequency measurement;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Polynomials;Solid state circuits","","242","4","25","IEEE","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This structure is in essence a composite right/left-handed (CRLH) microstrip structure incorporating varactor diodes for fixed-frequency voltage-controlled operation. Angle scanning at a fixed frequency is achieved by modulating the capacitances of the structure by adjusting the (uniform) bias voltage applied to the varactors. Beamwidth tuning is obtained by making the structure nonuniform by application of a nonuniform bias voltage distribution of the varactors. A rigorous analysis based on an extension of the CRLH concept is proposed and the corresponding dispersion curves, obtained by equivalent-circuit formulas with LC parameters extracted from full-wave simulation, are shown. A 30-cell LW antenna structure, incorporating both series and shunt varactors for optimal impedance matching and maximal tuning range, is designed. This prototype exhibits continuous scanning capability from 50/spl deg/ to -49/spl deg/ by tuning the bias voltages from 0 to 21 V at 3.33 GHz. A maximum gain of 18 dBi at broadside is also achieved. In addition, it provides half-power beamwidth variation of up to 200% with comparison to the case of uniform biasing. The effect of intermodulation due to the nonlinearity of the varactors is shown to be negligible for antenna applications. The antenna is tested in a 10-Mb/s binary phase-shift key transmission link and successful recovery of the baseband data is demonstrated.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2004.838302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1366539","Beamwidth tuning;composite right/left-handed (CRLH) transmission line (TL);electronic scanning;leaky-wave (LW) antenna;left-handed metamaterials (LHMs);nonuniform TL;varactor diode","Transmission lines;Leaky wave antennas;Varactors;Voltage;Transmitting antennas;Microstrip;Diodes;Frequency;Capacitance;Tuning","","242","20","34","IEEE","13 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Also distribution management system (DMS) have advanced and include more sophisticated analysis tools. The combination of these developments is providing a platform for development of distribution system state estimation (DSE). A branch-current-based three-phase state estimation algorithm for distribution systems has been developed and tested. This method chooses the magnitude and phase angle of the branch current as the state variables. Because of the limited number of real-time measurements in the distribution system, the state estimator can not acquire enough real-time measurements for convergence, so pseudo-measurements are necessary for distribution system state estimator. The load estimated at every node from the AMR systems is used as a pseudo-measurement for the state estimator. The algorithm has been tested on three IEEE radial test feeders. In addition to this new strategy for DSE, another issue is meter-placement. This topic includes the type of measurement as well as the location of the measurement. Our results show the impact of these two issues on accuracy. Several general meter rules based on this analysis are outlined.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2003.821426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266570","","State estimation;SCADA systems;Meter reading;Automatic meter reading;Real time systems;Jacobian matrices;Testing;Instruments;Loss measurement;Voltage","","240","1","13","IEEE","19 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the high initial investment impedes its wide commercialization. This paper proposes a cost-effective single-stage inverter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in combination with one-cycle control (OCC) for photovoltaic power generation. This control scheme is based on the output current-adjusting feature of OCC. The output current of the inverter can be adjusted according to the voltage of the photovoltaic (PV) array so as to extract the maximum power from it. In the mean time, OCC guarantees that the output current is proportional and in phase with the grid voltage. All these are accomplished in one power stage and a simple control circuit. No detection and calculation of power are needed. Compared with previously proposed approaches, this method is much more efficient and cost-effective and yet exhibits excellent performance. The principle is explained qualitatively and extensive experiments have been carried out to verify the proposed method.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.833458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331490","","Inverters;Solar power generation;Photovoltaic systems;Voltage;Renewable energy resources;Solar energy;Investments;Impedance;Commercialization;Circuits","","238","6","6","IEEE","3 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is further complicated by the variety of applications that these sensors are being required to fulfill. A review of the motivation for the development of these sensors is followed by a discussion of the consequent implications for waveform design and limitations on system architecture. Other practical considerations such as available semiconductor technology, packaging, and assembly techniques are reviewed, and results are presented for conventional surface-mount plastic packages illustrating their usefulness in the greater than 20-GHz frequency range. Suitable antenna technology for wide-band transmission is presented that is compliant with the specific restrictions stipulated in the FCC ruling.

Then, we study the effects of carrier frequency offset on their performance and throughput. We further compare the performance and complexity of uncoded and coded transmissions over random dispersive channels, including Rayleigh fading channels, as well as practical HIPERLAN/2 indoor and outdoor channels. We establish that unlike OFDM, uncoded block transmissions with ZP enjoy maximum diversity and coding gains within the class of linearly precoded block transmissions. Analysis and computer simulations confirm the considerable edge of ZP-only in terms of PAR, robustness to carrier frequency offset, and uncoded performance, at the price of slightly increased complexity. In the coded case, ZP is preferable when the code rate is high (e.g., 3/4), while coded OFDM is to be preferred in terms of both performance and complexity when the code rate is low (e.g., 1/2) and the error-correcting capability is enhanced.

The primary application of this novel FSK modulation/demodulation technique is to send data to inductively powered wireless biomedical implants at data rates in excess of 1 Mbps, using comparable carrier frequencies. This method can also be used in other applications such as radio-frequency identification tags and contactless smartcards by adding a back telemetry link. The inductive link utilizes a series-parallel inductive-capacitance tank combination on the transmitter side to provide more than 5 MHz of bandwidth. The demodulator circuits detect data bits by directly measuring the duration of each received FSK carrier cycle, as well as derive a constant frequency clock, which is used to sample the data bits.

To address these problems, we have formulated the tracking problem in terms of local bundle adjustment and have developed a method for establishing image correspondences that can equally well handle short and wide-baseline matching.

We present taxonomy that developers and researchers can use to analyze and differentiate recent developments in runtime software fault-monitoring approaches. The taxonomy categorizes the various runtime monitoring research by classifying the elements that are considered essential for building a monitoring system, i.e., the specification language used to define properties; the monitoring mechanism that oversees the program's execution; and the event handler that captures and communicates monitoring results.

The sensorless control system is based on a model reference adaptive system (MRAS) observer to estimate the rotational speed. In order to tune the MRAS observer and compensate for the parameter variation and uncertainties, a separate estimation of the speed is obtained from the rotor slot harmonics using an algorithm for spectral analysis. This algorithm can track fast dynamic changes in the rotational speed, with high accuracy. Two back-to-back pulse-width-modulated (PWM) inverters are used to interface the induction generator with the grid. The front-end converter is also vector controlled. The dc link voltage is regulated using a PI fuzzy controller. The proposed sensorless control strategy has been experimentally verified on a 2.5-kW experimental set up with an induction generator driven by a wind turbine emulator. The emulation of the wind turbine is performed using a novel strategy that allows the emulation of high-order wind turbine models, preserving all of the dynamic characteristics.

The illumination effectively decreases the threshold voltage of the device and increases the apparent subthreshold swing, while the field-effect mobility of the charge carriers in the polymer channel is unchanged. We have observed full recovery of our devices after the illumination is removed at room temperature. These observations are explained in terms of the photogeneration of excitons due to the absorbed photons. The photogenerated excitons subsequently diffuse and dissociate into free charge carriers, thereby enhancing the carrier density in the channel of the device. We have found broadband responsivities of approximately 0.7 mA/W for devices biased in the strong-accumulation regime and gate-to-source voltage-independent photosensitivities of approximately 10/sup 3/ for devices in the off-state.

In the PTS technique, the data block to be transmitted is partitioned into disjoint subblocks and the subblocks are combined using phase factors to minimize PAPR. As ordinary PTS technique requires an exhaustive search over all combinations of allowed phase factors, the search complexity increases exponentially with the number of subblocks. In the proposed technique, a gradient descent search is performed to find the phase factors.

Since partial discharges are considered to be the main cause of the reliability loss, new enamel insulations for magnet wires are being developed in order to withstand better stress amplification. The electrical characterization of these insulating materials is often carried out through aging tests which may provide estimation of life under different stress levels and conditions. However, deeper investigation of aging phenomena due to supply voltage waveforms is needed, especially regarding the relation between aging factors and stress conditions. This paper deals with this topic, showing experimental evidences of relation between partial discharge quantities (e.g., inception voltage, repetition frequency, amplitude) and electrical properties, associated with charge accumulation, which can be directly evaluated through space charge measurements. Characterization of insulating materials and comparison of materials candidate for application in power electronic waveform environment can be carried out resorting to the methodology proposed here. This approach can provide, therefore, a useful feedback to wire manufacturers regarding, e.g., the choice of additive nature and enamel components for magnet wires in power-electronic controlled motors.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2004.1306718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306718","","Pulse width modulation;Space charge;Partial discharges;Wires;Voltage;Stress;Magnetic materials;Aging;Power electronics;Dielectrics and electrical insulation","","232","","28","IEEE","4 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Statistical iterative reconstruction with accurate modeling of the noise, rather than a filtered back-projection (FBP) with low-pass filtering, is one way to deal with the problem. Estimating a noise-free sinogram to satisfy the FBP reconstruction for the Radon transform is another way. The benefits of the latter include a higher computation efficiency, more uniform spatial resolution in the reconstructed image, and less modification of the current machine configurations. In a clinic X-ray CT system, the acquired raw data must be calibrated, in addition to the logarithmic transform, to achieve the high diagnostic image quality. The calibrated projection data or sinogram no longer follow a compound Poisson distribution in general, but are close to a Gaussian distribution with signal-dependent variance. In this paper, we first investigated a relatively accurate statistical model for the sinogram data, based on several phantom experiments. Then we developed a penalized likelihood method to smooth the sinogram, which led to a set of nonlinear equations that can be solved by iterated conditional mode (ICM) algorithm within a reasonable computing time. The method was applied to several experimental datasets acquired at 120 kVp, 10 mA/20 mA/50 mA protocols with a GE HiSpeed multi-slice detector CT scanner and demonstrated a significant noise suppression without noticeable sacrifice of the spatial resolution.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2004.834824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344369","","Smoothing methods;Computed tomography;Image reconstruction;X-ray imaging;Low pass filters;Spatial resolution;Optical imaging;Filtering;Image quality;Gaussian distribution","","230","2","20","IEEE","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this tutorial we give an introduction to the use of video traces in networking studies. First we give a brief overview of digital video and its encoding and playout. Then we present a library of traces of single- and two-layer encoded video. We discuss the statistical properties of the traces and the resulting implications for the transport of video over networks. Finally we discuss the factors that need to be considered when using video traces in network performance evaluations.

Block migration (e.g., D-NUCA and NuRapid) reduces average hit latency by migrating frequently used blocks towards the lower-latency banks. Transmission Line Caches (TLC) use on-chip transmission lines to provide low latency to all banks. Traditional stride-based hardware prefetching strives to tolerate, rather than reduce, latency. Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) present additional challenges. First, CMPs often share the on-chip L2 cache, requiring multiple ports to provide sufficient bandwidth. Second, multiple threads mean multiple working sets, which compete for limited on-chip storage. Third, sharing code and data interferes with block migration, since one processor's low-latency bank is another processor's high-latency bank. In this paper, we develop L2 cache designs for CMPs that incorporate these three latency management techniques. We use detailed full-system simulation to analyze the performance trade-offs for both commercial and scientific workloads. First, we demonstrate that block migration is less effective for CMPs because 40-60% of L2 cache hits in commercial workloads are satisfied in the central banks, which are equally far from all processors. Second, we observe that although transmission lines provide low latency, contention for their restricted bandwidth limits their performance. Third, we show stride-based prefetching between L1 and L2 caches alone improves performance by at least as much as the other two techniques. Finally, we present a hybrid design-combining all three techniques-that improves performance by an additional 2% to 19% over prefetching alone.","1072-4451","0-7695-2126-6","10.1109/MICRO.2004.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1551004","","Wire;Delay;Transmission lines;Prefetching;Bandwidth;Technology management;Hardware;Yarn;Analytical models;Performance analysis","","228","17","49","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The technique is based on a heteroscedastic two-class technique which utilizes the so-called Chernoff criterion, and successfully extends the well-known linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The latter, which is based on the Fisher criterion, is incapable of dealing with heteroscedastic data in a proper way. For the two-class case, the between-class scatter is generalized so to capture differences in (co)variances. It is shown that the classical notion of between-class scatter can be associated with Euclidean distances between class means. From this viewpoint, the between-class scatter is generalized by employing the Chernoff distance measure, leading to our proposed heteroscedastic measure. Finally, using the results from the two-class case, a multiclass extension of the Chernoff criterion is proposed. This criterion combines separation information present in the class mean as well as the class covariance matrices. Extensive experiments and a comparison with similar dimension reduction techniques are presented.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288523","Linear dimension reduction;linear discriminant analysis;Fisher criterion;Chernoff distance;Chernoff criterion.","Linear discriminant analysis;Scattering;Covariance matrix;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Arithmetic;Distributed decision making;Euclidean distance;Density measurement","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Linear Models;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","228","1","24","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to investigate the effects of seal robots on elderly people, their mood was evaluated using face scales (which express moods by identifying the appropriate facial illustration) and questionnaires. Changes in reaction to stress in the elderly was measured using urinary tests. In addition, stress of nursing staff was investigated. Their mental state was evaluated using a ""burnout scale."" The day service center was provided with seal robots for five weeks. As a result, the feelings of elderly people improved by the interaction with the robots.

The lognormal sum distribution is not known in the closed form and is difficult to compute numerically. Several approximations to the distribution have been proposed and employed in applications. Some widely used approximations are based on the assumption that a lognormal sum is well approximated by a lognormal random variable. Here, a new paradigm for approximating lognormal sum distributions is presented. A linearizing transform is used with a linear minimax approximation to determine an optimal lognormal approximation to a lognormal sum distribution. The accuracies of the new method are quantitatively compared to the accuracies of some well-known approximations. In some practical cases, the optimal lognormal approximation is several orders of magnitude more accurate than previous approximations. Efficient numerical computation of the lognormal characteristic function is also considered.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.823494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275712","","Minimax techniques;Probability distribution;Random variables;Wireless communication;Shadow mapping;Linear approximation;Interchannel interference;Distributed computing;Distribution functions;Fourier transforms","","227","1","21","IEEE","22 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the novel features of our approach is that we explicitly account for heading rate and velocity input constraints. For a UAV, the velocity is constrained to lie between two positive constants, and therefore presents particular challenges for the control design. We propose a control Lyapunov function (CLF) approach. We first introduce a CLF for the input constrained case, and then construct the set of all constrained inputs that are feasible with respect to this CLF. The control input is then selected from this ""feasible"" set. The proposed approach is applied to a simulation scenario, where the UAV is assigned to transition through several targets in the presence of multiple dynamic threats.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2004.826956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1327609","","Trajectory;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Lyapunov method;Control systems;Kinematics;Velocity control;Nonlinear systems;Mobile robots;Control design;Vehicle dynamics","","226","2","20","IEEE","30 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spontaneous neuronal activity emerged toward the end of the first week in vitro and from then on exhibited periods of elevated firing rates, lasting for a few days up to weeks, which were largely uncorrelated among different recording sites. On a time scale of seconds to minutes, network activity typically displayed an ongoing repetition of distinctive firing patterns, including short episodes of synchronous firing at many sites ( network bursts). Network bursts were highly variable in their individual spatio-temporal firing patterns but showed a remarkably stable underlying probabilistic structure (obtained by summing consecutive bursts) on a time scale of hours. On still longer time scales, network bursts evolved gradually, with a significant broadening (to about 2 s) in the third week in vitro, followed by a drastic shortening after about one month in vitro. Bursts at this age were characterized by highly synchronized onsets reaching peak firing levels within less than ca. 60 ms. This pattern persisted for the rest of the culture period. Throughout the recording period, active sites showed highly persistent temporal relationships within network bursts. These longitudinal recordings of network firing have, thus, brought to light a reproducible pattern of complex changes in spontaneous firing dynamics of bursts during the development of isolated cortical neurons into synaptically interconnected networks.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.827936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344208","","Intelligent networks;Neural networks;Neurons;In vitro;Bioelectric phenomena;Calcium;Biological neural networks;Cerebral cortex;Morphology;Pattern analysis","Action Potentials;Adaptation, Physiological;Animals;Biological Clocks;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells, Cultured;Cerebral Cortex;Cerebral Cortex;Microelectrodes;Nerve Net;Nerve Net;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Time Factors","226","4","57","IEEE","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We observe that continuous device scaling and increasing temperatures are making lifetime reliability targets even harder to meet. However, current methodologies for qualifying lifetime reliability are overly conservative since they assume worst-case operating conditions. This paper makes the case that the continued use of such methodologies will significantly and unnecessarily constrain performance. Instead, lifetime reliability awareness at the microarchitectural design stage can mitigate this problem, by designing processors that dynamically adapt in response to the observed usage to meet a reliability target. We make two specific contributions. First, we describe an architecture-level model and its implementation, called RAMP, that can dynamically track lifetime reliability, responding to changes in application behavior. RAMP is based on state-of-the-art device models for different wear-out mechanisms. Second, we propose dynamic reliability management (DRM) - a technique where the processor can respond to changing application behavior to maintain its lifetime reliability target. In contrast to current worst-case behavior based reliability qualification methodologies, DRM allows processors to be qualified for reliability at lower (but more likely) operating points than the worst case. Using RAMP, we show that this can save cost and/or improve performance, that dynamic voltage scaling is an effective response technique for DRM, and that dynamic thermal management neither subsumes nor is subsumed by DRM.","1063-6897","0-7695-2143-6","10.1109/ISCA.2004.1310781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310781","","Microprocessors;Thermal management;Manufacturing processes;Temperature;Microarchitecture;Process design;Target tracking;Maintenance;Qualifications;Costs","","226","7","24","IEEE","12 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this setting, we introduce the class of LAttice Space-Time (LAST) codes. We show that these codes achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff defined by Zheng and Tse under generalized minimum Euclidean distance lattice decoding. Our scheme is based on a generalization of Erez and Zamir mod-Lambda scheme to the MIMO case. In our construction the scalar ""scaling"" of Erez-Zamir and Costa Gaussian ""dirty-paper"" schemes is replaced by the minimum mean-square error generalized decision-feedback equalizer (MMSE-GDFE). This result settles the open problem posed by Zheng and Tse on the construction of explicit coding and decoding schemes that achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. Moreover, our results shed more light on the structure of optimal coding/decoding techniques in delay-limited MIMO channels, and hence, open the door for novel approaches for space-time code constructions. In particular, 1) we show that MMSE-GDFE plays a fundamental role in approaching the limits of delay-limited MIMO channels in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, unlike the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel case and 2) our random coding arguments represent a major departure from traditional space-time code designs based on the rank and/or mutual information design criteria.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.828067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302284","","Lattices;Decoding;MIMO;AWGN;Delay;Space time codes;Signal to noise ratio;Signal design;Euclidean distance;Decision feedback equalizers","","225","4","33","IEEE","1 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various types of noise (e.g., photon, electronics, and quantization) often contribute to degrade medical images; the overall noise is generally assumed to be additive with a zero-mean, constant-variance Gaussian distribution. However, statistical analysis suggests that the noise variance could be better modeled by a nonlinear function of the image intensity depending on external parameters related to the image acquisition protocol.

Since we are concerned with the overall network dimensioning problem, we take into account the manufacturing cost of the hardware as well as the battery energy of the nodes. A homogeneous sensor network consists of identical nodes, while a heterogeneous sensor network consists of two or more types of nodes (organized into hierarchical clusters). We first consider single hop clustered sensor networks (nodes use single hopping to reach the cluster heads). We use LEACH as the representative single hop homogeneous network, and a sensor network with two types of nodes as a representative single hop heterogeneous network. For multihop homogeneous networks (nodes use multihopping to reach the cluster head), we propose and analyze a multihop variant of LEACH that we call M-LEACH. We show that M-LEACH has better energy efficiency than LEACH in many cases. We then compare the cost of multihop clustered sensor networks with M-LEACH as the representative homogeneous network, and a sensor network with two types of nodes (that use in-cluster multi-hopping) as the representative heterogeneous network.","","0-7803-8533-0","10.1109/ICC.2004.1313223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1313223","","Hardware;Batteries;Costs;Spread spectrum communication;Base stations;Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Routing;Contracts;Computer networks","","222","","8","IEEE","26 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the first stage of the study, we use SVMs for crop classification and analyze their performance in terms of efficiency and robustness, as compared to extensively used neural and fuzzy methods. Efficiency is assessed by evaluating accuracy and statistical differences in several scenes. Robustness is analyzed in terms of: (1) suitability to working conditions when a feature selection stage is not possible and (2) performance when different levels of Gaussian noise are introduced at their inputs. In the second stage of this work, we analyze the distribution of the support vectors (SVs) and perform sensitivity analysis on the best classifier in order to analyze the significance of the input spectral bands. For classification purposes, six hyperspectral images acquired with the 128-band HyMAP spectrometer during the DAISEX-1999 campaign are used. Six crop classes were labeled for each image. A reduced set of labeled samples is used to train the models, and the entire images are used to assess their performance. Several conclusions are drawn: (1) SVMs yield better outcomes than neural networks regarding accuracy, simplicity, and robustness; (2) training neural and neurofuzzy models is unfeasible when working with high-dimensional input spaces and great amounts of training data; (3) SVMs perform similarly for different training subsets with varying input dimension, which indicates that noisy bands are successfully detected; and (4) a valuable ranking of bands through sensitivity analysis is achieved.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.827262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315837","","Hyperspectral imaging;Performance analysis;Hyperspectral sensors;Crops;Noise robustness;Sensitivity analysis;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Layout;Employee welfare","","222","","113","IEEE","19 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assuming a block fading channel model and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation at the receiver, we design the transmitted signal to optimize two criteria: MMSE and the conditional mutual information between the MIMO channel and the received signal. Our analysis is based on the recently proposed virtual channel representation, which corresponds to beamforming in fixed virtual directions and exposes the structure and the true degrees of freedom in the correlated channel. However, our design framework is applicable to more general channel models, which include known channel models, such as the transmit and receive correlated model, as special cases. We show that optimal signaling is in a block form, where the block length depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as the channel correlation matrix. The block signal corresponds to transmitting beams in successive symbol intervals along fixed virtual transmit angles, whose powers are determined by (nonidentical) water filling solutions based on the optimization criteria. Our analysis shows that these water filling solutions identify exactly which virtual transmit angles are important for channel estimation. In particular, at low SNR, the block length reduces to one, and all the power is transmitted on the beam corresponding to the strongest transmit angle, whereas at high SNR, the block length has a maximum length equal to the number of active virtual transmit angles, and the power is assigned equally to all active transmit angles. Consequently, from a channel estimation viewpoint, a faster fading rate can be tolerated at low SNRs relative to higher SNRs.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261339","","Signal design;MIMO;Fading;Filling;Channel estimation;Statistics;Transmitters;Mean square error methods;Estimation error;Design optimization","","222","1","23","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our so-called Zigzag approach, we propose a method for clustering peers into a hierarchy called the administrative organization for easy management, and a method for building the multicast tree atop this hierarchy for efficient content transmission. In Zigzag, the multicast tree has a height logarithmic with the number of clients, and a node degree bounded by a constant. This helps reduce the number of processing hops on the delivery path to a client while avoiding network bottlenecks. Consequently, the end-to-end delay is kept small. Although one could build a tree satisfying such properties easily, an efficient control protocol between the nodes must be in place to maintain the tree under the effects of network dynamics. Zigzag handles such situations gracefully, requiring a constant amortized worst-case control overhead. Especially, failure recovery is done regionally with impact on, at most, a constant number of existing clients and with mostly no burden on the server.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.818803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1258120","","Streaming media;Peer to peer computing;Delay;Multicast protocols;Internet;Large-scale systems;Network servers;IP networks;Computer science;Content management","","222","","17","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, artifacts that may arise in 3-D TV systems are addressed, such as keystone distortion, depth-plane curvature, puppet theater effect, cross talk, cardboard effect, shear distortion, picket-fence effect, and image flipping.

This allows to verify whether a set of services selected for composition satisfies the QoS requirements for the whole composition. The aggregation performed builds upon abstract composition patterns, which represent basic structural elements of a composition, like sequence, loop, or parallel execution. This work focusses on workflow management environments. We define composition patterns that are derived from Van der Aalst's et al. comprehensive collection of workflow patterns.

We found that, whatever the frequency and the induction waveform, the loss behavior can be quantitatively assessed within the theoretical framework of the statistical loss model. The prediction requires a limited set of preemptive experimental data, depending on whether or not the arbitrary J(t) waveform is endowed with local slope inversions (i.e., minor hysteresis loops) in its periodic time behavior. In the absence of minor loops, such data reduce, for any peak polarization value J/sub p/, to the loss figures obtained under sinusoidal J(t) at two different frequency values. In the presence of minor loops of semiamplitude J/sub m/, the two-frequency loss experiment should be carried out for both peak polarization values J/sub p/ and J/sub m/. Additional knowledge of the quasi-static major loop, to be used for modeling hysteresis loss, does improve the accuracy of the prediction method. A more general approach to loss in soft magnetic laminations is obtained in this way, the only limitation apparently being the onset of skin effect at high frequencies.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2004.830510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1325347","","Magnetic losses;Steel;Magnetic hysteresis;Soft magnetic materials;Polarization;Frequency;Lamination;Predictive models;Accuracy;Prediction methods","","221","","21","IEEE","24 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This design is based on assumptions concerning the frequency content of the acceleration of the movement that is measured, the knowledge that the magnitude of the gravity is 1 g and taking into account a fluctuating sensor offset. It is shown that for measuring trunk and pelvis inclination during the functional three-dimensional activity of stacking crates, the inclination error that is made is approximately 2/spl deg/ root-mean square.

For example, several studies have identified clear empirical relationships between class-level coupling and class fault-proneness. A common way to define and measure coupling is through structural properties and static code analysis. However, because of polymorphism, dynamic binding, and the common presence of unused (""dead"") code in commercial software, the resulting coupling measures are imprecise as they do not perfectly reflect the actual coupling taking place among classes at runtime. For example, when using static analysis to measure coupling, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to determine what actual methods can be invoked from a client class if those methods are overridden in the subclasses of the server classes. Coupling measurement has traditionally been performed using static code analysis, because most of the existing work was done on nonobject oriented code and because dynamic code analysis is more expensive and complex to perform. For modern software systems, however, this focus on static analysis can be problematic because although dynamic binding existed before the advent of object-orientation, its usage has increased significantly in the last decade. We describe how coupling can be defined and precisely measured based on dynamic analysis of systems. We refer to this type of coupling as dynamic coupling. An empirical evaluation of the proposed dynamic coupling measures is reported in which we study the relationship of these measures with the change proneness of classes. Data from maintenance releases of a large Java system are used for this purpose. Preliminary results suggest that some dynamic coupling measures are significant indicators of change proneness and that they complement existing coupling measures based on static analysis.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2004.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1316867","Index Terms- Coupling measurement;change predictions;quality modeling;maintenance.","Software measurement;Object oriented modeling;Software quality;Predictive models;Performance evaluation;Performance analysis;Q factor;Fault diagnosis;Runtime;Software systems","","220","6","30","IEEE","26 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately these shortcomings and limitations often seem to be overlooked.

Computational efficiency is ensured using an orthogonal forward regression, but the algorithm incrementally minimizes the PRESS statistic instead of the usual sum of the squared training errors. A local regularization method can naturally be incorporated into the model selection procedure to further enforce model sparsity. The proposed algorithm is fully automatic, and the user is not required to specify any criterion to terminate the model construction procedure.

A simple transmission-line model is used to calculate the frequencies of the two transmission zeros. It is shown that the nature of the coupling between the degenerate modes determines the type of filter characteristic, whether it is Chebyshev or elliptic.

This paper examines such packet-pair and packet-train dispersion techniques in depth. We first demonstrate that, in general, packet-pair bandwidth measurements follow a multimodal distribution and explain the causes of multiple local modes. The path capacity is a local mode, often different than the global mode of this distribution. We illustrate the effects of network load, cross-traffic packet-size variability, and probing packet size on the bandwidth distribution of packet pairs. We then switch to the dispersion of long packet trains. The mean of the packet-train dispersion distribution corresponds to a bandwidth metric that we refer to as average dispersion rate (ADR). We show that the ADR is a lower bound of the capacity and an upper bound of the available bandwidth of a path. Putting all of the pieces together, we present a capacity-estimation methodology that has been implemented in a tool called pathrate. We report on our experiences with pathrate after having measured hundreds of Internet paths over the last three years.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2004.838606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369287","Available bandwidth;bandwidth estimation;bottleneck link;density estimation;multimodal distributions;network measurements;packet pair;packet train","Bandwidth;Monitoring;Web and internet services;Bit rate;Switches;Packet switching;Upper bound;Density measurement;Throughput","","219","29","26","IEEE","20 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been reported that the linear techniques used to control such noise exhibit degradation in performance. In addition, the actuators of an active noise control (ANC) system very often have nonminimum-phase response. A linear controller under such situations can not model the inverse of the actuator, and hence yields poor performance. A novel filtered-s least mean square (FSLMS) algorithm based ANC structure, which functions as a nonlinear controller, is proposed in this paper. A fast implementation scheme of the FSLMS algorithm is also presented. Computer simulations have been carried out to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm and even performs better than the recently proposed Volterra filtered-x least mean square (VFXLMS) algorithm, in terms of mean square error (MSE), for active control of nonlinear noise processes. An evaluation of the computational requirements shows that the FSLMS algorithm offers a computational advantage over VFXLMS when the secondary path estimate is of length less than 6. However, the fast implementation of the FSLMS algorithm substantially reduces the number of operations compared to that of FSLMS as well as VFXLMS algorithm.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.822741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288157","","Active noise reduction;Least squares approximation;Acoustic noise;Stochastic systems;Stochastic resonance;Degradation;Control systems;Inverse problems;Hydraulic actuators;Computer simulation","","219","","17","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown in the paper, using general theory of electrical machines, that an increase of the stator phase number to at least five (or more) enables completely independent vector control of two (or more) multiphase machines that are supplied from a single current-controlled voltage source inverter. In order to achieve such an independent control it is necessary to connect multiphase stator windings of the machines in series and perform an appropriate phase sequence transposition. The concept is equally applicable to any multiphase ac machine type and its major advantage, compared to an equivalent multimotor three-phase drive system, is the saving of a certain number of inverter legs. The actual saving depends on the number of phases. The concept is introduced using an n-phase induction machine as the starting point and further analysis is restricted to an odd number of phases, for the reason explained in the paper. Classification of all the possible cases that may arise is given, followed by presentation of connection diagrams for selected phase numbers. Detailed verification of the proposed concept is provided by simulating the operation of a seven-phase three-motor drive system, controlled using indirect rotor flux oriented control principles. Some preliminary experimental results, which confirm the feasibility of a two-motor series-connected drive system, are included as well. The main advantages and drawbacks of the concept, when compared with an equivalent three-phase multimotor drive system, are finally addressed.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.823241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271315","","Voltage control;Control systems;Inverters;AC machines;Electric variables control;Power supplies;Power electronics;Machine vector control;Stator windings;Leg","","218","","24","IEEE","8 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The TDNs are a consequence of the deflective routing policy used, and gives rise to an explicit time-division-multiplexing within the network. To prove our concept an HDL implementation has been synthesised and simulated. The cost in terms of additional hardware needed, as well as additional bandwidth is very low-less than 2 percent in both cases! Simulations showed that ordinary BE traffic is practically unaffected by the VCs.","1530-1591","0-7695-2085-5","10.1109/DATE.2004.1269001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269001","","Bandwidth;Containers;Network-on-a-chip;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Quality of service;Delay;Circuits;Virtual colonoscopy;Routing","","218","2","17","IEEE","8 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No.04CH37546),"9 Aug 2004","2004","1","","737","746 Vol.1","Pb free solder is fast becoming a reality in electronic manufacturing due to marketing and legislative pressures. The industry has pretty much concluded that various versions of SnAgCu solder alloy offer the best alternative for eutectic Sn/Pb solder currently in use. With the current trend of cheaper, faster, and better electronic equipment, it has become increasingly important to evaluate the package and system performance very early in the design cycle using simulation tools. This requires life prediction models for new solder alloy systems so that the package-to-board interconnect reliability can be predicted for various environmental and field conditions. This paper describes in detail the life prediction models for SnAgCu solder joints. The models are based on published constitutive equations for this alloy and thermal cycle fatigue data on actual components. The approach uses advanced finite element modeling and analysis techniques and is based on mechanics of deformation. Both accumulated creep strain and creep strain energy density based models are developed. The model has been correlated with a number of data points and predicts life within 25% in most cases. The framework of modeling and prediction methodology described here is fully compatible with the framework used for SnPb solder previously.","","0-7803-8365-6","10.1109/ECTC.2004.1319419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1319419","","Creep;Capacitive sensors;Fatigue;Predictive models;Soldering;Packaging machines;Electronic packaging thermal management;Consumer electronics;Electronic equipment manufacture;Manufacturing industries","","218","","15","IEEE","9 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a special case, we obtain /spl Omega/(/spl radic/n) throughput for a general class of network configurations in a fixed area. Results for random node locations in a fixed area can also be derived as special cases of the general result by verifying the growth rate of three parameters.

The maximum magnitude of the balanced three-phase voltage and the maximum magnitude of zero sequence voltage, which can be synthesized simultaneously, are derived.

Our primary goal in this analysis was to investigate the hypothesis that the robotic training promoted improved muscle activation patterns. To this end, we examined the interaction forces, kinematics, and electromyograms recorded during training of eight different movement patterns in active-constrained mode. In this mode, the robot constrained the reaching movements to be toward the target, and the movement velocity was proportional to the force produced along the trajectory. Thirteen chronic stroke subjects trained in MIME for 24 1-h sessions over an eight-week period. Work output was significantly increased by week five in all eight movement patterns. Low-level subjects increased their extent of reach, while high-level subjects increased their speed. Directional errors in force production were reduced in six of eight movement patterns. Electromyographic data provided evidence for improved muscle activation patterns in the four movement patterns that started at tabletop level and ended at shoulder level. In contrast, there was no evidence of improved muscle activation patterns in any of the tabletop movements, with increased activation of antagonists in two movement patterns. This dichotomy may have been related to compensation at the shoulder girdle during movements that remained at tabletop level. A simple biomechanical model will be introduced to demonstrate the likelihood of this possibility.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2004.827225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1304860","","Muscles;Robots;Rehabilitation robotics;Electromyography;Pattern analysis;Kinematics;Production;Shoulder;Medical services;Trajectory","Arm;Electromyography;Evidence-Based Medicine;Humans;Middle Aged;Muscle Contraction;Muscle, Skeletal;Paresis;Paresis;Paresis;Physical Therapy Modalities;Robotics;Robotics;Stroke;Stroke;Stroke;Task Performance and Analysis;Treatment Outcome","215","1","34","IEEE","14 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is assumed to be noiseless and causal with a feedback capacity constraint in terms of maximum number of feedback bits per fading block. We show that the hybrid design could achieve the optimal MIMO link capacity, and we derive a computationally efficient algorithm to search for the optimal design under a specific average power constraint. Finally, we shall illustrate that a minimum mean-square error spatial processor with a successive interference canceller at the receiver could be used to realize the optimal capacity. We found that feedback effectively enhances the forward channel capacity for all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values when the number of transmit antennas (n/sub T/) is larger than the number of receive antennas (n/sub R/). The SNR gain with feedback is contributed by focusing transmission power on active eigenchannel and temporal power waterfilling . The former factor contributed, at most, 10log/sub 10/(n/sub T//n/sub R/) dB SNR gain when n/sub T/>n/sub R/, while the latter factor's SNR gain is significant only for low SNR values.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.822171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264195","","MIMO;Channel capacity;Feedback;Algorithm design and analysis;Receiving antennas;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Power control;Array signal processing;Constraint optimization","","215","75","18","IEEE","3 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"SOP: what is it and why? A new microsystem-integration technology paradigm-Moore's law for system integration of miniaturized convergent systems of the next decade","R. R. Tummala","Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging,"3 Sep 2004","2004","27","2","241","249","In the past, microsystems packaging played two roles: 1) it provided I/O connections to and from integrated circuits (ICs) or wafer-level packaging (WLP), and 2) it interconnected both active and passive components on system level boards, referred to as systems packaging. Both were accomplished by interconnections or multilayer wiring at the package or board level. More recently, the IC devices have begun to integrate not only more and more transistors, but also active and passive components on an individual chip, leading the community to believe that someday there may be a single-chip complete system, referred to as system-on-chip (SOC). This can be called horizontal or two-dimensional (2-D) integration of IC blocks in a single-chip toward end-product systems. The community began to realize, however, that such an approach presents fundamental, engineering, and investment limits, as well as computing and communication limits for wireless and wired systems over the long run. This led to 3-D packaging approaches, often referred to as system-in-package (SIP). The SIP, while providing major opportunities in both miniaturization and integration for advanced and portable electronic products, is a subsystem, limited by the CMOS process just like the SOC. Some existing and emerging applications, however, include sensors, memory modules and embedded processors with DRAMs. More recent 3-D solutions, which incorporate stacked package approaches, offer solutions toward faster time-to-market and business impediments that have plagued MCM deployment for the past decade. There is a new emerging concept called system-on-package (SOP). With SOP, the package, not the board, is the system. As such, SOP is beginning to address the shortcomings of both SOC and SIP, as well as traditional packaging which is bulky, costly, and lower in performance and reliability than ICs, in two ways: 1) It uses CMOS-based silicon for what it is good for, namely, for transistor integration, and the package, for what it is good for, namely, RF, optical, and digital integration by means of IC-package-system codesign. The SOP package, therefore, overcomes both the computing limitations and integration limitations of SOC, SIP, MCM, and traditional system packaging. It does this by having global wiring as well as RF, digital, and optical component integration in the package, not in the chip. The SOP, therefore, includes both active and passive components in thin-film form, in contrast with indiscrete or thick-film form, including embedded digital, RF, and optical components, and functions in a microminiaturized package or board.","1557-9980","","10.1109/TADVP.2004.830354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331506","","Wafer scale integration;Integrated circuit packaging;Radio frequency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Electronics packaging;Optical devices;Integrated circuit technology;Nonhomogeneous media;Wiring;System-on-a-chip","","215","12","38","IEEE","3 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a modification of the Fincke-Pohst (sphere decoding) algorithm to estimate the maximum a posteriori probability of the received symbol sequence. The new algorithm solves a nonlinear integer least squares problem and, over a wide range of rates and signal-to-noise ratios, has polynomial-time complexity. Performance of the algorithm, combined with convolutional, turbo, and low-density parity check codes, is demonstrated on several multiantenna channels. The results for systems that employ space-time modulation schemes seem to indicate that the best performing schemes are those that support the highest mutual information between the transmitted and received signals, rather than the best diversity gain.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.837271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374936","Expected complexity;iterative decoding;low-density parity check (LDPC) codes;multiantenna systems;polynomial-time complexity;space–time codes;sphere decoding;turbo codes;wireless communications","Iterative decoding;MIMO;Iterative algorithms;Bit error rate;Space time codes;Least squares methods;Signal to noise ratio;Polynomials;Convolutional codes;Convolution","","214","6","21","IEEE","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The applications can take a very long time to run on real hardware and it is impractical to simulate them to completion on performance models. Furthermore, these applications have complex execution environments that cannot easily be reproduced on a simulator, making porting the applications to simulators difficult. We attack these problems using the well-known SimPoint methodology to find representative portions of an application to simulate, and a dynamic instrumentation framework called Pin to avoid porting altogether. Our system uses dynamic instrumentation instead of simulation to find representative portions - called Pin-Points - for simulation. We have developed a toolkit that automatically detects PinPoints, validates whether they are representative using hardware performance counters, and generates traces for large Itanium® programs. We compared SimPoint-based selection to random selection of simulation points. We found for 95% of the SPEC2000 programs we tested, the PinPoints prediction was within 8% of the actual whole-program CPI, as opposed to 18% for random selection. We measure the end-to-end error, comparing real hardware to a performance model, and have a simple and efficient methodology to determine the step that introduced the error. Finally, we evaluate the system in the context of multiple configurations of real hardware, commercial applications, and industrial-strength performance models to understand the behavior of a complete and practical workload collection system. We have successfully used our system with many commercial Itanium® programs, some running for trillions of instructions, and have used the resulting traces for predicting performance of those applications on future Itanium processors.","1072-4451","0-7695-2126-6","10.1109/MICRO.2004.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1550984","","Instruments;Computational fluid dynamics;Computational modeling;Clustering algorithms;Sun;Microarchitecture;Database systems;Packaging;Production systems;Bayesian methods","","214","4","21","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The large surface area occupied by a conventional structure has been significantly reduced through the use of space-filling curves having the same electrical characteristics. Several space-filling curves have been studied and implemented in different designs. The second-iteration Moore rat-race coupler occupies only 12.6% of the conventional coupler's area, while the area of the second-iteration Sierpinski branch-line coupler is 24.7% of the conventional case. On the other hand, a nine-section Minkowski coupled-line balun is confined in 60% of the conventional balun's area. However, the effective size reduction depends on the used space-filling curve, compression ratio, and associated coupling between segments. The performance of the proposed space-filling hybrids is as good as that of the corresponding conventional structures, and even better in some cases. The design and simulation of the proposed space-filling hybrids have been performed using a moment-method-based full-wave electromagnetic simulator.

The paper first provides a general discussion of the approximations associated with using a dc model, with an emphasis on the impact these approximations will have on security constrained OPF (SCOPF) results and LMP values. Then, since the impact of the approximations can be quite system specific, the paper provides case studies using both a small 37 bus system and a somewhat larger 12,965 bus model of the Midwest U.S. transmission grid. Results are provided comparing both the accuracy and the computational requirements of the two models.

The proposed technique is suitable for applications where some correlation, either localized or global, exists between the auxiliary image and the image being enhanced. To exploit localized correlations, a spatially varying statistical model, based on vector quantization, is used. Another important aspect of the proposed algorithm is that it allows for the use of an accurate observation model relating the ""true"" scene with the low-resolutions observations.

It is a two-stage system in which a mulitersolution S-transform is used to generate a set of optimal feature vectors in the first stage. The multiresolution S-transform is based on a variable width analysis window, which changes with frequency according to a user-defined function. Thus, the resolution in time or the related resolution in frequency is a general function of the frequency and two parameters, which can be chosen according to signal characteristics. The multiresolution S-transform can be seen either as a phase-corrected version of the wavelet transform or a variable window short time Fourier transform that simultaneously localizes both real and imaginary spectra of the signal. The features obtained from S-transform analysis of the power quality disturbance signals are much more amenable for pattern recognition purposes unlike the currently available wavelet transform techniques. In stage two, a fuzzy logic-based pattern recognition system is used to classify the various disturbance waveforms generated due to power quality violations. The fuzzy approach is found to be very simple and classification accuracy is more than 98% in most cases of power quality disturbances.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2003.820180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1256395","","Fuzzy systems;Power quality;Signal resolution;Pattern recognition;Frequency;Fourier transforms;Wavelet transforms;Image resolution;Pattern analysis;Signal analysis","","214","","11","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have collected a diverse database of real-world camera response functions (DoRF). Using this database, we show that real-world responses occupy a small part of the theoretical space of all possible responses. We combine the constraints from our theoretical space with the data from DoRF to create a low-parameter empirical model of response (EMoR). This response model allows us to accurately interpolate the complete response function of a camera from a small number of measurements obtained using a standard chart. We also show that the model can be used to accurately estimate the camera response from images of an arbitrary scene taken using different exposures.

Similarly, we learn probabilistic models for the temporal evolution of each limb (forward and backward in time). Human pose and motion estimation is then solved with non-parametric belief propagation using a variation of particle filtering that can be applied over a general loopy graph. The loose-limbed model and decentralized graph structure facilitate the use of low-level visual cues. We adopt simple limb and head detectors to provide ""bottom-up"" information that is incorporated into the inference process at every time-step; these detectors permit automatic initialization and aid recovery from transient tracking failures. We illustrate the method by automatically tracking a walking person in video imagery using four calibrated cameras.

We also show how to use the relaxation algorithm to compute, and enforce, a coupled constraint equilibrium, which occurs if regulatory, generation, and distribution (and more) restrictions are placed on the companies and entire markets.

The microreformer-fuel cell combination has the advantage of not requiring the tedious recharging cycles needed by conventional rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. It also offers significantly higher energy storage densities, which translates into less frequent ""recharging"" through the refilling of methanol fuel.

"A simple and effective method for predicting travel times on freeways","J.

The prediction is done on the basis of the current traffic situation in combination with historical data. We argue that, for our purposes, the current traffic situation of a section of a freeway is well summarized by the current status travel time. This is the travel time that would result if one were to depart immediately and no significant changes in traffic would occur. This current status travel time can be estimated from single- or double-loop detectors, video data, probe vehicles, or any other means. Our prediction method arises from the empirical observation that there exists a linear relationship between any future travel time and the current status travel time. The slope and intercept of this relationship may change subject to the time of day and the time until departure, but linearity persists. This observation leads to a prediction scheme by means of linear regression with time-varying coefficients.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2004.833765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331390","","Traffic control;Transportation;Prediction methods;Linear regression;Measurement;Internet;Vehicle detection;Detectors;Probes;Vehicles","","211","","19","IEEE","3 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to the research in the 1980s, the research efforts in the 1990s aimed to further relax the constraints of handwriting, namely, the adherence to standard stroke orders and stroke numbers and the restriction of recognition to isolated characters only. The target of recognition has shifted from regular script to fluent script in order to better meet the requirements of practical applications. The research works are reviewed in terms of pattern representation, character classification, learning/adaptation, and contextual processing.

The characteristics of the proposed method are that no prior knowledge about the objects is necessary and the parameters can be set automatically. In our work, an infrared (IR) camera is adopted as the input device to capture the thermal images of the palm-dorsa. In the proposed approach, two of the finger webs are automatically selected as the datum points to define the region of interest (ROI) on the thermal images. Within each ROI, feature points of the vein patterns (FPVPs) are extracted by modifying the basic tool of watershed transformation based on the properties of thermal images. According to the heat conduction law (the Fourier law), multiple features can be extracted from each FPVP for verification. Multiresolution representations of images with FPVPs are obtained using multiple multiresolution filters (MRFs) that extract the dominant points by filtering miscellaneous features for each FPVP. A hierarchical integrating function is then applied to integrate multiple features and multiresolution representations. The former is integrated by an inter-to-intra personal variation ratio and the latter is integrated by a positive Boolean function. We also introduce a logical and reasonable method to select a trained threshold for verification. Experiments were conducted using the thermal images of palm-dorsas and the results are satisfactory with an acceptable accuracy rate (FRR:2.3% and FAR:2.3%). The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is valid and effective for vein-pattern verification.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2003.821975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269753","","Biometrics;Veins;Image resolution;Infrared imaging;Cameras;Fingers;Feature extraction;Filters;Filtering;Boolean functions","","211","7","43","IEEE","3 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trained users can move the cursor in one or two dimensions. The primary goal of this research is to provide a new communication and control option for people with severe motor disabilities. Currently, cursor movements in each dimension are determined 10 times/s by an empirically derived linear function of one or two EEG features (i.e., spectral bands from different electrode locations). This study used offline analysis of data collected during system operation to explore methods for improving the accuracy of cursor movement. The data were gathered while users selected among three possible targets by controlling vertical [i.e., one-dimensional (1-D)] cursor movement. The three methods analyzed differ in the dimensionality of the cursor movement [1-D versus two-dimensional (2-D)] and in the type of the underlying function (linear versus nonlinear). We addressed two questions: Which method is best for classification (i.e., to determine from the EEG which target the user wants to hit)? How does the number of EEG features affect the performance of each method? All methods reached their optimal performance with 10-20 features. In offline simulation, the 2-D linear method and the 1-D nonlinear method improved performance significantly over the 1-D linear method. The 1-D linear method did not do so. These offline results suggest that the 1-D nonlinear or the 2-D linear cursor function will improve online operation of the BCI system.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2004.834627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333048","","Electroencephalography;Communication system control;Data analysis;Biomedical imaging;Frequency domain analysis;Scalp;Brain computer interfaces;Frequency conversion;Electrodes;Two dimensional displays","Adult;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Cerebral Palsy;Cerebral Palsy;Communication Aids for Disabled;Computer Peripherals;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Online Systems;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Task Performance and Analysis;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface;Word Processing","211","2","25","IEEE","13 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks. Pre-distribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory used when the network size is large. Recently, a random key pre-distribution scheme and its improvements have been proposed. A common assumption made by these random key pre-distribution schemes is that no deployment knowledge is available. Noticing that in many practical scenarios, certain deployment knowledge may be available a priori, we propose a novel random key pre-distribution scheme that exploits deployment knowledge and avoids unnecessary key assignments.

The objective of the mission is to provide exploratory global measurements of the earth's soil moisture at 10-km resolution with two- to three-days revisit and land-surface freeze/thaw conditions at 3-km resolution with one- to two-days revisit. The mission builds on the heritage of ground-based and airborne passive and active low-frequency microwave measurements that have demonstrated and validated the effectiveness of the measurements and associated algorithms for estimating the amount and phase (frozen or thawed) of surface soil moisture. The mission data will enable advances in weather and climate prediction and in mapping processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles. The Hydros instrument is a combined radar and radiometer system operating at 1.26 GHz (with VV, HH, and HV polarizations) and 1.41 GHz (with H, V, and U polarizations), respectively. The radar and the radiometer share the aperture of a 6-m antenna with a look-angle of 39/spl deg/ with respect to nadir. The lightweight deployable mesh antenna is rotated at 14.6 rpm to provide a constant look-angle scan across a swath width of 1000 km. The wide swath provides global coverage that meet the revisit requirements. The radiometer measurements allow retrieval of soil moisture in diverse (nonforested) landscapes with a resolution of 40 km. The radar measurements allow the retrieval of soil moisture at relatively high resolution (3 km). The mission includes combined radar/radiometer data products that will use the synergy of the two sensors to deliver enhanced-quality 10-km resolution soil moisture estimates. In this paper, the science requirements and their traceability to the instrument design are outlined.

Sensor nodes have access to conditionally independent and identically distributed observations, given the state of nature, and transmit their data over a wireless channel. Upon reception of the information, the fusion center attempts to accurately reconstruct the state of nature. Specifically, we extend existing asymptotic results about large sensor networks to the case where the network is subject to a joint power constraint, and where the communication channel from each sensor node to the fusion center is corrupted by additive noise. Large deviation theory is used to show that having identical sensor nodes, i.e., each node using the same transmission scheme, is asymptotically optimal. Furthermore, a performance metric by which sensor node candidates can be compared is established. We supplement the theory with examples to illustrate how the results derived in this paper apply to the design of practical sensing systems.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.830894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1321213","","Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Testing;Communication channels;Additive noise;Measurement;Decision making;Multisensor systems","","210","","20","IEEE","9 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show the appropriateness of independent component analysis (ICA) to tackle this biomedical challenge when regarded as a blind source separation (BSS) problem. ICA is a statistical tool able to reconstruct the unobservable independent sources of bioelectric activity which generate, through instantaneous linear mixing, a measurable set of signals. The three key hypothesis that make ICA applicable in the present scenario are discussed and validated: 1) AA and ventricular activity (VA) are generated by sources of independent bioelectric activity; 2) AA and VA present non-Gaussian distributions; and 3) the generation of the surface ECG potentials from the cardioelectric sources can be regarded as a narrow-band linear propagation process. To empirically endorse these claims, an ICA algorithm is applied to recordings from seven patients with persistent AF. We demonstrate that the AA source can be identified using a kurtosis-based reordering of the separated signals followed by spectral analysis of the sub-Gaussian sources. In contrast to traditional methods, the proposed BSS-based approach is able to obtain a unified AA signal by exploiting the atrial information present in every ECG lead, which results in an increased robustness with respect to electrode selection and placement.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.827272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306570","","Atrial fibrillation;Blind source separation;Independent component analysis;Electrocardiography;Bioelectric phenomena;Source separation;Signal generators;Biomedical measurements;Electric potential;Cardiology","Algorithms;Atrial Fibrillation;Atrial Fibrillation;Body Surface Potential Mapping;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Heart Atria;Heart Conduction System;Heart Ventricles;Humans;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","209","3","14","IEEE","21 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results show that the length of the plasma column increases as the square root of the applied power and that the plasma density decreases linearly from the wave launcher to the end of the plasma column. These results are consistent with a simple global model of the antenna. Since noise is critical to communication systems, the noise generated by the plasma was measured from 10 to 250 MHz. Between 50 and 250 MHz the excess noise temperature was found to be 17.2/spl plusmn/1.0 dB above 290 K. This corresponds to an ohmic thermal noise source at 1.4/spl plusmn/0.3 eV, compared with an electron temperature of 1.65 eV predicted by the global model. Estimates of the electrical conductivity of the plasma column based on measured electron number densities lead to an antenna efficiency of about 65% at a transmission frequency of 100 MHz and an increase in total antenna noise of 1 dB due to the plasma. Theoretical modeling and experimental observations of the radiation pattern of the antenna show that the linear variation of conductivity and finite resistance of the column lead to a reduction in the depth of the nulls in the radiation pattern and a consequent increase in the width of the main lobe.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2004.826019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291644","","Plasma properties;Plasma density;Plasma measurements;Plasma waves;Plasma temperature;Antenna theory;Noise generators;Plasma sources;Antenna measurements;Noise measurement","","209","1","24","IEEE","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has lead to the common practice of categorizing bearing faults according to fault location (i.e., inner race, outer race, ball, or cage fault). While the ability to detect the four characteristic fault frequencies is necessary, this approach neglects another important class of faults that arise in many industrial settings. This research introduces the notion of categorizing bearing faults as either single-point defects or generalized roughness. These classes separate bearing faults according to the fault signatures that are produced rather than by the physical location of the fault. Specifically, single-point defects produce the four predictable characteristic fault frequencies while faults categorized as generalized roughness produce unpredictable broadband changes in the machine vibration and stator current. Experimental results are provided from bearings failed in situ via a shaft current. These results illustrate the unpredictable and broadband nature of the effects produced by generalized roughness bearing faults. This issue is significant because a successful bearing condition monitoring scheme must be able to reliably detect both classes of faults.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2004.827454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300726","","Production;Rolling bearings;Electric machines;Frequency;Condition monitoring;Electrical fault detection;Fault location;Stators;Shafts;Fault detection","","209","5","5","IEEE","24 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a collection of self-interested agents who want to form a network connecting certain endpoints, the set of stable solutions - the Nash equilibria - may look quite different from the centrally enforced optimum. We study the quality of the best Nash equilibrium, and refer to the ratio of its cost to the optimum network cost as the price of stability. The best Nash equilibrium solution has a natural meaning of stability in this context - it is the optimal solution that can be proposed from which no user will ""defect"". We consider the price of stability for network design with respect to one of the most widely-studied protocols for network cost allocation, in which the cost of each edge is divided equally between users whose connections make use of it; this fair-division scheme can be derived from the Shapley value, and has a number of basic economic motivations. We show that the price of stability for network design with respect to this fair cost allocation is O(log k), where k is the number of users, and that a good Nash equilibrium can be achieved via best-response dynamics in which users iteratively defect from a starting solution. This establishes that the fair cost allocation protocol is in fact a useful mechanism for inducing strategic behavior to form near-optimal equilibria. We discuss connections to the class of potential games defined by Monderer and Shapley, and extend our results to cases in which users are seeking to balance network design costs with latencies in the constructed network, with stronger results when the network has only delays and no construction costs. We also present bounds on the convergence time of best-response dynamics, and discuss extensions to a weighted game.","0272-5428","0-7695-2228-9","10.1109/FOCS.2004.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1366249","","Stability;Computer science;Nash equilibrium;Protocols;Cost function;Joining processes;Delay;Convergence;Routing;Load management","","208","","26","IEEE","13 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The contribution of the paper is two-fold. Firstly, we consider the problem of global regulation, instead of global asymptotic stabilization (GAS), for systems with generalized dynamic uncertainties. It is shown by an elementary example that GAS is not solvable using conventional smooth output feedback. Secondly, we reduce the stability requirements for the disturbance and demand relaxed assumptions for the system. Using our framework, most of the known classes of output feedback form systems are broadened in several directions: unmeasured states and unknown parameters can appear nonlinearly, restrictive matching and growth assumptions are removed, the dynamic uncertainty satisfies the weaker condition of Sontag's integral input-to-state stability, and the sign of high-frequency gain may be unknown. A constructive strategy is proposed to design a dynamic output feedback control law, that drives the state to the origin while keeping all other closed-loop signals bounded.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.825663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284717","","Output feedback;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear systems;Control systems;Stability;Nonlinear control systems;Uncertainty;Automatic control;Robust control;Signal design","","207","","56","IEEE","13 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A real-time 3-D gaze tracking system has been developed which can provide 30 gaze measurements per second. Moreover, a simple and accurate calibration method is proposed to calibrate the gaze tracking system. Before using the system, each user only has to stare at a target point for a few (2-3) seconds so that the constant angle between the 3-D line of sight and the optical axis can be estimated.

Although counter-intuitive, we show surprisingly that, through the use of coding with side information principles, this reversal of order is indeed possible in some settings of interest without loss of either optimal coding efficiency or perfect secrecy. We show that in certain scenarios our scheme requires no more randomness in the encryption key than the conventional system where compression precedes encryption.

However, due to the physics of the radar imaging process, SAR images contain unwanted artifacts in the form of a granular look which is called speckle. The assumptions of the classical SAR image generation model lead to a Rayleigh distribution model for the histogram of the SAR image. However, some experimental data such as images of urban areas show impulsive characteristics that correspond to underlying heavy-tailed distributions, which are clearly non-Rayleigh. Some alternative distributions have been suggested such as the Weibull, log-normal, and the k-distribution which had success in varying degrees depending on the application. Recently, an alternative model namely the /spl alpha/-stable distribution has been suggested for modeling radar clutter. In this paper, we show that the amplitude distribution of the complex wave, the real and the imaginery components of which are assumed to be distributed by the /spl alpha/-stable distribution, is a generalization of the Rayleigh distribution. We demonstrate that the amplitude distribution is a mixture of Rayleighs as is the k-distribution in accordance with earlier work on modeling SAR images which showed that almost all successful SAR image models could be expressed as mixtures of Rayleighs. We also present parameter estimation techniques based on negative order moments for the new model. Finally, we test the performance of the model on urban images and compare with other models such as Rayleigh, Weibull, and the k-distribution.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.818017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284389","","Synthetic aperture radar;Adaptive optics;Laser radar;Satellites;Physics;Radar imaging;Speckle;Image generation;Histograms;Urban areas","","206","","20","IEEE","13 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Global History Buffer can be used for implementing a number of previously proposed prefetch methods, as well as new ones. Prefetching with the Global History Buffer has two significant advantages over conventional table prefetching methods. First, the use of a FIFO history buffer can improve the accuracy of correlation prefetching by eliminating stale data from the table. Second, the Global History Buffer contains a more complete (and intact) picture of cache miss history, creating opportunities to design more effective prefetching methods. Global History Buffer prefetching can increase correlation prefetching performance by 20% and cut its memory traffic by 90%. Furthermore, the Global History Buffer can make correlations within a load’s address stream, which can increase stride prefetching performance by 6%.

Although the SVM has been shown to exhibit excellent generalization properties in many experiments, it suffers from several drawbacks, both of a theoretical and a technical nature: the absence of probabilistic outputs, the restriction to Mercer kernels, and the steep growth of the number of support vectors with increasing size of the training set. In this paper, we present a different class of kernel regressors that effectively overcome the above problems. We call this approach generalized LASSO regression. It has a clear probabilistic interpretation, can handle learning sets that are corrupted by outliers, produces extremely sparse solutions, and is capable of dealing with large-scale problems. For regression functionals which can be modeled as iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) problems, we present a highly efficient algorithm with guaranteed global convergence. This defies a unique framework for sparse regression models in the very rich class of IRLS models, including various types of robust regression models and logistic regression.

However, with both approaches, heating and destruction of healthy tissue can occur. Recently, a nonthermal atmospheric plasma (plasma needle) has been developed. In this work, the interactions of this plasma with dental tissue is studied, and its capability of bacterial inactivation is tested. A plasma needle is an efficient source of various radicals, which are capable of bacterial decontamination; however, it operates at room temperature and thus, does not cause bulk destruction of the tissue. Plasma treatment is potentially a novel tissue-saving technique, allowing irregular structures and narrow channels within the diseased tooth to be cleaned.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2004.832636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1341519","","Dentistry;Plasma temperature;Plasma sources;Needles;Microorganisms;Cleaning;Heating;Testing;Decontamination;Teeth","","205","76","15","IEEE","8 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To control the motion of the platform along desired trajectories in space, nonlinear feedforward control laws in the cable length coordinates are used. Taking account of the effect of redundancy on actuation, the optimal tension distribution should be considered to the advantage of the control laws. Using a method based on the analysis of the workspace condition, tension constraints and limiting torque constraints of actuators, an analytical solution for optimum tension distribution was found and used to compute the force in each cable for compensation of dynamic errors. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed control laws reduce the energy consumption of the actuators and satisfy the path tracking accuracy.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2004.835336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336812","","Motion control;Cables;Manipulator dynamics;Actuators;Distributed computing;Mechatronics;Optimal control;PD control;Redundancy;Torque","","205","","14","IEEE","27 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The three-phase PWM ac/dc converters modeled in the a-b-c reference frame are first shown to be EL systems whose EL parameters are explicitly identified. The energy-dissipative properties of this model are fully retained under the d-q-axis transformation. Based on the transformed d-q EL model, passivity-based controllers are then synthesized using the techniques of energy shaping and damping injection. Two possible passivity-based feedback designs are discussed, leading to a feasible dynamic current-loop controller. Motivated from the usual power electronics control schemes and the study of Lee, the internal dc-bus voltage dynamics are regulated via an outer loop proportional plus integral (PI) controller cascaded to the d-axis current loop. Nonlinear PI control results of Desoer and Lin are applied to theoretically validate the proposed outer loop control scheme. The PWM ac/dc converter controlled by the proposed passivity-based current control scheme with outer loop PI compensation has the features of enhanced robustness under model uncertainties, decoupled current-loop dynamics, guaranteed zero steady-state error, and asymptotic rejection of constant load disturbance. Experimental results on a 1.5-kVA PC-based controlled prototype provide verification of these salient features. The experimental responses of a classical linear PI scheme are also included for comparative study.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2004.831753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318752","","Lagrangian functions;Voltage control;Analog-digital conversion;Pulse width modulation converters;Pulse width modulation;DC-DC power converters;Pi control;Power system modeling;Proportional control;Control theory","","204","","27","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, elasticity by itself is not necessarily a discriminant parameter for malignancy diagnosis. Modeling viscous properties of tissues could also be of great interest for tumor characterization. We report in this paper an explicit derivation of the Green's function in a viscous and elastic medium taking into account shear, bulk, and coupling waves. From this theoretical calculation, 3D simulations of mechanical waves in viscoelastic soft tissues are presented. The relevance of the viscoelastic Green's function is validated by comparing simulations with experimental data. The experiments were conducted using the supersonic shear imaging (SSI) technique which dynamically and remotely excites tissues using acoustic radiation force. We show that transient shear waves generated with SSI are modeled very precisely by the Green's function formalism. The combined influences of out-of-plane diffraction, beam shape, and shear viscosity on the shape of transient waves are carefully studied as they represent a major issue in ultrasound-based viscoelasticity imaging techniques.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1367494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1367494","","Viscosity;Acoustic diffraction;Acoustic waves;Elasticity;Green's function methods;Ultrasonic imaging;Biological tissues;Acoustic imaging;Shape;Equations","Acoustics;Algorithms;Animals;Biomimetic Materials;Computer Simulation;Connective Tissue;Connective Tissue;Elasticity;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Biological;Radio Waves;Refractometry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stress, Mechanical;Viscosity","204","5","15","IEEE","20 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Tone reservation uses other unused or reserved tones to design a peak-cancelling signal that lowers the PAR of a transmit OFDM block. In contrast to previous methods, the new active-set method proposed here converges very quickly toward a minimum-PAR solution at a lower computational cost. An efficient real-baseband algorithm is well suited for discrete multitone (DMT) modulation over twisted-pair copper wiring, where some subchannels may have an insufficient SNR to reliably send data. The real PAR problem occurs in the analog signal before the power amplifier, and results focus on this figure of merit. The performance of oversampling before applying PAR reduction is analyzed, and results show that this is necessary to sufficiently handle the analog PAR problem. An extension of the real-baseband technique can be applied to complex-baseband signals to help reduce PAR in wireless and broadcast systems. By sacrificing 11 out of 256 OFDM tones (4.3%) for tone reservation, over 3 dB of analog PAR reduction can be obtained for a wireless system.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.821110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261335","","Peak to average power ratio;OFDM modulation;Nonlinear distortion;Signal design;Computational efficiency;Copper;Wiring;Power amplifiers;Performance analysis;Broadcasting","","204","21","22","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the computation of such metrics is complicated by their nonlinear and combinatorial nature, we introduce the notion of hybrid metrics based on the probabilities of loss-of-load due to single and double generation outages only. The reliability-constrained market-clearing problem can then be formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and solved with large-scale commercial solvers. Numerical tests with data from the IEEE Reliability Test System indicate that the new method is computationally efficient and produces market-clearing results with the desired probabilistic characteristics.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2003.818587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266582","","Electricity supply industry;Spinning;Power generation;System testing;Costs;Hybrid power systems;Large-scale systems;Linear programming;Power engineering and energy;Councils","","204","","12","IEEE","19 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a task duplication-based scheduling algorithm for network of heterogeneous systems (TANH), with complexity O(V/sup 2/), which provides optimal results for applications represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), provided a simple set of conditions on task computation and network communication time could be satisfied. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated by comparing the scheduling time with an existing ""best imaginary level scheduling (BIL)"" scheme for heterogeneous systems.

Indeed, even for multi-viewface detection the performance of existing systems is far from satisfactory. In this work we focus on the problem of learning to detect objects from a small training database. We show that performance depends crucially on the features that are used to represent the objects. Specifically, we show that using local edge orientation histograms (EOH) as features can significantly improve performance compared to the standard linear features used in existing systems. For frontal faces, local orientation histograms enable state of the art performance using only a few hundred training examples.

By using metallic (iron and cobalt) nanoparticles, absorbers with relatively low volume fraction of metallic inclusions can be made.

Nevertheless, issues often encountered in MIFG structures, such as the initial charge trapped in the floating gates or the gain-bandwidth product degradation, are not present in QFG configurations. Several CMOS circuit realizations using open- and closed-loop topologies, have been designed.

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) refers to the retrieval of images from a database using information derived from the images themselves, rather than solely from accompanying text indices. In the medical-imaging context, the ultimate aim of CBIR is to provide radiologists with a diagnostic aid in the form of a display of relevant past cases, along with proven pathology and other suitable information. CBIR may also be useful as a training tool for medical students and residents. The goal of information retrieval is to recall from a database information that is relevant to the user's query. The most challenging aspect of CBIR is the definition of relevance (similarity), which is used to guide the retrieval machine. In this paper, we pursue a new approach, in which similarity is learned from training examples provided by human observers. Specifically, we explore the use of neural networks and support vector machines to predict the user's notion of similarity. Within this framework we propose using a hierarchal learning approach, which consists of a cascade of a binary classifier and a regression module to optimize retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. We also explore how to incorporate online human interaction to achieve relevance feedback in this learning framework. Our experiments are based on a database consisting of 76 mammograms, all of which contain clustered microcalcifications (MCs). Our goal is to retrieve mammogram images containing similar MC clusters to that in a query. The performance of the retrieval system is evaluated using precision-recall curves computed using a cross-validation procedure. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the learning framework can accurately predict the perceptual similarity reported by human observers, thereby serving as a basis for CBIR; 2) the learning-based framework can significantly outperform a simple distance-based similarity metric; 3) the use of the hierarchical two-stage network can improve retrieval performance; and 4) relevance feedback can be effectively incorporated into this learning framework to achieve improvement in retrieval precision based on online interaction with users; and 5) the retrieved images by the network can have predicting value for the disease condition of the query.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.834601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339430","","Image retrieval;Content based retrieval;Mammography;Information retrieval;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Image databases;Humans;Displays;Pathology","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Diseases;Calcinosis;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Database Management Systems;Decision Support Systems, Clinical;Female;Humans;Information Storage and Retrieval;Mammography;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Precancerous Conditions;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","202","4","41","IEEE","4 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Often, the ultimate objective is to derive an estimate of a parameter or function from these data. This paper investigates a general class of distributed algorithms for ""in-network"" data processing, eliminating the need to transmit raw data to a central point. This can provide significant reductions in the amount of communication and energy required to obtain an accurate estimate. The estimation problems we consider are expressed as the optimization of a cost function involving data from all sensor nodes. The distributed algorithms are based on an incremental optimization process. A parameter estimate is circulated through the network, and along the way each node makes a small adjustment to the estimate based on its local data. Applying results from the theory of incremental subgradient optimization, we show that for a broad class of estimation problems the distributed algorithms converge to within an /spl epsi/-ball around the globally optimal value. Furthermore, bounds on the number incremental steps required for a particular level of accuracy provide insight into the trade-off between estimation performance and communication overhead. In many realistic scenarios, the distributed algorithms are much more efficient, in terms of energy and communications, than centralized estimation schemes. The theory is verified through simulated applications in robust estimation, source localization, cluster analysis and density estimation.","","1-58113-846-6","10.1145/984622.984626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1307319","","Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Distributed algorithms;Parameter estimation;Permission;Sensor systems;Energy resources;Data engineering;Data processing;Cost function","","201","5","","","28 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The basis is derived from orthogonal Legendre polynomials which are modified to impose continuity of vector quantities between neighboring elements while maintaining most of their desirable features. Expressions are presented for wire, surface, and volume elements but emphasis is given to the surface elements. In this case, the new hierarchical basis leads to a near-orthogonal expansion of the unknown surface current and implicitly an orthogonal expansion of the surface charge. In addition, all higher order terms in the expansion have two vanishing moments. In contrast to existing formulations, these properties allow the use of very high-order basis functions without introducing ill-conditioning of the resulting MoM matrix. Numerical results confirm that the condition number of the MoM matrix obtained with this new basis is much lower than existing higher order interpolatory and hierarchical basis functions. As a consequence of the excellent condition numbers, we demonstrate that even very high-order MoM systems, e.g., tenth order, can be solved efficiently with an iterative solver in relatively few iterations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2004.835279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353496","Basis functions;hierarchical systems;high-order methods;integral equations;method of moments (MoM);orthogonal functions;polynomial approximation","Electromagnetic modeling;Integral equations;Moment methods;Iterative methods;Polynomials;Interpolation;Wire;Hierarchical systems;Differential equations;Acceleration","","201","","32","IEEE","8 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The unit commitment problem is initially formulated as a chance constrained optimization problem in which we require that the load be met with a specified high probability over the entire time horizon. The solution procedure consists of solving a sequence of deterministic versions of the unit commitment problem that converge to the solution of the chance constrained program. For the deterministic unit commitment problems, Lagrangian relaxation is used to separate the dual problem into its subproblems. Each subproblem is solved by a dynamic program. The initial results indicate that accounting for the correlation structure of the hourly loads reduces the value of the objective function when the optimization problem is formulated as a chance constrained program. Monte Carlo simulation is used to verify the accuracy of the solution provided by the algorithm. The relationship that the unit commitment solution found using the chance constrained optimization approach has with that found using conventional spinning reserves is discussed.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.831651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318698","","Stochastic processes;Power generation;Costs;Gaussian distribution;Constraint optimization;Lagrangian functions;Distribution functions;Spinning;Fuels;Industrial engineering","","201","","25","IEEE","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most algorithms that make a hard decision on the origin of the true measurement begin to fail as the FA rate increases or with low observable (low probability of target detection) maneuvering targets. Instead of using only one measurement among the received ones and discarding the others, an alternative approach is to use all of the validated measurements with different weights (probabilities), known as probabilistic data association (PDA). This paper presents an overview of the PDA technique and its application for different target tracking scenarios. First, it describes the use of the PDA technique for tracking low observable targets with passive sonar measurements. This target motion analysis is an application of the PDA technique, in conjunction with the maximum-likelihood approach, for target motion parameter estimation via a batch procedure. Then, the PDA technique for tracking highly maneuvering targets and for radar resource management is illustrated with recursive state estimation using the interacting multiple model estimator combined with PDA. Finally, a sliding window (which can also expand and contract) parameter estimator using the PDA approach for tracking the state of a maneuvering target using measurements from an electrooptical sensor is presented.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.823149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271405","","Target tracking;Radar tracking;State estimation;Motion analysis;Parameter estimation;Clutter;Birth disorders;Object detection;Weight measurement;Sonar measurements","","200","1","60","IEEE","8 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A short length of wire formed the antenna while a beam lead Schottky diode across a resonant loop formed the frequency doubler circuit yielding a total tag mass of less than 3 mg. Simulators using the method-of-moments for the antenna, finite-integral time-domain for the loop, and harmonic balance for the nonlinear diode element were used to predict and optimize the transceiver performance. This performance is compared to the ideal case and to measurements performed using a pulsed magnetron source within an anechoic chamber. A method for analysis of the tag is presented and used to optimize the design by creating the largest possible return signal at the second harmonic frequency for a particular incident power density. These methods were verified through measurement of tags both in isolation and mounted on insects. For excitation at 9.41 GHz the optimum tag in isolation had an antenna length of 12 mm with a loop diameter of 1 mm which yielded a harmonic cross-section of 40 mm/sup 2/. For tags mounted on Colorado potato beetles, optimum performance was achieved with an 8 mm dipole fed 2 mm from the beetle attached end. A theory is developed that describes harmonic radar in a fashion similar to the conventional radar range equation but with harmonic cross-section replacing the conventional radar cross-section. This method provides a straightforward description of harmonic radar system performance as well as provides a means to describe harmonic radar tag performance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2004.835166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353476","Antenna measurements;dipole antennas;radar applications;radar theory;radio tracking;transceivers;Schottky diodes","Radar tracking;Transceivers;Insects;Radar cross section;Antenna measurements;Radar antennas;Schottky diodes;Pulse measurements;Radar theory;Radar measurements","","200","6","14","IEEE","8 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has led to the development of 3D shape retrieval systems that, given a query object, retrieve similar 3D objects. For visualization, 3D shapes are often represented as a surface, in particular polygonal meshes, for example in VRML format. Often these models contain holes, intersecting polygons, are not manifold, and do not enclose a volume unambiguously. On the contrary, 3D volume models, such as solid models produced by CAD systems, or voxels models, enclose a volume properly. This paper surveys the literature on methods for content based 3D retrieval, taking into account the applicability to surface models as well as to volume models. The methods are evaluated with respect to several requirements of content based 3D shape retrieval, such as: (1) shape representation requirements, (2) properties of dissimilarity measures, (3) efficiency, (4) discrimination abilities, (5) ability to perform partial matching, (6) robustness, and (7) necessity of pose normalization.

This makes reconfigurable platforms an ideal target for many modern embedded systems that combine high computation demands with dynamic task sets. A rather new line of research is engaged in the construction of operating systems for reconfigurable embedded platforms. Such an operating system provides a minimal programming model and a runtime system. The runtime system performs online task and resource management. In this paper, we first discuss design issues for reconfigurable hardware operating systems. Then, we focus on a runtime system for guarantee-based scheduling of hard real-time tasks. We formulate the scheduling problem for the 1D and 2D resource models and present two heuristics, the horizon and the stuffing technique, to tackle it. Simulation experiments conducted with synthetic workloads evaluate the performance and the runtime efficiency of the proposed schedulers. The scheduling performance for the 1D resource model is strongly dependent on the aspect ratios of the tasks. Compared to the 1D model, the 2D resource model is clearly superior. Finally, the runtime overhead of the scheduling algorithms is shown to be acceptably low.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2004.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336761","Index Terms- FPGA;partial reconfiguration;operating system;online scheduling;real-time.","Network operating systems;Reconfigurable architectures;Field programmable gate arrays;Resource management;Processor scheduling;Multiprogramming","","199","9","41","IEEE","27 Sep 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we view the sample points as realizations of an unknown multivariate density supported on an unknown smooth manifold. We introduce a novel geometric approach based on entropic graph methods. Although the theory presented applies to this general class of graphs, we focus on the geodesic-minimal-spanning-tree (GMST) to obtaining asymptotically consistent estimates of the manifold dimension and the Re/spl acute/nyi /spl alpha/-entropy of the sample density on the manifold. The GMST approach is striking in its simplicity and does not require reconstruction of the manifold or estimation of the multivariate density of the samples. The GMST method simply constructs a minimal spanning tree (MST) sequence using a geodesic edge matrix and uses the overall lengths of the MSTs to simultaneously estimate manifold dimension and entropy.

This RPNN consists of nonlinearly operated nodes whose outputs are only connected with the inputs of themselves and the latter nodes. The connections may contain multiple branches with time delays. An extended algorithm of self-adaptive back-propagation through time (BPTT) learning algorithm is used to train the RPNN. In simulation, two performance measures [root-mean-square error (RMSE) and prediction accuracy (PA)] show that the proposed method is more effective and accurate for multistep prediction.

This paper presents and verifies a novel voltage sag detection technique for use in conjunction with the main control system of a DVR. In all cases it is necessary for the DVR control system to not only detect the start and end of a voltage sag but also to determine the sag depth and any associated phase shift. The DVR, which is placed in series with a sensitive load, must be able to respond quickly to a voltage sag if end users of sensitive equipment are to experience no voltage sags. A problem arises when fast evaluation of the sag depth and phase shift is required, as this information is normally embedded within the core of a main DVR control scheme and is not readily available to either users monitoring the state of the grid or parallel controllers. Previous research presented an additional controller, which required phase and sag depth information to manipulate the injection voltage vector returned by the main controller in order to prevent the DVR injection transformers from saturating. Typical standard information tracking or detection methods such as the Fourier transform or phase-locked loop (PLL) are too slow in returning this information, when either applied to the injection voltage vector, or to the supply voltages directly. As a result of this the voltage sag detection method in this paper proposes a new matrix method, which is able to compute the phase shift and voltage reduction of the supply voltage much quicker than the Fourier transform or a PLL. The paper also illustrates that the matrix method returns results that can be directly interpreted, whereas other methods such as the wavelet transform return results that can be difficult to interpret.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.821801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268198","","Voltage fluctuations;Voltage control;Phase detection;Phase locked loops;Power quality;Control systems;Fourier transforms;Protection;Monitoring;Transformers","","199","","17","IEEE","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Theoretically, all the techniques are quite effective for minimizing the cogging torque. This paper presents the efficacy of these methods in mass production subject to manufacturing tolerances/variations. The cogging torque minimization becomes a challenging task when the requirement is very stringent in applications such as electric power steering and robotics. Some of the known techniques for reducing the cogging torque are the magnet pole design, skewing, step skewing, and dummy slots in the stator lamination. They will be discussed in this paper considering manufacturing tolerances/variations when used in mass production. Finite-element analysis is carried out to determine the worst case scenarios. The research demonstrates that the cogging torque amplitude and frequency are highly sensitive to magnet shapes, dimensions, locations and magnetization pattern, as well as slot/pole combination. In reality, the cogging torque may not be eliminated completely but minimized to a satisfactory level depending on the application requirements.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2004.827469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300736","","Forging;Torque;Brushless DC motors;Mass production;Pulp manufacturing;Robots;Stators;Lamination;Finite element methods;Magnetic analysis","","199","","12","IEEE","24 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stabilizing signals are obtained from remote locations based on observability of the critical modes. A H/sub /spl infin// damping control design based on the mixed-sensitivity formulation in a linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework is carried out. It is shown that, with local signal, supplementary damping control through three flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices is necessary to provide damping to the three dominant interarea modes. On the other hand, the use of global signals has been shown to improve the damping of all the critical interarea modes with a single controller for the TCSC only. The damping performance of the centralized controller was examined in the frequency and the time domain for various operating scenarios.

In this work, we derive an achievable rate region for this channel. It includes the rate region which is achieved by time/frequency division multiplexing (TDM/ FDM), and it also includes the rate region which is obtained by time sharing between the two rate pairs where one of the transmitters sends its data reliably at the maximal possible rate (i.e., the maximum rate it can achieve in the absence of interference), and the other transmitter decreases its data rate to the point where both receivers can reliably decode its message. The suggested rate region is easily calculable, though it is a particular case of the celebrated achievable rate region of Han and Kobayashi whose calculation is, in general, prohibitively complex. In the high-power regime, a lower bound on the sum-capacity (i.e., the maximal achievable total rate) is derived, and we show its superiority over the maximal total rate which is achieved by the TDM/FDM approach with moderate interference. For degraded and one-sided Gaussian ICs, we rely on some observations of Costa and Sato, and obtain directly their sum-capacities.

In this paper, the effects of gain, phase imbalance, and phase noise on EVM are examined. The work is focused on single-carrier, linear, and memoryless modulated signals, such as phase-shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The EVM is calculated under the assumption that the transmitted signal consists of zero-mean uncorrelated inphase and quadrature components that are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, an expression for the EVM is derived using a simple model that accounts for linear transmitter and receiver imperfections, inspired by the works of Cavers and Liao, 1993. Second, a union bound on the symbol error rate (SER) is derived. The root mean square EVM is shown to be independent of the constellation shape. The SER, however, is sensitive to the individual transmitted symbols and, therefore, the constellation shape. The resulting equations are used to examine the relation between EVM, sideband suppression, and phase noise.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.823477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275708","","Phase noise;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Vectors;Shape;Phase modulation;Amplitude modulation;Phase shift keying;Additive white noise;Transmitters;Error analysis","","197","3","11","IEEE","22 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, conventional routing schemes would fail. To deal with such networks we propose the use of an opportunistic hop-by-hop routing model. According to the model, a series of independent, local forwarding decisions are made, based on current connectivity and predictions of future connectivity information diffused through nodes' mobility. The important issue here is how to choose an appropriate next hop. To this end, we propose and analyze via theory and simulations a number of routing algorithms. The champion algorithm turns out to be one that combines the simplicity of a simple random policy, which is efficient in finding good leads towards the destination, with the sophistication of utility-based policies that efficiently follow good leads. We also state and analyze the performance of an oracle-based optimal algorithm, and compare it to the online approaches. The metrics used in the comparison are the average message delivery delay and the number of transmissions per message delivered.","","0-7803-8796-1","10.1109/SAHCN.2004.1381922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381922","","Routing;Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Disruption tolerant networking;Predictive models;Analytical models;Performance analysis;Delay;Wildlife","","197","","29","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such multilayer PCBs, the power and ground planes act as radiating microstrip patch antennas, where radiation is caused by fringing electric fields at board edges. In this paper, we introduce an effective method for suppressing PCB radiation from their power bus over an ultrawide range of frequencies by using metallo-dielectric electromagnetic band-gap structures. More specifically, this study focuses on the suppression of radiation from parallel-plate bus structures in high-speed PCBs caused by switching noise, such as simultaneous switching noise, also known as Delta-I noise or ground bounce. This noise consists of unwanted voltage fluctuations on the power bus of a PCB due to resonance of the parallel-plate waveguiding system created by the power bus planes. The techniques introduced here are not limited to the suppression of switching noise and can be extended to any wave propagation between the plates of the power bus. Laboratory PCB prototypes were fabricated and tested revealing appreciable suppression of radiated noise over specific frequency bands of interest, thus, testifying to the effectiveness of this concept.","1558-187X","","10.1109/TEMC.2004.837671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1362872","Electromagnetic band gap (EBG) material;electromagnetic compatibility (EMC);electromagnetic interference (EMI);switching noise","Electromagnetic interference;Interference suppression;Printed circuits;Electromagnetic compatibility;Microstrip antennas;Circuit noise","","197","8","31","IEEE","30 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, we now revisit the Poisson assumption, by studying a combination of historical traces and new measurements obtained from a major backbone link belonging to a Tier 1 ISP. We show that unlike the older data sets, current network traffic can be well represented by the Poisson model for sub-second time scales. At multisecond scales, we find a distinctive piecewise-linear nonstationarity, together with evidence of long-range dependence. Combining our observations across both time scales leads to a time-dependent Poisson characterization of network traffic that, when viewed across very long time scales, exhibits the observed long-range dependence. This traffic characterization reconciliates the seemingly contradicting observations of Poisson and long-memory traffic characteristics.

We investigate the hypothesis that open-source software grows more quickly, but does not find evidence to support this. The project growth is similar for all the projects in the analysis, indicating that other factors may limit growth. The hypothesis that creativity is more prevalent in open-source software is also examined, and evidence to support this hypothesis is found using the metric of functions added over time. The concept of open-source projects succeeding because of their simplicity is not supported by the analysis, nor is the hypothesis of open-source projects being more modular. However, the belief that defects are found and fixed more rapidly in open-source projects is supported by an analysis of the functions modified. We find support for two of the five common beliefs and conclude that, when implementing or switching to the open-source development model, practitioners should ensure that an appropriate metrics collection strategy is in place to verify the perceived benefits.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2004.1274044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1274044","","Open source software;Computer Society;Programming;Software metrics;Computer industry;Scalability;Data security;Costs;Software systems","","196","1","14","IEEE","22 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve more accurate document clustering, more informative features including phrases and their weights are particularly important in such scenarios. Document clustering is particularly useful in many applications such as automatic categorization of documents, grouping search engine results, building a taxonomy of documents, and others. This article presents two key parts of successful document clustering. The first part is a novel phrase-based document index model, the document index graph, which allows for incremental construction of a phrase-based index of the document set with an emphasis on efficiency, rather than relying on single-term indexes only. It provides efficient phrase matching that is used to judge the similarity between documents. The model is flexible in that it could revert to a compact representation of the vector space model if we choose not to index phrases. The second part is an incremental document clustering algorithm based on maximizing the tightness of clusters by carefully watching the pair-wise document similarity distribution inside clusters. The combination of these two components creates an underlying model for robust and accurate document similarity calculation that leads to much improved results in Web document clustering over traditional methods.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324634","Index Terms- Web mining;document similarity;phrase-based indexing;document clustering;document structure;document index graph;phrase matching.","Indexing;Data mining;Clustering methods;Information retrieval;Taxonomy;Clustering algorithms;Text mining;Web mining;Artificial intelligence;Data models","","196","18","45","IEEE","24 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our main contributions are as follows. 1) First, we prove that the problem of finding an eligible pair of working and backup paths for a new lightpath request requiring shared-path protection under the current network state is NP-complete. 2) Then, we develop a heuristic, called CAFES, to compute a feasible solution with high probability. 3) Finally, we design another heuristic, called OPT, to optimize resource consumption for a given solution. The merits of our approaches are that they capture the essence of shared-path protection and approach to optimal solutions without enumerating paths.

If it is capable of supplying enough power at all times, then it is an adequate source. Major problems presently facing the industry include the size, cost, and efficiency of the energy source. The primary energy source presently used in automotive systems is a battery. In order to reduce the cost of the battery, the current needs to be decreased and stabilized so it is not very erratic. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and justify the use of a new model for an energy source: a battery in parallel with an ultra-capacitor. The ultra-capacitor can supply a large burst of current, but cannot store much energy. Conversely, the battery can store mass amounts of energy; however, without expensive and inefficient units, a battery cannot provide the current that the ultra-capacitor can. By combining the two energy sources in parallel, the storage and peak current characteristics desired can be achieved. The standards of the vehicle are not degraded, allowing this to be a promising technique to incorporate into hybrid electric vehicles to reduce their cost and increase the efficiency of their energy-source system.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2003.822004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262142","","Hybrid electric vehicles;Costs;Energy storage;Power supplies;Degradation;Propulsion;Power electronics;Power demand;Battery powered vehicles;Heart","","195","3","12","IEEE","30 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We derive the moment generating function (MGF) of instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after space-time block decoding (signal combining) in such channels. Using a well-known MGF-based analysis approach, we express the average SER of the STBC in the form of single finite-range integrals whose integrand contains only the derived MGF. Numerical results show that the keyhole significantly degrades the SER performance of the STBC from idealistic behaviors in independent identically distributed MIMO channels.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.823540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275699","","Performance analysis;Block codes;Fading;MIMO;Transmitters;Error analysis;Signal generators;Signal to noise ratio;Decoding;Degradation","","194","","24","IEEE","22 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is observed that, for the narrow-band case, the measured channel coefficients are complex Gaussian distributed and, consequently, we focus on a statistical description using the first- and second-order moments of MIMO radio channels. It is shown that the MIMO channel covariance matrix can be well approximated by the Kronecker product of the covariance matrices, seen from the transmitter and receiver, respectively. A narrow-band model for NLoS indoor MIMO channels is thus verified by these results. As for the wide-band case, it is observed that the average power-delay profile of each element of the channel impulse response matrix fits the exponential decay curve and that the Kronecker structure of the second-order moments can be extended to each channel tap. A wide-band MIMO channel model is then proposed, combining a simple COST 259 single-input-single-output channel model and the Kronecker structure. Monte Carlo simulations are used to generate indoor MIMO channel realizations according to the models discussed. The results are compared with the measured data using the channel capacity and good agreement is found.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.827164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300860","","Wideband;MIMO;Channel capacity;Radio transmitters;Narrowband;Covariance matrix;Receivers;Antenna measurements;Broadband antennas;Block codes","","194","3","59","IEEE","24 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main features of a MAC protocol are high throughput, good fairness, energy efficiency, and support priority guarantees, especially under distributed contention-based environment. Based on the current standardized IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) protocol, this paper proposes a new efficient collision resolution mechanism, called GDCF. Our main motivation is based on the observation that 802.11 DCF decreases the contention window to the initial value after each success transmission, which essentially assumes that each successful transmission is an indication that the system is under low traffic loading. GDCF takes a more conservative measure by halving the contention window size after c consecutive successful transmissions. This ""gentle"" decrease can reduce the collision probability, especially when the number of competing nodes is large. We compute the optimal value for c and the numerical results from both analysis and simulation demonstrate that GDCF significantly improve the performance of 802.11 DCF, including throughput, fairness, and energy efficiency. In addition, GDCF is flexible for supporting priority access by selecting different values of c for different traffic types and is very easy to implement it, as it does not requires any changes in control message structure and access procedures in DCF.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.830951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317225","","Energy resolution;Media Access Protocol;Throughput;Energy efficiency;Road accidents;Wireless application protocol;Wireless LAN;Telecommunication traffic;Size measurement;Performance analysis","","194","5","12","IEEE","26 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main advantage of this new formulation is that it can be used with any field defining irreducible polynomial. Using this formulation, we then develop a generalized architecture for the multiplier and analyze the time and gate complexities of the proposed multiplier as a function of degree m and the reduction matrix Q. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these complexities are given in terms of Q. Unlike most other articles on bit parallel finite field multipliers, here we also consider the number of signals to be routed in hardware implementation and we show that, compared to the well-known Mastrovito's multiplier, the proposed architecture has fewer routed signals. The proposed generalized architecture is further optimized for three special types of polynomials, namely, equally spaced polynomials, trinomials, and pentanomials. We have obtained explicit formulas and complexities of the multipliers for these three special irreducible polynomials. This makes it very easy for a designer to implement the proposed multipliers using hardware description languages like VHDL and Verilog with minimum knowledge of finite field arithmetic.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2004.47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306989","Finite or Galois field;Mastrovito multiplier;all-one polynomial;polynomial basis;trinomial;pentanomial and equally-spaced polynomial.","Parallel architectures;Galois fields;Polynomials;Multiplying circuits;Digital arithmetic","","194","4","28","IEEE","21 Jun 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Turbo space-time multiuser detection (ST MUD) is employed for intracell communications and is shown to closely approach the ultimate capacity limits in Gaussian ambient noise for an isolated cell. Then, it is combined with various multiuser detection methods for combating intercell interference. Among various multiuser detection techniques examined, linear minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) MUD and successive interference cancellation are shown to be feasible and effective. Based on these two multiuser detection schemes, one of which may outperform the other for different settings, an adaptive detection scheme is developed, which together with a Turbo ST MUD structure offers substantial performance gain over the well-known V-BLAST techniques with coding in this interference-limited cellular environment. The obtained multiuser capacity is excellent in the high to medium signal-to-interference ratio scenario. Nonetheless, numerical results also indicate that a further increase in system complexity, using base-station cooperation, could lead to further significant increases of the system capacity. The asymptotic multicell MIMO capacity with linear MMSE MUD preprocessing is also derived, and this analysis agrees well with the simulation results.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2003.821168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1271237","","Downlink;MIMO;Multiuser detection;Interchannel interference;Receiving antennas;Gaussian noise;Noise cancellation;Antenna arrays;Signal processing;Interference cancellation","","194","13","33","IEEE","8 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithms were analyzed by tabulating true and false detections when applied to a set of realistic artificial neural signals with known spike times and varying signal to noise ratios. A design-specific cost function was developed to score the relative merits of each detector; correct detections increased the score, while false detections and computational burden reduced it. Test signals both with and without overlapping action potentials were considered. We also investigated the utility of rejecting spikes that violate a minimum refractory period by occurring within a fixed time window after the preceding threshold crossing. Our results indicate that the cost-function scores for the absolute value operator were comparable to those for more elaborate nonlinear energy operator based detectors. The absolute value operator scores were enhanced when the refractory period check was used. Matched-filter-based detectors scored poorly due to their relatively large computational requirements that would be difficult to implement in a real-time system.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.826683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1300781","","Detectors;Hardware;Signal to noise ratio;Application specific integrated circuits;Testing;Extracellular;Biomedical engineering;Bandwidth;Signal analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Animals;Brain;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Neurons;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","193","17","25","IEEE","24 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The architecture is backward compatible for users on existing TDM-PONs, while simultaneously capable of providing upgraded high-bandwidth services to new users on DWDM-PONs through advanced WDM techniques.

A semipassive configuration of the Remote Nodes (RNs) enables protection and restoration, making the network resilient to power failures. A novel design of the OLT and DWDM-PON ONUs minimizes the system cost considerably: 1) tunable lasers and receivers at the OLT are shared by all ONUs on the network to reduce the transceiver count and 2) the fast tunable lasers not only generate downstream data traffic but also provide DWDM-PON ONUs with optical CW bursts for their upstream data transmission.

Currently, each of these applications requires their proprietary functionality support. A general unified framework may be a desirable alternative to application-specific overlays. We introduce the concept of overlay brokers (OBs). We assume that each autonomous system in the Internet has one or more OBs. These OBs cooperate with each other to form an overlay service network (OSN) and provide overlay service support for overlay applications, such as resource allocation and negotiation, overlay routing, topology discovery, and other functionalities. The scope of our effort is the support of quality-of-service (QoS) in overlay networks. Our primary focus is on the design of QoS-aware routing protocols for overlay networks (QRONs). The goal of QRON is to find a QoS-satisfied overlay path, while trying to balance the overlay traffic among the OBs and the overlay links in the OSN. A subset of OBs, connected by the overlay paths, can form an application specific overlay network for an overlay application. The proposed QRON algorithm adopts a hierarchical methodology that enhances its scalability. We analyze two different types of path selection algorithms. We have simulated the protocols based on the transit-stub topologies produced by GT-ITM. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms perform well in providing a QoS-aware overlay routing service.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.818782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1258113","","Intelligent networks;Web and internet services;Network topology;Quality of service;IP networks;Peer to peer computing;Fault detection;Routing protocols;Bandwidth;Resource management","","192","3","33","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Exciting perspectives may be offered by electrical insulation. Polymeric nanofilled materials may find new and/or upgraded applications in the electrical and electronic industry, replacing conventional insulation to provide improved performances in electrical apparatus, as regards, e.g., reliability, environmental compatibility and power rating. This paper shows that electrical properties of nanocomposite insulating materials for DC applications, specifically space charge, conductivity and breakdown voltage, can improve significantly with respect to the basis, unfilled materials. Reference is made to two polymeric materials, i.e. poly(ethylene-covinylacetate) (EVA) and polypropylene (PP), that are widely used as electrical insulation, e.g. for cables and capacitors. The nanofiller consists of an organophilic layered silicate, specifically an extra-pure synthetic fluorohectorite modified by means of interlayer exchange of sodium cations for protonated octadecylamine NH/sub 3//sup +/ (ODA), in a weight concentration of maximum 6%. In both materials the space charge accumulation rate as a function of applied electric field is significantly reduced, while the electrical conductivity is raised. The breakdown voltage can increase for the nanofilled materials.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2004.1349780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1349780","","Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Conducting materials;Nanostructured materials;Polymers;Plastic insulation;Space charge;Conductivity;Electronics industry;Materials reliability;Cable insulation","","192","1","37","IEEE","1 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Denoising functional MR images: a comparison of wavelet denoising and Gaussian smoothing","A. M. Wink; J. B. T. M.

One-dimensional WaveLab thresholding routines were adapted to two-dimensional (2-D) images, and applied to 2-D wavelet coefficients. To test the effect of these methods on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we compared the SNR of 2-D fMRI images before and after denoising, using both Gaussian smoothing and wavelet-based methods. We simulated a fMRI series with a time signal in an active spot, and tested the methods on noisy copies of it. The denoising methods were evaluated in two ways: by the average temporal SNR inside the original activated spot, and by the shape of the spot detected by thresholding the temporal SNR maps. Denoising methods that introduce much smoothness are better suited for low SNRs, but for images of reasonable quality they are not preferable, because they introduce heavy deformations. Wavelet-based denoising methods that introduce less smoothing preserve the sharpness of the images and retain the original shapes of active regions. We also performed statistical parametric mapping on the denoised simulated time series, as well as on a real fMRI data set. False discovery rate control was used to correct for multiple comparisons. The results show that the methods that produce smooth images introduce more false positives. The less smoothing wavelet-based methods, although generating more false negatives, produce a smaller total number of errors than Gaussian smoothing or wavelet-based methods with a large smoothing effect.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.824234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269883","","Noise reduction;Smoothing methods;Two dimensional displays;Testing;Shape;Waves;Magnetic resonance imaging;Image analysis;Magnetic analysis;Wavelet coefficients","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Humans;Image Enhancement;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Normal Distribution;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stochastic Processes","192","","32","IEEE","3 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A T2FNN consists of a type-2 fuzzy linguistic process as the antecedent part, and the two-layer interval neural network as the consequent part. A general T2FNN is computational-intensive due to the complexity of type 2 to type 1 reduction. Therefore, the interval T2FNN is adopted in this paper to simplify the computational process. The dynamical optimal training algorithm for the two-layer consequent part of interval T2FNN is first developed. The stable and optimal left and right learning rates for the interval neural network, in the sense of maximum error reduction, can be derived for each iteration in the training process (back propagation). It can also be shown both learning rates cannot be both negative. Further, due to variation of the initial MF parameters, i.e., the spread level of uncertain means or deviations of interval Gaussian MFs, the performance of back propagation training process may be affected. To achieve better total performance, a genetic algorithm (GA) is designed to search optimal spread rate for uncertain means and optimal learning for the antecedent part. Several examples are fully illustrated. Excellent results are obtained for the truck backing-up control and the identification of nonlinear system, which yield more improved performance than those using type-1 FNN.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2004.825927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1298894","","Fuzzy neural networks;Neural networks;Fuzzy logic;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Feedback;Fuzzy Logic;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated","192","","29","IEEE","18 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then propose a shape representation method that fulfills these criteria. In the proposed approach, contour convexities and concavities at different scale levels are represented using a two-dimensional (2-D) matrix. The representation can be visualized as a 2-D surface, where ""hills"" and ""valleys"" represent contour convexities and concavities, respectively. The optimal matching of two shape representations is achieved using dynamic programming and a dissimilarity measure is defined based on this matching. The proposed algorithm is very efficient and invariant to several kinds of transformations including some articulations and modest occlusions. The retrieval performance of the approach is illustrated using the MPEG-7 shape database, which is one of the most complete shape databases currently available. Our experiments indicate that the proposed representation is well suited for object indexing and retrieval in large databases. Furthermore, the representation can be used as a starting point to obtain more compact descriptors.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2004.826776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294965","","Shape measurement;Humans;Information retrieval;Two dimensional displays;Indexing;Multimedia databases;Character recognition;Image retrieval;Object recognition;Data visualization","","192","","26","IEEE","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Briefly, deafness is caused when a transmitter fails to communicate to its intended receiver, because the receiver is beamformed towards a direction away from the transmitter. Existing CSMA/CA protocols rely on the assumption that congestion is the predominant cause of communication failure, and adopt backoff schemes to handle congestion. While this may be appropriate for omnidirectional antennas, for directional antennas, both deafness and congestion can be the reason for communication failures. An appropriate directional MAC protocol needs to classify the actual cause of failure, and react accordingly. This paper quantifies the impact of deafness on directional medium access control, and proposes a tone-based mechanism as one way of addressing deafness. The tone-based mechanism, ToneDMAC, assumes congestion as the default reason for communication failures, and applies a corrective measure whenever the cause is deafness. Simulation results indicate that ToneDMAC can alleviate deafness, and perform better than existing directional MAC protocols.","1092-1648","0-7695-2161-4","10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348118","","Deafness;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Directional antennas;Media Access Protocol;Transmitters;Array signal processing;Computer science;Computer networks;Design engineering","","191","5","19","IEEE","1 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We also design the number of pilots, and the power distributed between information bearing and pilot symbols, using as criterion a lower bound on the average capacity.

The development of China's power industry has proposed new requirements for power systems to ensure secure and stable operations. The principal standards for the security and stability of China's current power systems are analyzed in terms of operational control, generator-grid coordination and simulation. The shortcomings are pointed out and the directions of future development are discussed. In the end, the study highlighted the following key areas that require further research and improvement: the evaluation criteria of power system security and stability should be improved to ensure the secure and stable operation of China's power systems; the operational control standards should be constantly enhanced to increase the reliability and flexibility of operational control strategies; generator-grid coordination standards should be upgraded to improve the coordination between the generator control protection system and the grid; and the simulation methodology should be standardized in future power system security and stability research.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2017.00650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8233579","Generator-grid coordination;operationalcontrol;planning and design;power system security andstability standards;simulation","Power system stability;Stability criteria;Standards;Power system security;Accidents;Power grids","","30","","","","25 Dec 2017","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

In this study, a new current statistical model and a new Kalman filter are proposed to improve the performance of maneuvering target tracking. The new model which employs innovation dominated subjection function to adaptively adjust maneuvering frequency has a better performance in step maneuvering target tracking, while a fluctuant phenomenon appears. As far as this problem is concerned, a new adaptive fading Kalman filter is proposed as well. In the new Kalman filter, the prediction values are amended in time by setting judgment and amendment rules, so that tracking precision and fluctuant phenomenon of the new current statistical model are improved.

Then, IGC control laws are designed using the trajectory linearization control (TLC). A nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is introduced to the IGC controller to reject various uncertainties, such as the aerodynamic parameter perturbation and the measurement error interference. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven by using the Lyapunov theorem. The performance of the proposed IGC design method is verised in a terminal attack mission of the suicide UCAV.

Due to the convenience of using conventional voltage-source systems for connecting a common bus voltage with multiple downstream loads, the same configuration is often adopted for current-source systems, where design optimization can be achieved without an intermediate (bus) voltage regulator. However, the stability of such cascaded current-source systems is still relatively unexplored or incomplete, though the associated basic circuit theory has been well established. In this paper, steady-state operating points are obtained by applying power balance between the current-source output converter and the downstream converters. The incremental change of the input power versus the input impedance of the downstream converters is derived. The stability of such current-source converter systems is re-visited using an impedance-based approach. A general set of impedance-based stability criteria is developed and experimentally verified by a DC bus system consisting of a current source output converter and two PWM power converters.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2017.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7948000","DC bus system;DC current source converter;stability criterion","Stability criteria;Power system stability;Circuit stability;Voltage control;Resistance;Impedance","","10","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

In order to solve such problem, self-adaptive stepsize affine projection algorithm for parameter estimation of IPMSM is proposed in this paper. Compared with traditional affine projection algorithm, this method can obtain the stepsize automatically based on the operation condition, which can ensure the convergence and celerity of the process of parameter estimation. Then, on the basis of self-adaptive stepsize affine projection algorithm, a novel parameter estimation method based on square-wave current injection is proposed. By this method, the error of estimated parameter caused by stator resistance, linkage magnetic flux and dead-time voltage can be reduced effectively. Finally, the proposed parameter estimation method is verified by experiments on a 2.2-kW IPMSM drive platform.","2096-3564","","10.23919/TEMS.2017.7911108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911108","Affine projection;parameter estimation;permanent magnet synchronous machine;square-current injection;self-adaptive stepsize","Decision support systems","","6","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","CES","CES Journals"

One example of fractal radial structure and one fractal meshed structure are presented. The likely evolution path is then proposed together with basic technology sets. Specific foundation technologies are discussed in detail, including adiabatic power conversion, 3MC technology, medium voltage conversion, distribution-level electronic power transformer and FACTs hardware integration, and back-to-back converters as a universal interconnect element. The rapidly emerging on-wire sensing technology is also discussed.

However, individuals may differ considerably in terms of organ size and shape. In this study, the authors sought to determine the energy-dependent standard deviations due to lung size of the dose absorbed by the lung during external photon and neutron beam exposures. One hundred lungs with different masses were prepared and located in an adult male International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference phantom. Calculations were performed using the Monte Carlo N-particle code version 5 (MCNP5). Variation in the lung mass caused great uncertainty: ~90% for low-energy broad parallel photon beams. However, for high-energy photons, the lung-absorbed dose dependency on the anatomical variation was reduced to <1%. In addition, the results obtained indicated that the discrepancy in the lung-absorbed dose varied from 0.6% to 8% for neutron beam exposure. Consequently, the relationship between absorbed dose and organ volume was found to be significant for low-energy photon sources, whereas for higher energy photon sources the organ-absorbed dose was independent of the organ volume. In the case of neutron beam exposure, the maximum discrepancy (of 8%) occurred in the energy range between 0.1 and 5 MeV.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8159562","statistical phantom;lung-absorbed dose;broad parallel beams;MCNP5;mono-energetic photon and neutron exposures","","","3","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using an existing adaptive environment prototype, we conducted a controlled study testing how the reversal of control (where the environment attempts to influence the behaviour of the inhabitant) would affect participants. Most participants changed their respiratory behaviour in accordance with this environmental manipulation. Behavioural change occurred either consciously or unconsciously. We explain the two different paths leading participants to behavioural change: (i) we adapt the model of interbodily resonance, a process of bodily interaction observable between, for example, partners engaged in verbal dialogue, to describe the unconscious bodily response to subtle changes in the environment and (ii) we apply the model of secondary control, an adjustment of one's own expectations to maintain the pretence of control, to describe conscious cognitive adaptation to the changing environment.

Literature on value-sensitive design (VSD) and technology ethics has advocated for a range of design methods that propose different roles and responsibility for ethics during technology development. This paper explores four provocations that imagine different roles and responsibilities for moral and ethical reasoning on design teams: participatory design (in which diverse stakeholders may represent their own values in the design process), values advocates (introducing experts to lead values discussions or conduct ethics interventions), embedding values discussions within design and encouraging ‘moral exemplars’ within design. Each of these posits different logistical arrangements as well as different levels of expertise in ethical practice. The paper uses examples from the VSD and computer ethics literatures as well as the authors' ethnographic work to explore the advantages, challenges and consequences of each approach.","1873-7951","","10.1093/iwc/iww002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155238","participatory design;HCI theory, concepts, and models;ethnographic studies;programming teams;technology ethics","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Current algorithms lack control of key network parameters, the ability to specify to what subgraphs a node belongs to, come at a considerable complexity cost or, critically and sample from a limited ensemble of networks. To enable controlled investigations of the impact and role of subgraphs, especially for epidemics, neuronal activity or complex contagion, it is essential that the generation process be versatile and the generated networks as diverse as possible. In this article, we present two new network generation algorithms that use subgraphs as building blocks to construct networks preserving a given degree sequence. Additionally, these algorithms provide control over clustering both at node and global level. In both cases, we show that, despite being constrained by a degree sequence and global clustering, generated networks have markedly different topologies as evidenced by both subgraph prevalence and distribution around nodes, and large-scale network structure metrics such as path length and betweenness measures. Simulations of standard epidemic and complex contagion models on those networks reveal that degree distribution and global clustering do not always accurately predict the outcome of dynamical processes taking place on them. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of both methods.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnw011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8149446","networks;clustering;subgraphs;epidemics;complex contagion","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"The properties of integral models for planar and axisymmetric unsteady jets","J. Craske",NA,IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics,"18 Jan 2018","2017","82","2","305","333","This article reviews and builds upon recent progress that has been made in understanding the mathematical properties of integral models for unsteady turbulent jets. The focus is on models that describe the evolution of the volume flux and the momentum flux in a jet, whose source conditions are time dependent. A generalized approach that postpones making assumptions about the ‘internal’ properties of the flow, such as the radial dependence of the longitudinal velocity profile, turbulent transport and pressure, allows one to understand how the resulting integral equations are affected by model-specific assumptions. Whereas the assumptions invoked in previous unsteady jet models have resulted in a parabolic system of equations, generalized equations that are derived from first principles have a hyperbolic character and statistical stability that depends sensitively on assumptions that are normally invoked a priori. Unsteady axisymmetric jets with Gaussian velocity profiles have special properties, including a tendency to remain straight-sided (conical) and marginal stability in response to source perturbations. A distinct difference between planar jets and axisymmetric jets is that the mean energy flux, which plays a leading-order role in determining the unsteady dynamics of jets, is significantly lower in planar jets. We hypothesize that in order to maintain marginal stability the turbulence and pressure fields in planar jets adjust themselves, relative to axisymmetric jets, to compensate for the lower mean energy flux.","1464-3634","","10.1093/imamat/hxw043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8226498","turbulent jets;stability;integral models","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Our Year With the Glass: Expectations, Letdowns and Ethical Dilemmas of Technology Trials With Vulnerable People","J. Vines; R. McNaney; A. Holden; I. Poliakov; P. Wright; P. Olivier",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Interacting with Computers,"18 Jan 2018","2017","29","1","27","44","In this paper, we reflect upon the ethical dilemmas faced during our research exploring the potential of Google Glass as a self-care technology for people with Parkinson's. Our project involved two stages of research: an initial study that explored the overall acceptability and responses of people with Parkinson's to the technology; and a follow-up study that examined participants’ experiences of the technology in more depth through further trials and a series of co-design activities. While our first trials were successful, leading to publication and subsequent local and national publicity, our follow-up trials were hampered by technical problems that were often out of our control. We highlight how participants’ heightened expectations prior to the second trial, as a result of public discourse around the project, were difficult to meet. This led to our participants articulating their frustrations, feelings of lowered self-confidence, and in some cases a reduced sense of self-worth. We reflect on how the decisions and actions taken during the project led to these dilemmas, and how these relate to contemporary challenges in human-computer interaction research where there is increased focus on in the wild studies of technology use and a pressure to publicly disseminate the findings of research. In doing so, we offer an open and honest account of how a set of ethical dilemmas emerged while conducting technology field trials with a potentially vulnerable group, and offer guidance to future researchers finding themselves in similar circumstances. We conducted ‘in the wild’ deployments of Google Glass with people with Parkinson's. There were several ethical implications of conducting this type of research, wherein the technology in question was still being developed and updated by its commercial manufacturer. Prior publicity about our project caused participants to formulate overly positive preconceptions around the technology.

"Adequate target volume in total-body irradiation by intensity-modulated radiation therapy using helical tomotherapy: a simulation study","R. Takenaka; A. Haga; H. Yamashita; K. Nakagawa",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2017","58","2","210","216","Recently, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been used for total-body irradiation (TBI). Since the planning target volume (PTV) for TBI includes the surrounding air, a dose prescription to the PTV provides high fluence to the body surface. Thus with just a small set-up error, the body might be exposed to a high-fluence beam. This study aims to assess which target volume should be prescribed the dose, such as a clinical target volume (CTV) with a margin, or a CTV that excludes the surface area of the skin. Three treatment plans were created for each patient: the 5-mm clipped plan (Plan A), the 0-mm margin plan (Plan B) and the 5-mm margin plan (Plan C). The CTV was the whole body. PTVs were the CTV with the exception of 5 mm from the skin surface in Plan A, equal to the CTV in Plan B, and the CTV with a 5 mm margin in Plan C. The prescribed dose was 12 Gy in six fractions. To assess the influence of the set-up error, dose distributions were simulated on computed tomography (CT) images shifted 2 pixels (= 4.296 mm), 5 pixels (= 10.74 mm) and 10 pixels (= 21.48 mm) in the lateral direction from the original CT. With a set-up error of 10.74 mm, V 110% was 8.8%, 11.1% and 23.3% in Plans A, B and C, respectively. The prescription to the PTV containing the surrounding air can be paradoxically vulnerable to a high-dose as a consequence of a small set-up error.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8159919","total-body irradiation;intensity-modulated radiation therapy;helical tomotherapy;set-up error;PTV margin","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our notion of state is quite general, and is able to represent resource allocation problems in distributed systems. The underlying logic is a variant of the modal logic of bunched implications, and based on resource semantics, which is closely related to concurrent separation logic. We consider a labelled transition semantics and establish conditions under which Hennessy—Milner soundness and completeness hold. By considering notions of cost, strategy and utility, we are able to formulate characterizations of Pareto optimality, best responses, and Nash equilibrium within resource semantics. We also show that our logic is able to serve as a logic for a fully featured process algebra and explain the interaction between utility and the structure of processes.","1465-363X","","10.1093/logcom/exw030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8210200","Substructural logic;bunched logic;modal logic;process algebra;resource semantics;Hennessy—Milner logic utility;Pareto optimality;Nash equilibrium","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Semantic subtyping is an approach for defining subtyping relation based on set-theoretic models, rather than syntactic rules. On the one hand, this approach involves some non-trivial mathematical machinery in the background. On the other hand, final users of the language need not know this machinery and the resulting subtyping relation is very powerful and intuitive. While semantic subtyping is naturally linked to the structural one, we show how our framework can also accommodate the nominal subtyping. Several examples show the expressivity and the practical advantages of our proposal.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxw080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8204555","semantic subtyping;object-oriented languages;type theory;Featherweight Java;nominal and structural subtyping","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"An analytic solution for gust-aerofoil interaction noise including effects of geometry","L. J. Ayton",NA,IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics,"18 Jan 2018","2017","82","2","280","304","An analytic solution is obtained for the sound generated by gust-aerofoil interaction for aerofoils with thickness, camber and angle of attack. The model is based on the linearization of the Euler equations about a steady subsonic flow, and is an extension of previous work which considered restrictive aerofoil geometries. Only high-frequency incident gusts are considered. The aerofoil thickness, camber and angle of attack are such that the steady flow past the aerofoil is seen as a small perturbation to uniform flow. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to identify regions around the aerofoil where different processes govern the generation or propagation of sound. Key local regions at the leading and trailing edges of the aerofoil determine the generation of noise whilst transition regions along the rigid aerofoil surface, and outer regions away from the surface play key roles in the propagation of sound. The effects of varying thickness and camber angle are discussed, along with the effects of varying the radius of the leading edge.","1464-3634","","10.1093/imamat/hxw038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8226497","gust-aerofoil interaction;leading-edge noise;asymptotic analysis;Wiener–Hopf method","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Generally, these sources are integrated at the distribution utilities to supply the local distribution customers. If the power generated by these sources is bulk, then they are either integrated at the distribution/transmission level or may be operated in an island mode if feasible. The integration of these renewables in the power network will change the fault level and network topologies. These fault levels are intermittent in nature and existing protection schemes may fail to operate because of their pre-set condition. Therefore, the design and selection of a proper protection scheme is very much essential for reliable control and operation of renewable integrated power systems. Depending upon the level of infeed and location of the renewable integration, the protection requirements are different. For low renewable infeed at the distribution level, the existing relay settings are immune from any small change in the network fault current from new incoming renewables. However, bulk renewable infeed requires modification in the existing protection schemes to accommodate the fault current variation from the incoming renewables. For bulk penetration of the renewable, the requirement of modified/additional protection schemes is unavoidable. Adaptive relaying and non-adaptive relaying schemes are discussed in the literature for protection of power networks, which are experiencing dynamic fault currents and frequent changing network topologies. This article presents a detailed review of protection schemes for renewable integrated power networks which includes distribution, transmission and microgrid systems. The merits and demerits of these protection schemes are also identified in this article for the added interest of the readers. The visible scope of advance protection schemes which may be suitable for providing reliable protection for dynamic fault current networks is also explored.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2017.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8233582","Adaptive relaying;distribution systems;distance protection;doubly fed induction generator;microgrid;protection;renewable energy source.","Fault currents;Circuit faults;Protective relaying;Power system reliability;Reliability","","217","","","","25 Dec 2017","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Since the best renewable energy resources are far away from load centers in the east and southeast, transmission over long distances is required. Over 20 high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines, with a combined capacity exceeding 150 GW, are in operation or are currently under construction. This rapid expansion of new generation and transmission capacities based on power electronics starts to change the characteristics of the grid, especially in areas where they concentrate, creating new stability problems and operational challenges. New system theories and technologies are required to support the development and operation of a future grid that relies more and more on power electronics. This paper highlights the characteristics of power electronics as used in renewable energy generation and HVDC transmission systems, discusses the impacts of these power-electronics-based assets on grid stability and operational requirements, and identifies opportunities for the development of both new system theories and system technologies to support a national energy policy that emphasizes the use of clean energy.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2017.01200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8233581","Grid code;high-voltage DC transmission;renewable energy;system resonance;system stability","HVDC transmission;Power electronics;Harmonic analysis;Power system stability;Renewable energy sources;Power system harmonics;Stability analysis","","156","","","","25 Dec 2017","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

However, this requires a new device, namely, a three-terminal tunable RNG or a p-bit, whose input terminal can be used to pin its output to 0 or 1.

A ring slot and a series of shorting vias are introduced into the patch to merge the two modes, enhancing the bandwidth of the passband. The combination of the two elements simultaneously generates a radiation null at the lower band edge.

Recently, it became very popular in solid-state transformer application, where fault tolerance is a highly desired feature and it is obtained through redundancy. This letter proposes a reconfiguration scheme for the SRC for the case of failure in one semiconductor, which could drastically reduce the need of redundancy. Using the proposed scheme, the full-bridge based SRC can be reconfigured in a half-bridge topology, in order to keep the converter operational even with the failure [open circuit (OC) or short circuit (SC)] of one switch. As a drawback of this technique, the output voltage drops to half of its original value. Therefore, a novel reconfigurable rectifier based on the voltage-doubler topology is proposed as a solution to keep the output voltage constant after the fault. To verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, the converter is tested experimentally in a 700-600 V prototype with 10 kW of output power. An insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) SC fault is tested and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2016.2585668","European Research Council(grant numbers:ERC Grant Agreement n. 616344 – Heart); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552527","Availability;dc–dc power converters;fault diagnosis;fault tolerance;isolated converter;reliability;resonant converter;series-resonant converter","Circuit faults;Topology;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Capacitors;Switches;DC-DC power converters","","94","","23","OAPA","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, as the bubble size decreases, the level of deep fade also decreases because the optical beam is less susceptible to complete obstruction, and more light reaches the detector.

However, as a result of the way that training data and predictor variables are randomly selected for use in constructing each tree and splitting each node, it is also well known that if too few trees are generated, variable importance rankings tend to differ between model runs. In this letter, we characterize the effect of the number of trees (ntree) and class separability on the stability of variable importance rankings and develop a systematic approach to define the number of model runs and/or trees required to achieve stability in variable importance measures. Results demonstrate that both a large ntree for a single model run, or averaged values across multiple model runs with fewer trees, are sufficient for achieving stable mean importance values.

We model an AC microgrid with energy generating units, local loads, and electronic devices. Then, the set of non-linear differential equations are expressed as a state-space model. As the microgrid is located in the customer premises or remote areas, its condition needs to monitor in real-time. So, the smart sensor requires to deploy around the microgrid, and its sensing information transmits to the energy management system via the Internet as the sensing information is a massive amount of data. Combining the Internet of Things elements, such as sensors (Internet emended), and the Internet as a transmission medium will form the Internet of Energy, which is considered as a sign interest nowadays. Basically, the energy management center estimates the microgrid states to know the operating conditions of these foreseeable intermittent resources. For estimating the microgrid states, the H-infinity-based Mimi-max filter is proposed, which will no need to know the exact process and measurement noise statistics. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can well estimate the system states compared with the existing Kalman filter.

With the development of highly compact circuits, the isolation between each terminal of a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system becomes more and more important to reach high system accuracy. Here, we propose an innovative approach of decoupling for a dual-band MSA, in which the isolation is achieved through two kinds of transmission lines based on the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) and miniaturized spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP). Both SIW and SSPP transmission lines have been used in functional devices and could be considered as part of radio frequency front-end circuits. Using the proposed method, the isolation between two ports of MSA is achieved without occupying extra space. A prototype is fabricated on the basis of a triple-layer dual-band MSA, each port of which is connected to one of the novel transmission lines. Combining the perfectly high-pass SIW and low-pass SSPP, the proposed feeding network could provide broadband decoupling without influencing the property of the antenna. We show that the mutual coupling between two ports is decreased by almost 20 dB within a wide frequency band. Such a design could meet the needs in application of multiantenna or tunable system without further alteration in dimensions and has potential to play an important role in the future communication systems.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2017.2742539","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631007,61571117); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013841","Decoupling;dual band;spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs);substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)","Ports (Computers);Substrates;Power transmission lines;Microstrip;Dual band;Antennas;Transmission line measurements","","61","","15","OAPA","21 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a novel method for predicting the types of weather based on the PV power data and partial meteorological data. By this method, the weather types are deduced by data analysis, instead of weather instrument. A better fault detection is obtained by using the support vector machines U+0028 SVM U+0029 and comparing the predicted and the actual weather. The model of the weather prediction is established by a direct SVM for training multiclass predictors. Although SVM is suitable for classification, the classified results depend on the type of the kernel, the parameters of the kernel, and the soft margin coefficient, which are difficult to choose. In this paper, these parameters are optimized by particle swarm optimization U+0028 PSO U+0029 algorithm in anticipation of good prediction results can be achieved.

Actually, some references have shown that the tags can readily realize three states: positive and negative phase backscatter, and non-backscatter. In this paper, we propose a new coding scheme for these tags with three states to improve the throughput of the ambient backscatter communication system. We then design a maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector for the reader to extract binary information from ternary coded signals. We also analyze the detection performance in terms of closed-form bit error rate (BER) expressions.

The atmospheric turbulence channel is emulated by a spatial light modulator on which a series of azimuthal phase patterns yielding Andrews' spectrum are recorded. A commercial coherent receiver is implemented at Bob's side, followed by a phase noise cancellation stage, where channel transmittance can be monitored accurately and phase noise can be effectively eliminated. Compared to four-state CV-QKD, eight-state CV-QKD protocol potentially provides a better performance by offering higher SKR, better excess noise tolerance, and longer secure transmission distance.

One G-AETCAM cell encodes the input and stored bit into one encoded bit which results in a match-line after passing from the AND-gate-array. Many architectures configure random-access memory (RAM) available on FPGAs as content-addressable storage architecture but are efficient for specific size and deal with data only in ascending or descending order while the proposed architecture provides freedom in size with no chance of making a single memory cell as useless and can store ternary data in any order.

An important feature of the developed VD-type rectenna is the absence of the charge pump capacitor that is present in conventional VDs. Based on the circuit simulation and measurement results, the developed VD-type rectenna shows drastic improvement to the radio frequency-to-direct current (RF-dc) conversion efficiency in comparison with a half-wave rectifier (HWR)-type rectenna at output loads exceeding 100 Ω. From the simulation, both the VD- and HWR-type rectennas show VD behavior, even without the charge pump capacitor. This behavior was found to be attributable to the electric charge stored in the junction and package capacitances of the Schottky barrier diode in the rectennas. Additionally, it was found that the improvement of the RF-dc conversion efficiency is caused by the voltage conservation in the series diode. This improvement is dependent on the microwave period and the electric discharge time constant. When the microwave period is comparable with the electric discharge time constant, the VD-type rectenna conserves a dc voltage even when the input microwave voltage is negative. These phenomena were observed by analyzing the voltage and current waveforms of the rectenna equivalent circuit obtained via circuit simulation.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2017.2668413","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:15K18051); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7879310","Capacitance;circuit simulation;equivalent circuits;microwave measurement;rectennas","Rectennas;Capacitors;Transmission line measurements;Integrated circuit modeling;Antenna measurements;Charge pumps;Dipole antennas","","36","","14","OAPA","15 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Owing to the explicit benefit of sparse FTN-IM signaling, the FTN-specific inter-symbol interference is mitigated in an effective manner, hence attaining a higher spectral efficiency than the conventional FTN counterpart. Furthermore, a low-complexity noise-whitening frequency-domain equalization is developed for our FTN-IM receiver.

A generalized approach for filtering penalty assessment is proposed and verified using a commercial 200G 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) transponder and WSS modules. A practical method for filter penalty reduction is described, whereby a single, optimized digital pre-equalization filter is used to compensate filtering effects of multiple concatenated WSSs.

Both one-bit and two-bit delta-sigma modulations were demonstrated, and the digitized signals were transmitted over on-off keying (OOK) or 4-level pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM4) optical intensity modulation-direct detection (IM-DD) links. 32 LTE component carriers (CCs) were digitized and transmitted over a 25-km single-λ 10-Gbaud OOK/PAM4 link, so that 32 LTE carrier aggregation (CA) specified by 3GPP release 13 can be supported. Compared with the conventional digitization interface based on CPRI, the fronthaul capacity is increased by four times. Error vector magnitude (EVM) less than 5% or 2.1% for all LTE CCs was obtained using one-bit and two-bit delta-sigma modulators, so that high-order modulations (256QAM/1024QAM) can be supported. As a waveform-agnostic digitization interface, delta-sigma modulation can digitize not only 4G-LTE but also 5G waveforms, and its 5G compatibility was verified by filter-bank-multicarrier (FBMC) signals. The tolerance to bit error ratio (BER) of the proposed delta-sigma modulation-based digital MFH was evaluated, and no significant EVM degradation was observed for BER up to 3 χ 10−5.

This paper proposes the ambient backscatter technique using multiple antennas. Since the tag only plays a role of reflecting signals, a signal is transmitted with a power allocation in the case of multiple antennas. At the receiving end, the higher power signal is detected first via the received signal. Next, signal from other antenna is detected by using the first detected signal. Since the backscatter technique generally uses energy detection, it has a low data rate using a single antenna. The proposed method can obtain a higher data rate than conventional methods by using multiple antennas. Also, it can be usefully used for the Internet of Things system, which requires high data rate through the proposed backscatter method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2732948","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIT) (Development of non-powered technology combined with ambient RF energy harvesting and Backscatter data transfer)(grant numbers:B0126-15-1076); IITP grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIT) (Development of Immersive Signage Based on Variable Transparency and Multiple Layers)(grant numbers:2017-0-00217); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995033","Ambient backscatter;multiple antenna;IoT","Backscatter;Wireless fidelity;Bit error rate;Radio frequency;Transmitting antennas;Receivers","","32","","14","OAPA","28 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be combined with NOMA to get the higher spectral efficiency. The main drawback of OFDM-based NOMA (OFDM-NOMA) scheme is high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Therefore, this paper presents a new discrete-cosine transform matrix precoding-based uplink OFDM-NOMA scheme for PAPR reduction. Additionally, the proposed precoding-based uplink multicarrier NOMA scheme takes advantage of information spreading over the entire signal spectrum; thus, bit-error rate is also reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed precodingbased NOMA scheme outperforms as compared with the non-precoding-based NOMA schemes available in the literature.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038791","NOMA;5G cellular networks;PAPR;DCTM;BER","NOMA;Precoding;Uplink;Peak to average power ratio;Phase shift keying","","30","","16","OAPA","15 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most of the existing temperature prediction models use small sample set. Today, the precision of them can not satisfy practical production. Fortunately, the large sample set is accumulated from the practical production process. However, a large sample set makes it difficult to build a liquid steel temperature model. To deal with the issue, the random forest method is preferred in this paper, which is a powerful regression method with low complexity and can be designed very quickly. It is with the parallel ensemble structure, uses sample subsets, and employs a simple learning algorithm of sub-models. Then, the random forest method is applied to establish a temperature model by using the data sampled from the production process. The experiments show that the random forest temperature model is more precise than other temperature models.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2016.7510247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783977","","Liquids;Steel;Furnaces;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Bagging;Training","","30","","","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The DCPCF is filled with magnetic fluids in the air holes, whose refractive index varies with the magnetic field strength. The two polarized modes are separated into the two cores at the output ports in a magnetic-free condition. When magnetic field is applied, the output intensities of the two polarized modes would fluctuate. The polarized modes can be ported out with arbitrary proportion by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. Moreover, the polarized mode would be completely converted at some magnetic field strength. The properties of the DCPCF are investigated by the finite element method (FEM), including mode-conversion magnetic field strength, extinction ratio, fabrication tolerance of the PBS, and the performance of PBS at various temperatures.

To address this problem, the paper proposes a control strategy to help the PVs work like a synchronous generator with variable inertia by energy storage system (ESS). First, the overall control strategy of the PV-based virtual synchronous generator (PV-VSG) is illustrated. Then the control strategies for the variable inertia of the PV-VSG are designed to attenuate the transient energy of the power system after the fault.

However, due to the quadratic differential in the FSM acceleration open-loop response, in fact, it is very difficult to realize an integral algorithm to compensate a quadratic differential in practical application. Thus, the conventional DOB controller has to be simplified further to make a concession, which eventuates in still insufficient disturbance compensation, particularly at low frequency. To solve this problem, an enhanced DOB control structure, which changes the compensation plant to be the acceleration open-loop and avoids the saturation of double integration skillfully, is proposed.

The equivalent impedance of rectifier load is complex impedance, which is affected not only by itself, but also by pre-stage circuit, such as impedance matching circuit parameters. It is hard to calculate the equivalent impedance of rectifier load directly to design the impedance matching circuit parameters. This paper investigates the LCC impedance matching design method for secondary side under rectifier load. Firstly, the transfer efficiency characteristic under rectifier load is studied, and the equivalent impedance is analyzed according to transfer efficiency. Then the impedance calculation method of secondary side under rectifier load is derived via formula derivation and Fourier series theory, and the LCC circuit parameters design method is proposed.

The cutting tool in this process is a core drill attached to an ultrasonic transducer, which generates longitudinal and bending vibrations. Thus an elliptical movement with ultrasonic frequency that is vertical to the working surface is formed at the cutting edge. The longitudinal vibration can help the cutting edge impact the workpiece and thus crush it. With the rotation of the cutting tool, the cutting edge scratches a groove on the working surface. While the bending vibration speeds up the movement of the cutting edge toward the workpiece in the working surface so as to amplify the fracture region. Moreover, a radial clearance assisting chip removal is made by the bending vibration.

"Modelling the Microgrid and Its Parameter Estimations Considering Fading Channels","M. M. Rana","Independent Researcher, Sydney, NSW, Australia",IEEE Access,"30 Jun 2017","2017","5","","10953","10958","As the electricity demand continues to grow and renewable energy resources are incorporated into the grid, an effective dynamic state estimation is required for monitoring and grid synchronization. This paper proposes a microgrid state estimation approach considering the unreliable communication channels. Particularly, the renewable microgrid incorporating distributed energy resources, such as solar panels, are represented as a state-space linear model. Then, the wireless sensor network is adopted to sense the microgrid states. For long-distance transmission, we propose an innovative smart grid infrastructure, which is easy to design and offers a reliable two-way communication. In this infrastructure, the modulated signal is transmitted over an unreliable channel, which causes signal distortions. After demodulation and dequantization, the received signal at the energy management system is used the fading Kalman filter algorithm. Using the tunable forgetting factor in the predicted error covariance step, this algorithm aims to minimize the estimation errors so the estimated states reflect the true system states. Simulations results indicate that the developed approach estimates the system states within 0.25 seconds.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2712790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7941984","Binary phase shift keying;distributed energy resources;fading channel;microgrid;Kalman filter","Microgrids;State estimation;Fading channels;Sensors;Energy management;Transmission line matrix methods;Smart grids","","19","","29","OAPA","7 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Received signal strength (RSS) based visible light positioning method is easy to implement because it requires simple hardware structure. However, in practical scenarios, the actual channel gain does not follow the ideal channel model. Instead of Lambertian channel model, some approximations have to be adopted to describe the relationship between received optical power and distance, and these approximations will cause deviation of positioning calculation. In this paper, an optical antenna based on freeform lens design is proposed to improve the accuracy of RSS-based positioning. With the optical antenna, the luminous intensity distribution is optimized, and the relationship between received optical power and distance becomes a simple linear relationship. Results show that RSS-based positioning system using freeform lens optical antenna can improve the positioning accuracy by 44%.

Based on the coupling effect of multilayer window-type metamatarials, the bandwidth of 1.25 THz with the index of more than 20 for the five-layer structure can be reached, and the refractive index peak reach to 50 while maintaining low losses. Importantly, the ultrabroadband performance with the bandwidth of 2.25 THz at the index larger than 20 was surprisingly indicated for multilayer coupling structure by a small incident angle. Simultaneously, the refractive index peak of more than 70 can be obtained.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2647558","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY17F050009); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY17F050009); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61405182,61377108,51401197); Public Technical International Cooperation Project of Science Technology, Department of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2015c340009); Zhejiang Students Research and Innovation Team Funded Projects(grant numbers:2016R409009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803575","Electromagnetic metamaterials;terahertz metamaterials","Metamaterials;Refractive index;Indexes;Nonhomogeneous media;Permeability;Permittivity;Metals","","18","","22","OAPA","2 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a method to address this problem without significantly complicating the original architecture. By properly introducing a dispersion module into the feedback loop, a different frequency component of chaotic spectrum will be subject to different time delay in feedback loop, thus destroying the generation mechanism of time delay signature (TDS). The concealment performance is verified by both time-domain and spectrum analysis methods. The relation between the amplitude of TDS and cavity dispersion value is evaluated in detail. Since the dispersion module has no filtering effect, the chaotic bandwidth will not be affected during the TDS concealment process. This proposal solves the security problem of feedback chaotic systems without introducing much extra effort in implementation, and the underlying principle is not restricted to all-optical chaotic systems but applies for other optelectrical chaotic dynamics, which include a feedback cavity.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2664341","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61322507,61575122); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7882637","Fiber non-linear optics;nonlinear optical effects in semiconductors.","Dispersion;Optical attenuators;Chaotic communication;Optical feedback;Optical filters;Cavity resonators;Optical fibers","","17","","24","OAPA","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to make full use of the spatial aperture of each component, the original uniform linear three-component EMVS array (ULTEA) is stretched into one half-wavelength spaced uniform linear loop subarray (ULLSA) along the z axis, and one sparse uniform linear co-centered orthogonally oriented dual-dipole (CODD) subarray (SULCSA) along the x axis. Then, a generalized rotation invariance based quaternion multiple signal classification (GRIQ-MUSIC) algorithm is presented for direction of arrival (DOA) and polarization parameters estimation. According to the proposed algorithm, the elevation angles are firstly estimated based on the half-wavelength spaced ULLSA. Then the polarization phase differences and azimuth angles are obtained based on the coupling relationship between the angle domain and polarization domain, but the azimuth angles are in coarse-resolution since the array aperture is not utilized. Next, the SULCSA is used to re-estimate the azimuth angles in fine resolution, and the ambiguity problem can be resolved by the least square method. Finally, based on the estimated elevation angles, azimuth angles and polarization phase differences, the corresponding auxiliary polarization angles can be estimated by N times one-dimensional parameter search, where N is the sources number, and the parameters high dimensional parameters search problemare matched automatically. Based on the GRIQ-MUSIC algorithm, the high dimensional parameters search problem of the conventional Q-MUSIC algorithm is simplified to a one-dimensional parameter search problem, thus the proposed algorithm not only reduces the computation complexity considerably, but also avoids the performance degradation caused by the failure in parameters pairing. The simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.01.01","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7870503","electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) array;generalized rotational invariance based quaternion multiple signal classification (GRIQ-MUSIC);direction of arrival (DOA);polarization","Quaternions;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Sensor arrays;Azimuth;Apertures;Data models","","17","","","","6 Mar 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The distinct thermo-optic coefficients between silica and air result in a high-temperature sensitivity of 41 pm/ °C, and the enclosed structure ensures its immunity to the external refractive index.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2671437","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61635007,61425007,61575128,61405128); Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2014A030308007,2014B050504010,2015B010105007,2015A030313541); Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen(grant numbers:GJHZ20150313093755757,JCYJ20160520163134575,JCYJ20160427104925452,JCYJ2015032414171161); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project(grant numbers:2015M572351,2016T90796); Pearl River Scholar Fellowships; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7862746","Hollow-core fiber;interferometer;temperature sensor.","Temperature sensors;Optical fiber sensors;Temperature measurement;Optical fibers;Interference","","17","","26","OAPA","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The axicon was fabricated on the cleaved endfacet of an SMF-28e optical fiber using a focused ion beam milling process. The lens converts the guided mode of the optical fiber (mode field diameter of 10.4 μm) into a Bessel-type beam with an extended depth of focus, which was verified both experimentally and by three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations. Axicon lenses with a diameter of 15 μm and heights of 3.5 and 5.0 μm were fabricated, and their focusing effect optically characterized through high-resolution confocal imaging, showing a focal spot size of 3.57 and 2.34 μm, respectively. The coupling efficiency from the axicon into a silicon-on-insulator photonic integrated circuit is comparable to that of a commercial tapered lensed fiber, and in some cases slightly higher. Due to the extended depth of focus, the axicon lens also offers a larger alignment tolerance in the longitudinal direction.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2710189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7938330","Axicon lens;fiber optics;focused ion beam milling","Lenses;Couplings;Optical device fabrication;Optical coupling;Optical diffraction;Optical refraction;Optical waveguides","","16","","20","OAPA","2 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of various indexes is conducted to obtain a unified parameter for describing the characteristics of power quality from an overall perspective. First, weight values of power quality indexes are calculated by combining the subjective and objective weight. Then, based on the principal components of the projection method, projection values of boundary data and data to be evaluated are obtained.

They mostly focused on either interference avoidance, based on the assumption that a receiver can only decode one transmission at a time, or self-interference cancellation, where a node can be a receiver and a transmitter at the same time. In this letter, we propose the first distributed communication protocol for SIC-based wireless networks, based on a novel message exchange and decision mechanism, to enable the simultaneous transmission of multiple neighboring nodes around the transmitter and receiver. The message exchange allows a random subset of neighboring nodes to test the feasibility of their simultaneous transmission. The decision mechanism evaluates the successive decoding capability of SIC receivers with the additional activation of neighboring nodes.

This new read mechanism significantly reduces the fabrication difficulties compared with MTJ-based designs.

One of the performance limiting factors in visible light communications is the nonlinear characteristics of the light-emitting diode (LED), which is used as a transmitter in VLC. Among seminal works for mitigating performance-limiting nonlinearity, the modified cascaded multimodulus algorithm (MCMMA) based Volterra filtering approaches have been proposed recently for blind LED postdistortion. This work proposes an unsupervised normalized Hammerstein improved multistage clustering (HIMSC) based postdistorter that is formulated as a more suitable cost function, as compared with the Volterra-MCMMA-based approaches. Theoretical bounds on step size are found to ensure convergence of the proposed postdistorter. Simulations over IEEE 802.15 personal area network (PAN) channels indicate that the proposed normalized HIMSC delivers much better performance as compared with the Volterra-MCMMA in terms of mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER) performance.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2639506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7784808","Multi-stage clustering equalizer;Hammerstein filtering;802.15 visible light communication (VLC) channel","Light emitting diodes;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Cost function;Equalizers;Convergence;Clustering algorithms;Adaptation models","","14","","22","CCBY","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We obtained two nulls as measured in the experiments, and we explain their origin. The nulls appear due to the transit time variation when the average photocurrent varies, and the transit time variation is due to the change of electron velocity when the average photocurrent varies. We also show that the AM-to-PM conversion coefficient depends only on the pulse energy and is independent of the pulse duration when the duration is less than 500 fs. When the pulse duration is larger than 500 fs, the nulls of the AM-to-PM conversion coefficient shift to larger average photocurrents. This shift occurs because the increase in that pulse duration leads to a decrease in the peak photocurrent. The AM-to-PM noise conversion coefficient changes as the repetition rate varies. However, the repetition rate does not change the AM-to-PM conversion coefficient as a function of input optical pulse energy. The repetition rate changes the average photocurrent.

Most of current models are built using the parametric density estimation (PDE) methods, which usually assume that the wind speed are subordinate to a certain known distribution (e.g. Weibull distribution and Normal distribution) and estimate the parameters of models with the historical data. This paper presents a kernel density estimation (KDE) method which is a nonparametric way to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of wind speed. The method is a kind of data-driven approach without making any assumption on the form of the underlying wind speed distribution, and capable of uncovering the statistical information hidden in the historical data. The proposed method is compared with three parametric models using wind data from six sites. The results indicate that the KDE outperforms the PDE in terms of accuracy and flexibility in describing the long-term wind speed distributions for all sites. A sensitivity analysis with respect to kernel functions is presented and Gauss kernel function is proved to be the best one. Case studies on a standard IEEE reliability test system (IEEE-RTS) have verified the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model in evaluating the reliability performance of wind farms.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0172-5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946848","Wind speed model;Kernel density estimation;Reliability evaluation;Wind power","Wind speed;Kernel;Estimation;Probability density function;Reliability;Power system reliability;Histograms","","13","","38","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

It was found that by using this material with a method of transient frequency analysis, a resistive gas sensor can operate reliably in a harsh environment, e.g., pure hydrogen and elevated humidity levels. A linear response in gas concentration was obtained from the analysis of transient sensor signal. This novel temperature modulation technique is more effective than an isothermal method where H2 background is introduced, due to the elimination of drift and additive noise in the sensor response that limits the practical utilization of these low-cost sensors.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2017.2709345","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/L018330/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942142","Chemical and biological sensors;gas sensor;hydrogen environment;hydrogen sulfide;temperature modulation","Temperature sensors;Gas detectors;Hydrogen;Temperature measurement;Modulation;Impurities","","12","1","16","OAPA","7 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To accomplish this objective, a process of associating each interleaved pulse with its emitter must be done. This process is termed sorting or de-interleaving. A novel point symmetry based radar sorting (PSBRS) algorithm is addressed. In order to deal with all kinds of radar signals, the symmetry measure distance is used to cluster pulses instead of the conventional Euclidean distance. The reference points of the symmetrical clusters are initialized by the alternative fuzzy c-means (AFCM) algorithm to ameliorate the effects of noise and the false sorting. Besides, the density filtering (DF) algorithm is proposed to discard the noise pulses or clutter. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated under the effects of noise and missing pulses. It has been observed that the PSBRS algorithm can cope with a large number of noise pulses and it is completely independent of missing pulses. Finally, PSBRS is compared with some benchmark algorithms, and the simulation results reveal the feasibility and efficiency of the algorithm.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.08","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038205","sorting radar pulse;symmetry;alternative fuzzy c-means;noise;missing pulse","Clustering algorithms;Sorting;Euclidean distance;Pulse measurements;Shape;Radar countermeasures","","12","","","","14 Sep 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Considering that the modeling of grey model U+0028 GM U+0029 depends on the preprocessing of the original data, the fractional-order accumulation calculus could be used to do preprocessing. In this paper, the residual sequence represented by Fourier series is used to ameliorate performance of the fractionalorder accumulation GM U+0028 1, 1 U+0029 and improve the accuracy of predictor. The state space model of optimally modified GM U+0028 1, 1 U+0029 predictor is given and genetic algorithm U+0028 GA U+0029 is used to find the smallest relative error during the modeling step. Furthermore, the fractional form of continuous GM U+0028 1, 1 U+0029 is given to enlarge the content of prediction model. The simulation results illustrated that the fractional-order calculus could be used to depict the GM precisely with more degrees of freedom. Meanwhile, the ranges of the parameters and model application could be enlarged with better performance. The method of modified GM predictor using optimal fractional-order accumulation calculus is expected to be widely used in data processing, model theory, prediction control and related fields.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2017.7510355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833248","","Mathematical model;Calculus;Predictive models;Data models;Genetic algorithms;Computational modeling;Fourier series","","12","","","","25 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cymgrd simulation software is then used to determine the acceptability of these measured resistivity values by finding out the root mean square error between the measured and calculated values for both wet and dry soil sites. These values for wet and dry soil sties were found to be only 0 % and 4.92 %, respectively, and deemed acceptable. The measured soil resistivity values were then used to evaluate the ground resistance values of a grounding grid ‘with rod’ for the wet soil site and ‘without rods’ for the dry soil site, and then compared with the simulated ground resistance values.

This QD array is further placed onto traditional color filter array, by matching the corresponding color filter pixel, in order to eliminate the blue light cross talk. In this case, the energy efficiency of this QD active color filter array no longer depends on its geometric arrangement and absorption properties, but depends on the quantum yield of QDs. Furthermore, 90% Adobe RGB color gamut can be achieved. One advantage of our fabrication method is synthesizing the QDs array onto the substrate directly, without the requirement of dissolving the QDs into other media.

Such problems are usually detected when patients or healthcare providers report abnormalities to medical authorities. Here, we test the hypothesis that defective production lots can be detected earlier by monitoring queries to Internet search engines. We extracted queries from the USA to the Bing search engine, which mentioned one of the 5195 pharmaceutical drugs during 2015 and all recall notifications issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during that year. By using attributes that quantify the change in query volume at the state level, we attempted to predict if a recall of a specific drug will be ordered by FDA in a time horizon ranging from 1 to 40 days in future. Our results show that future drug recalls can indeed be identified with an AUC of 0.791 and a lift at 5% of approximately 6 when predicting a recall occurring one day ahead. This performance degrades as prediction is made for longer periods ahead. The most indicative attributes for prediction are sudden spikes in query volume about a specific medicine in each state. Recalls of prescription drugs and those estimated to be of medium-risk are more likely to be identified using search query data. These findings suggest that aggregated Internet search engine data can be used to facilitate in early warning of faulty batches of medicines.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2017.2732945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995038","Pharmacovigilance;drug safety;rare classes;Internet search engines","Drugs;Search engines;Internet;US Government agencies;Production;Safety","","10","","15","OAPA","28 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Though VxLAN partially overcomes the capacity limitation of its predecessor virtual local area network, it still faces several challenges like annoying signaling overhead during the multicast period and interrupted communication with a migrating virtual machine (VM). In this paper, we propose a new software defined network (SDN) based VxLAN network architecture. Based on this architecture, we address how we can deploy an intelligent center to enhance the multicast capability and facilitate the VM migration.

With the help of the derived formula, the evolution properties of the spectral density, the effective beam width, and the spectral degree of coherence of the RMGSM beams in a uniaxial crystal are investigated in detail. It is shown that the evolution properties of an RMGSM beam in uniaxial crystal are much different from its evolution properties in free space, and the propagation properties of the RMGSM beams in uniaxial crystals are closely related to the initial beam parameters (beam index M and spatial coherence length) and the parameters of the uniaxial crystals (the ratio of extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices).

Although stochastic scattering in fibers is of great significance, until now, no accurate theoretical model has described the randomness of the distributions and variations in scattering since the scattering sources are regarded as centralized or homogeneously distributed. In this paper, we proposed a model to analyze the random variation in scattering with time and location. Then, we employed the model to simulate stochastic scattering in distributed fiber Raman amplification (FRA) systems, including Rayleigh backscattering and spontaneous Raman scattering, which are crucial limitations of the distributed FRA systems. The simulations agreed well with our experimental measurements, proving that our model efficiently described stochastic scattering spectra and distributions in FRAs. Our theory accurately analyzed the distribution and evolution of scattering along the fiber and is a promising tool for optimizing the performance of distributed fiber systems, especially systems with distributed amplification such as fiber communication systems, random feedback fiber lasers, and fiber sensors.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2777475","China 863 project(grant numbers:2015AA017002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231147","Rayleigh backscattering (RB);spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS);stimulated Raman scattering (SRS);fiber Raman amplification (FRA)","Raman scattering;Stochastic processes;Rayleigh scattering;Laser noise;Laser modes;Optical sensors","","9","","22","OAPA","20 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the principle of surface plasma resonance, a kind of dual-wavelength single polarizing filter with the broadband of low crosstalk was proposed in the paper by adopting good polarization characteristics of photonic crystal fiber. It could have single polarizing filtering in the dual-wavelength of 1310 and 1550 nm and the polarization direction of optical output is independent of the wavelength of incident light. The polarization direction of emergent light through filter can always keep the core mode in x-polarized direction (x-PCM) in a wide range of wavelength, which increases the difference of confinement loss of core mode in y-polarized direction (y-PCM) and x-PCM, and reduces mutual crosstalk. Meanwhile, the theoretical result also showed that the wavelength location and intensity of loss peak of polarizing mandrel are only affected by the air holes adjacent to fiber core and metal film and have little correlation with the structural parameters of other air holes, which ease the difficulty level of preparing filter based on photonic crystal fiber. Under certain structural parameters, the confinement loss of y-PCM could reach 265.04 dB/cm in 1310 nm and 230.5 dB/cm in 1550 nm. The half-width of confinement loss in the wavelength of 1310 nm is only 12 nm, while the loss of x-PCM is much smaller than that in y-PCM.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2711045","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61575066,60377100,61527822); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2014A030313428); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7938309","Photonic crystal fiber;surface plasma;polarizing filter;low crosstalk.","Metals;Optical fiber polarization;Optical fiber filters;Couplings;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber theory;Optical fiber devices","","9","","17","OAPA","2 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using raycasting techniques, the aperture model allows the prediction of the maximum gain pattern in the presence of obstructions. The maximum gain patterns are shown for a conformal antenna array integrated into the curved corner of a building, and a conformal antenna array integrated into the wing leading edge of an aircraft. This technique presents an invaluable tool to assess the viability of a conformal aperture on a structure, while allowing for variation of the structure to assess performance implications for the conformal antenna array.

The SNS structure acts as a band pass fiber (BPF), and the Bragg wavelengths of the two FBGs located at each edge of the BPF. Because the interference spectrum of the SNS is sensitive to refractive index (RI) but FBG is not, the reflective powers of the FBGs are modulated by the surrounding refractive index (SRI) and have contrary changing trends. The reflective intensity difference of the FBGs is used to describe the change of the SRI, which not only increases the RI sensitivity but diminishes the influence of the input light fluctuation as well. In addition, as the SNS and the FBGs have approximate temperature sensitivities, this sensor can accomplish temperature self-compensation. The experiments show that the RI sensitivity of this sensor is about -199.6 dB/RIU in the range of 1.3326-1.3702 and -355.5 dB/RIU in the range of 1.3702-1.4066, which is greater than the traditional SNS-FBG structure. However, its temperature sensitivity is only 0.0148 dB/°C.

Therefore, for electromagnetic compatibility designing purposes, knowledge of the DM noise of the household appliances in the frequency range of 150 kHz to 30 MHz is essential to provide insight of conducted disturbance on the low-voltage power-line network. In this paper, a simple and useful method of DM conducted emission (DMCE) measurement using a PLC coupler is proposed and it offers a suitable interface and a convenient way for the household appliance to obtain the DMCE with the existing equipment. The obtained results compare the levels of DMCE and mixed-mode conducted emission (MMCE) from different kind of household appliance. It shows that even when MMCE meets the current limits in standard CISPR 14, DMCE may still exceed these limits.

Firstly, a new model is constructed to describe the measurement process, based on which a new particle filter is developed with the ability to fuse multi-sensor information in the case of known delay probability. In addition, an online delay probability estimation module is introduced in the particle filtering framework, which leads to another new filter that can be implemented without the prior knowledge of delay probability. More importantly, since there is no complex iterative operation, the resulting filter can be implemented recursively and is suitable for many real-time applications.

In this paper, we propose to use optical-pulse compression in a standard optical fiber in order to enhance the RF output power. We use an optical two tone, or optical pulses generated with a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), as an optical-pulse source. In numerical simulation of the Mach-Zehnder modulator pulse, a maximum RF gain due to optical-pulse compression of 8.0 dB is obtained. In a 20-GHz RF generation experiment with a standard single-mode fiber and a Mach-Zehnder modulator pulse, an RF gain of 6.6 dB was obtained with a fiber length of 7.5 km and a launched average power to the fiber of 20.0 dBm. Furthermore, we found that 50 GHz, 75 GHz, and 100 GHz generation with RF gain is possible with realistic optical power if non-zero dispersion-shifted fiber is used as the transmission fiber, whereas highly nonlinear fiber is necessary for 300-GHz RF generation.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2017.8113429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8113429","","Optical pulses;Radio frequency;Optical modulation;Nonlinear optics;Optical pulse compression;Gain;Optical propagation","","9","","17","","16 Nov 2017","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

The performances of terahertz waveguides were investigated using the finite-element method. The results demonstrated that the hybrid slot waveguide (HSW) provides significantly enhanced field confinement in low index slot regions: more than five times that of traditional low index slot waveguides (LISWs). An optimized HSW structure was achieved by tuning the tradeoff between mode confinement and propagation length. We also showed that its integration in conventional planar waveguide circuits was greatly improved compared with the LISWs, by comparing their crosstalk.

The uniform linear motion and sway motion components are assumed to be responsible for the observed differences in comparison with the bistatic fixed antenna case. Correspondingly, simulations are conducted to study the sea clutter spectral characteristics for these two cases versus different system parameters and sea state conditions.

IEC 61000–4-30 Class A PQ measurements are used as a reference dataset for engineers and can be obtained simultaneously at different points in a network in an attempt to better understand the relative contribution by the source of distortion and the voltage supply network. The opportunity to improve the CIGRE/CIRED C4.109 approach by means of multiple-point synchronized network data is shown to be significant in the qualification of the statistical method but lacks the quantification in calculating the harmonic emission of a non-linear load. The CIGRE/CIRED method can be improved by only considering those harmonic currents identified as emission as some harmonic currents could be the result of background harmonic voltages in the supply network.

The discretization is applied to the state variables instead of time range in QSS. QSS is efficient to solve ODEs, but it is difficulty to be used when simulating actual power electronics systems with controller’s and other events. Based on the idea of this numerical algorithm and discrete event, a Discrete State Event Driven (DSED) simulation method is presented in this paper, which is fit for simulation of power electronics system. The method is developed to deal with non-linearity, stiffness and multi-time scale of power electronics systems. The DSED simulation method includes event definition, module seperation and modeling, event-driven mechanisms, numerical computation based on QSS, and some other operations. Simulation results verified the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method.","2096-3564","","10.23919/TEMS.2017.8086106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8086106","Discrete state event driven;simulation method;discontinuities and stiffness;power electronics systems","Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Algorithm design and analysis;Inverters;Switches","","8","2","","","30 Oct 2017","","","CES","CES Journals"

Both positive and negative defect modes are extremely sensitive to the defect strength and amplitude of periodic potential. Their eigenvalues increase almost linearly with the defect strength and continuously jump among neighboring gaps in the entire defect strength domain. There exists a phase transition point where two adjacent defect mode curves merge into a single one. Below which the eigenvalues are real, and their profiles have the same symmetry as the parity-time symmetric potential. Above the transition point, the defect modes give rise to complex eigenvalues, and the above symmetric property is destroyed. The transition point also grows linearly with the defect strength. As defect strength increases, much more positive defect mode branches merge together and more phase transition points appear in each gap. However, only one phase transition point exists for negative defect modes, and moves into the higher gaps.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2761826","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61605251,11247259); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:16CX02052A,14CX02156A); Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(grant numbers:ZR2012AQ005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8068207","Defect modes;parity-time symmetry;fractional Schrodinger equation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Bifurcation;Optical diffraction;Periodic structures;Optical beams;Diffraction;Indexes","","8","","17","OAPA","16 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we consider a fair situation where the MSL in both PCF and COF shows a comparable peak value in the autocorrelation function computed from the intensity time series. Our simulations uncover that combining the mechanism of PCF and chaotic optical injection is beneficial for TDS concealment in the SSL. To better understand this, the effects of some control parameters including injection and feedback are comparably studied. The results further prove that, as the injection or feedback parameters are varied, the proposed PCF-system always exhibits weaker autocorrelation around the feedback delay value when compared to the COF-system.

Considering that microgrids in a MGC, power dispatch optimization in a MGC is difficult to achieve. In this paper, a hybrid interactive communication optimization solution (HICOS) is suggested based on flexible communication, which could be used to solve plug-in or plug-out operation states of microgrids in MGC power dispatch optimization. HICOS consists of a hierarchical architecture: the upper layer uses distributed control among multiple microgrids, with no central controller for the MGC, and the lower layer uses a central controller for each microgrid. Based on flexible communication links among microgrids, the optimal iterative information are exchanged among microgrids, thus HICOS would gradually converge to the global optimal solution. While some microgrids plug-in or plug-out, communication links will be changed, so as to unsuccessfully reach optimal solution. Differing from changeless communication links in traditional communication networks, HICOS redefines the topology of flexible communication links to meet the requirement to reach the global optimal solutions. Simulation studies show that HICOS could effectively reach the global optimal dispatch solution with non-MGC center. Especially, facing to microgrids plug-in or plug-out states, HICOS would also reach the global optimal solution based on refined communication link topology.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-016-0235-2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946851","Microgrid Cluster (MGC);Plug-in/plug-out dispatch optimization;hybrid interactive communication optimization solution(HICOS);Flexible communication","Microgrids;Optimization;Plugs;Decentralized control;Mathematical model;Generators;Hybrid power systems","","7","","23","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

A negative voltage-bias does not produce such a tuning effect but can restore the NPC response suppressed by the positive voltage-bias before a re-breakdown step. In samples with a non-metal (Si) electrode, the NPC tuning effect is absent indicating that a positively biased TiN electrode is needed to produce the tuning effect. We hypothesize that a positive voltage may induce the migration of Ti ions into the vacancy sites in the breakdown path. This then prevents the photo-assisted recombination of the interstitial-vacancy defect pairs, leading to a modulated NPC response. A negative voltage-bias expels the Ti ions back to the electrode and restores the NPC response.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2017.2678469","Ministry of Education - Singapore(grant numbers:MOE2013-T2-2-099,MOE2016-T2-1-102); NTU–Toshiba Joint Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872399","High-k oxide;negative photoconductivity;optical sensor;plasmonic sensor;soft electrical-breakdown;silicon dioxide;wide-bandgap oxides","Electric breakdown;Electrodes;Tin;Lighting;Ions;Current measurement;Probes","","7","","28","OAPA","6 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The OFDM signal can be simply retrieved from the bit sequence, using a low-pass filter at the receiver. Neither the analog-to-digital converter (ADC)/digital-to-analog converter (DAC) nor the linear modulator/detector are required, which means the proposed system can be fulfilled by employing cost-effective 10- or 40-Gb/s binary optics and electronics. Besides, the delta-sigma-modulated OFDM-PON is able to offer excellent robustness against noises and nonlinear distortions. In the experimental demonstration, the performance of proposed delta-sigma-modulated OFDM-PON system has been investigated.

In this experiment, the maximum incident angle was expanded up to 32.5° from nadir, while the maximum incident angle is 18° for normal observation of the TRMM/PR. Although the results show that the clutter height monotonically increases with the incident angle as expected, the clutter height is suppressed for wide angles because of the weakening of the surface echo strength. As a result, the clutter height is less than 2 km if the rain echo is 15 dB higher than the noise level (i.e., about 34 dBZ echo for the TRMM/PR). The clutter height and the normalized backscattering cross section (0r0) are compared between ocean and land. Suppression of the clutter height is significant over ocean because of the relatively smaller 0r0 (smoother surface) and flat surface (no topography). The impact of the 0r0 for wide swath observation on the rain retrieval algorithm, especially on the surface reference technique, is also examined. The operation with a swath width almost twice the current TRMM/PR is achievable if relatively intense echoes are targeted; however, relatively weak and shallow precipitation will be masked by the clutter.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2633971","Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency through the Precipitation Measuring Mission Research Announcement; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797218","Radar clutter;radar cross-section;spaceborne radar","Sea surface;Clutter;Spaceborne radar;Satellites;Surface topography;Standards","","7","","14","OAPA","23 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The kinematic model is established based on modified Rodrigues parameters (MRPs). Firstly, we get the desired angular velocity virtually drives the attitude parameters to origin, and then backstep it to the desired control torque required for stabilization. Considering the time delay induced by the actuator, the control torque functions only after the delayed time, therefore time compensation is needed in the controller. Stability analysis of the close-loop system is given afterwards. The infinite dimensional actuator state is modeled with a first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), the L2 norm of the system state is constructed and is proved to be exponentially stable. An inverse optimality theorem is also employed during controller design.

Traditional control methods rely on the accurate model of the fuel cell system, which is a high-order nonlinear system, and involve a complex controller design process.

Without the necessity of changing the geometry size of graphene ribbons, we tune the Fano resonance of the metasurface containing identical graphene ribbons by simply changing the global or local periods of the superlattice. The increase of the global period of the superlattice leads to a blue-shift of the broad resonance of the bright mode, while the increase of the local period leads to simultaneous shifts of the broad resonance of the bright mode and the sharp resonance of the dark mode toward opposite direction with respect to each other. The resonance shift mechanism can be well explained by the restoring force model for longitudinal dipole arrays. In addition, the overall spectral position of the Fano resonance can be actively tuned by the fermi level of graphene ribbons.

This nonsequential speckle reduction method has no requirement of the modulators speed; thus, it has obvious merit comparing with the sequential speckle reduction methods.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2732507","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0401903,2016YFB0402003); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61404104); Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi Province for International Cooperation(grant numbers:201703D421015); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20140409); Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:IRT13076); State Key Program of National Natural Science of China(grant numbers:11434007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7994593","Coherent effects;coherent imaging.","Speckle;Laser beams;Reflection;Gray-scale;Optical losses;Modulation;Mirrors","","6","","19","OAPA","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of this paper is to develop a coordination strategy between a battery energy storage and a PtG system. A simulation case is created with an electrical and a natural gas grid as well as steady-state models of RES and PtG. Charging strategies are developed accordingly for the ESS as well as production strategies for the PtG system. The size of the ESS is then observed with regards to the RES and PtG systems. As a result, it is found that surplus energy from RES can be stored and then used to support the electrical grid and the natural gas grid. It is also concluded that the capacity of the ESS can be affected, given a proper charging and production strategy, which needs to be tailored to each system. As shown in the paper, due to an improper charging strategy in the first quarter of a month, the ESSPC size has increased from its optimal size of 314 MWh to roughly 576 MWh. It can also be seen that given a proper charging strategy, this capacity can be less than 200 MWh.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-017-0072-y","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10366443","Electrical energy storage;Power-to-gas;Coordination;Integrated energy systems","Methane;Renewable energy sources;Production;Power systems;Batteries;Steady-state","","6","","17","","20 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

Traditional EV chargers in V2H applications mainly consist of DC/DC and DC/AC stages, which complicate the control algorithm and result in low conversion efficiency. In order to solve this problem, a novel EV charger is proposed for V2H applications. It can boost the battery voltage and output AC voltage with only one-stage power conversion. Also, the DC, 1-phase and 3-phase loads can be fed with the proposed single-stage EV charger. The system control strategy is also provided to deal with versatile load variations.

Four sensing coils are then used to measure the influence a conducting target has on the magnetic field to enable position sensing.

Meanwhile, the path constraints, control constraints and initial/terminal states constraints are considered in the optimization as well.

Experimental results show that there is an enhanced low dose rate sensitivity for PNP transistors with and without nitride passivation layers. In addition, the degradation of PNP BJTs with nitride layer is more serious than that of PNP BJTs without nitride layer under the same irradiation condition. Compared with the PNP BJTS without nitride passivation layer, ionization effect in the PNP BJTs with nitride passivation layer can generate greater density of interface traps with deeper energy level at a given dose rate.

In this paper, we propose an effective refinement process that employs image transformations and mask matching to increase the accuracy of object segmentation masks. The proposed refinement process is applied to three state-of-the-art object proposal methods (DeepMask, SharpMask, and FastMask), and is evaluated on two standard benchmarks (Microsoft COCO and PASCAL VOC).

In particular, the OAM divider, which can convert the incoming OAM mode into one or several new smaller modes in proportion at different spatial paths, is very useful in OAM-based optical networks. However, this useful tool has rarely been reported. Here, we put forward a passive OAM divider based on coordinate transformation. The device consists of a Cartesian to log-polar coordinate converter and an inverse converter. The first converter converts the OAM light into a rectangular-shaped plane light with a transverse phase gradient, and the second converter converts the plane light into multiple diffracted light. The OAM of zeroth-order diffracted light is the product of the input OAM and the scaling parameter. The residual light is the output from other diffracted orders. Furthermore, we extend the scheme to realize equal N-division of OAM and arbitrary division of OAM. The ability of dividing OAM shows huge potential for OAM-based classical and quantum information processing.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2645896","National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2011CB301704,2014CB340004); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:NCET-11-0168,NCET-11-0182); National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China(grant numbers:201139); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61622502,61475052,11274131,11574001); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2014CFA004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7801909","Orbital angular momentum (OAM);mode conversion;optical diffraction.","Optical diffraction;Lenses;Adaptive optics;Performance evaluation;Optical imaging;Charge coupled devices;Information processing","","5","","23","OAPA","29 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two optical fibers are both designed as movable cantilever structures with a free-hanging length. With injecting pump lights into the opto-mechanical system, the generated thermal radiation between the grating couplers and the optical fibers could effectively move the fibers with displacements up to tens of micrometers. Thus, the optical fibers would completely deviate from the corresponding grating coupler to cut off the optical signal transmission. In the experiment, using light to control light, both ultrahigh switching extinction ratios beyond 60 dB and an operation bandwidth of at least 45 nm have been achieved by taking advantage of the powerful thermal radiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is a record extinction ratio for fiber-based all-optical switch. The significant thermal radiation opens up a new opportunity and solution for all-optical switch. In the future, the significant effect is promising to be used in fully integrated chips to greatly reduce the required pump power.

This kind of faults is difficult to be detected by traditional relay or fuse due to the limited fault current values and the situation is worse in wind farms. The mostly adopted HIF detection algorithms are based on the 3rd harmonic characteristic of the fault zero-sequence currents, whereas these 3rd harmonics are very easy to be polluted by wind power back-to-back converters. In response to this problem, the typical harmonic characteristic of HIF arc flash based on Mayr's arc model is first analyzed, and the typical fault waveforms of HIF in wind farm are presented. Then the performance of the harmonic based HIF detection algorithm is discussed, and a novel detection algorithm is proposed from the viewpoint of time domain, focusing on the convex and concave characteristic of zero-sequence current at zero-crossing points.

We propose a multi-dimensional trusted attestation architecture that can collect and verify trusted attestation information from the computing nodes, and manage the information centrally on a cloud management platform. The architecture verifies the IaaS's trusted attestation by apprising the VM, Hypervisor, and host Operating System's (OS) trusted status. The theory and the technology roadmap were introduced, and the key technologies were analyzed. The key technologies include dynamic measurement of the Hypervisor at the process level, the protection of vTPM instances, the reinforcement of Hypervisor security, and the verification of the IaaS trusted attestation. A prototype was deployed to verify the feasibility of the system. The advantages of the prototype system were compared with the Open CIT (Intel Cloud attestation solution).

Several works have investigated the impedance interaction between the DFIG based wind farm and long transmission cables which may unfortunately cause high frequency resonance (HFR). The main contribution of this paper is to investigate the influence of the variable wind farm capacity on the behavior of the HFR when certain transmission cables are provided. It is found out that the potential HFR may happen in certain wind farms, and the larger wind farm capacity causes more severe HFR due to the relatively weaker grid transmission capability.

The linewidth of the laser is nearly 86 MHz at ~1560 nm measured by the Fabry-Perot interferometer. Since the thermooptic effect changes the reflectivity of the modes excited inside the MBR, the transition from the dual-wavelength operation to a stable single-wavelength output is found as increasing the pump power. The outstanding advantage of such laser is the microfluidic channel of the MBR which provides an excellent platform for the light to interact with the liquids. Thus, the laser wavelengths could be tuned by injecting different refractive index (RI) liquids into the microbubble. A coupled-cavities system is setup through inserting the MBR into the fiber cavity directly, of which the laser spectrum is very sensitive to the light polarization. Moreover, the laser wavelength could be tuned in a wide wavelength range if the thin-wall MBR is adopted.

To enhance multiphoton signal levels and enable deep-tissue penetration, water immersion has to be replaced by deuterium dioxide (D2O) immersion to boost transmittance at the 1700-nm window. The key problem facing this D2O immersion technique is the hygroscopic nature of D2O, which leads to decrease of MPM signals as time lapses. Here, we demonstrate a simple, yet very effective technique to isolate D2 O from the ambient environment, by sealing it with the paraffin liquid. We demonstrate the application of this technique to MPM signal maintenance in both three-photon fluorescence generation in a fluorescent dye and third-harmonic generation (THG) imaging of biological tissue, excited at the 1700-nm window. Ex-vivo imaging results show that during an imaging session of 5 h, multiphoton signals of both modalities can be maintained with no deterioration due to absorption of water vapor from the environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate  in-vivo deep-tissue mouse brain imaging using this technique, in which THG signals can be maintained for at least 5 h. This justifies the applicability and effectiveness of our D2O sealing technique for long-span in-vivo imaging.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2737012","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61475103,11404218); National Hi-Tech Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2015AA020515); Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen(grant numbers:KQJSCX20160226194151,JCYJ20160307150657874,KQTD20150710165601017); Natural Science Foundation of SZU(grant numbers:00002701); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013790","Fluorescence microscopy;non-linear microscopy;optical properties of photonic materials.","Imaging;Fluorescence;In vivo;Mice;Brain;Lenses;Liquids","","4","","18","OAPA","21 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed pressure sensor is based on the fact that the Brillouin peak frequency at ~8.5 GHz and ~9 GHz shifts when environment air pressure changes. It exhibits a pressure sensitivity of approximately 0.066 MHz/kPa. This device provides a candidate for gas pressure measurement. We also measure the temperature response of the spectra.

A novel technique for enhancing the light extraction of HV-LEDs by using wet-etched chamfer structures in the sidewalls of each cell is proposed. The thicknesses of the u-GaN layers used were in the range of 3-7 μm. Simulations revealed that the light extraction of the HV-LEDs with chamfer structures would be enhanced by increasing the u-GaN thickness. The output power (@80 mA) of the HV-LEDs without chamfer structures was 538.0-539.1 mW. However, the output powers (@80 mA) of the HV-LEDs with chamfer structures and u-GaN thicknesses of 3, 5, and 7 μm were increased to 555.3, 573.1, and 561.6 mW, respectively. The 7 μm thick u-GaN layer led to an extremely large thickness of the HV-LED epitaxial structure, which caused difficulties during the wet etching process. Because of the apparent decrease in the wet etching rate of GaN, the damages to the epitaxial structures of the HV-LED with the 7 μm thick u-GaN was more obvious. Therefore, the device's light extraction was slightly reduced. The results confirm that chamfer structures are highly useful for improving the performance of HV-LEDs, especially for the u-GaN thickness of 5 μm.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2710019","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:104-2221-E-005-036-MY3,102-2221-E-005-072-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7936480","High-voltage light emitting diodes;sidewall chamfer structure;wet etching;Trace-Pro simulation;light extraction.","Microcell networks;Light emitting diodes;Epitaxial growth;Etching;Power generation;Scanning electron microscopy;Performance evaluation","","4","","16","OAPA","31 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This behavior accounts for the trapping of charges generated on previous X-ray shots near the HgI2/electrode interface. These trapped charges create the conditions that deter subsequent charges generated by the next X-ray shot from traveling from the photoconductor into the electrode. Such conditions can be improved significantly by switching the bias polarity of the photoconductor with an illuminating light under the image sensor. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is optimum when the duration of the illuminating light is 1 s longer than the applied time of the positive bias. Increases in the bias switching/lighting combination time for obtaining the best SNR are required with increasing amounts of incident X-ray exposure. Such results obtained from making adjustments in the technique for using screen-printed HgI2 photoconductors for digital tomosynthesis indicate promising results for improving the diagnostic accuracy of this digital imaging method for breast cancer screening while mitigating patients' X-ray exposure.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2017.2736538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8003260","Mercury iodide photodonductor;X-ray image sensor","X-ray imaging;Photoconducting materials;Signal to noise ratio;Image sensors;Electrodes;Lighting;Electron traps","","4","","17","OAPA","7 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To extract the global atmospheric light accurately, we exploit multiple prior rules underlying hazy images, and put forward a novel measurement to judge the likelihood that a pixel is regarded as the global atmospheric light. In addition, the rough transmission map is estimated through a multiscale fusion process based on the Laplace pyramid transform, and refined by a total variation model.

Firstly, the wideband signals are divided into several narrowband signals of different frequency bins by discrete Fourier transformation (DFT). Then, the signal matched power spectrum in referenced frequency bins is computed, which can form the initial covariance matrix. Finally, the linear restrained minimum variance spectral (Capon spectral) of signals in other frequency bins are reconstructed using sequential iterative means, so the DOA can be estimated by the locations of spectral peaks. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the proposed method based on the iterative spectral reconstruction for the covariance matrices of all sub-bands can avoid the problem of determining the signal subspace accurately with the coherent signal subspace method under the conditions of small samples and low signal to noise ratio (SNR), and it can also realize full dimensional focusing of different sub-band data, which can be applied to coherent sources and can signiscantly improve the accuracy of DOA estimation.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.06.01","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8277353","direction of arrival (DOA);wideband source;coherent source;minimum variance spectral","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Wideband;Covariance matrices;Frequency estimation;Signal to noise ratio;Sensor arrays","","3","","","","1 Feb 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

To ensure that the stability loss of the system meets the user's need, performance evaluation for RF frequency dissemination over fiber is necessary. Considering the numerous users over fiber links and the long dissemination distance, traditional transfer quality evaluation method is not very practical, because the cost of the loop-back configuration is relatively large. In this paper, we propose a method to directly evaluate the radio frequency transfer quality via fiber links at the remote site. At the local site, the radio frequency signal is amplitude-modulated on continuous-wave lasers with two wavelengths. After multiplexing, the frequency signal is disseminated to the remote site. At the remote site, RF signal is detected from the continuous-wave optical carrier and transfer performance can be evaluated by measuring the phase fluctuation difference between two different RF signals. The remote signal does not need to be sent back to the local site. It will greatly simplify the structure of the frequency dissemination link, like in an antenna array system.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2705917","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371074,61535001); Program of International S&T Cooperation(grant numbers:2016YFE0100200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7931544","RF;frequency dissemination over fiber;performance evaluation;WDM.","Optical fiber networks;Optical fiber amplifiers;Fluctuations;RF signals;Optical fiber theory","","3","","20","OAPA","18 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In photon counting integral imaging system, 3-D objects having small number of photons can be visualized by the prior-based statistical estimation. However, improper prior constrains can lead to inaccurate reconstruction results. The adaptive parametric Maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) using a compound photon counting model is proposed to visualize the photon-limited 3-D objects. Through maximizing a likelihood function with pixel-based adaptive information, the number of photons for reconstructed pixels is estimated. Variance stabilizing transformation combined with Block-matching and 3-D filtering algorithm is also applied to enhance the photon counting elemental images captured by the photon counting integral imaging system. The performance of our proposed reconstruction method is illustrated by experimental results and compared with conventional MLE using the peak signal-to-noise ratio metric. It is shown that our proposed method outperforms the conventional MLE for the photon counting 3-D integral imaging reconstruction.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2761181","Seventh Six-talent Peak project of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:2014-DZXX-007); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271332); Fundamental Research Funds; Central Universities(grant numbers:30920140112012); Innovation Fund Project; Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Systems; High-Dimensional Information of Ministry of Education(grant numbers:JYB201509); Fund Project for Low-light-level Night Vision Laboratory(grant numbers:J20130501); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8081819","Photon counting;integral imaging;variance stabilizing transformation combined with block-matching and three dimensional (3-D) filtering (VST+BM3D);3-D reconstruction","Photonics;Image reconstruction;Imaging;Maximum likelihood estimation;Three-dimensional displays;Ultraviolet sources","","3","","17","OAPA","24 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Incident light with different spin angular momentum can create plasmonic vortexes centered at different points, and the orbital angular momentum of light determines the size of the vortex, which manifests its topological charge.

For double-pass pump FOPO, the idler removal filter is designed to allow propagation of signal and pump in the cavity.

Unmodulated pilot subframes are periodically inserted and interleaved with data subframes to form an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. Owing to the coherence between the embedded pilot and data subframes, a Mach-Zehnder delay interferometer with a free spectral range equal to the frequency of the subframe is deployed for the self-homodyne detection of the OFDM signal. It saves the local oscillator and optical hybrid, which are usually used in a conventional coherent receiver, thus reducing the hardware complexity and implementation cost. Meanwhile, the digital signal processing (DSP) for the self-homodyne detection is free from carrier-frequency-offset compensation and carrier-phase estimation, reducing the complexity, power consumption, and latency of the system. It also allows the use of a low-cost laser source as the source for the downstream signal. The proposed scheme provides a cost-effective and energy-efficient downstream solution for optical access networks, owing to the hardware saving and complexity reduction in DSP.

Then, set order for the time series model by Akaike information criterion (AIC) rule and acquire model coefficients to establish ARMA (2,1) model. Next, test the applicability of the established model. Finally, Kalman filter is adopted to process the electric power load data. Simulation results of total variance demonstrate that stochastic noise is obviously decreased after Kalman filtering based on ARMA (2,1) model.

Firstly, as trajectory directly optimizing is quite time costing, an online trajectory functional representation method is proposed. Considering the practical requirement of online trajectory, the 4-order polynomial function is used to represent the trajectory, and which can be determined by two independent parameters with the trajectory terminal conditions; thus, the trajectory online optimization problem is converted into the optimization of the two parameters, which largely lowers the complexity of the optimization problem. Furthermore, the scopes of the two parameters have been assessed into small ranges using the golden section ratio method. Secondly, a multi-population rotation strategy differential evolution approach (MPRDE) is designed to optimize the two parameters; in which, “current-to-best/1/bin”, “current-torand/1/bin” and “rand/2/bin” strategies with fixed parameter settings are designed, these strategies are rotationally used by three subpopulations. Thirdly, the rolling optimization method is applied to model the online trajectory optimization process. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and real-time calculation capability of the designed combined strategy for UCAV trajectory online optimizing under dynamic and complicated environments.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.05.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240039","","Trajectory;Optimization methods;Modeling;Complexity theory","","3","","","","28 Dec 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

In this paper, we systematically report the enhanced excitation and DFE of quantum dot (QD) by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through theoretical calculations. A finite difference time-domain method is used in the calculations. By changing the size and the number of AgNPs, as well as relative position between QD and AgNPs, we found that when QD is in the middle of two AgNPs (the diameters of two AgNPs are 90 nm and 70 nm, respectively) and the spacing between them is 20 nm (surface to surface), the DFE is enhanced by 70 times compared to the QD on bare glass. The reason for the DFE enhancement is the geometrical scattering and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) created by AgNPs. The enhancement is the largest when the peak wavelengths of geometrical scattering and LSPR are close to each other. Furthermore, we conclude that monolayer AgNPs play a main role in the DFE enhancement of monolayer or low-concentration QDs, and uniform-sized AgNPs are not the best choice for enhancing the DFE. This will be of significance for designing and developing high-sensitivity fluorescent biosensors and high-efficiency QD LEDs.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2636741","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11674239,61307069,61575139,61575138,31640019); Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(grant numbers:20131402120018); Top Young Academic Leaders and the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi; Excellent Young Scientist Foundation and Qualified Personnel Foundation of Taiyuan University of Technology(grant numbers:2014YQ012,tyut-rc201203b); Open Fund of Top priority disciplines in colleges and universities in Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2015KF20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776762","Directional fluorescence emission (DFE);excitation;quantum dot (QD);geometrical scattering;surface plasmon resonance.","Fluorescence;Monitoring;Nanoparticles;Electric fields;Biology;Surface waves;Scattering","","3","","33","OAPA","7 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The corresponding neutral defect limited inversion-layer electron mobility, μn, is calculated in the momentum relaxation time approximation. The calculated results lead to a new analytical model: μn = cNn-1, where Nn is the neutral defect density per unit area and c is the coefficient independent of the inversion-layer density, the strain, and the temperature. The validity and applicability of the model are confirmed by citing three independent experiments on strained silicon MOSFETs undergoing different implantation sources and different annealing budgets. Importantly, this paper clarifies for the first time that strain will not change neutral defect limited mobility unless changing the neutral defect density. This reasonably explains the two experimental observations during implantation and annealing: 1) the implantation-induced strain relaxation in strained sample does not occur and 2) the neutral defect density is much higher in strained sample than in unstrained sample.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2017.2656883","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 104-2221-E-009-072-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7829294","Interstitial;metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs);mobility;neutral defect;scattering;strain","Scattering;Tensile stress;Impurities;Strain;Electron mobility;Silicon;Electric potential","","2","","20","OAPA","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A method is proposed to discriminate among the scatterers on the cone-cylinder target based on the deviation degree of micro-Doppler from sinusoid. By extracting the amplitude and initial phase, the micro-Doppler is estimated as sinusoid. Then the deviation degree is evaluated by the error between the extracted sinusoidal micro-Doppler and the actual micro-Doppler curve. Threshold for the classification is determined with the simulation data. After classification, the micro-Doppler features of sliding-type scatterers are exploited to estimate the target dimensions.

This work presents an interesting result on depolarization effect based on graphene when a laser beam passes through in perpendicular direction of graphene.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2692216","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61205076,61378035); University Young Teacher Training Scheme of Shanghai; Hujiang Foundation of China(grant numbers:61205076,61378035); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2015CB352001); National Key Scientific Instruments and Equipment Development(grant numbers:2012YQ17000408); 51 Talent Project of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:12-2-008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7894266","Optical and other properties;light-material interactions;sensors","Graphene;Garnets;Laser beams;Measurement by laser beam;Stokes parameters;Optical sensors","","2","","29","OAPA","7 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the smooth solid rotor, five different rotor end factors are discussed and compared with each other. It is theoretically clarified that the resistivity of rotor in 2-D FEA should be multiplied by the square of rotor end factors to take the 3-D end effect of solid rotor into account. For the slitted solid rotor, an improved rotor end factor is proposed based on the equivalent area algorithm of eddy currents in rotor, since the end factors of smooth solid rotor are not applicable. Finally, the time-harmonic finite element method (FEM) combined with the rotor end factor is applied to analyze the performance of solid rotor induction motor.

It contains a nominal control law used to achieve finite-time stabilization performance and a compensated control law used to reject the uncertainties. The switching gains of the compensated control law are tuned using adaptation algorithms, and the knowledge of the bounds of the uncertainties is not required to be known in advance.

In comparison with the conventional grids, the protection relays in power grids with micro-sources are more difficult to set. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes an extended bus differential protection (EBDP) strategy based on the limited wide area (LWA). In this method, the micro-grids are divided into several protection areas at the core of the bus. The whole protection areas are protected by the wide area current differential relays, which are also configured to protect each component in this protection area. Moreover, the protection areas can be changed adaptively according to the power flow direction. Finally, a micro-grid model with multiple DGs is developed using the PSCAD/EMTDC platform. The simulation results indicate that the proposed adaptive limited wide area differential protection (LWADP) has better performance than the traditional relaying protection in detecting the faulty area in micro-grids and isolating the fault, and can be widely utilized in larger micro-grids.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-017-0052-2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10366432","Micro-sources;Distributed generation (DG);Extended bus differential protection (EBDP);Limited wide area differential protection (LWADP);Micro-grids","Adaptation models;Simulation;Protective relaying;Bidirectional power flow;Power grids;Distributed power generation;Load flow","","2","","15","","20 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

The field distributions at the two peaks of the normalized absorption spectrum indicate that propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), as well as the horizontal metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguide mode, play the main role of trapping light into the active material.

The proposed replacement policy is the replacement after the extended warranty is performed by the consumer based on the repair-cost threshold or preventive replacement (PR) age, which are decision variables.

Based on the Collins formula, we obtain the exact analytical solution of the spiraling elliptic beams carrying the orbital angular momentum (OAM) to the paraxial wave equation. It is found that the rotation property is closely relevant to the OAM, which can be controlled by the linear anisotropy of media. For an anisotropic media such as the uniaxial crystal, the rotation velocity of spiraling elliptic beams at the output can be controlled only by changing the direction of the optic axis of the uniaxial crystal. Depending on the anisotropy parameter, two rotation modes are predicted for the spiraling elliptic beam. For small anisotropy parameter, the rotation direction of the spiraling elliptic beam is inverted at a certain propagation distance. When the anisotropy parameter is large enough, the invertion of the rotation direction disappears. The results are potentially useful in controlling the optical beams.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2734066","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11604199); Key Research Fund of Higher Education of Henan Province(grant numbers:16A140030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997877","Linear anisotropy;orbital angular momentum;rotation properties","Optical beams;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Media;Laser beams;Angular velocity;Crystals;Solitons","","2","","24","OAPA","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

External beam radiotherapy (50 Gy) with central shielding after 20–40 Gy was performed for each patient. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy was administered concurrently to advanced-stage patients aged ≤75 years. Brachytherapy was delivered in four fractions of 6 Gy per week. In-room computed tomography imaging with applicator insertion was performed for treatment planning. Information from physical examinations at diagnosis, and brachytherapy and magnetic resonance imaging at diagnosis and just before the first brachytherapy session, were referred to for contouring of the high-risk clinical target volume. The median follow-up duration was 60 months. The 5-year local control, pelvic progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 94%, 90% and 86%, respectively. No significant differences in 5-year local control rates were observed between Stage I, Stage II and Stage III–IVA patients. Conversely, a significant difference in the 5-year overall survival rate was observed between Stage II and III–IVA patients (97% vs 72%; P = 0.006). One patient developed Grade 3 late bladder toxicity. No other Grade 3 or higher late toxicities were reported in the rectum or bladder.

The integral and envelope methods are both proposed to reconstruct a sample's axial PA image, which has only been achieved approximately by the PA signals' peak values obtained by a peak-holding circuit in previous reports. And the envelope method is proposed for the first time. Hilbert transform was used to obtain the envelope of the sample's PA signals and axial PA images.

Many researchers, among whom the most notable was Michael Faraday [Southwark, London, UK, September 22, 1791 — Hampton Court, Middlesex, UK, August 25, 1867], actively sought such a phenomenon, yet the instrumentation then available was exceedingly crude [1]. For an electric phenomenon to be apparent, a spark should be o bserved for voltage, or a current strong enough for visible effects. Some more-sensitive device able to detect feeble currents was necessary. Indeed, Orsted's discovery made possible the development of such an instrument: the galvanometer. In that same 1820, Johann Schweigger [Erlangen, Germany, April 8, 1779 - Halle, Germany, September 6, 1857] build a first galvanometer by winding a coil of wire around a magnetic needle free to rotate. This was later enhanced by multiplying the effect of the current by using several coils of wire.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2017.8409434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8409434","","Needles;Instruments;Force;Wires;Europe;History;Electronic mail","","1","","19","","12 Jul 2018","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

In order to recover groupsparse signals with a better sparsity-measurement tradeoff, the truncated l2,1-norm regularization and reweighted l2,1-norm regularization are proposed for the recovery of group-sparse signals based on the iterative support detection.

Cost efficiency is defined as the ratio of minimum costs to current costs, while revenue efficiency is defined as the ratio of maximum revenue to current revenue of the DMU. This paper presents a framework where data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to measure cost, revenue and profit efficiency with fuzzy data. In such cases, the classical models cannot be used, because input and output data appear in the form of ranges. When the data are fuzzy, the cost, revenue and profit efficiency measures calculated from the data should be uncertain as well. Fuzzy DEA models emerge as another class of DEA models to account for imprecise inputs and outputs for DMUs. Although several approaches for solving fuzzy DEA models have been developed, numerous deficiencies including the α-cut approaches and types of fuzzy numbers must still be improved.

In this paper, we propose a wavelength reused mode-division-multiplexing (MDM) scheme for bidirectional short-reach optical access network with low mode-crosstalk multiplexer/demultiplexer (MUX/DEMUX) and few-mode fiber (FMF). In downstream (DS) transmission, one of the spatial modes in FMF is used to transmit optical carriers, while the others are used as DS signal channels. In upstream (US) transmission, the carrier is split to all the ONUs for US remodulation. By utilizing low mode-crosstalk mode MUX/DEMUX and FMF, the carrier and each signal channel can be effectively separated. Compared with other wavelength reused schemes in which the DS and US transmission are modulated in orthogonal dimension, the signal qualities on two transmission directions are independent in the proposed scheme, and symmetrical bidirectional transmission without residual remodulation crosstalk can be achieved. What is more, to reduce bidirectional Rayleigh backscattering noise, we propose to use different optical sidebands for DS and US transmission. With the proposed scheme, we experimentally demonstrate symmetrical bidirectional 2 × 12.5-Gb/s quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) intensity-modulation and direct-detection transmission over 11.5-km four-mode FMF.

Research shows frequency domain beat signal linewidth broadening aggravates beat frequency fluctuation due to time domain irregular self-pulsation effect. By introducing self-injection into laser cavity as an auxiliary pump laser with a circulator, self-pulsation effect in DBR fiber laser sensor can be greatly suppressed, resulting in the compression of frequency domain beat signal linewidth as well as the stabilization of beat frequency fluctuation.

Since people are more dependent on their close social relationships as they age, understanding the quality of relationships between aged parents and their adult children is a critical topic. Previous research shows that this relationship is complicated with both kinship and ambivalence. However, there is little research on the causes of this complexity. This paper proposes a role model to explain this complexity by studying the leadership transition within a family as the child grows. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, we proposed a novel perception to understand this transition process and explain related problems based on the analysis of the leader-follower relationship between the parents and their children. Findings – When a child is born, his/her parents become the leader of this family because of their abilities, responsibilities and the requirements of the infant. This leader-follower role structure will last a long time in this family. Decades later, when the parents become old and the child grows up, the inter-generational contracts within the family and the requirement of each members change. This transition weakens the foundation of the traditional leader-follower role structure within the family. If either the parent or the child does not want to accept their new roles, both of them will suffer and struggle in this relationship. This role conflict will cause ambivalence in the relationship between aged parents and their adult children. Originality/value – Based on the quantitative study model provided in this paper, we can moderate the relationships between aged parents and their adult children. This effort is meaningful in enhancing the quality of life and emotional wellbeing for senior citizens.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-08-2017-0012","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826551","Role;ambivalence;inter-generation relationship;parent-child","Leadership;Analytical models;Aging;Complexity theory;Older adults;Contracts","","1","","22","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this work, the process of (AIGS) film growth by a three-stage molecular beam epitaxy method is studied. The diffusion of silver and grain growth of AIGS films from the first stage-deposited (In, Ga)2Se3 is investigated. Energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping is used to reveal the distribution of silver in the film during each stage of the deposition process. A sharp silver accumulation at the surface of the film at the early stage of the deposition process is observed. This has led to the formation of a silver-rich phase, which gradually diffused into the film to produce a homogeneous distribution. X-ray diffraction results illustrate the phase changes of AIGS films. Based on the result, a growth model for AIGS films from the first stage to the second stage is suggested as (In, Ga)2Se3 → Ag9 (In, Ga)Se6 at the surface and (In, Ga)2Se3 at the bottom of the film → silver-rich AIGS film. During the third stage, the silver-rich film was converted to silver-poor film. The performance of AIGS solar cells fabricated from various samples was compared, and a highest efficiency of 7.1% was obtained.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2670923","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7858727","Ag(In;Ga)Se  $_2$  ;three-stage;Ag diffusion;growth mechanism.","Films;Silver;Atomic layer deposition;Photovoltaic cells;Substrates;Grain size;X-ray scattering","","1","","17","CCBY","17 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The nonradiative recombination defect is a major factor affecting the performance of LED chips, and the increase in defects eventually leads to the chip failure. Therefore, the growth rate of defects determines the lifetime of the LED chip. A new measurement method of the defect density is introduced. A batch of 1-W blue LED chips is selected to conduct 6000-h accelerated life tests with constant current stresses. And through studying the data of defect densities and light output, it is concluded that compared with light output, the defect density is more sensitive to the current stress, which indicates that the defect density is more advantageous to reflect the performance degradation of the LED chip. In particular, the growth of defects induced by aging stress is found to follow a logarithmic law, then a mathematical model of the defect growth is introduced. And with the model we can obtain the key parameters about the growth rate of defects. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative relationship between the growth rate of defects and aging lifetime. Based on this relationship, the lifetime of the LED chip can be predicted in a more accurate and faster way. The result shows that under the stress condition of our experiments, this new method requires less than 1000-h stress time, and the traditional method requires more than 6000 h.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2703851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7929262","Light-emitting diode (LED) chip;lifetime estimation;defect density;semiconductor device reliability","Light emitting diodes;Aging;Stress;Density measurement;Semiconductor device measurement;Radiative recombination","","1","","23","OAPA","16 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The novelty lies in the designing of an evaluation function for the robust FD. The basic idea is to directly construct an evaluation function by using a weighted l2-norm of the measurement output, which achieves an optimal trade-off between the sensitivity to fault and the robustness to l2-norm bounded unknown input. To avoid complex computation, a feasible solution is obtained via the recursive computation by applying the orthogonal projection. It is shown that such an evaluation function provides a unified scheme for both the cases of unknown input being l2-norm bounded and jointly normal distribution, while a threshold may be chosen based on a priori knowledge of unknown input. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.05.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240041","fault detection;evaluation function;linear discretetime-varying system;time-delay","Robustness;Time-varying systems;Sensitivity;Fault detection;Gaussian distribution;Optimization;Testing","","1","","","","28 Dec 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Ten prostate cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were studied. Nine or ten CBCT scans were performed for each patient. First, rigid registration was performed between the planning CT and all CBCT images using gold fiducial markers, and then DIR was performed. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and center of mass (COM) displacement were used to evaluate the quantitative DIR accuracy. The average DSCs for intensity-based DIR for the prostate, rectum, bladder, and seminal vesicles were 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.75 ± 0.05, 0.69 ± 0.07 and 0.65 ± 0.11, respectively, whereas those values for hybrid DIR were 0.98 ± 0.00, 0.97 ± 0.01, 0.98 ± 0.00 and 0.94 ± 0.03, respectively (P < 0.05).

Large-scale microarray experimental data revealed several genes with significantly differential expression between the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the SN dopamine (DA) neurons. Several epidemiological studies have additionally indicated nicotine-mediated neuroprotection in PD patients. Based on the strong evidence implicating lipoprotein lipase (LPL), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and gastrin-releasing peptide genes in neuroprotection, this letter investigates areaand age-specific nicotine regulation of these genes' expression in the VTA and SN of different age groups (3 months, 12 months, and 24 months) in an in vivo animal model. Our in vivo rat model results suggest that out of these genes, only the LPL gene has significantly differential expression between the VTA and SN in the senior age group (24 months). Nicotine treatment did not upregulate the neuroprotective genes in adult and senior groups (12 and 24 months). Differential expression of the LPL gene in the senior population may contribute to the different survival rates of DA neurons within the VTA and SN. However, downregulation by nicotine suggests that these genes may not be related to the nicotine-mediated neuroprotection known to reduce the risks of PD. Our results suggest that nicotine may not play an important role in the regulation of neuroprotective gene expressions, while providing new insights into the role of nicotine in PD.","2332-7685","","10.1109/LLS.2017.2756835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8082481","Aging;dopamine (DA);neuroprotective;nicotine;polymerase-chain reaction","Gene expression;Neurons;Aging;Rats;Life sciences;Brain","","1","","12","OAPA","25 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The provided optical gain spectrum is broad enough to support two distinct mid-infrared modes with a significant spectral separation. For dual-emission, the waveguide contains a buried, index-coupled distributed feedback grating. This grating is based on a sampled approach to provide selective feedback for two midinfrared modes at λ1 = 8.39 μm and λ2 = 9.38 μm. Simultaneously, the manifold of possible transitions within the active region is designed to provide a peak nonlinear susceptibility of |χ(2)| = 29 nmV-1 at the conversion to 3.8 THz.

A two-dimensional representation of the optical path functional is developed, and used to gain insight into the fundamental difference between high and low ionospheric rays. We conclude that high and low rays are minima and saddle points of the optical path functional, respectively. An optimization method for point-to-point ionospheric ray tracing, based on the direct variational principle for the optical path, is proposed.

Compared with existed integral inequalities, those proposed here can be applied to more complicated differential equations, such as time-varying delay neutral differential equations. Secondly, the notions of (w, Ω) uniform stable and (w, Ω) uniform asymptotically stable, especially (c1, c1) uniform stable and (c1, c1) uniform asymptotically stable, are presented.

Theoretically, if the polarization state of a monochromatic light is scrambled at a particular depth, the direct current component of the photocurrent would be independent of the polarization perturbation from the fiber link. A proof of concept experiment is performed in which a 500-MHz simulated polarization perturbation from the fiber is successfully suppressed by more than 40 dB. We then apply the proposed scrambling method to a 5-km remote electro-optic modulation fiber link and significantly reduce polarization-dependent intensity fluctuation from 42 to 0.6 dB. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed scrambling method for remote photonic radio-frequency (RF) mixing, where the fluctuation of the converted signal is stabilized within 0.9 dB.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2689329","International S&T Cooperation Program of China(grant numbers:2011DFR10940); High-Tech Ship Research Project of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology(grant numbers:200904); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890484","Polarization-insensitive;polarization scrambling;remote electro-optic modulation.","Electrooptic modulators;Optical polarization;Optical mixing;Radio frequency;Frequency modulation;Optical fiber communication","","","","18","OAPA","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is constituted by slow-response and low-precision thyristor converters and fast-response and high-accuracy voltage source converters. This paper models its primary circuit and addresses its basic operation mechanism. Then a dual-timescale control scheme is investigated to realize the coordinated regulation of both types of converter. A simulation case is established in PSCAD containing interconnected mid-voltage distribution networks. Simulations with poor- and well-matched control timescales are both carried out. And accordingly, the power flow controllability under these conditions is compared. When the shorter control timescale is no more than tenth of the longer one, the power electronic zigzag transformer will operate with satisfying performances.","2096-3564","","10.23919/TEMS.2017.8086111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8086111","Power electronic transformer;thyristor converter;voltage source converter;dual-timescale control;flexible interconnection","Thyristors;Switches;Integrated circuit interconnections;Mathematical model;Voltage control;Barium","","","","","","30 Oct 2017","","","CES","CES Journals"

In the scheme, two log likelihood ratio (LLR)-based thresholds are devised to measure the reliability of received signals for the relay and the destination, respectively. One of the threshold guarantees that the relay only forwards reliable symbols, thus less error will be propagated to the destination. The other threshold is used at the destination for determining the reliability of symbols received from the source. The destination will directly demodulate reliable symbols received from the source. Otherwise, when the symbols received from the source are not reliable, the maximum ratio combiner (MRC) is used to combine symbols received from the source and the relay. Closed-form expression of the bit error probability (BEP) of the proposed scheme is derived and analyzed under binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation. Then, the relationship and closed-form solutions of two LLR-based thresholds are derived. Simulation results prove that the theoretical BEP of the proposed scheme closely matches the simulated ones. The proposed scheme can achieve high performance with low computational complexity compared to existing schemes.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.06.03","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8277355","demodulate-and-forward;relaying strategies;error propagation;cooperative networks","Relays;Reliability;Error probability;Binary phase shift keying;Signal to noise ratio;Computational complexity;Closed-form solutions","","","","","","1 Feb 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"
"Sub-voxel refinement method for tissue boundary conductivities in volume conductor models","M. Mikkonen; I. Laakso","School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland; School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Finland",URSI Radio Science Bulletin,"16 Nov 2017","2017","2017","360","13","18","The resolution and element type of the mesh used in the Finite-Element Method modeling of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) greatly affect both the accuracy of the solution and the computational time. Tetrahedral meshing is usually used in these models as it well approximates curvature, but the models are slow to solve. Using a voxel grid as the mesh significantly reduces the computational time, but the cubical elements are not the most suitable option for curved surfaces. Tissue boundaries can be modeled as a layer of voxels with an average conductivity of the surrounding tissues. However, as the boundary being modeled only rarely divides a voxel into two equally sized portions, this approach is often erroneous, and in particular, with low resolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for improving the accuracy of anatomically correct Finite-Element Method simulations by enhancing the tissue boundaries in voxel models. In our method, a voxel model is created from a set of polygonal surfaces segmented from magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) data. This is done by first voxelizing with a fine resolution, and then increasing the voxel size to the target resolution, and calculating the ratio of fine voxels in and outside the surface within each coarse voxel. More-accurate proportions for the volume of a coarse voxel inside and outside the tissue boundary are thus achieved, and the tissue boundary's conductivity can be better approximated. To test the performance of this method, a series of simulations of motor cortical tDCS were performed using resolutions from 0.2 mm to 2 mm, scaled to zero, two, or four times finer resolution. Based on the results, the voxel size could be doubled with a cost of 3% in relative error by using our method. The model's degrees of freedom (DOF) could thus be decreased by 87%, and the simulation times could be decreased by 82%.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2017.8113160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8113160","","Conductivity;Solid modeling;Brain modeling;Conductors;Computational modeling;Finite element analysis","","","","28","","16 Nov 2017","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

The traditional definitions of strong ties (with two endpoints in the same community) and weak ties (with two endpoints in different communities) are being challenged by overlapping community structures. Because of their unique nature, the relationships between overlapping nodes and non-overlapping nodes are difficult to classify as strong or weak. In view of this, it is here proposed that the coefficient indicator for overlapping communities was used to redefine node relationships and enable the quantification of strong and weak ties. Next, changes in the quantities of strong and weak ties were analyzed by varying the threshold values of the overlap coefficient. Finally, the effect of weak ties in information dissemination was assessed in overlapping and non-overlapping situations, respectively. Results demonstrated that the overlap coefficient proposed in this paper could better characterize the strong and weak attributes of edges under overlapping community structures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2710360","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1404602); Young Scholar Program of Henan Province(grant numbers:2015GGJS-086); Science and Technology Foundation of Henan Province(grant numbers:172102210341); Dr. Startup Project of Henan Normal University(grant numbers:qd14136); Young Scholar Program of Henan Normal University(grant numbers:15018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937807","Overlapping community structures;strong ties;weak ties;social networks","Social network services;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Electronic mail;Measurement;Dolphins;Bridges;Data mining","","","","11","OAPA","1 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional modeling methods are based on scenarios or situations, such methods will cause the covering problem due to redundancy and are incapable of depicting interactions among various goals and plans of pilot. Petri net integrated with belief, desire and intention (BDI) theory (BDI Petri net) is designed to solve this problem. Focusing on the BDI theory, goal states of agent are discussed firstly. Belief, desire and intention are modeled by places and transitions based on the Petri net theory. In order to simplify the network, colored token is introduced to depict various states of belief, and the hierarchy transition is applied to model the intention, together with tokens' flow demonstrating the interaction among various goals and relationship among belief, desire and intention. A search and rescue mission is used to validate the proposed method and the result indicates that the model can be used to monitor goals and behaviors of pilots.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038214","Petri net;belief;desire and intention (BDI) theory;flight mission modeling;agent","Petri nets;Monitoring;Meteorology;Analytical models;Joining processes","","","","","","14 Sep 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The VERT approach is more general than previous ionospheric tomography methods because it can reconstruct the volume emission rate field irrespective of the particular excitation mechanisms (e.g., radiative recombination, photoelectron impact excitation, and energetic particle precipitation in auroras); physical models are then applied to interpret the airglow. The technique was developed and tested using data from the Special Sensor Ultraviolet Limb Imager and Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager instruments aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F-18 spacecraft and planned for use with upcoming remote sensing missions. The technique incorporates several features to optimize the tomographic solutions, such as the use of a nonnegative algorithm (Richardson-Lucy, RL) that explicitly accounts for the Poisson statistics inherent in optical measurements, capability to include extinction effects due to resonant scattering and absorption of the photons from the lines of sight, a pseudodiffusion-based regularization scheme implemented between iterations of the RL code to produce smoother solutions, and the capability to estimate error bars on the solutions. Tests using simulated atmospheric emissions verify that the technique performs well in a variety of situations, including daytime, nighttime, and even in the challenging terminator regions. Lastly, we consider ionospheric nightglow and validate reconstructions of the nighttime electron density against Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-range Tracking and Identification Radar (ALTAIR) incoherent scatter radar data.","1944-799X","","10.1002/2015RS005887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8068301","","Tomography;Instruments;Satellites;Atmospheric measurements;Satellite broadcasting;Space vehicles;Ionosphere","","","","","","16 Oct 2017","","","AGU","AGU Journals"

A hybrid maximal-ratio-based switch-and-stay combining (M-SSTC) scheme, for dual-branch systems, is proposed in this paper to enhance the existing SSTC-type combining techniques. According to this paper, the problem of the available solutions is that they are valid only when both the branches are poor, leading the performance gain very limited. Thus, we make an attempt to adopt the maximal-ratio combining technique to overcome this disadvantage. By designing reasonable switching logic, M-SSTC can improve the performance of the diversity system as much as possible while keeping its complexity in a low level. Based on the Markovian property of the M-SSTC's output state sequences, the outage probability performance of M-SSTC is analyzed, and the closed-form expression is also presented. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical results and show the advantages of M-SSTC over the available schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2721115","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61501347); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2015M580816); Xi’an Technology Research Project(grant numbers:CXY1402); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961144","Diversity;hybrid combining;threshold;outage probability","Diversity reception;Switches;Signal to noise ratio;Complexity theory;Fading channels;5G mobile communication;Diversity methods","","","","18","OAPA","28 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A section of PANDA fiber is used as an example to experimentally demonstrate the proposed method. The results show that the calculated birefringence is consistent with the theoretical simulation. Furthermore, four different structural states, which reflected in four different rate of change, are presented in the whole etching process of PANDA fiber.

This type of array arrangement (namely, a nanoarray) is useful for controlling and directing optical waves in numerous applications, such as optical links, sensing, and energy harvesting [1–6]. A particular aim in SOLBOX-06 is to maximize the scattering or radiation of a given array structure in desired directions. Despite the number of unknowns being relatively small, the main challenge is the size of the optimization space, which is grows exponentially with the number of nanocubes. In addition, the nanocubes are made of silver (Ag). They must therefore be modeled as penetrable objects with negative real permittivity, at optical frequencies. The sample solutions also included in this issue use genetic algorithms, combined with a solver based on surface integral equations, and the Multilevel Fast Multipole algorithm. Alternative solutions of the same problems with other solvers, possibly using different and more-efficient optimization tools (heuristic or gradient-based) and solution methods (e.g., volume integral equations, other types of acceleration algorithms, iterative solvers, and discretization techniques), are welcome.

To minimize the total size, a scaled-down model of an air-filled tunnel in underground rock was replaced by a cylindrical ceramic rod in pure water. When the upper arm of a sleeve-dipole antenna of the scaled-down cross-borehole pulse radar was directly connected to a coaxial cable, the measured B-scan data were contaminated by unwanted striped patterns that were generated by multipath coupling. Such multipath coupling between the sleeve-antenna pair was generated by the glass-tube-guided waves. To suppress the glass-tube-guided waves, the coaxial cable was clad in ferrite cores. As the total length of the ferrite-core cladding was increased up to 150 mm, the unwanted multipath couplings were gradually suppressed, and the target signature could be more clearly recognized.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2017.8113428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8113428","bistatic pulse radar;ferrite core;multipath coupling;sleeve dipole antenna;tube-guided wave","Couplings;Radar;Ferrites;Coaxial cables;Radar antennas;Ceramics","","","","21","","16 Nov 2017","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

Array elements (unit cells, antennas, etc.) are periodically arranged in order to enhance the response of a single element or to gain new capabilities due to interactions between them. Naturally, electromagnetic simulations of periodic structures have a long history in the literature. This is still an active area as the structures become more complicated and require more sophisticated (accurate, efficient, stable) tools for precise analysis. When the structure is infinitely large, and particularly when the periodicity is sub-wavelength, there are excellent tools based on Fourier series and finite-diff erence models, e.g., see [4] and [5]. Similarly, when the elements can be represented pointwise with or without interactions, there are analytical (e.g., using array factor) and semi-analytical (e.g., using lumped elements and/or transmission-line models) techniques. On the other hand, challenges arise when each element is a complex electromagnetic problem itself while it needs to interact with other complex elements. In addition, if the finiteness is an important geometric parameter of a periodic structure, its full-wave models may lead to large-scale problems that can be difficult to solve numerically. In such cases, it is tempting to substitute high-order mathematical models for the elements [6], specifically by isolating their inner dynamics to derive the required equivalence [7] within the decomposed models. A well-known method in this path is called the Equivalence-Principle Algorithm (EPA), which has been used and improved (e.g., hybridized with or used in other methods) by numerous researchers [7–11].","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2017.8409438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8409438","","Method of moments;Periodic structures;Antenna arrays;MLFMA;Electromagnetics;Acceleration","","","","17","","12 Jul 2018","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

These structures are usually made of silver (Ag) or gold (Au), which are active at optical frequencies with strong plasmonic responses and which provide the favorable characteristics of nanowires. For example, by using a transmission line involving an arrangement of nanowires, electromagnetic energy can be carried to distances long with respect to wavelength. As the technology in this area develops, nanowires with improved geometric properties [8] – such as regularity, cross-sectional preciseness, and surface smoothness – become available, further expanding their usage. Naturally, electromagnetic simulations of nanowires [9-11], especially using their three-dimensional full-wave models, are essential to studying and understanding these important structures, as well as to designing them. In this issue of Solution Box, an optimization problem involving a nanowire transmission line to be improved by a coupler is presented (SOLBOX-08). Specifically, a pair of nanowires with a sharp 90° bend, which leads to significant deteriorations in the power transmission capability due to reflections and diffractions, is considered. The purpose was to design an efficient coupler in a limited space around the corner, in order to improve the transmission as much as possible. In the sample solution that is also considered in this issue, cubic nanoparticles were used to reduce the reflections and to improve the power transmission. Starting from a full grid, the existence and absence of each nanocube was decided based on an optimization via genetic algorithms (GAs). The trials during the optimization were efficiently performed by using the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) [12, 13]. This has been designed for accurate analysis of plasmonic objects [14-16] without resorting to approximate and asymptotic techniques. Different numerical solutions, analysis methods, and optimization tools to design more efficient couplers, probably leading to better transmission capabilities, are welcome. We are also looking for alternative solutions to previous problems (SOLBOX-01 to SOLBOX-07), which can be found in earlier editions of this column.

The standard method based on fixed threshold is too susceptible to both illumination variations and interference. To overcome issues above, a robust detection algorithm with triple constraints for cooperative targets based on spectral residual (TCSR) is proposed. Firstly, by designing an asymmetric cooperative target, which comprises red background, green H and triangle target, the captured original image is converted into a Lab color space, whose saliency map is yielded by constructing the spectral residual. Then, the triple constraints are developed according to the prior knowledge of the cooperative target. Finally, the salient region in saliency map is considered as the cooperative target, and it meets the triple constraints. Experimental results in complex environments show that the proposed TCSR outperforms the standard methods in higher detection accuracy and lower false alarm rate.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.04.04","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038201","saliency detection;cooperative target;spectral residual;triple constraints","Image color analysis;Robustness;Lighting;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Cameras;Detection algorithms;Visualization","","","","","","14 Sep 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Moreover, real attacks tend to be more stealthy and difficult to detect at an early stage.

A lossy object with a known averaged absorption cross section is used to aid the measurement. By measuring decay time constants of the cavity with and without the lossy object, the cavity volume can be extracted. It is found that only one antenna is required for the measurement and the whole measurement can be completed simply and rapidly. The method could be applied to both metallic and non-metallic cavities which makes the proposed method a very attractive alternative to existing methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2745698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8017395","Absorption cross section;cavity volume;decay time constant","Cavity resonators;Antenna measurements;Volume measurement;Frequency measurement;Time measurement;Extraterrestrial measurements;Time-domain analysis","","","","18","CCBY","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem of recovering a sparse signal representation from a signal dictionary might be classified as a linear constraint £0-quasinorm minimization problem, which is thought to be a Non-deterministic Polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem. Although several approximation methods have been developed to solve this problem via convex relaxation, researchers find the nonconvex methods to be more efficient in solving sparse recovery problems than convex methods. In this paper a nonconvex Exponential Metric Approximation (EMA) method is proposed to solve the sparse signal recovery problem. Our proposed EMA method aims to minimize a nonconvex negative exponential metric function to attain the sparse approximation and, with proper transformation, solve the problem via Difference Convex (DC) programming. Numerical simulations show that exponential metric function approximation yields better sparse recovery performance than other methods, and our proposed EMA-DC method is an efficient way to recover the sparse signals that are buried in noise.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2017.7830900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7830900","sparse recovery;exponential metric approximation;sparsity tolerance;DC optimization;signal-to-noise-ratio","","","","","","","26 Jan 2017","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

During the transmission of the communication signal, the impact of IQI is coupled with channel impulse responses (CIR), which makes the traditional channel estimation schemes ineffective. A decoupled estimation scheme is proposed to separately estimate the frequency-dependent IQI and wireless channel. Firstly, the generalized channel model is built to separate the parameters of IQI and wireless channel. Then an iterative estimation scheme of frequency-dependent IQI is designed at the initial stage of communication. Finally, based on the estimation result of IQI, the least square algorithm is utilized to estimate the channel-related parameters at each time of channel variation. Compared with the joint estimation schemes of IQI and channel, the proposed decoupled estimation scheme requires much lower training overhead at each time of channel variation. Simulation results demonstrate the good estimation performance of the proposed scheme.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.03.03","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7978016","direct-conversion transceivers;frequency-dependent in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI);orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);decoupled estimation","OFDM;Channel estimation;Estimation;Training;Frequency estimation;Receivers;Wireless communication","","","","","","13 Jul 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Recently, the feasibility of transistors operating at ultra-low voltages with a nanometer-scale channel length has been extensively investigated for future nanoelectronics. Here, we demonstrate solution-processed single-walled carbon nanotubes-based thin-film transistors (SWCNT-TFTs) with a sub-20-nm-channel operating at ultra-low voltages which utilize an electromigration technique that induces a broken bridge of nanoparticles. By employing the post-treatment process of thermal annealing in a vacuum, the charge transport of the short-channel SWCNT-TFTs was improved. The origin of such improvements is presumed to reduce the charge impurities, including organic/inorganic residues as defect states, as well as to improve electric contact between the SWCNT and the metal electrode, which strongly affects the one-dimensional charge transport.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2017.2756263","National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korea Government(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1A2B2003808); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049267","Short-channel;charge transport;single-walled carbon nanotube;thermal annealing in vacuum","Annealing;Carbom nanotubes;Impurities;Performance evaluation;Transistors","","","","24","OAPA","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new ionospheric data assimilation method is introduced that has the capability to resolve traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). TIDs are important because they cause strong delay and refraction to radio signals that are detrimental to the accuracy of high-frequency (HF) geolocation systems. The capability to accurately specify the ionosphere through data assimilation can correct systems for the error caused by the unknown ionospheric refraction. The new data assimilation method introduced here uses ionospheric models in combination with observations of HF signals from known transmitters. The assimilation methodology was tested by the ability to predict the incoming angles of HF signals from transmitters at a set of nonassimilated test locations. The technique is demonstrated and validated using observations collected during 2 days of a dedicated campaign of ionospheric measurements at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in January 2014. This is the first time that full HF ionospheric data assimilation using an ensemble run of a physics-based model of ionospheric TIDs has been demonstrated. The results show a significant improvement over HF angle-of-arrival prediction using an empirical model and also over the classic method of single-site location using an ionosonde close to the midpoint of the path. The assimilative approach is extendable to include other types of ionospheric measurements.","1944-799X","","10.1002/2016RS006187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8068295","","Data assimilation;Hafnium;Mathematical model;Ionosphere;Geology;Data models;Tomography","","","","","","16 Oct 2017","","","AGU","AGU Journals"

Graph-based approaches, in particular, define various diffusion processes on weighted data graphs. Despite success, these approaches rely on fixed-weight graphs, making ranking sensitive to the input affinity matrix. In this study, we propose a new ranking algorithm that simultaneously learns the data affinity matrix and the ranking scores. The proposed optimization formulation assigns adaptive neighbors to each point in the data based on the local connectivity, and the smoothness constraint assigns similar ranking scores to similar data points.

This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1] . The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3] , DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2644615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803544","Deep convolutional neural networks;semantic pixel-wise segmentation;indoor scenes;road scenes;encoder;decoder;pooling;upsampling","Decoding;Neural networks;Training;Computer architecture;Image segmentation;Semantics;Convolutional codes","","12160","","69","CCBY","2 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Regularized iterative algorithms have emerged as the standard approach to ill-posed inverse problems in the past few decades. These methods produce excellent results, but can be challenging to deploy in practice due to factors including the high computational cost of the forward and adjoint operators and the difficulty of hyperparameter selection. The starting point of this paper is the observation that unrolled iterative methods have the form of a CNN (filtering followed by pointwise nonlinearity) when the normal operator (H*H, where H* is the adjoint of the forward imaging operator, H) of the forward model is a convolution. Based on this observation, we propose using direct inversion followed by a CNN to solve normal-convolutional inverse problems. The direct inversion encapsulates the physical model of the system, but leads to artifacts when the problem is ill posed; the CNN combines multiresolution decomposition and residual learning in order to learn to remove these artifacts while preserving image structure. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed network in sparse-view reconstruction (down to 50 views) on parallel beam X-ray computed tomography in synthetic phantoms as well as in real experimental sinograms. The proposed network outperforms total variation-regularized iterative reconstruction for the more realistic phantoms and requires less than a second to reconstruct a 512 × 512 image on the GPU.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2017.2713099","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (call 2015)(grant numbers:665667); Center for Biomedical Imaging of the Geneva-Lausanne Universities and EPFL; European Research Council (H2020-ERC Project GlobalBioIm)(grant numbers:692726); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(grant numbers:EB017095,EB017185); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7949028","Image restoration;image reconstruction;tomography;computed tomography;magnetic resonance imaging;biomedical signal processing;biomedical imaging;reconstruction algorithms","Image reconstruction;Convolution;Inverse problems;Computed tomography;Neural networks;Iterative methods","","1577","","38","OAPA","15 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The literature has reported on various voltage-boosting techniques, in which fundamental energy storing elements (inductors and capacitors) and/or transformers in conjunction with switch(es) and diode(s) are utilized in the circuit. These techniques include switched capacitor (charge pump), voltage multiplier, switched inductor/voltage lift, magnetic coupling, and multistage/-level, and each has its own merits and demerits depending on application, in terms of cost, complexity, power density, reliability, and efficiency. To meet the growing demand for such applications, new power converter topologies that use the above voltage-boosting techniques, as well as some active and passive components, are continuously being proposed. The permutations and combinations of the various voltage-boosting techniques with additional components in a circuit allow for numerous new topologies and configurations, which are often confusing and difficult to follow. Therefore, to present a clear picture on the general law and framework of the development of next-generation step-up dc–dc converters, this paper aims to comprehensively review and classify various step-up dc–dc converters based on their characteristics and voltage-boosting techniques.

Such methodologies, nevertheless, can lead to information loss in representing hyperspectral pixels, which intrinsically have a sequence-based data structure. A recurrent neural network (RNN), an important branch of the deep learning family, is mainly designed to handle sequential data. Can sequence-based RNN be an effective method of hyperspectral image classification? In this paper, we propose a novel RNN model that can effectively analyze hyperspectral pixels as sequential data and then determine information categories via network reasoning. As far as we know, this is the first time that an RNN framework has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. Specifically, our RNN makes use of a newly proposed activation function, parametric rectified tanh (PRetanh), for hyperspectral sequential data analysis instead of the popular tanh or rectified linear unit. The proposed activation function makes it possible to use fairly high learning rates without the risk of divergence during the training procedure. Moreover, a modified gated recurrent unit, which uses PRetanh for hidden representation, is adopted to construct the recurrent layer in our network to efficiently process hyperspectral data and reduce the total number of parameters. Experimental results on three airborne hyperspectral images suggest competitive performance in the proposed mode. In addition, the proposed network architecture opens a new window for future research, showcasing the huge potential of deep recurrent networks for hyperspectral data analysis.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2636241","China Scholarship Council; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Helmholtz Association through the framework of the Young Investigators Group SiPEO(grant numbers:VH-NG-1018); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Acronym: So2Sat)(grant numbers:ERC-2016-StG-714087); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7914752","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;gated recurrent unit (GRU);hyperspectral image classification;long short-term memory (LSTM);recurrent neural network (RNN)","Hyperspectral imaging;Recurrent neural networks;Logic gates;Support vector machines;Data models","","1039","1","48","OAPA","28 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which has been recently proposed for the third-generation partnership projects long-term evolution advanced (3GPP-LTE-A), constitutes a promising technology of addressing the aforementioned challenges in 5G networks by accommodating several users within the same orthogonal resource block. By doing so, significant bandwidth efficiency enhancement can be attained over conventional orthogonal multiple-access (OMA) techniques. This motivated numerous researchers to dedicate substantial research contributions to this field. In this context, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in power-domain multiplexing-aided NOMA, with a focus on the theoretical NOMA principles, multiple-antenna-aided NOMA design, on the interplay between NOMA and cooperative transmission, on the resource control of NOMA, on the coexistence of NOMA with other emerging potential 5G techniques and on the comparison with other NOMA variants. We highlight the main advantages of power-domain multiplexing NOMA compared to other existing NOMA techniques. We summarize the challenges of existing research contributions of NOMA and provide potential solutions.

However, one of specific challenges to achieve smart manufacturing with these strategies is how to converge the manufacturing physical world and the virtual world, so as to realize a series of smart operations in the manufacturing process, including smart interconnection, smart interaction, smart control and management, etc. In this context, as a basic unit of manufacturing, shop-floor is required to reach the interaction and convergence between physical and virtual spaces, which is not only the imperative demand of smart manufacturing, but also the evolving trend of itself. Accordingly, a novel concept of digital twin shopfloor (DTS) based on digital twin is explored and its four key components are discussed, including physical shop-floor, virtual shop-floor, shop-floor service system, and shop-floor digital twin data.

Current methods to effectively manage and protect medical records have been proved to be insufficient. In this paper, we propose MeDShare, a system that addresses the issue of medical data sharing among medical big data custodians in a trust-less environment. The system is blockchain-based and provides data provenance, auditing, and control for shared medical data in cloud repositories among big data entities. MeDShare monitors entities that access data for malicious use from a data custodian system. In MeDShare, data transitions and sharing from one entity to the other, along with all actions performed on the MeDShare system, are recorded in a tamper-proof manner. The design employs smart contracts and an access control mechanism to effectively track the behavior of the data and revoke access to offending entities on detection of violation of permissions on data. The performance of MeDShare is comparable to current cutting edge solutions to data sharing among cloud service providers. By implementing MeDShare, cloud service providers and other data guardians will be able to achieve data provenance and auditing while sharing medical data with entities such as research and medical institutions with minimal risk to data privacy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2730843","Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2015JY0043); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2015J154,ZYGX2016J152,ZYGX2016J170); International Science and Technology Cooperation and Exchange of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2017HH0028); Key Research and Development Projects of High and New Technology Development and Industrialization of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2017GZ0007); National Key Project in Cyber Security(grant numbers:2016QY04W0800,02,03); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016QY04W0800,02,03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990130","Access control;blockchain;cloud computing;data sharing;electronic medical records;privacy","Cloud computing;Contracts;Access control;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Public key","","822","2","31","OAPA","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we streamline machine learning algorithms for effective prediction of chronic disease outbreak in disease-frequent communities. We experiment the modified prediction models over real-life hospital data collected from central China in 2013-2015. To overcome the difficulty of incomplete data, we use a latent factor model to reconstruct the missing data. We experiment on a regional chronic disease of cerebral infarction. We propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multimodal disease risk prediction algorithm using structured and unstructured data from hospital. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work focused on both data types in the area of medical big data analytics.

In this study, the current state in the field of LIPSS is reviewed. Their formation mechanisms are analyzed in ultrafast time-resolved scattering, diffraction, and polarization constrained double-pulse experiments.

Power system resilience characterizes the ability to resist, adapt to, and timely recover from disruptions. The resilient power system is intended to cope with low probability, high risk extreme events including extreme natural disasters and man-made attacks. With an increasing awareness of such threats, the resilience of power systems has become a top priority for many countries. Facing the pressing urgency for resilience studies, the objective of this paper is to investigate the resilience of power systems. It summarizes practices taken by governments, utilities, and researchers to increase power system resilience. Based on a thorough review on the existing metrics system and evaluation methodologies, we present the concept, metrics, and a quantitative framework for power system resilience evaluation.

The deep learning techniques are explored to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches. Specifically, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed for time series classification. Different from other feature-based classification approaches, CNN can discover and extract the suitable internal structure to generate deep features of the input time series automatically by using convolution and pooling operations. Two groups of experiments are conducted on simulated data sets and eight groups of experiments are conducted on real-world data sets from different application domains.

The two major problems for object localization in remote sensing images caused by the complex context information such images contain are achieving generalizability of the features used to describe objects and achieving accurate object locations. To address these challenges, we propose a new object localization framework, which can be divided into three processes: region proposal, classification, and accurate object localization process. First, a region proposal method is used to generate candidate regions with the aim of detecting all objects of interest within these images. Then, generic image features from a local image corresponding to each region proposal are extracted by a combination model of 2-D reduction convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, to improve the location accuracy, we propose an unsupervised score-based bounding box regression (USB-BBR) algorithm, combined with a nonmaximum suppression algorithm to optimize the bounding boxes of regions that detected as objects. Experiments show that the dimension-reduction model performs better than the retrained and fine-tuned models and the detection precision of the combined CNN model is much higher than that of any single model. Also our proposed USB-BBR algorithm can more accurately locate objects within an image. Compared with traditional features extraction methods, such as elliptic Fourier transform-based histogram of oriented gradients and local binary pattern histogram Fourier, our proposed localization framework shows robustness when dealing with different complex backgrounds.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2645610","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB0502602); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7827088","Convolutional neural network (CNN);object localization;remote sensing images;unsupervised score-based bounding box regression (USB-BBR)","Remote sensing;Feature extraction;Object detection;Proposals;Semantics;Search methods;Neural networks","","554","","51","CCBY","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

NTC is important, because much information about a current network flow can be learned and anticipated just by knowing its network service (required latency, traffic volume, and possible duration). This is of particular interest for the management and monitoring of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where NTC will help to segregate traffic and behavior of heterogeneous devices and services.

Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability.

Such energy dissipation overall is now at environmentally significant levels; the source of that dissipation is progressively shifting from logic operations to interconnect energies. Without the prospect of substantial reduction in energy per bit communicated, we cannot continue the exponential growth of our use of information. The physics of optics and optoelectronics fundamentally addresses both interconnect energy and bandwidth density, and optics may be the only scalable solution to such problems. Here we summarize the corresponding background, status, opportunities, and research directions for optoelectronic technology and novel optics, including subfemtojoule devices in waveguide and novel two-dimensional (2-D) array optical systems. We compare different approaches to low-energy optoelectronic output devices and their scaling, including lasers, modulators and LEDs, optical confinement approaches (such as resonators) to enhance effects, and the benefits of different material choices, including 2-D materials and other quantum-confined structures. With such optoelectronic energy reductions, and the elimination of line charging dissipation by the use optical connections, the next major interconnect dissipations are in the electronic circuits for receiver amplifiers, timing recovery, and multiplexing. We show we can address these through the integration of photodetectors to reduce or eliminate receiver circuit energies, free-space optics to eliminate the need for timing and multiplexing circuits (while also solving bandwidth density problems), and using optics generally to save power by running large synchronous systems. One target concept is interconnects from ~1 cm to ~10 m that have the same energy (~10 fJ/bit) and simplicity as local electrical wires on chip.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2017.2647779","Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative Grant(grant numbers:FA9550-12-1-0024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805240","Integrated optoelectronics;optical arrays;optical communications;optical computing;optical interconnections;optical resonators;optoelectronic devices;quantum-confined Stark effect;space-division multiplexing;wavelength-division multiplexing","Integrated circuit interconnections;Optical interconnections;Bandwidth;Optical receivers;Information processing;Optical amplifiers","","520","15","227","OAPA","4 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The integration level of the DPGS into the grid plays a critical role in developing sustainable and resilient power systems, especially with highly intermittent renewable energy resources. To address the challenging issues and, more importantly, to leverage the energy generation, stringent demands from both utility operators and consumers have been imposed on the DPGS. Furthermore, as the core of energy conversion, numerous power electronic converters employing advanced control techniques have been developed for the DPGS to consolidate the integration.

This paper aims to provide fundamentals insights on the modeling and quantification of power systems resilience. Specifically, a fragility model of individual components and then of the whole transmission system is built for mapping the real-time impact of severe weather, with focus on wind events, on their failure probabilities. A probabilistic multitemporal and multiregional resilience assessment methodology, based on optimal power flow and sequential Monte Carlo simulation, is then introduced, allowing the assessment of the spatiotemporal impact of a windstorm moving across a transmission network. Different risk-based resilience enhancement (or adaptation) measures are evaluated, which are driven by the resilience achievement worth index of the individual transmission components. The methodology is demonstrated using a test version of the Great Britain's system. As key outputs, the results demonstrate how, by using a mix of infrastructure and operational indices, it is possible to effectively quantify system resilience to extreme weather, identify and prioritize critical network sections, whose criticality depends on the weather intensity, and assess the technical benefits of different adaptation measures to enhance resilience.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2641463","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/I035781/1,EP/I035757/1); UK-Chile ‘Disaster management and resilience in electric power systems’(grant numbers:EP/N034899/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7801854","Critical infrastructure;extreme weather;fragility curve;resilience;resiliency","Resilience;Meteorology;Poles and towers;Hazards;Power system reliability;Reliability","","442","","37","CCBY","29 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Privacy-preserving data aggregation is one of typical fog computing applications in IoT, and many privacy-preserving data aggregation schemes have been proposed in the past years. However, most of them only support data aggregation for homogeneous IoT devices, and cannot aggregate hybrid IoT devices' data into one in some real IoT applications. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme, called Lightweight Privacy-preserving Data Aggregation, for fog computing-enhanced IoT. The proposed LPDA is characterized by employing the homomorphic Paillier encryption, Chinese Remainder Theorem, and one-way hash chain techniques to not only aggregate hybrid IoT devices' data into one, but also early filter injected false data at the network edge. Detailed security analysis shows LPDA is really secure and privacy-enhanced with differential privacy techniques. In addition, extensive performance evaluations are conducted, and the results indicate LPDA is really lightweight in fog computing-enhanced IoT.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2677520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7869305","Internet of Things;fog computing;privacy-preserving aggregation;lightweight;differential privacy","Security;Data aggregation;Edge computing;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Aggregates;Computational modeling","","385","","34","OAPA","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, thus moving the control logic from the node to a central controller. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature. Moreover, it delves into some of the challenges facing this paradigm, as well as the major SDWSN design requirements that need to be considered to address these challenges.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2666200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7847327","Software defined wireless sensor networks;software defined networking;wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks;Software;Protocols;Iron;Internet of Things;Switches","","357","","187","OAPA","8 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike existing hierarchical architectures for pattern recognition, the presented model relies on a time oriented approach to extract spatio-temporal features from the asynchronously acquired dynamics of a visual scene. These dynamics are acquired using biologically inspired frameless asynchronous event-driven vision sensors. Similarly to cortical structures, subsequent layers in our hierarchy extract increasingly abstract features using increasingly large spatio-temporal windows. The central concept is to use the rich temporal information provided by events to create contexts in the form of time-surfaces which represent the recent temporal activity within a local spatial neighborhood. We demonstrate that this concept can robustly be used at all stages of an event-based hierarchical model. First layer feature units operate on groups of pixels, while subsequent layer feature units operate on the output of lower level feature units. We report results on a previously published 36 class character recognition task and a four class canonical dynamic card pip task, achieving near 100 percent accuracy on each.

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2633287","EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/L014149/1); EPSRC-NIHR HTC Partnership Award(grant numbers:EP/M000257/1,EP/N027132/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797232","ActiveMiles;deep learning;Human Activity Recognition (HAR);Internet-of-Things (IoT);low-power devices;wearable","Machine learning;Feature extraction;Time-frequency analysis;Spectrogram;Real-time systems;Pipelines;Performance evaluation","Human Activities;Humans;Machine Learning;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Neural Networks (Computer);Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","338","","34","CCBY","23 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: (1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); (2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; (3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; (4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in CI; (5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and (6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7%) and evaluation (36.2%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2685629","Data61, a business unit of CSIRO, Australia; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7884954","Continuous integration;continuous delivery;continuous deployment;continuous software engineering;systematic literature review;empirical software engineering","Software;Organizations;Software engineering;Systematics;Bibliographies;Testing;Production","","334","","59","OAPA","22 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes an improvement to the whale optimization algorithm that is based on a Lévy flight trajectory and called the Lévy flight trajectory-based whale optimization algorithm (LWOA). The LWOA makes the WOA faster and more robust and avoids premature convergence. The Lévy flight trajectory is helpful for increasing the diversity of the population against premature convergence and enhancing the capability of jumping out of local optimal optima. This method helps obtaining a better tradeoff between the exploration and exploitation of the WOA. The proposed algorithm is characterized by quick convergence and high precision, and it can effectively get rid of a local optimum. The LWOA is further compared with other well-known nature-inspired algorithms on 23 benchmarks and solving infinite impulse response model identification. The statistical results on the benchmark functions show that the LWOA can significantly outperform others on a majority of the benchmark functions, especially in solving an optimization problem that has high dimensionality. Additionally, the superior identification capability of the proposed algorithm is evident from the results obtained through the simulation study compared with other algorithms.

Mining such data yields stimulating information that serves its handlers well. Rapid growth in educational data points to the fact that distilling massive amounts of data requires a more sophisticated set of algorithms. This issue led to the emergence of the field of educational data mining (EDM). Traditional data mining algorithms cannot be directly applied to educational problems, as they may have a specific objective and function. This implies that a preprocessing algorithm has to be enforced first and only then some specific data mining methods can be applied to the problems. One such preprocessing algorithm in EDM is clustering. Many studies on EDM have focused on the application of various data mining algorithms to educational attributes. Therefore, this paper provides over three decades long (1983-2016) systematic literature review on clustering algorithm and its applicability and usability in the context of EDM.

In these scenarios, vehicle stabilization becomes important to ensure that the vehicle does not lose control. However, stabilization actions may conflict with those necessary for collision avoidance, potentially leading to a collision. This paper presents a new control structure that integrates path tracking, vehicle stabilization, and collision avoidance and mediates among these sometimes conflicting objectives by prioritizing collision avoidance. It can even temporarily violate vehicle stabilization criteria if needed to avoid a collision. The framework is implemented using model predictive and feedback controllers. Incorporating tire nonlinearities into the model allows the controller to use all of the vehicle’s performance capability to meet the objectives. A prediction horizon comprised of variable length time steps integrates the different time scales associated with stabilization and collision avoidance. Experimental data from an autonomous vehicle demonstrate the controller safely driving at the vehicle’s handling limits and avoiding an obstacle suddenly introduced in the middle of a turn.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2016.2599783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7585053","Autonomous vehicles;collision avoidance;model predictive control;vehicle control;vehicle stability","Vehicles;Trajectory;Collision avoidance;Tires;Autonomous automobiles;Predictive models;Stability analysis","","308","","24","OAPA","6 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, soft open point (SOP), a flexible power electronic device, can be used as the continuous reactive power source to realize the fast voltage regulation. Considering the cooperation of SOP and multiple regulation devices, this paper proposes a coordinated VVC method based on SOP for ADNs. First, a time-series model of coordinated VVC is developed to minimize operation costs and eliminate voltage violations of ADNs. Then, by applying the linearization and conic relaxation, the original nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model is converted into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model which can be efficiently solved to meet the requirement of voltage regulation rapidity.

When the system transform matrix has independent identically distributed (IID) Gaussian entries, the performance of AMP can be asymptotically characterized by a simple scalar recursion called state evolution (SE). However, SE may become unreliable for other matrix ensembles, especially for ill-conditioned ones. This imposes limits on the applications of AMP. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal AMP (OAMP) algorithm based on de-correlated linear estimation (LE) and divergence-free non-linear estimation (NLE). The Onsager term in standard AMP vanishes as a result of the divergence-free constraint on NLE. We develop an SE procedure for OAMP and show numerically that the SE for OAMP is accurate for general unitarily-invariant matrices, including IID Gaussian matrices and partial orthogonal matrices. We further derive optimized options for OAMP and show that the corresponding SE fixed point coincides with the optimal performance obtained via the replica method. Our numerical results demonstrate that OAMP can be advantageous over AMP, especially for ill-conditioned matrices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2653119","University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:AoE/E-02/08,CityU 11217515,CityU 11280216); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7817805","Compressed sensing;approximate message passing (AMP);replica method;state evolution;unitarily-invariant;IID Gaussian;partial orthogonal matrix","Discrete cosine transforms;Estimation;Message passing;Algorithm design and analysis;Sparse matrices;Gaussian processes;Orthogonal matrices","","285","","45","OAPA","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to utilize data in different working conditions to improve the performance, this paper presents a transfer learning approach for fault diagnosis with neural networks. First, it learns characteristics from massive source data and adjusts the parameters of neural networks accordingly. Second, the structure of neural networks alters for the change of data distribution. In the same time, some parameters are transferred from source task to target task. Finally, the new model is trained by a small amount of target data in another working condition. The Case Western Reserve University bearing data set is used to validate the performance of the proposed transfer learning approach.

We first dynamically group the UE receive antennas into a number of clusters equal to or more than the number of BS transmit antennas. A single beamforming vector is then shared by all the receive antennas in a cluster. We propose a linear beamforming technique in which all the receive antennas can significantly cancel the inter-cluster interference. On the other hand, the receive antennas in each cluster are scheduled on the power domain NOMA basis with SIC at the receiver ends. For inter-cluster and intra-cluster power allocation, we provide dynamic power allocation solutions with an objective to maximizing the overall cell capacity. An extensive performance evaluation is carried out for the proposed MIMO-NOMA system and the results are compared with those for conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based MIMO systems and other existing MIMO-NOMA solutions.

There are many techniques to address this, including data augmentation, dropout, and transfer learning. In this paper, we introduce an additional method, which we call smart augmentation and we show how to use it to increase the accuracy and reduce over fitting on a target network. Smart augmentation works, by creating a network that learns how to generate augmented data during the training process of a target network in a way that reduces that networks loss. This allows us to learn augmentations that minimize the error of that network. Smart augmentation has shown the potential to increase accuracy by demonstrably significant measures on all data sets tested. In addition, it has shown potential to achieve similar or improved performance levels with significantly smaller network sizes in a number of tested cases.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696121","SFI Strategic Partnership Program on Next Generation Imaging for Smartphone and Embedded Platforms by Science Foundation Ireland and FotoNation Ltd(grant numbers:13/SPP/I2868); Irish Research Council Employment Based Programme Award(grant numbers:EBPPG/2016/280); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7906545","Artificial intelligence;artificial neural networks;machine learning;computer vision supervised learning;machine learning algorithms;image databases","Training;Biological neural networks;Informatics;Electronic mail;Machine learning;Data models","","271","3","20","OAPA","24 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Stochastic geometry is used to characterize the performance of the proposed mmWave-NOMA transmission scheme by using key features of mmWave systems, i.e., that mmWave transmission is highly directional and potential blockages will thin the user distribution. Two random beamforming approaches that can further reduce the system overhead are also proposed, and their performance is studied analytically in terms of sum rates and outage probabilities.

Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this position paper is fivefold. First, we review the technological attributes and platforms proposed in the current literature for the standing-alone FC and IoE paradigms. Second, by leveraging some use cases as illustrative examples, we point out that the integration of the FC and IoE paradigms may give rise to opportunities for new applications in the realms of the IoE, Smart City, Industry 4.0, and Big Data Streaming, while introducing new open issues. Third, we propose a novel technological paradigm, the Fog of Everything (FoE) paradigm, that integrates FC and IoE and then we detail the main building blocks and services of the corresponding technological platform and protocol stack. Fourth, as a proof-of-concept, we present the simulated energy-delay performance of a small-scale FoE prototype, namely, the V-FoE prototype. Afterward, we compare the obtained performance with the corresponding one of a benchmark technological platform, e.g., the V-D2D one.

Apart from guiding the probe to the correct location, it can be equally difficult for a non-expert to identify relevant structures within the image. Automatic image processing can provide tools to help experienced as well as inexperienced operators with these tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on convolutional neural networks, which can automatically detect 13 fetal standard views in freehand 2-D ultrasound data as well as provide a localization of the fetal structures via a bounding box. An important contribution is that the network learns to localize the target anatomy using weak supervision based on image-level labels only. The network architecture is designed to operate in real-time while providing optimal output for the localization task. We present results for real-time annotation, retrospective frame retrieval from saved videos, and localization on a very large and challenging dataset consisting of images and video recordings of full clinical anomaly screenings. We found that the proposed method achieved an average F1-score of 0.798 in a realistic classification experiment modeling real-time detection, and obtained a 90.09% accuracy for retrospective frame retrieval.

Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud.

In this paper, we propose an improved variant of the differential grouping (DG) algorithm, which has a better efficiency and grouping accuracy. The proposed algorithm, DG2, finds a reliable threshold value by estimating the magnitude of roundoff errors. With respect to efficiency, DG2 reuses the sample points that are generated for detecting interactions and saves up to half of the computational resources on fully separable functions. We mathematically show that the new sampling technique achieves the lower bound with respect to the number of function evaluations. Unlike its predecessor, DG2 checks all possible pairs of variables for interactions and has the capacity to identify overlapping components of an objective function. On the accuracy aspect, DG2 outperforms the state-of-the-art decomposition methods on the latest large-scale continuous optimization benchmark suites. DG2 also performs reliably in the presence of imbalance among contribution of components in an objective function. Another major advantage of DG2 is the automatic calculation of its threshold parameter ($\epsilon $ ), which makes it parameter-free. Finally, the experimental results show that when DG2 is used within a cooperative co-evolutionary framework, it can generate competitive results as compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2017.2694221","EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/K001523/1,EP/J017515/1); ARC Discovery(grant numbers:DP120102205); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61305086,61329302); Open Research Project of the Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing(grant numbers:KLIGIP201602); Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911173","Cooperative co-evolution;differential grouping (DG);large-scale global optimization;problem decomposition","Optimization;Linear programming;Benchmark testing;Sensitivity;Roundoff errors;Computer science;Reliability","","254","","71","CCBY","25 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite the great potential of this integration, it also brings new threats, such as the exposure of sensor nodes to attacks originating from the Internet. In this context, lightweight authentication and key agreement protocols must be in place to enable end-to-end secure communication. Recently, Amin et al. proposed a three-factor mutual authentication protocol for WSNs. However, we identified several flaws in their protocol. We found that their protocol suffers from smart card loss attack where the user identity and password can be guessed using offline brute force techniques. Moreover, the protocol suffers from known session-specific temporary information attack, which leads to the disclosure of session keys in other sessions. Furthermore, the protocol is vulnerable to tracking attack and fails to fulfill user untraceability. To address these deficiencies, we present a lightweight and secure user authentication protocol based on the Rabin cryptosystem, which has the characteristic of computational asymmetry. We conduct a formal verification of our proposed protocol using ProVerif in order to demonstrate that our scheme fulfills the required security properties. We also present a comprehensive heuristic security analysis to show that our protocol is secure against all the possible attacks and provides the desired security features.

Taking advantage of ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms in preserving high diversity, this paper intends to extend ACO algorithms to deal with multimodal optimization. First, combined with current niching methods, an adaptive multimodal continuous ACO algorithm is introduced. In this algorithm, an adaptive parameter adjustment is developed, which takes the difference among niches into consideration. Second, to accelerate convergence, a differential evolution mutation operator is alternatively utilized to build base vectors for ants to construct new solutions. Then, to enhance the exploitation, a local search scheme based on Gaussian distribution is self-adaptively performed around the seeds of niches. Together, the proposed algorithm affords a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments on 20 widely used benchmark multimodal functions are conducted to investigate the influence of each algorithmic component and results are compared with several state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms and winners of competitions on multimodal optimization. These comparisons demonstrate the competitive efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, especially in dealing with complex problems with high numbers of local optima.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2016.2591064","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61379061,61332002,61511130078,6141101191); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2015A030306024); Guangdong Special Support Program(grant numbers:2014TQ01X550); Guangzhou Pearl River New Star of Science and Technology(grant numbers:201506010002,151700098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7511696","Ant colony optimization (ACO);multimodal optimization;multiple global optima;niching","Optimization;Algorithm design and analysis;Sociology;Statistics;Ant colony optimization;Clustering algorithms;Computer science","","248","","87","OAPA","13 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we describe the fog computing architecture and review its different services and applications. We then discuss security and privacy issues in fog computing, focusing on service and resource availability. Virtualization is a vital technology in both fog and cloud computing that enables virtual machines (VMs) to coexist in a physical server (host) to share resources. These VMs could be subject to malicious attacks or the physical server hosting it could experience system failure, both of which result in unavailability of services and resources. Therefore, a conceptual smart pre-copy live migration approach is presented for VM migration. Using this approach, we can estimate the downtime after each iteration to determine whether to proceed to the stop-and-copy stage during a system failure or an attack on a fog computing node. This will minimize both the downtime and the migration time to guarantee resource and service availability to the end users of fog computing.

If a change is detected, it reuses a portion of outdated solutions with good distribution and relocates a number of solutions close to the new Pareto front based on the information collected from previous environments and the new environment. This way, the algorithm can quickly adapt to changing environments and thus is expected to provide a good tracking ability.

In this paper, a dual-mode OFDM technique (DM-OFDM) is proposed, which is combined with index modulation and enhances the attainable throughput of conventional index-modulation-based OFDM. In particular, the subcarriers are divided into several subblocks, and in each subblock, all the subcarriers are partitioned into two groups, modulated by a pair of distinguishable modem-mode constellations, respectively. Hence, the information bits are conveyed not only by the classic constellation symbols, but also implicitly by the specific activated subcarrier indices, representing the subcarriers' constellation mode. At the receiver, a maximum likelihood (ML) detector and a reduced-complexity near optimal log-likelihood ratio-based detector are invoked for demodulation. The minimum distance between the different legitimate realizations of the OFDM subblocks is calculated for characterizing the performance of DM-OFDM. Then, the associated theoretical analysis based on the pairwise error probability is carried out for estimating the BER of DM-OFDM. Furthermore, the simulation results confirm that at a given throughput, DM-OFDM achieves a considerably better BER performance than other OFDM systems using index modulation, while imposing the same or lower computational complexity. The results also demonstrate that the performance of the proposed low-complexity detector is indistinguishable from that of the ML detector, provided that the system's signal to noise ratio is sufficiently high.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2601648","National Key Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2013CB329203); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571267); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:1108170036003286); Shenzhen Visible Light Communication System Key Laboratory(grant numbers:ZDSYS20140512114229398); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7547943","Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);index modulation;index pattern;constellation;maximum likelihood detection;log-likelihood ratio based detection","Indexes;OFDM;Detectors;Phase shift keying;Throughput;Signal to noise ratio","","241","","29","CCBY","19 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a neuro development disorder, neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), coupled with machine learning algorithms, are being increasingly explored as biomarkers in ADHD. Among various machine learning methods, deep learning has demonstrated excellent performance on many imaging tasks. With the availability of publically-available, large neuroimaging data sets for training purposes, deep learning-based automatic diagnosis of psychiatric disorders can become feasible. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based ADHD classification method via 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to MRI scans. Since deep neural networks may utilize millions of parameters, even the large number of MRI samples in pooled data sets is still relatively limited if one is to learn discriminative features from the raw data. Instead, here we propose to first extract meaningful 3-D low-level features from functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) data. Furthermore, inspired by radiologists' typical approach for examining brain images, we design a 3-D CNN model to investigate the local spatial patterns of MRI features. Finally, we discover that brain functional and structural information are complementary, and design a multi-modality CNN architecture to combine fMRI and sMRI features. Evaluations on the hold-out testing data of the ADHD-200 global competition shows that the proposed multi-modality 3-D CNN approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 69.15% and outperforms reported classifiers in the literature, even with fewer training samples. We suggest that multi-modality classification will be a promising direction to find potential neuroimaging biomarkers of neuro development disorders.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762703","NPRP through the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)(grant numbers:7-684-1-127); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067637","Attention deficit hyperactive disorder;3D CNN;magnetic resonance imaging;multi-modality analysis","Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Testing;Training;Neuroimaging;Biological neural networks","","233","","40","OAPA","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Printed/Organic Electronics, now an industry on its own right and recognized as one of the key technological enablers for the Internet of Things, is largely complementary to silicon because the printed transistors are slow and the printed elements are large. The sanguine projected growth of the $29 B market today to $73 B by 2027 assumes that `intelligence' (analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing) would be realizable. Nevertheless, many of the said attributes of printed/organic electronics remain a challenge.

We further review the application space of printed/organic electronics and the supply chain, including their classifications and delineate the associated challenges in each constituent chain. These challenges, largely unresolved, are indeed formidable, and are discussed with a critical circuits and systems perspective. Our review depicts that contemporary design philosophies and methodologies for silicon are largely inadequate for printed/organic electronics.

In order to minimize the energy consumption on SMDs, we jointly optimize the offloading selection, radio resource allocation, and computational resource allocation coordinately. We formulate the energy consumption minimization problem as a mixed interger nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is subject to specific application latency constraints. In order to solve the problem, we propose a reformulation-linearization-technique-based Branch-and-Bound (RLTBB) method, which can obtain the optimal result or a suboptimal result by setting the solving accuracy. Considering the complexity of RTLBB cannot be guaranteed, we further design a Gini coefficient-based greedy heuristic (GCGH) to solve the MINLP problem in polynomial complexity by degrading the MINLP problem into the convex problem. Many simulation results demonstrate the energy saving enhancements of RLTBB and GCGH.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2710056","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471060); National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2017ZX03001003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7938331","Mobile edge computing;computation offloading;energy minimization;branch-and-bound method;reformulation-linearization-technique;Gini coefficient","Energy consumption;Servers;Resource management;Mobile communication;Computational modeling;Minimization;Radio spectrum management","","224","","38","OAPA","2 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The lack of robustness of existing methods directly results in a lack of penetration of such systems into clinical practice. The present work proposes an alternative method to improve the robustness of the estimation of RR from the PPG. Methods: The proposed algorithm is based on the use of multiple autoregressive models of different orders for determining the dominant respiratory frequency in the three respiratory-induced variations (frequency, amplitude, and intensity) derived from the PPG. The algorithm was tested on two different datasets comprising 95 eight-minute PPG recordings (in total) acquired from both children and adults in different clinical settings, and its performance using two window sizes (32 and 64 seconds) was compared with that of existing methods in the literature. Results: The proposed method achieved comparable accuracy to existing methods in the literature, with mean absolute errors (median, 25th-75th percentiles for a window size of 32 seconds) of 1.5 (0.3-3.3) and 4.0 (1.8-5.5) breaths per minute (for each dataset respectively), whilst providing RR estimates for a greater proportion of windows (over 90% of the input data are kept). Conclusion: Increased robustness of RR estimation by the proposed method was demonstrated. Significance: This work demonstrates that the use of large publicly available datasets is essential for improving the robustness of wearable-monitoring algorithms for use in clinical practice.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2613124","Health Innovation Challenge Fund; Wellcome Trust and the Department of Health; EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/F058845/1); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre; Guy's and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and Kings College London; Rhodes Trust; Centre of Excellence in Personalised Healthcare; Wellcome Trust and EPSRC(grant numbers:WT 088877/Z/09/Z); Royal Academy of Engineering; Balliol College, Oxford; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748483","Mobile health;patient monitoring;photoplethysmography;pulse oximetry;respiratory rate","Robustness;Estimation;Hospitals;Resonant frequency;Electronic mail;Heart rate;Biomedical measurement","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Child;Child, Preschool;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Male;Middle Aged;Oximetry;Regression Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Respiratory Rate;Sensitivity and Specificity;Young Adult","220","","44","CCBY","18 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Collision avoidance and trajectory planning are the core areas of any UAV system. However, there are theoretical and practical problems associated with the existing methods. To manage these problems, this paper presents an optimized artificial potential field (APF) algorithm for multi-UAV operation in 3-D dynamic space. The classic APF algorithm is restricted to single UAV trajectory planning and usually fails to guarantee the avoidance of collisions. To overcome this challenge, a method is proposed with a distance factor and jump strategy to solve common problems, such as unreachable targets, and ensure that the UAV will not collide with any obstacles. The method considers the UAV companions as dynamic obstacles to realize collaborative trajectory planning. Furthermore, the jitter problem is solved using the dynamic step adjustment method. Several resolution scenarios are illustrated. The method has been validated in quantitative test simulation models and satisfactory results were obtained in a simulated urban environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2746752","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71601181); Military Scientific Research Project(grant numbers:162017160500A21XXX); State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems-Open Project(grant numbers:20160109); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8022685","Multi-UAV;trajectory planning;collision avoidance;artificial potential field;jitter problem","Trajectory;Force;Planning;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Collision avoidance;Jitter;Algorithm design and analysis","","219","","23","OAPA","30 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The data set containing samples of the above mentioned fault signals was acquired as follows: normal data signals were obtained from a temperature-to-voltage converter by using an Arduino Uno microcontroller board and MATLAB. Then, faults were simulated in normal data to get 100 samples of each fault, in which one sample is composed of 1000 data elements. A support vector machine (SVM) was used for data classification in a one-versus-rest manner. The statistical time-domain features, extracted from a sample, were used as a single observation for training and testing SVM. The number of features varied from 5 to 10 to examine the effect on accuracy of SVM. Three different kernel functions used to train SVM include linear, polynomial, and radial-basis function kernels. The fault occurrence event in fault samples was chosen randomly in some cases to replicate a practical scenario in industrial systems. The results show that an increase in the number of features from 5 to 10 hardly increases the total accuracy of the classifier. However, using ten features gives the highest accuracy for fault classification in an SVM. An increase in the number of training samples from 40 to 60 caused an overfitting problem. The k-fold cross-validation technique was adopted to overcome this issue. The increase in number of data elements per sample to 2500 increases the efficiency of the classifier. However, an increase in the number of training samples to 400 reduces the capability of SVM to classify stuck fault.

They are eventually used for selecting the threshold that allows binarizing the image in an optimal way. In this context, one of the main difficulties in parameterizing these functions originates from the fact that the target class often represents only a small fraction of the image. Under such circumstances, the histogram of the image values is often not obviously bimodal and it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to accurately parameterize distribution functions. Here we introduce a hierarchical split-based approach that searches for tiles of variable size allowing the parameterization of the distributions of two classes. The method is integrated into a flood-mapping algorithm in order to evaluate its capacity for parameterizing distribution functions attributed to floodwater and changes caused by floods. We analyzed a data set acquired during a flood event along the Severn River (U.K.) in 2007. It is composed of moderate (ENVISAT-WS) and high (TerraSAR-X)-resolution SAR images. The obtained classification accuracies as well as the similarity of performance levels to a benchmark obtained with an established method based on the manual selection of tiles indicate the validity of the new method.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2737664","Luxembourg National Research Fund through the MOSQUITO(grant numbers:C15/SR/10380137); PAPARAZZI projects(grant numbers:C11/SR/1277979); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8017436","Change detection (CD);flood;hierarchical split-based approach (HSBA);parametric thresholding;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Backscatter;Histograms;Speckle;Distribution functions;Spatial resolution","","208","","61","OAPA","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To meet increasing security and privacy requirements, physiological signalbased biometric human identification is gaining tremendous attention. This paper focuses on two major impediments: the signal processing technique is usually both complicated and data-dependent and the feature engineering is time-consuming and can fit only specific datasets . To enable a data-independent and highly generalizable signal processing and feature learning process, a novel wavelet domain multiresolution convolutional neural network is proposed. Specifically, it allows for blindly selecting a physiological signal segment for identification purpose, avoiding the complicated signal fiducial characteristics extraction process. To enrich the data representation, the random chosen signal segment is then transformed to the wavelet domain, where multiresolution time-frequency representation is achieved. An auto-correlation operation is applied to the transformed data to remove the phase difference as the result of the blind segmentation operation. Afterward, a multiresolution 1-D-convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) is introduced to automatically learn the intrinsic hierarchical features from the wavelet domain raw data without datadependent and heavy feature engineering, and perform the user identification task. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is thoroughly evaluated on eight electrocardiogram datasets with diverse behaviors, such as with or without severe heart diseases, and with different sensor placement methods. Our evaluation is much more extensive than the state-of-the-art works, and an average identification rate of 93.5% is achieved. The proposed multiresolution 1-D-CNN algorithm can effectively identify human subjects, even from randomly selected signal segments and without heavy feature engineering. This paper is expected to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the blind signal processing and deep learning techniques to biometric human identification, to enable a low algorithm engineering effort and also a high generalization ability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2707460","Recruitment Program of Global Experts (the Thousand Talents Plan); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61574044,61376040,61574046); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933065","ECG;wavelet transformation;convolutional neural network;deep learning;machine learning;feature learning;blind signal processing;data representation","Electrocardiography;Signal resolution;Feature extraction;Heart rate variability;Convolution;Wavelet domain;Wavelet transforms","","207","","45","OAPA","24 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our proposed approach, the run-time is more than one to two orders of magnitude faster than the best competing methods currently available, while producing results comparable or better than state-of-the-art. A closely related topic is image sharpening and contrast enhancement, i.e., improving the visual quality of a blurry image by amplifying the underlying details (a wide range of frequencies).

With the advent of VEC, service providers directly host services in close proximity of mobile vehicles for great improvements. As a result, a new networking paradigm, vehicular edge networks is emerged along with the development of VEC. However, it is necessary to address security issues for facilitating VEC well. In this paper, we focus on reputation management to ensure security protection and improve network efficiency in the implementation of VEC. A distributed reputation management system (DREAMS) is proposed, wherein VEC servers are adopted to execute local reputation management tasks for vehicles. This system has remarkable features for improving overall performance: 1) distributed reputation maintenance; 2) trusted reputation manifestation; 3) accurate reputation update; and 4) available reputation usage. In particular, we utilize multi-weighted subjective logic for accurate reputation update in DREAMS. To enrich reputation usage in DREAMS, service providers optimize resource allocation in computation offloading by considering reputation of vehicles. Numerical results indicate that DREAMS has great advantages in optimizing misbehavior detection and improving the recognition rate of misbehaving vehicles.

Although the benefits introduced by these emerging solutions have been widely acknowledged in cloud computing, recent advances have led to the spread of such technologies in different contexts. As an example, the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile edge computing benefit from container virtualization by exploiting the possibility of using these technologies not only in data centers but also on devices, which are characterized by fewer computational resources, such as single-board computers. This has led to a growing trend to more efficiently redesign the critical components of IoT/edge scenarios (e.g., gateways) to enable the concept of device virtualization. The possibility for efficiently deploying virtualized instances on single-board computers has already been addressed in recent studies; however, these studies considered only a limited number of devices and omitted important performance metrics from their empirical assessments. This paper seeks to fill this gap and to provide insights for future deployments through a comprehensive performance evaluation that aims to show the strengths and weaknesses of several low-power devices when handling container-virtualized instances.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2704444","FP7 Marie Curie Initial Training Network METRICS Project(grant numbers:607728); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7930383","Internet of Things;edge computing;container virtualization;docker;performance evaluation","Containers;Virtualization;Logic gates;Performance evaluation;Cloud computing;Hardware","","194","","46","OAPA","17 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The operation of the microgrids, along with the shared DER, are coordinated such that the available flexibility sources are optimised and a common goal is achieved, e.g., minimizing energy exchanged with the distribution grid and the overall energy costs. Each microgrid is equipped with an MPC-based energy management system, responsible for optimally controlling flexible loads, heating systems, and local generation devices based on end-user preferences, weather-dependent generation and demand forecasts, energy prices, and technical and operational constraints. The proposed coordination algorithm is distributed and guarantees constraints satisfaction, cooperation among microgrids and fairness in the use of the shared resources, while addressing the issue of scalability of energy management in an urban district. Furthermore, the proposed framework guarantees an agreed cost saving to each microgrid. The described method is implemented and evaluated in a virtual testing environment that integrates accurate simulators of the microgrids.

One of the most important aspects in measuring the extracted features is whether they can explore more information of the inputs and avoid redundancy to be representative. Thus, a stacked sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based machine fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. The penalty term of the SAE can help mine essential information and avoid redundancy. To help the constructed diagnosis network further mine more abstract and representative high-level features, the collected non-stationary and transient signals are preprocessed with ensemble empirical mode decomposition and autoregressive (AR) models to obtain AR parameters, which are extracted based on the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and regarded as the low-level features for the inputs of the proposed diagnosis network. Only the first four IMFs are considered, because fault information is mainly reflected in high-frequency IMFs. Experiments and comparisons are complemented to validate the superiority of the presented diagnosis network. Results fully demonstrate that the stacked SAE-based diagnosis method can extract more discriminative high-level features and has a better performance in rotating machinery fault diagnosis compared with the traditional machine learning methods with shallow architectures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2728010","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51505311,51375322); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20150339); Jiangsu Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project(grant numbers:1601227C); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7983338","Sparse autoencoder;ensemble empirical mode decomposition;autoregressive model;fault diagnosis","Feature extraction;Fault diagnosis;Machinery;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Data mining;Learning systems","","192","","31","OAPA","18 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that leakage can occur both vertically and laterally, and we suggest that this is associated not only with bulk transport, but also with extended defects as well as hole gases at heterojunctions. For exactly the same epitaxial design, it is shown using a “leaky dielectric” model that depending on the leakage paths, dynamic RON dispersion can vary between insignificant and infinite. An optimum leakage configuration is identified to minimize dispersion requiring a resistivity which increases with depth in the buffer stack. It is demonstrated that leakage through the undoped GaN channel is required over the entire gate to drain gap, and not just under the contacts, in order to fully suppress dispersion.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2017.2706090","UK EPSRC PowerGaN(grant numbers:EP/K0114471/1); ENIAC under Project E2COGaN; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7938782","Current collapse;dynamic RON;power electronics","Conductivity;Substrates;Epitaxial growth;Gallium nitride;Semiconductor process modeling;Dielectrics;Dispersion","","189","1","36","CCBY","6 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, inaccurate, incomplete, and imprecise information collected by vehicles as well as movable/immovable obstacles have interrupting effects on VANET.

The control output admittance of the converter is decomposed into a passive filter output admittance in series with an active admittance, which is dependent on the current controller and the time delay. The frequency-domain passivity theory is then applied to the active admittance for system stability analysis. It reveals that the stability region of the single-loop grid current control is not only dependent on the time delay, but affected also by the resonance frequency of the converter-side filter inductor and filter capacitor. Further on, the damping injection based on the discrete derivative controller is proposed to enhance the passivity of individual converters and thereby stabilizing the paralleled converters.

Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing. More importantly, we identify and describe the potential key enablers for the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework, the associated key challenges and some interesting future research directions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2682640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7882669","Big data;data analytics;internet of things (IoT);cloud computing;edge computing;fog computing","Cloud computing;Wireless communication;Data analysis;Big Data;Wireless sensor networks;Edge computing;Distributed databases","","184","1","46","OAPA","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, chronic stress could implicate several psychophysiological disorders. For example, stress increases the likelihood of depression, stroke, heart attack, and cardiac arrest. The latest neuroscience reveals that the human brain is the primary target of mental stress, because the perception of the human brain determines a situation that is threatening and stressful. In this context, an objective measure for identifying the levels of stress while considering the human brain could considerably improve the associated harmful effects. Therefore, in this paper, a machine learning (ML) framework involving electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis of stressed participants is proposed. In the experimental setting, stress was induced by adopting a well-known experimental paradigm based on the montreal imaging stress task. The induction of stress was validated by the task performance and subjective feedback. The proposed ML framework involved EEG feature extraction, feature selection (receiver operating characteristic curve, t-test and the Bhattacharya distance), classification (logistic regression, support vector machine and naïve Bayes classifiers) and tenfold cross validation. The results showed that the proposed framework produced 94.6% accuracy for two-level identification of stress and 83.4% accuracy for multiple level identification. In conclusion, the proposed EEG-based ML framework has the potential to quantify stress objectively into multiple levels. The proposed method could help in developing a computer-aided diagnostic tool for stress detection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723622","Ministry of Education Malaysia through the Higher Institution Centre of Excellence(grant numbers:0153CA-005); Yayasan Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS Fundamental Research(grant numbers:0153AA-E54); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968419","Absolute power;amplitude asymmetry;coherence;EEG;machine learning;mental stress levels;phase lag;relative power;support vector machine;t-test","Stress;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Cardiac arrest;Object recognition;Psychology","","183","","56","OAPA","5 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The beampattern of the array is shown to be stochastic but thumbtack-like, and its stochastic characteristics, such as the mean, variance, and asymptotic distribution are derived analytically. Based on these two features, we propose two kinds of algorithms for signal processing. One is matched filtering, due to the beampattern's good characteristics. The other is compressive sensing, because the new approach can be regarded as a sparse and random sampling of target information in the spatial-frequency domain. Fundamental limits, such as the Cramér-Rao bound and the observing matrix's mutual coherence, are provided as performance guarantees of the new array structure.

To increase the accuracy of models, nonlinearities in the junction capacitances of the devices are incorporated by fitting their nonlinear curves to a simple equation. The numerical solutions of the analytical models provide more accurate prediction than an LTspice simulation with a threefold reduction in the simulation time.

Recent photon-efficient computational imaging methods are remarkably effective with only 1.0 to 3.0 detected photons per pixel, but they are not demonstrated at signal-to-background ratio (SBR) below 1.0 because their imaging accuracies degrade significantly in the presence of high background noise. We introduce a new approach to depth and reflectivity estimation that emphasizes the unmixing of contributions from signal and noise sources. At each pixel in an image, short-duration range gates are adaptively determined and applied to remove detections likely to be due to noise. For pixels with too few detections to perform this censoring accurately, data are combined from neighboring pixels to improve depth estimates, where the neighborhood formation is also adaptive to scene content. Algorithm performance is demonstrated on experimental data at varying levels of noise. Results show improved performance of both reflectivity and depth estimates over state-of-the-art methods, especially at low SBR. In particular, accurate imaging is demonstrated with SBR as low as 0.04. This validation of a photon-efficient, noise-tolerant method demonstrates the viability of rapid, long-range, and low-power LIDAR imaging.","2333-9403","","10.1109/TCI.2017.2706028","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1422034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932527","3-D imaging;computational imaging;depth cameras;LIDAR;low-light imaging;photon counting;Poisson processes;ranging;time-of-flight imaging","Photonics;Imaging;Detectors;Laser radar;Lighting;Maximum likelihood estimation","","180","","34","OAPA","23 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for lower voltage applications the neutral-point-clamped inverter suffers from relatively large semiconductor conduction losses because the output current always flows through two switching devices. In contrast, the T-type multilevel inverter has less conduction losses because only a single outer loop switching device is required to connect the converter output to the upper and lower dc buses, albeit at the expense of increased switching losses since these outer switches must now block the full dc link voltage. Silicon carbide (SiC) mosfet devices potentially offer substantial advantage in this context with their lower switching losses, but the benefit of replacing all switching devices in a T-type inverter with SiC mosfets is not so clear-cut. This paper now explores this issue by presenting a detailed comparison of the use of Si and SiC devices for a three-level T-type inverter operating in grid-tie applications. The study uses datasheet values, switching loss measurements, and calibrated heat sink thermal measurements to precisely compare semiconductor losses for these two alternatives for a T-type inverter operating at or near unity power factor. The results show that replacing only the dc bus connection switches with SiC devices significantly reduces the semiconductor losses, allowing either the converter power level or the switching frequency to be significantly increased for the same device losses. Hence, the use of SiC mosfets for T-type inverters can be seen to be an attractive and potentially cost-effective alternative, since only two switching devices per phase leg need to be upgraded.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2016.2582344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7508887","Photovoltaic (PV);semiconductor losses;Si IGBT;SiC mosfet;T-type inverter","Inverters;Switches;Switching loss;Silicon carbide;Switching frequency;Topology;Loss measurement","","175","","33","OAPA","11 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After preprocessing of the input GPR images, a novel thresholding method is applied to separate the regions of interest from background. A novel column-connection clustering (C3) algorithm is then applied to separate the regions of interest from each other. Subsequently, a machine learnt model is applied to identify hyperbolic signatures from outputs of the C3 algorithm, and a hyperbola is fitted to each such signature with an orthogonal-distance hyperbola fitting algorithm. The novel clustering algorithm C3 is a central component of the proposed system, which enables the identification of hyperbolic signatures and hyperbola fitting. Only two features are used in the machine learning algorithm, which is easy to train using a small set of training data. An orthogonal-distance hyperbola fitting algorithm for “south-opening” hyperbolae is introduced in this work, which is more robust and accurate than algebraic hyperbola fitting algorithms. The proposed method can successfully recognize and fit hyperbolic signatures with intersections with others, hyperbolic signatures with distortions, and incomplete hyperbolic signatures with one leg fully or largely missed. As an additional novel contribution, formulas to compute an initial “south-opening” hyperbola directly from a set of given points are derived, which make the system more efficient. The parameters obtained by fitting hyperbolae to hyperbolic signatures are very important features; they can be used to estimate the location and size of the related target objects and the average propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave in the medium. The effectiveness of the proposed system is tested on both synthetic and real GPR data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2592679","EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/F06585X/1,EP/K021699/1); EU(grant numbers:280712); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572995","Buried asset detection;column-connection clustering (C3) algorithm;ground-penetrating radar (GPR);hyperbola recognition;machine learning;orthogonal-distance fitting","Ground penetrating radar;Machine learning algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Image edge detection;Transforms;Partitioning algorithms;Real-time systems","","171","","35","OAPA","21 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the underlying semiconductor technologies are getting less and less reliable, the probability that some components of computing devices fail also increases, preventing designers from realizing the full potential benefits of on-chip exascale integration derived from near atomic scale feature dimensions. As the quest for performance confronts permanent and transient faults, device variation, and thermal issues, major breakthroughs in computing efficiency are expected to benefit from unconventional and new models of computation, such as brain-inspired computing. The challenge is then to find not only high-performance and energy-efficient, but also fault-tolerant computing solutions. Neural computing principles remain elusive, yet as source of a promising fault-tolerant computing paradigm. In the quest to fault tolerance can be translated into scalable and reliable computing systems, hardware design itself and/or to use circuits even with faults has further motivated research on neural networks, which are potentially capable of absorbing some degrees of vulnerability based on their natural properties. This paper presents a survey on fault tolerance in neural networks manly focusing on well-established passive techniques to exploit and improve, by design, such potential but limited intrinsic property in neural models, particularly for feedforward neural networks. First, fundamental concepts and background on fault tolerance are introduced. Then, we review fault types, models, and measures used to evaluate performance and provide a taxonomy of the main techniques to enhance the intrinsic properties of some neural models, based on the principles and mechanisms that they exploit to achieve fault tolerance passively. For completeness, we briefly review some representative works on active fault tolerance in neural networks.

Among others, voltage violation is of prime importance. Our review of the literature focused on PV penetration limits due to voltage violations in low-voltage (LV) networks. The review revealed that voltage violations can occur at a penetration level as low as 2.5% when a large distributed generator (DG) is installed at a single point. Alternatively, a LV network can host a large number of photovoltaic distributed generators (PVDGs), with a penetration level up to 110% if evenly distributed over shorter lengths. However, an LV network has no rules of thumb for safe penetration limits. Penetration-level calculations have been found that they used numerous approaches, which we have analyzed and discussed to adopt a more rational and unified approach. Our literature review revealed that, in LVs, a very high penetration level can be achieved as compared with medium-voltage (MV) networks. However, MV voltage-level control problems impose a limit for PV hosting in LV networks. There is a need to evolve strategies for robust voltage control at the MV level and to develop certain rules of thumb for PV penetration limits in LV networks independent of the MV level, to increase the PV hosting capacity.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2747086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8022856","LV distribution network;PV penetration limits;PV impacts on LV voltage;voltage violations","Voltage control;Low voltage;Renewable energy sources;Photovoltaic systems;Generators;Load flow","","171","","49","OAPA","30 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the aim of maximizing the sum rate of SCUs while taking the fairness issue into consideration, a joint problem of spectrum allocation and power control is formulated. In particular, the spectrum allocation problem is modeled as a many-to-one matching game with peer effects. We propose a novel algorithm where the SBSs and resource blocks interact to decide their desired allocation. The proposed algorithm is proved to converge to a two-sided exchange-stable matching. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of `exploration' into the matching game for further improving the SCUs' sum rate. The power control of each SBS is formulated as a non-convex problem, where the sequential convex programming is adopted to iteratively update the power allocation result by solving the approximate convex problem. The obtained solution is proved to satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. We unveil that: 1) the proposed algorithm closely approaches the optimal solution within a limited number of iterations; 2) the `exploration' action is capable of further enhancing the performance of the matching algorithm; and 3) the developed NOMA-enhanced HetNets achieve a higher SCUs' sum rate compared with the conventional OMA-based HetNets.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2017.2716921","ESRC U.K.(grant numbers:ES/M008509/1); joint programme between the Queen Mary University of London and the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications; U.S. NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1702850,CNS-1646607,ECCS-1547201,CCF-1456921,CMMI-1434789,CNS-1443917,ECCS-1405121); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954630","Fairness;heterogeneous networks (HetNets);matching game;non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA);sequential convex programming;sum rate","NOMA;Resource management;Interference;Power control;Silicon carbide;Wireless communication;Protocols","","166","","34","OAPA","21 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our objective is to maximize the system sum rate by optimizing subchannel and power allocation. We propose a novel solution that jointly assigns subchannels to D2D groups and allocates power to receivers in each D2D group. For the subchannel assignment, a novel algorithm based on the many-to-one two-sided matching theory is proposed for obtaining a suboptimal solution. Since the power allocation problem is nonconvex, sequential convex programming is adopted to transform the original power allocation problem to a convex one. The power allocation vector is obtained by iteratively tightening the lower bound of the original power allocation problem until convergence. Numerical results illustrate that: 1) the proposed joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm are an effective approach for obtaining near-optimal performance with acceptable complexity and 2) the NOMA enhanced D2D communication scheme is capable of achieving promising gains in terms of network sum rate and the number of accessed users, compared to a traditional OMA-based D2D communication scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2741941","ESRC U.K.(grant numbers:ES/M008509/1); joint programme between Queen Mary University of London and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8014491","Device-to-device (D2D);matching theory;non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA);power allocation;subchannel assignment;5G","Device-to-device communication;Resource management;NOMA;Receivers;Interference;Cellular networks;Transmitters","","166","","34","OAPA","22 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

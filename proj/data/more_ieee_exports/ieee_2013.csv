"Transparent computing: Spatio-temporal extension on von Neumann architecture for cloud services","Y. Zhang; Y. Zhou","Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China; Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China",Tsinghua Science and Technology,"7 Feb 2013","2013","18","1","10","21","The rapid advancements in hardware, software, and computer networks have facilitated the shift of the computing paradigm from mainframe to cloud computing, in which users can get their desired services anytime, anywhere, and by any means. However, cloud computing also presents many challenges, one of which is the difficulty in allowing users to freely obtain desired services, such as heterogeneous OSes and applications, via different light-weight devices. We have proposed a new paradigm by spatio-temporally extending the von Neumann architecture, called transparent computing, to centrally store and manage the commodity programs including OS codes, while streaming them to be run in non-state clients. This leads to a service-centric computing environment, in which users can select the desired services on demand, without concern for these services' administration, such as their installation, maintenance, management, and upgrade. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept, namely Meta OS, to support such program streaming through a distributed 4VP+ platform. Based on this platform, a pilot system has been implemented, which supports Windows and Linux environments. We verify the effectiveness of the platform through both real deployments and testbed experiments. The evaluation results suggest that the 4VP+ platform is a feasible and promising solution for the future computing infrastructure for cloud services.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6449403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449403","transparent computing;extended von Neumann architecture;cloud computing;cloud services;Meta OS","Transparent computing;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Central Processing Unit;Maintenance engineering","","41","","","","7 Feb 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In the network, FOG temperature and its gradient are set as input and the FOG bias drift is set as the expected output. A 2-5-1 network trained with IUKF algorithm is established. The IUKF algorithm is developed on the basis of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The weight and bias vectors of the hidden layer are set as the state of the UKF and its process and measurement equations are deduced according to the network architecture. To solve the unavoidable estimation deviation of the mean and covariance of the states in the UKF algorithm, iterative computation is introduced into the UKF after the measurement update. While the measurement noise R is extended into the state vectors before iteration in order to meet the statistic orthogonality of estimate and measurement noise. The IUKF algorithm can provide the optimized estimation for the neural network because of its state expansion and iteration. Temperature rise (-20-20°C) and drop (70-20°C) tests for FOG are carried out in an attemperator.

Most feature selection algorithms have been proposed based on specific objective functions which are usually intuitively reasonable but can sometimes be far from the more basic objectives of the feature selection. This paper describes how to select features such that the basic objectives, e.g., classification or clustering accuracies, can be optimized in a more direct way. The analysis requires that the contribution of each feature to the evaluation metrics can be quantitatively described by some score function. Motivated by the conditional independence structure in probabilistic distributions, the analysis uses a leave-one-out feature selection algorithm which provides an approximate solution. The leave-one-out algorithm improves the conventional greedy backward elimination algorithm by preserving more interactions among features in the selection process, so that the various feature selection objectives can be optimized in a unified way. Experiments on six real-world datasets with different feature evaluation metrics have shown that this algorithm outperforms popular feature selection algorithms in most situations.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6678908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6678908","leave-one-out;feature selection objectives;evaluation metrics","Measurement;Accuracy;Laplace equations;Markov processes;Clustering algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Linear programming","","10","","","","6 Dec 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Neither providers nor users have the right combination of visibility/access/expertise to perform proper tuning and provisioning. This paper presents a performance prediction model for query execution time estimates based on the query complexity for various data sizes. The user query execution time is a combination of five basic operator complexities: O(1), O(log(n)), O(n), O(n log(n)), and O(n2). Moreover, tests indicate that not all queries are equally important for performance prediction. As such, this paper illustrates a performance-sensitive query locating process on three benchmarks: RUBiS, RUBBoS, and TPC-W. A key observation is that performance-sensitive queries are only a small proportion (20%) of the application query set. Evaluation of the performance model on the TPC-W benchmark shows that the query complexity in a real life scenario has an average prediction error rate of less than 10% which demonstrates the effectiveness of this predictive model.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6678907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6678907","query performance;data size;query complexity;performance-sensitive query","Time complexity;Indexes;Benchmark testing;Monitoring;Semantics","","6","","","","6 Dec 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In target tracking, the blind zone can cause target tracking breakage easily. In order to solve this problem, a parallel particle filter (PF) algorithm based on multi-hypothesis motion models (MHMMs) is proposed. The algorithm produces multiple possible target motion models according to the DBZ constraint. Particles are updated with the constraint in each motion model. Once the first measurement from the target which reappears from DBZ falls into the particle cloud formed by any model, the measurement-track association succeeds and track breakage is avoided. The simulation results show that on the condition of different DBZ ranges, a high association ratio can be got for targets with different maneuverability levels, which accordingly improves the tracking quality.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6756008","Doppler blind zone (DBZ);track breakage;particle filter (PF);multi-hypothesis motion model (MHMM);measurement-track association","Target tracking;Radar tracking;Doppler radar;Atmospheric modeling;Doppler effect;Detection algorithms","","5","","","","5 Mar 2014","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The method is based on localization of the inversion, while subsequently the interaction between local domains is estimated. A global field update is calculated which honours the non-linear relationship between the subsurface properties and the measured seismic data. By using this non-linearity, the spectral gap between the a priori background model and the seismic bandwidth will be closed and spatially broad-band properties can be estimated from a band-limited seismic signal.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggt021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8144151","Image processing;Numerical solutions;Inverse theory","","","3","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This study analyzes the exploitation of data locality in the BFS and its impact on the energy efficiency with the Codelet fine-grain dataflow-inspired execution model. The Codelet Model more efficiently exploits data locality than the OpenMP-like execution models which traditionally focus on coarse-grain parallelism inside loops. A BFS algorithm is then given to exploit the locality between two loop iterations that belong to two different loops (inter-loop locality). This kind of locality can be exploited by the Codelet Model but not by traditional coarse-grain execution models like OpenMP. Tests were performed on fsim which is a simulation platform developed by Intel for the Ubiquitous High Performance Computing (UHPC) project to design future exa-scale architectures. The results show that this BFS algorithm saves up to 7% of the dynamic energy for memory accesses compared to a BFS implementation based on OpenMP loop scheduling.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6678909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6678909","breadth first search;locality;fine grain;execution model","Computer architecture;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Computational modeling;Abstracts;Data models","","2","","","","6 Dec 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The oxygen concentrations used were normoxia (air), hypoxia (94.5% N2, 5% CO2, 0.5% O2) and anoxia (95% N2, 5% CO2). Cells were exposed to X-rays and to C-, N- or O-ions with linear energy transfer (LET) values ranging from 100–160 keV/µm. The oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values have been calculated from the measured clonogenic survival curves. For both cell lines, the X-ray OER depended on the survival level. For particle irradiation, OER was not dependent on the survival level but decreased with increasing LET. The RBE of CHO cells under oxic conditions reached a plateau for LET values above 100 keV/µm, while it was still increasing under anoxia. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that our chamber could be used to measure radiosensitivity under intermediate hypoxia.

Mutant frequency increased significantly following irradiation by γ-rays, but not by 320-MeV 12C6+. Mutation spectra showed that both radiations increased the frequency of frameshifts and other mutations, including deletions and insertions, but only γ-rays increased the frequency of total base substitutions. These results suggest that the type of DNA lesions which cause base substitutions were less often induced by 320-MeV 12C6+ than by γ-rays in Arabidopsis seedlings. Furthermore, γ-rays never increased the frequencies of G:C to T:A or A:T to C:G transversions, which are caused by oxidized guanine; 320-MeV 12C6+, however, produced a slight increase in both transversions. Instead, γ-rays produced a significant increase in the frequency of G:C to A:T transitions.

The deformation is non-linear in time over the observed interval. The observed deformation can be explained by a combination of three processes, including: (i) secular plate spreading between the North American and Eurasian plates at a rate of 18.2 mm yr−1, (ii) viscoelastic relaxation following the Krafla Fires rifting episode between 1975 and 1984 and (iii) inflation/deflation of shallow magma chambers beneath the Theistareykir and Krafla central volcanoes.

The calibration parameters include the locking depth of the plate boundary and the rheological properties of the lower crust and mantle.

Therapeutic options are limited, even though various treatments have been investigated, particularly in the field of regenerative therapy. In order to identify readily available treatment methods, we included several current pharmaceutical drugs, for which the clinical trials have already been completed, in tests on mice that had undergone severe mucosal damage by radiation. The drugs were injected into mice 24 h after exposure to 15.7 Gy X-rays. The effects of the drugs on the damaged mucosa of the small intestine were evaluated using early regeneration indices [the expression of c-myb mRNA, and proliferation of epithelial cells in the form of microcolonies (MCs) by Days 4 and 5 post-irradiation] and the survival rate of the mice. Enhancement of mucosal regeneration at Day 4 (c-myb: P < 0.01, MC: P < 0.05) and improvement of the survival rate (P < 0.05) were observed when a clinical dose of gonadotropin, a stimulator of androgen, was injected. Similarly, a clinical dose of thiamazole (which prevents secretion of thyroid hormone) stimulated mucosal growth by Day 5 (c-myb: P < 0.01, MC: P < 0.05) and also improved the survival rate (P < 0.05). The nonclinical drugs histamine and high-dose octreotide (a growth hormone antagonist) also gave significant survival-enhancing benefits (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). These results can be used to construct therapeutic programs and applied in various experimental studies to control the regeneration of damaged mucosa.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8162587","radiation accident;thyroid hormone;histamine;glucagon;anabolic steroid","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In-beam positron emission tomography (ibPET), which can provide an image of the β+ activity induced in the patient during irradiation, which in turn is correlated to the range of the ion beam, is one of the modalities for achieving this goal. Application to hadron therapy requires that the scanner geometry be modified from that which is used in nuclear medicine. In particular, PET detectors that allow a sub-nanosecond time-of-flight (TOF) registration of the collinear photons have been proposed. Inclusion of the TOF information in PET data leads to more effective PET sensitivity. Considering the challenges inherent in the ibPET technique, namely limited β+ activity and the effect of biological washout due to blood flow, TOF-PET technologies are very attractive. In this context, the TERA Foundation is investigating the use of resistive plate chambers (RPC) for an ibPET application because of their excellent timing properties and low cost. In this paper we present a novel compact multi-gap RPC (MRPC) module design and construction method, which considering the large number of modules that would be needed to practically implement a high-sensitivity RPC-PET scanner, could be advantageous. Moreover, we give an overview of the efficiency and timing measurements that have been obtained in the laboratory using such single-gap and multi-gap RPC modules.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8199197","in-beam PET;resistive plate chambers;on-line dosimetry;hadron therapy;quality assurance","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These can be weight loss, tumour shrinkage, and organ motion or filling changes. For advanced and adaptive radiotherapy (ART) information about anatomical changes must be extracted from repeated images in order to be able to evaluate and manage these changes. Deformable image registration (DIR) is a tool that can be used to efficiently gather information about anatomical changes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of two DIR methods for automatic organ at risk (OAR) contour propagation. Datasets from ten gynaecological patients having repeated computed tomography (CT) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were collected. Contours were delineated on the planning CT and on every repeated scan by an expert clinician. DIR using our in-house developed featurelet-based method and the iPlan® BrainLab treatment planning system software was performed with the planning CT as reference and a selection of repeated scans as the target dataset. The planning CT contours were deformed using the resulting deformation fields and compared to the manually defined contours. Dice's similarity coefficients (DSCs) were calculated for each fractional patient scan structure, comparing the volume overlap using DIR with that using rigid registration only. No significant improvement in volume overlap was found after DIR as compared with rigid registration, independent of which image modality or DIR method was used. DIR needs to be further improved in order to facilitate contour propagation in the pelvic region in ART approaches.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8199199","radiotherapy;registration;deformable;organ;adaptive radiotherapy","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The median of a population of these disequilibrium angles, Θcpp, varies systematically within a single layered intrusion, remaining constant over large stretches of stratigraphy with significant increases and decreases associated with the addition or reduction respectively of the number of phases on the liquidus of the bulk magma. The stepwise changes in Θcpp are present in the Upper Zone of the Bushveld Complex, the Megacyclic Unit I of the Sept Iles Intrusion, and the Layered Series of the Skaergaard intrusion. The plagioclase-bearing cumulates of Rum have a bimodal distribution of Θcpp, dependent on whether the cumulus assemblage includes clinopyroxene. The presence of the stepwise changes is independent of the order of arrival of cumulus phases and of the composition of either the cumulus phases or the inferred composition of the interstitial liquid. The only parameter that behaves in an exactly analogous manner to Θcpp is the rate of change in enthalpy with temperature (ΔH/ΔT) during crystallization. Both ΔH/ΔT and Θcpp increase with the addition of a liquidus phase, and decrease with the removal of a liquidus phase. The replacement of one phase by another has little effect on ΔH/ΔT and no discernible effect on Θcpp. An increase of ΔH/ΔT results in an increase in the fraction of the total enthalpy budget that is the latent heat of crystallization (the fractional latent heat). It also increases the mass crystallized in each incremental temperature drop (the crystal productivity). These increases of both fractional latent heat and crystal productivity are likely to cause an increase in the time taken to form three-grain junctions in the mush via thermal buffering of a thickened mushy layer. We suggest these are the underlying causes of stepwise increases in Θcpp. Stepwise changes in the geometry of three-grain junctions in fully solidified gabbros thus provide a clear microstructural marker for the progress of fractionation down the liquid line of descent in layered intrusions.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egt041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8185233","crystallization;gabbro;layered igneous rock;magma chamber;microstructure;dihedral angle","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Thus, due to the different frequency distribution characteristics between the noise and signals, after EG combination, the energy of signals has almost no loss and the noise energy is greatly reduced.

EMRBs provide a novel means of extracting information about the MBH; an EMRB from the Galactic MBH could be highly informative regarding the MBH's mass and spin if the orbital periapsis is small enough. However, to be a useful astronomical tool, EMRBs must be both informative and sufficiently common to be detectable with a space-based interferometer. We construct a simple model to predict the event rate for Galactic EMRBs. We estimate that there could be on average ∼2 bursts in a two-year mission lifetime for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. Stellar mass black holes dominate the event rate. Creating a sample of 100 mission realizations, we calculate what we could learn about the MBH. On average, we expect to be able to determine the MBH mass to ∼1 per cent and the spin to ∼0.1 using EMRBs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stt1543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8185561","black hole physics;gravitational waves;celestial mechanics;Galaxy: centre","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Instead of using one planning image only, multiple scans are taken on different days. The target and organs at risk (OARs) are delineated on each images. The proposed PTV is generated from a union of those target contours on the planning images, excluding voxels of the OARs, and is denoted the PTV ‘GP–OAR’ (global prostate–organs at risk). The study is performed using ‘plan of the day’ adaptive workflow, which selects a daily plan from a library of plans based on a similarity comparison between the daily scan and planning images. The daily plans optimized for GP–OAR volumes are compared with those optimized for PTVs generated from a single prostate contour (PTV SP). Four CT serials of prostate cancer patient datasets are included in the test, and in total 28 fractions are simulated. The results show that the daily chosen GP–OAR plans provide excellent target coverage, with V95 values of the prostate mostly > 95%. In addition, dose delivered to the OARs as calculated from applying daily chosen GP–OAR plans is slightly increased but comparable to that calculated from applying daily SP plans. In general, the PTV GP–OARs are able to cover possible target variations while keeping dose delivered to the OARs at a similar level to that of the PTV SPs.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8199208","particle therapy;treatment planning;organ motion;prostate;planning target volume","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Among them, 99 patients who underwent at least one computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis during their follow-up at more than 6 months were included in this analysis. The relationship between the incidence of PIF and several patient- and treatment-related factors was analyzed. The median follow-up period was 21 months. Of the 126 patients, 33 (with a total of 50 lesions) were diagnosed with PIF. The 2-year cumulative incidence was 32%. Univariate analysis showed that age ≥70 years (P= 0.0010), postmenopausal state (P = 0.0013), and lower CT density of bone and bone marrow (P= 0.020) significantly related to PIF. In a multivariate analysis, of the 59 patients whose CT densities were evaluable, lower CT density was the only significant factor associated with PIF (P = 0.0026). In conclusion, postradiation PIFs were detected in a considerable number of patients after definitive RT for cervical cancer. Predisposing factors were older age, postmenopausal state, and decreased density of bone and bone marrow on CT.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8162572","adverse event;CT density;pelvic insufficiency fracture;radiotherapy;uterine cervical cancer","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This analysis included 174 patients with HCC who underwent surgery. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed up to 30 days before surgery. After resection, the size of the tumor on gross pathologic examination was recorded. The maximal measurement in one dimension on axial imaging and pathologic examination was extracted for statistical analysis. The clinical and pathologic sizes were compared using a percent size difference (%Δsize) as an end point. A regression analysis was applied to study the association between pathologic and radiographic size. The median radiographic and pathologic size were 70.58 ± 38.9 mm and 68.59 ± 40.56 mm, respectively. The radiographic size was larger than or equal to the pathologic size in 110/174 tumors (63.2%), and smaller in 64/174 (36.8%) tumors. Overall, the radiographic and pathologic sizes were positively correlated (r = 0.983, P = 0.000). CT seemed to overestimate the tumor size by 2.16 mm compared to final pathology (P = 0.024). The median %Δsize was 3.3%. Pathologic tumor size was significantly underestimated in patients with a tumor size 3–5 cm (P = 0.011), Grade I HCC (P = 0.023), with clear boundary (P = 0.013). We concluded that CT size and pathologic size were positively correlated, but differences did exist. Utilizing the radiographic tumor when planning radiation would have covered 63.2% of gross tumors. For a radiographic tumor size < 50 mm, utilizing a 3-mm margin around the radiographic tumor would have covered 90% of gross lesions, while a margin of 5 mm would have covered 95%, and a margin of 15 mm would have covered 100%.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150031","hepatocellular carcinoma;CT-pathologic relation;target delineation;radiation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For compressive images, a mixture of the Gaussian distribution is applied to the compressed image field to model the background. A simple threshold test in compressive sampling image is used to declare motion objects. Foreground image retrieval from underdetermined measurement using the total variance optimization algorithm is explored. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is employed to evaluate the image quality recovered from the compressive sampling signals, and receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves are used to quantify the performance of the motion detection algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the low dimensional compressed imaging representation is sufficient to determine spatial motion targets. Compared with the random Gaussian and Toeplitz mask, motion detection algorithms using the random binary phase mask can yield better detection results.

In this paper, we show the impact of a carbon sandwich preparation on the preservation of crystalline sample quality, using characteristic examples of two-dimensional (2D) crystals from gastric H+,K+-ATPase and their analyzed images. Compared with the ordinary single carbon support film preparation, the carbon sandwich preparation dramatically enhanced the resolution of images from flat sheet 2D crystals. As water evaporation is restricted in the carbon-sandwiched specimen, the improvement could be due to the strong protective effect of the retained water against drastic changes in the environment surrounding the specimen, such as dehydration and increased salt concentrations. This protective effect by the carbon sandwich technique helped to maintain the inherent and therefore best crystal conditions for analysis. Together with its strong compensation effect for the image shift due to beam-induced specimen charging, the carbon sandwich technique is a powerful method for preserving crystals of membrane proteins with larger hydrophilic regions, such as H+,K+-ATPase, and thus constitutes an efficient and high-quality method for collecting data for the structural analysis of these types of membrane proteins by electron crystallography.","1477-9986","","10.1093/jmicro/dft038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8164648","cryo-electron microscopy;electron crystallography;H+,K+-ATPase;two-dimensional crystals;membrane proteins","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The key idea is to take a polyhedral approximation of the bulk region consisting of a union of simplices, and to use piecewise polynomial boundary faces as an approximation of the surface. Two finite element spaces are defined, one in the bulk region and one on the surface, by taking the set of all continuous functions which are also piecewise polynomial on each bulk simplex or boundary face. We study this method in the context of a model elliptic problem; in particular, we look at well-posedness of the system using a variational formulation, derive perturbation estimates arising from domain approximation and apply these to find the optimal-order error estimates.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of exposure to a magnetic field at 23 kHz (which is the maximum output power frequency of most IH cooktops) on gene expression in a human-fetus-derived astroglia cell line, SVGp12. The cells were exposed to the magnetic field at 2 mT rms [which is approximately 74 times higher than the reference level in the most recent International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines], for 2, 4 and 6 h, using a previously reported exposure system. Gene expression was evaluated using an Agilent cDNA microarray. We did not detect any significant effects of the magnetic field on the gene expression profile. On the contrary, heat treatment at 43°C for 2 h used as a positive control significantly affected gene expression, including inducing heat shock proteins, which indicated that our protocol for microarray analysis was appropriate. From these results, we conclude that exposure of human-fetus-derived astroglia cells to an intermediate-frequency magnetic field at 23 kHz and 2 mT rms for up to 6 h does not induce detectable alteration of gene expression.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8162578","induction heating (IH) cooktop;intermediate-frequency (IF) magnetic field;cDNA microarray;human-derived cells;International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In our calculations we use the five-constant model by Gol'dberg. It is shown that the interaction of plane waves in isotropic solids is completely described by five coupling coefficients, which have the same order of magnitude. By considering scattering of compressional waves generated by controlled sources at the Earth surface from a non-linear layer at the subsurface, we conclude that non-linear signals from deep formations are unlikely to be measured with the current level of technology. Our analysis of field tests where non-linear signals were measured, suggests that these signals are generated either in the shallow subsurface or in the vicinity of sources. Non-linear wave interaction might be observable in lab tests with focused ultrasonic beams. In this case, the non-linear response is generated in the secondary parametric array formed by linear beams scattered from inclusions. Although the strength of this response is controlled by non-linearity of the surrounding medium rather than by non-linearity of inclusions, its measurement can help to obtain better images of rock samples.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggt209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227220","Numerical approximations and analysis;Body waves;Wave propagation;Acoustic properties","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A total of 52 patients received external beam radiotherapy and high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT). For each of four ICBT applications, a pelvic CT scan was performed and the HR-CTV was delineated. Retrospectively, these patients were divided into two groups: (i) the standard dose group with 6 Gy to point A in each ICBT, and (ii) the adaptive dose group with a modified dose to point A to cover the HR-CTV with the 6-Gy isodose line as much as possible. The HR-CTV D90 was assessed in every session, and analyzed as interfractional changes. In the standard dose group, the interfractional changes of the HR-CTV D90 showed a linear increase from the first to the third of the four ICBT (average 6.1, 6.6, 7.0 and 7.1 Gy, respectively). In contrast, those of the adaptive dose group remained almost constant (average 7.2, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 Gy, respectively). Especially, in the case of a large HR-CTV volume (≥35 cm3) at first ICBT, the total HR-CTV D90 of the adaptive dose group with brachytherapy was significantly higher than that of the standard dose group. There were no significant differences in total D2cc in bladder and rectum between the two groups.

Plank",NA; NA; NA,Journal of Petrology,"18 Jan 2018","2013","54","3","525","537","Dy/Dy* is the measured value of Dy, a representative middle rare earth element (REE), compared with the value interpolated between La and Yb on a REE plot. It is essentially a measure of the ‘concavity’ of a REE pattern. The use of Dy/Dy* as a proxy for REE pattern shape allows us to compare large amounts of REE data, which can be difficult using standard REE patterns. When Dy/Dy* is combined with Dy/Yb (the slope of the middle-to-heavy REE pattern) REE patterns can effectively be classified by shape. We present a new set of high-quality REE (and other trace element) data for young volcanic rocks from six arcs. When plotted on the Dy/Dy*–Dy/Yb diagram they define a broad negative correlation from LREE-depleted (Tonga–Kermadec) to LREE-enriched (Philippines and Indonesia). This trend corresponds to decreasing Dy/Dy*, reflecting REE patterns varying from concave-down to concave-up respectively. When cogenetic suites from single volcanoes are plotted they define clear trends of decreasing Dy/Yb and Dy/Dy* with differentiation, roughly orthogonal to the general depletion–enrichment trend. The trends for single arc volcanoes are interpreted as most probably reflecting an amphibole control, consistent with the concomitant decreases in Ti/Ti* and increasing SiO2. Available distribution coefficients are, however, also permissive of cpx control on arc REE patterns. Estimated compositions of the continental crust fall along these same trends. In contrast, ocean island basalt (OIB) data all fall to high Dy/Yb, suggesting a significant control by garnet. A global consideration of the data suggests that (1) arc magmas are derived from variably depleted asthenospheric (mid-ocean ridge basalt) mantle sources, (2) arc magma (and continental crust) differentiation is controlled by a mineral phase (or phases) that preferentially partitions MREE and (3) OIB genesis appears to always involve garnet control. We propose that Dy/Dy* is potentially a powerful tool for representing the shapes of REE patterns, especially for large datasets. We also note the importance of using cogenetic rock suites to identify petrogenetic processes rather than regional suites.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egs076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8182736","amphibole;differentiation;geochemistry;partition coefficient;REE","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For inverse plan optimization, the commonly employed analytical treatment-planning systems (TPSs) have to meet reasonable compromises in the accuracy of the pencil-beam modelling to ensure good performances in clinically tolerable execution times. In particular, the complex lateral spreading of ion beams in air and in the traversed tissue is typically approximated with ideal Gaussian-shaped distributions, enabling straightforward superimposition of several scattering contributions. This work presents the double Gaussian parametrization of scanned proton and carbon ion beams in water that has been introduced in an upgraded version of the worldwide first commercial ion TPS for clinical use at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center (HIT). First, the Monte Carlo results obtained from a detailed implementation of the HIT beamline have been validated against available experimental data. Then, for generating the TPS lateral parametrization, radial beam broadening has been calculated in a water target placed at a representative position after scattering in the beamline elements and air for 20 initial beam energies for each ion species. The simulated profiles were finally fitted with an idealized double Gaussian distribution that did not perfectly describe the nature of the data, thus requiring a careful choice of the fitting conditions. The obtained parametrization is in clinical use not only at the HIT center, but also at the Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8199201","ion therapy;Monte Carlo;treatment planning;lateral dose distribution","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This method cannot work when specific complex modulations are employed since the assumption of mutual independence cannot be satisfied. The analysis shows that source signals, which are group-wise independent and use multi-dimensional ICA (MICA) instead of ordinary ICA, can be applied in this case. Utilizing the block-diagonal structure of the cumulant matrices, the JADE algorithm is generalized to the multidimensional case to separate the received data into mutually independent groups.

Here, we extend our earlier work to perform a probabilistic assessment of sea level variability within the LIG highstand. Using the terminology for probability employed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports, we find it extremely likely (95 per cent probability) that the palaeo-sea level record allows resolution of at least two intra-LIG sea level peaks and likely (67 per cent probability) that the magnitude of low-to-high swings exceeded 4 m. Moreover, it is likely that there was a period during the LIG in which GSL rose at a 1000-yr average rate exceeding 3 mkyr−1, but unlikely (33 per cent probability) that the rate exceeded 7 mkyr−1 and extremely unlikely (5 per cent probability) that it exceeded 11 mkyr−1.

Field observations suggest that the inclusions were derived from the Hypersthene Gabbro and were entrained in a few laterally restricted magma segments that subsequently coalesced with inclusion-free segments into continuous sheets. Using Stokes’ Law and adaptations thereof, we calculate that the magma within the inclusion-free segments behaved as a Newtonian fluid, with a potential settling velocity of <0·028 m s–1. In contrast, the presence of gabbro inclusions probably modified the magma dynamics to Bingham-like behaviour. We infer that this variation in the magma rheology of separate segments continued after coalescence and internally partitioned the magma sheet, preventing lateral mixing and inclusion transport.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egs064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8182746","anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility;Ardnamurchan;magma rheology;inclusions;magma flow","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It breached sea level in 1927 and since the 1950s has been growing at an average rate of ∼8 cm a week. We present new major and trace element data combined with whole-rock δ18O, Sr and Nd isotope data for 1883, 1993 and 2002 Krakatau eruptive products and the surrounding crust. Bombs erupted from Anak Krakatau during 2002 contain frothy metasedimentary and plutonic xenoliths that show variable degrees of thermal metamorphism, plastic deformation and partial melting. Contact-metamorphic minerals such as cordierite and tridymite in metasedimentary xenoliths are consistent with high-temperature metamorphism and incorporation at mid- to upper-crustal depth. Energy-constrained assimilation and fractional crystallization modelling of whole-rock data suggests that the Anak Krakatau magmas have a genetic relationship with the 1883 eruption products. The geochemical impact of crustal contaminants on whole-rock compositions is apparently small, and we conclude that low levels of assimilation of a quartzo-feldspathic sediment are recorded in Anak Krakatau magmas. Plagioclase phenocrysts from the 2002 eruption exhibit disequilibrium textures and complex compositional zoning, however, and are also isotopically variable with a total range in 87Sr/86Sr of 0·7043–0·7048 as determined by in situ laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. This suggests that although shallow crustal assimilation appears to have had a limited effect on whole-rock chemistry, a complex late-stage differentiation history is recorded within the magma’s cargo of crystals and xenoliths.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egs066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8182748","Anak Krakatau;plagioclase;crustal xenoliths;assimilation and fractional crystallization;isotope micro-analysis","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The aim of this study was to document changes in HQL of chordoma/chondrosarcoma patients treated with proton beam radiotherapy. Treatments commenced in September 2011 at CNAO, and HQL studies were initiated in January 2012 for all patients undergoing treatment. Methods: The validated Italian translation of the EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3.0 was used for HQL evaluation. The HQL assessments were made prior to starting radiation and at completion of treatment. Scoring was as per the EORTC manual. As per standard norms, a difference of >10 points in the mean scores was taken to be clinically meaningful. Results: Between January and September 2012, 17 patients diagnosed with chordoma or chondrosarcoma, with a mean ± SD age of 49.5 ± 16.4 years, had completed treatment. The involved sites were skull base (n = 12) and sacral/paraspinal (n = 5). The prescribed dose was 70–74 GyE at 2 GyE per fraction, 5 days/week. When comparing pre- and post-treatment scores, neither a clinically meaningful nor a statistically significant change was documented. Conclusions: During treatment, HQL is not adversely affected by protons, allowing normal life despite the long course of treatment. This is an ongoing study and more long-term assessment will help evaluate the actual impact of proton therapy on HQL for these slow-responding tumours.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8199205","quality of life;proton beam therapy;chordoma;chondrosarcoma","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For 10 patients with locally advanced head and neck (H&N) cancer and 10 with high-risk prostate cancer (PC) a VMAT plan was generated for PTVinitial that included lymph node regions, delivering 50 Gy (IsoE) for H&N and 50.4 Gy (IsoE) for PC patients. Furthermore, separate boost plans (VMAT, IMPT and IMIT) were created to boost PTVboost up to 70 Gy (IsoE) and 78 Gy (IsoE) for H&N and PC cases, respectively. Doses to brainstem, myelon, larynx and parotid glands were assessed for H&N cases. Additionally, various OARs (e.g. cochlea, middle ear, masticator space) were evaluated that are currently discussed with respect to quality of life after treatment. For PC cases, bladder, rectum and femoral heads were considered as OARs. For both tumour sites target goals were easily met. Looking at OAR sparing, generally VMAT + VMAT was worst. VMAT + IMIT had the potential to spare some structures in very close target vicinity (such as cochlea, middle ear, masticator space ) significantly better than VMAT + IMPT. Mean doses for rectal and bladder wall were on average 4 Gy (IsoE) and 1.5 Gy (IsoE) higher, respectively, compared to photons plus particles scenarios. Similar results were found for parotid glands and larynx. Concerning target coverage, no significant differences were observed between the three treatment concepts. Clear dosimetric benefits were observed for particle beam therapy as boost modality.

A total of 85 non-metastatic advanced SCCHN patients were accrued from January 2003 to December 2007. Of these, 48 and 37 patients received CCRT and CCB, respectively. The patients were randomized to receive either three cycles of carboplatin and 5-fluorouracil plus conventional radiotherapy (CCRT, 66 Gy in 6.5 weeks) or hybrid accelerated radiotherapy (CCB, 70 Gy in 6 weeks). The primary endpoint was determined by locoregional control rate. The secondary endpoints were overall survival and toxicity. With a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 3–102), the 5-year locoregional control rate was 69.6% in the CCRT arm vs 55.0% in the CCB arm (P = 0.184). The 5-year overall survival rate was marginally significantly different (P = 0.05): 76.1% in the CCRT arm vs 63.5% in the CCB arm. Radiotherapy treatment interruptions of more than three days were 60.4% and 40.5% in the CCRT arm and CCB arm, respectively. The median total treatment time was 55.5 days in the CCRT arm and 49 days in the CCB arm. The rate of Grade 3–4 acute mucositis was significantly higher in the CCB arm (67.6% vs 41.7%, P = 0.01), but no high grade hematologic toxicities were found in the CCB arm (27.2% vs 0%).

A new set of sufficient conditions for the stability of open as well as close loop systems are obtained in the sense of Lyapunov-Krasovskii. To reduce the conservatism, the work exploits the idea of splitting the delay interval into multiple equal regions so that less information on the time delay can be imposed to derive the results. The derived criterion not only improves the upper bounds of the time delay but also does not require the derivative of the delay to be known at prior. Easily testable sufficient criteria are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities. It is shown that the derived conditions are very less conservative while comparing the maximum allowable upper bound of delay with the existing results in literature.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6756023","delay dependent stability;time-varying delay;nonlinear perturbations","Delays;Stability criteria;Asymptotic stability;Matrix decomposition;Delay effects;Linear matrix inequalities","","","","","","5 Mar 2014","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Firstly, some definitions about the core distance and reachable distance of line segment are presented, and then the algorithm generates cluster sorting according to the core distance and reachable distance. Secondly, the reachable plots of line segment sets are constructed according to the cluster sorting and reachable distance. Thirdly, a parameterized sequence is extracted according to the reachable plot, and then the final trajectory cluster based on the parameterized sequence is acquired. The parameterized sequence represents the inner cluster structure of trajectory data.

Thus, the complexity of user terminals could be reduced, which results in the reduction of power consumption. The limitation of block diagonalization precoding algorithm in VLC systems is investigated. The corresponding solution by utilizing optical detectors with different fields of view (FOV) is derived, and the impact of FOV to the proposed system is also analyzed.

By screening the statistical data into different resistance ranges, both the distributions of IRESET and VRESET are shown to be compatible with a Weibull model. Contrary to previous reports for NiO-based RRAM, the Weibull slopes of the IRESET and VRESET are demonstrated to be independent of RON. This is an indication that the RESET point, defined in this letter as the point of maximum current, corresponds to the initial phase of CF dissolution. On the other hand, given that the scale factor of the VRESET distribution (VRESET63%) is roughly independent of RON, the scale factor of the IRESET (IRESET63%) is inversely proportional to RON. This is analogous to what was found in NiO-based RRAM and it is consistent with the thermal dissolution model of RESET.

The frequency response of LEDs is mainly limited by its diffusion capacitance and resistance, and the injected carriers in the active region of the device. Through appropriate device design, gallium-doped Zinc oxide film deposited by atomic layer deposition is used as the top contact layer with high lateral resistance to self-confine the current injection. In addition, a smaller bonding pad is used to reduce the RC time constant. Thus, the GaN-based blue LEDs with a 75-μm diameter exhibit a 3-dB modulation bandwidth of 225.4 MHz and a light output power of 1.6 mW at the current of 35 mA.

The optical gain of GeSn alloys with 0-10% Sn concentration was calculated with different n-type doping concentrations and injection levels. It is shown theoretically that adding Sn greatly increases the differential gain owing to the reduction of energy between the direct and indirect conduction bands. For a double-heterostructure laser, the model shows that at a cavity loss of 50 cm-1, the minimum threshold current density drops 60 times from Ge to Ge0.9Sn0.1, and the corresponding optimum n-doping concentration of the active layer drops by almost two orders of magnitude.

Two segments of high-birefringence fiber (HBF) with the lengths of 3 m and 6 m are used in the HB-FLM, and three typical spectral periods or their combinations can be independently achieved by simply adjusting the polarization controllers (PCs) in the HB-FLM.

The study shows that in NLOS, root mean square (RMS) delay spread has significantly 2.41 ns increased for the rush-hour scenario compared to off-hour. The median value of 3-dB coherence bandwidth in off-hour is wider than that in rush-hour (0.87 MHz wider in LOS and 1.97 MHz wider in NLOS). The 3-dB coherence bandwidth is an empirical exponential inverse relationship to RMS.

The microfiber is tapered from a single-mode fiber with two short transition regions. The mode evolution and intermodal couplings are analyzed based on the coupled local-mode theory. Due to the sharp variation of transverse geometry along the fiber length, couplings between copropagating local modes are excited, and the energy of light can be distributed into different modes by the transition regions. The grating couples the incident light to phase-matched backward fundamental and higher-order modes at the individual wavelengths. The coupled higher-order modes can be partially retrieved as a result of the abrupt taper. As a result, several reflection peaks can be observed in the reflection spectrum. The peaks present different responses to surrounding RI and identical temperature sensitivity. Therefore, the temperature cross-sensitivity can be removed by measuring the wavelength separations.

Residential air-conditioning is widely believed to be the prime cause of the rise in peak demand but, in the absence of detailed residential demand research, there is no bottom-up empirical evidence to support this supposition or to estimate its impact. This paper first examines the developments in network peak demand, at a national, network distribution, and local distribution feeder level to show recent trends in peak demand. Secondly, this paper applies analytics to the half-hourly consumption data of a sample of Ausgrid's interval metered customers, combined with local weather data, to develop an algorithm which can recognize air-conditioner use and can identify consumption patterns and peak load. This estimate is then compared to system peaks to determine residential air-conditioning's impact on overall demand. Finally, this paper considers the future impacts of air-conditioning load on peak demand as penetration rates reaches saturation levels and new minimum energy performance standards take effect reducing new units peak impacts.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-013-0032-0","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8986811","Air conditioner;Demand response;Peak load","Australia;Water heating;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Expert systems;Meteorology;Springs;Investment","","26","","14","","7 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Airborne and spaceborne LiDAR is known to provide reliable information on terrain elevation and forest canopy height over closed forests. However, it has rarely been used to characterize savannas, which have a complex structure of trees coexisting with grasses. This letter presents the first validation of spaceborne Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) full-waveform data to retrieve savanna vegetation canopy height that uses field data specifically collected within the GLAS footprints. Two methods were explored in the Kruger National Park, South Africa: one based on the Level 2 Global Land Surface Altimetry Data product and the other using Level 1A Global Altimetry Data (GLA01) with terrain correction. Both methods use Gaussian decomposition of the full waveform. Airborne LiDAR (AL) was also used to quantify terrain variability (slope) and canopy height within the GLAS footprints. The canopy height retrievals were validated with field observations in 23 GLAS footprints and show that the direct method works well over flat areas (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.70, , and n = 8 for GLA01) and moderate slopes (r = 0.68, , and n = 9 for GLA01). Over steep slopes in the footprint, however, the retrievals showed no significant correlation and required a statistical correction method to remove the effect of terrain variability on the waveform extent. This method improved the estimation accuracy of maximum vegetation height with correlations (R2 = 0.93, , and n = 6 using the terrain index (g) generated from AL data and R2 = 0.91,, and n = 6 using the GLAS returned waveform width parameter). The results suggest that GLAS can provide savanna canopy height estimations in complex tree/grass plant communities.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2013.2259793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6555819","Canopy height;Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS);Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat);Kruger National Park;light detection and ranging (LiDAR);savanna;terrain correction","Laser radar;Vegetation mapping;Remote sensing;Vegetation;Satellites;Correlation;Indexes","","25","","23","IEEE","9 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cloud computing offers better stability and lower price than traditional IT facilities. Huge storage capacity is essential for video streaming service. More and more cloud providers appear so there are increasing cloud platforms to choose. A better choice is to use more than one data center, which is called multi-cloud. In this paper a closed-loop approach is proposed for optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) and cost. Modules of monitoring and controlling data centers are required as well as the application feedback such as video streaming services. An algorithm is proposed to help choose cloud providers and data centers in a multi-cloud environment as a video service manager. Performance with different video service workloads are evaluated. Compared with using only one cloud provider, dynamically deploying services in multicloud is better in aspects of both cost and QoS. If cloud service costs are different among data centers, the algorithm will help make choices to lower the cost and keep a high QoS.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6522589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522589","cloud computing;dynamic scheduling;data centers;video streaming;service computing;performanceevaluation;Quality of Service (QoS)","","","24","2","","","3 Jun 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper, we investigate the traffic forecasting for data services in 3G mobile networks. Although the Box-Jenkins model has been proven to be appropriate for voice traffic (since the arrival of calls follows a Poisson distribution), it has been demonstrated that the Internet traffic exhibits statistical self-similarity and has to be modeled using the Fractional AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (FARIMA) process. However, a few studies have concluded that the FARIMA process may fail in modeling the Internet traffic. To this end, we conducted experiments on the modeling of benchmark Internet traffic and found that the FARIMA process fails because of the significant multifractal characteristic inherent in the traffic series. Thereafter, we investigate the traffic series of data services in a 3G mobile network from a province in China. Rich multifractal spectra are found in this series. Based on this observation, an integrated method combining the AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) and FARIMA processes is applied. The obtained experimental results verify the effectiveness of the integrated prediction method.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6574678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574678","time series prediction;self-similar;Fractional AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (FARIMA)","Time series analysis;Fractals;Autoregressive processes;Internet;Mobile communication;Predictive models;Mobile computing;Telecommunication traffic","","24","","","","5 Aug 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Recently, researchers have started to develop educational systems which are intended to support solving ill-defined problems. Most researchers agree that there is no sharp distinction but rather a continuum between well-definedness and ill-definedness. However, positioning a problem within this continuum is not always easy, which may lead to difficulties in choosing an appropriate educational technology approach. We propose a classification of the degree of ill-definedness of educational problems based on the existence of solution strategies, the implementation variability for each solution strategy, and the verifiability of solutions. The classification divides educational problems into five classes: 1) one single solution, 2) one solution strategy with different implementation variants, 3) a known number of typical solution strategies, 4) a great variety of solution strategies beyond the anticipation of a teacher where solution correctness can be verified automatically, and 5) problems whose solution correctness cannot be verified automatically. The benefits of this problem classification are twofold. First, it helps researchers choose or develop an appropriate modeling technique for educational systems. Second, it offers the learning technology community a communication means to talk about sorts of more or less ill-defined educational problems more precisely.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2013.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497037","classification;Ill-defined domains;ill-defined problems;ITS;CSCL;adaptive educational technology","Investment;Programming profession;Artificial intelligence;Educational technology;Problem-solving;Cities and towns","","24","","52","IEEE","11 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the 13.4-μm channel shows a cold bias of ~1 K in warm scenes, which changes with time. This is shown to be consistent with the contamination of SEVIRI by a layer of ice ~1 μm thick building up on the optics, which is believed to have condensed from water outgassed from the spacecraft. This ice modifies the spectral response functions and, hence, the weighting functions of the channels in stronger atmospheric absorption bands, thus introducing an apparent calibration error. Analysis of the radiometer's gain using an onboard black body source and a view of cold space confirms a loss consistent with transmission through a layer of comparable thickness, which also increases the radiometric noise-particularly for channels near the 12-μm libration band of water ice. Intercalibration, such as the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System Correction, offers an empirical method to correct this bias.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2236335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6451246","Calibration;decontamination;Earth-observing system;infrared (IR) image sensors;radiometers;satellites","Ice;Decontamination;Instruments;Contamination;Calibration;Atmospheric modeling;Satellites","","24","","10","IEEE","6 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The influences of pump power, gain fiber length, and cavity length (i.e., repetition rate) on the mode-locking wavelength and output spectrum are investigated. It is found that the tunable range of mode-locking wavelength depends on the length of the Yb-doped fiber, as well as the cavity loss, and is independent of the cavity length. Mode-locking in a longer wavelength regime can be obtained by increasing the gain fiber length, although the length depends on the cavity loss. Moreover, the effects of pump power, central wavelength, Yb-doped fiber length, and cavity length on other output parameters are discussed. The variation range of pump power to keep the mode-locking status is also analyzed.

Pulsed electroluminescence measurement, to avoid heating effects partly, revealed that the output intensity peak occurs at $\sim\! 280\ \hbox{A/cm}^{2}$ current density for the GQW structure, whereas for a conventional structure, it occurs at a much lower current density of $\sim\!\! 150\ \hbox{A/cm}^{2}$. The relative quantum efficiency indicates that the efficiency droop in GQW LEDs was reduced effectively due to the reduction in polarization field in the active layer. In the test GQW structure with inverse indium composition variation direction, electrons escape from the active region, which is in company with rapid saturation of output power and decrease in efficiency observed at high current density.

While mainlobe jamming (MLJ) exists, the mainlobe of adaptive pattern will subject to serious distortion, which results in a failure of detecting and tracking targets by monopulse technique. Therefore, a monopulse angle estimation algorithm based on combining sum-difference beam and auxiliary beam is presented. This algorithm utilizes both high gain difference beams and high gain auxiliary beams for cancelling the mainlobe jammer and multiple sidelobe jammers (SLJs) while keeping an adaptive monopulse ratio. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the serious invalidation of monopulse technique in MLJ and SLJs scenarios is resolved well, which improves the monopulse angle accuracy greatly. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is of simple implementation and low computational complexity.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550949","adaptive beamforming;auxiliary beam;mainlobe jamming;monopulse estimation","Jamming;Azimuth;Estimation;Radar tracking;Array signal processing;Manganese;Arrays","","18","","","","10 Jul 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The electro-quasistatic field model yields a suitable approximation to simulate high-voltage devices such as insulators or surge arresters featuring non-linear resistive field grading materials. These materials are usually applied as thin layers, i.e., they represent only a very small volume part in the overall model. Despite the application of unstructured FEM meshes, commonly most of the DoFs are located in the domain with constant material parameters. The non-linear subdomain is much smaller with respect to the number of DoFs than the part with constant materials. The application of model order reduction techniques, in particular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), is proposed to minimize the DoFs in the linear subdomain of the simulation model. POD captures the dynamic in the linear subdomain. Large reduction factors can be achieved for low dynamic exterior domains, thus considerably reducing the computational costs.

By doing so, they also influence the timing resolution of scintillators by improving the photostatistics. The present contribution will demonstrate that they are actually doing much more. Indeed, photonic crystals, if properly designed, allow the extraction of fast light propagation modes in the crystal with higher efficiency, therefore contributing to increasing the density of photons in the early phase of the light pulse. This is of particular interest to tag events at future high-energy physics colliders, such as CLIC, with a bunch-crossing rate of 2 GHz, as well as for a new generation of time-of-flight positron emission tomographs (TOFPET) aiming at a coincidence timing resolution of 100 ps FWHM. At this level of precision, good control of the light propagation modes is crucial if we consider that in a 2 × 2 × 20-mm3 LSO crystal, the time spread (peak to peak) of extracted photons can be as large as 400 ps considering simple light bouncing only. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the light propagation and extraction modes in a LSO crystal combining the LITRANI light ray tracing and the CAMFR PhC simulation codes. Ongoing measurement results are shown with an attempt to unfold the contribution from the improved photostatistics that result from the total enhanced light output on one side and from the improved contribution of fast propagation mode extraction on the other side. Some results are also shown on a new and more industrial process to produce PhCs by the use of nano-imprint technology.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2013.2260768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6520898","Crystals;photonic crystal;positron emission tomography (PET);scintillation detectors;scintillation yield","Crystals;Timing;Photonics;Photonic crystals;Face;Silicon;Photodetectors","","16","2","12","IEEE","27 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Noise in hologram is very difficult to remove because an interference pattern is recorded on a digital camera during the digital processing. It also occurs in the reconstruction process, which is affected by discrete quantizing levels and optical experiment setup. So, we develop an algorithm that is capable of changing pixel values at different scales with imaginary or real value according to the requirements of each position in the hologram. A new algorithm is proposed to satisfy the above requirements using a mathematical transformation between the smooth filter function and mother wavelet function in a wavelet transform. In this paper, a theoretical model to predict the effect of noise is described and verified by the experimental results. Based on this, the resultant noises in the reconstructed image by Fresnel CGH algorithm are decreased clearly when spatial light modulator (SLM) for 3D object is placed at distance from 260 mm to 900 mm.

It is found that, for TM polarization incidence, obvious optical absorption enhancement is obtained in both 2-D and 3-D cases. The absorption enhancement reaches more than 200% with nanoparticles deposited at the interface of PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:PCBM layer, which is larger than that with nanoparticles inside the active layer.

The absorption enhancement characteristics are also studied at oblique incidence, and the high absorption enhancement as high as 160% can be also obtained when the incident angle is increased to 60 ° in the 3-D model.

Initially, continuous data on temperature profiles are obtained at different altitudes before, during, and after total solar eclipses, using two single channel elevation scanning microwave temperature profilers. Terrestrial consequences of solar eclipses (especially total ones) are quite noticeable and important. Solar eclipses support unique, specific conditions, which gives the opportunity for various meteorological research. The most important indicator of thermodynamic processes occurring during solar eclipses is air temperature at different altitudes in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The ABL temperature depends, in general, on the flux of solar radiation and some features of the ground (albedo, absorptivity, and emissivity) and the air (humidity). Temperature profile measurements are accompanied by solar radiation (with net-radiometer) and total water vapor (with microwave radiometers) measurements. The observation results of this paper will contribute detailed model calculations for clarifying meteorological effects of solar eclipses.

In the approach, an optical frequency comb serves as the carriers of multiple channels, and each comb line is modulated by the upstream radio-frequency (RF) signal via single-sideband modulation. At the central station, the beating between the sideband with upstream signal and its adjacent optical carrier leads to photonic frequency down-conversion without additional optical frequency shifts. Due to the band overlapping or the reduction of guard band between adjacent channels, a high spectral efficiency is achieved for WDM-ROF uplinks. A two-channel experimental uplink is established, where a 15-GHz RF signal carrying quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) data is successfully down-converted to a 2-GHz intermediate frequency (IF) signal. For the 10-Mb/s QPSK data, the measured eye diagrams and the constellation diagrams clearly show the effectiveness of the frequency down-conversion and the influence of the transmission distance.

Based on the joint probability density function of the attenuated backscatter and depolarization ratio observed by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations platform, it is estimated that HOPs exist in approximately 60% of optically thick (τ > 3) ice and mixed-phase cloud layers.

The latter requires some time to build a model but recommends online items quickly, while the former is time-consuming but does not require pre-building time. Considering the shortcomings of the two types of algorithms, we propose a novel Community-based User domain Collaborative Recommendation Algorithm (CUCRA). The idea comes from the fact that recommendations are usually made by users with similar preferences. The first step is to build a user-user social network based on users' preference data. The second step is to find communities with similar user preferences using a community detective algorithm. Finally, items are recommended to users by applying collaborative filtering on communities. Because we recommend items to users in communities instead of to an entire social network, the method has perfect online performance. Applying this method to a collaborative tagging system, experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy of CUCRA is relatively good, and the online time-complexity reduces to O(n).","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6574673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574673","collaborative recommendation;tagging system;community-based;recommendation system","Social network services;Collaboration;Clustering algorithms;Time complexity;Tagging;Recommender systems","","13","","","","5 Aug 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The Dual-Axis Radiography for Hydrodynamic Testing (DARHT) facility at Los Alamos produces flash radiographs of large hydrodynamic experiments. Two linear induction accelerators (LIAs) make the bremsstrahlung radiographic source spots for orthogonal views of each test. The 2-kA, 20-MeV Axis-I LIA creates a single 60-ns radiography pulse. The 1.7-kA, 16.5-MeV Axis-II LIA creates up to four radiography pulses by kicking them out of a longer pulse that has a 1.6- μs flat top. The DARHT LIAs use solenoidal focusing for transport of the beam through the accelerators. The long-pulse Axis-II LIA has 74 accelerating cells, and uses 91 solenoids and 80 pairs of dipoles for focusing, transporting, and steering the beam. The setting of the currents of these 251 magnets is called tuning the accelerator. Tuning is done in two stages. First, the solenoidal focusing magnets are set to values designed to provide a beam with minimal envelope oscillations, and little or no instability growth. Then, steering dipoles are adjusted to minimize the low-frequency motion of the beam centroid and center it at the LIA exit. The design of the focusing tune is computationally intensive. Focusing tune design methods, simulations, and validation are the main topics of this article.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2013.2256933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553088","Beam dynamics;beam focusing;beam transport;linear induction accelerators (LIAs)","Particle beams;Focusing;Oscillators;Radiography;Solenoids;Tuning;Acceleration","","13","","26","IEEE","3 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

INS propagates position, velocity and attitude by integration of sensed accelerations, so initial alignment is needed before INS can work properly. However, traditional ground-based initial alignment methods cannot work well on the lunar surface because of its low rotation rate (0.55°/h). For solving this problem, a new autonomous INS initial alignment method assisted by celestial observations is proposed, which uses star observations to help INS estimate its attitude, gyroscopes drifts and accelerometer biases. Simulations show that this new method can not only speed up alignment, but also improve the alignment accuracy. Furthermore, the impact factors such as initial conditions, accuracy of INS sensors, and accuracy of star sensor on alignment accuracy are analyzed in details, which provide guidance for the engineering applications of this method.

With increasing the frequency of the wavelength sweep, the span of the wavelength sweep is reduced and the nonlinearity is pronounced. We experimentally characterize the nonlinearity, and by using a fiber Fabry-Pérot interferometer as a wavelength reference, we compensate it to enhance the accuracy of the interrogation for large strain-amplitude vibration. The proposed sensor achieves vibration measurement with a strain resolution of 0.3 nε/√{Hz} , measurement time of 10 μs, and maximum measurable value of 34 με at the wavelength-sweep frequency of 100 kHz under the present condition. The measurement time is limited by the capability of the laser diode driver, and the maximum measurable strain would be easily enhanced by increasing the wavelength-modulation current amplitude.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2276971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6576191","Fiber Bragg grating;optical fiber sensor;strain sensor;Fabry–Pérot interferometer","Modulation;Fiber gratings;Optical sensors;Optical interferometry;Wavelength measurement;Strain","","12","","13","IEEE","7 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this conjecture has never been proved by systematic numerical experiments. Our numerical results in this communication demonstrate that, the internal resonant modes' amplitudes are indeed dictated by the numerical errors. Additionally, it is shown that in a few cases, the internal resonant modes can be made “invisible” by significantly suppressing the numerical errors.

The PPC is made of two constituents, i.e., the plasma and the dielectric material like quartz. The effective plasma frequency in a PPC is obtained based on the calculated photonic band structure (PBS). It is found that fp, eff can be controlled by the externally applied static magnetic field, namely, fp, eff decreases significantly as the static magnetic field increases. This suggests that the plasma layer in a PPC shows a dielectric-like behavior when the magnetic field is applied. In addition, in the presence of static magnetic field, fp, eff will be increased as a function of electron density and thickness of the plasma layer. In the angular dependence of effective plasma frequency, we find that fp, eff is a decreasing function of angle of incidence in the absence of the static magnetic field. However, it becomes an increasing function of angle of incidence when the static magnetic field is applied.

Furthermore, each grating is assumed to comprise two slits with different widths (w) within each period. The physical origins of the transmission features of the DCG structures are examined using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The RCWA results show that the optical transmission spectra of the considered DCG structures can be tailored over a wide range of wavelengths via a suitable adjustment of the air gap thickness. Moreover, it is shown that, for values of the air gap thickness greater than 100 nm, the transmission spectrum of the DCG structure converges toward that of a single-layered compound grating (SCG). Overall, the results presented in this paper show that the optical transmission properties of a metallic DCG are highly sensitive to the thickness of the air gap between the two grating structures. As such, DCG structures are ideally suited to the realization of proximity sensors and other photonic-based optical devices.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2240290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413160","Diffraction gratings;transmission;sensors","Gratings;Gold;Compounds;Optical sensors;Finite difference methods;Photonics","","12","","33","IEEE","16 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the ICE morphing aircraft, the distributed arrays of hundreds of shape-change devices are employed to stabilize and maneuver the air vehicle. Because the morphing aircraft have the inherent uncertainty and varying dynamics due to the alteration of their configuration, a desired control performance can not be satisfied with a fixed feedback controller. Therefore, a novel control framework including an adaptive flight control law and an adaptive allocation algorithm is proposed. Firstly, a state feedback adaptive control law is designed to guarantee closed-loop stability and state tracking in the presence of uncertain dynamics caused by the wing shape change due to different flight missions. In the control allocation, many distributed arrays are managed in an optimal way to improve the robustness of the system. The scheme is used to an uncertain morphing aircraft model, and the simulation results demonstrate their performance.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6545440","morphing aircraft;flight control law;adaptive control allocation;model uncertainty","Aircraft;Aerospace electronics;Resource management;Aerospace control;Atmospheric modeling;Ice;Shape","","11","","","","21 Jun 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Simulation results show that the thin-GaN LEDs that use ITO as the nonshielded electrode have a more uniform current density distribution on the n-GaN surface and a higher average internal quantum efficiency than conventional metal electrodes. Furthermore, when a current of 200 mA was applied, the thin-GaN LEDs using the proposed electrode had a 40% increase in light-output power and a significant decrease in chip temperature compared to the use of conventional electrodes.

The epicenter has been located at about 130 km east of Sendai City at a depth of about 32 km. A foreshock sequence took place days preceding the mainshock with magnitude 7.3 in March 9. The earthquake has been followed by a devastating tsunami. The location, the geometric parameters, and the focal mechanism are in agreement with the occurrence of the earthquake along the subduction plate boundary. The focal region from seismological analysis indicated that an area of about 500 km × 200 km moved with a maximum displacement of about 24 m near the hypocenter. The Earth Observation Community has made a strong effort to investigate the surface effects by exploiting the satellite data and the geodetic GPS measurements available. The Group on Earth Observation Geohazard Supersites established the Tohoku-Oki Event Supersite. This initiative provided a huge amount of satellite data to the scientific community.

It has been assumed that their manufacturing costs decrease monotonically with the number of additional device layers. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of this assumption based on recently reported challenges associated with the construction of these architectures. It is shown that there is a minimum in die cost after which costs increase with increasing device layers. Also, achievable die sizes using these approaches may not even reach existing production NAND Flash.

It not only helps the system operator to perform security analysis, but also allows more time for operator to take better decision in case of emergency. In addition, predictive state can make the system implement real-time monitoring and achieve good robustness. UKF has been popular in state prediction because of its advantages in handling nonlinear systems. However, the accuracy of prediction degrades notably once a filter uses a much longer future prediction. A confidence interval (CI) is proposed to overcome the problem. The advantages of CI are that it provides the information about states coverage, which is useful for treatment-plan evaluation, and it can be directly used to specify the margin to accommodate prediction errors. Meanwhile, the CI of prediction errors can be used to correct the predictive state, and thereby it improves the prediction accuracy.

One is a small detector consisting of a 20 × 20 array of 0.7 × 0.7 × mm3 (pitch 0.8 mm) LYSO elements. The scintillator array is coupled to an array of silicon photomultipliers. The second detector is a 96 × 72 array of 2×2×15 mm3 (pitch=2.1 mm) LYSO elements coupled to PSPMTs. Separation between the two devices is 180 mm. The detectors are operated in coincidence with each other. Image reconstruction is performed using a limited angle, Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) algorithm. Evaluation of the device included measurements of spatial resolution and detection sensitivity as a function of distance. The transaxial radial and tangential spatial resolution of the system ranged from 0.6 mm to 0.9 mm FWHM; axial resolution ranged from 2.7 mm to 4.6 mm FWHM. Detection sensitivity ranged from 0.05 to 0.28%. Spatial resolution and field-of-view vary as a function of distance from the small detector. The tandem detector insert permitted differentiation of the smallest (1 mm diameter) rods in a mini-hot rod phantom.

Then, the aggregation operator called the IFSs weighted averaging (IFSWA) operator is taken to synthesize decision-makers' (DMs') preferences by the form of the IFS.

Then, simplified models of wind turbines (WTs) and the corresponding equivalent models of wind farms are analyzed. Three kinds of typical WT models, i.e., squirrel cage induction generator, doubly-fed induction generator, and permanent magnet synchronous generator are used. Furthermore, based on the simplified equivalent models, effects of large-scale wind farms on the electromechanical oscillation modes (EOMs) of synchronous systems are discussed.

The dithering process helps to remedy the problem, but it does not help much in terms of storage and transmission of images. To reduce storage needs and lower data transmission, numerous special compression techniques have been proposed in the last several decades. While the well-known compression algorithms, such as gzip, help lower image file sizes, usually, they are not adequate. To improve the compression gain, special compression techniques that take into account structure of image data must be developed.

However, efficient distribution of the limited number of particles in state space remains a critical issue in designing a particle filter. A simplified unscented particle filter (SUPF) is presented, where particles are drawn partly from the transition prior density (TPD) and partly from the Gaussian approximate posterior density (GAPD) obtained by a unscented Kalman filter. The ratio of the number of particles drawn from TPD to the number of particles drawn from GAPD is adaptively determined by the maximum likelihood ratio (MLR). The MLR is defined to measure how well the particles, drawn from the TPD, match the likelihood model. It is shown that the particle set generated by this sampling strategy is more close to the significant region in state space and tends to yield more accurate results. Simulation results demonstrate that the versatility and estimation accuracy of SUPF exceed that of standard particle filter, extended Kalman particle filter and unscented particle filter.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550965","nonlinear filtering;particle filter;unscented Kalman filter;importance density function","Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Kalman filters;Current measurement;Bayes methods;Probability density function;State estimation","","9","","","","10 Jul 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

In this paper, the impact of wind turbine outage probability on system reliability is firstly developed by considering the following factors: running time, operating environment, operating conditions, and wind speed fluctuations.

The accuracy of sensor readings is without a doubt one of the most important measures to evaluate the quality of a sensor and its network. Therefore, this work is motivated to propose approaches that can detect and repair erroneous (i.e., dirty) data caused by inevitable system problems involving various hardware and software components of sensor networks. As information about a single event of interest in a sensor network is usually reflected in multiple measurement points, the inconsistency among multiple sensor measurements serves as an indicator for data quality problem. The focus of this paper is thus to study methods that can effectively detect and identify erroneous data among inconsistent observations based on the inherent structure of various sensor measurement series from a group of sensors. Particularly, we present three models to characterize the inherent data structures among sensor measurement traces and then apply these models individually to guide the error detection of a sensor network. First, we propose a multivariate Gaussian model which explores the correlated data changes of a group of sensors. Second, we present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model which captures the sparse geometric relationship among sensors in a network. The PCA model is motivated by the fact that not all sensor networks have clustered sensor deployment and clear data correlation structure. Further, if the sensor data show non-linear characteristic, a traditional PCA model can not capture the data attributes properly. Therefore, we propose a third model which utilizes kernel functions to map the original data into a high dimensional feature space and then apply PCA model on the mapped linearized data. All these three models serve the purpose of capturing the underlying phenomenon of a sensor network from its global view, and then guide the error detection to discover any anomaly observations. We conducted simulations for each of the proposed models, and evaluated the performance by deriving the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6522580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522580","wireless sensor network;faulty detection;kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA)","","","8","4","","","3 Jun 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The size of the force sensor is 1.4-mm wide and 6-mm high for matching the size of endodontic instruments and making it feasible in the endodontic treatment. Experimental results on accuracy, repeatability, and nonlinearity are presented to validate the proposed sensor.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2258151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6502182","Bending sensing;endodontic therapy;piezoresistive;force sensor","","","7","","13","IEEE","15 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results show that when there exists measurement noise, the proposed learning law adjusts the learning gain matrix on line based on error amplitude, thus can make a compromise between learning convergence rate and convergence accuracy to some extent: the fast convergence rate is achieved with high gain in initial learning stage, the strong robustness and high convergence accuracy are achieved at the same time with small gain in the end learning stage, thus better learning results are obtained.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6473994","iterative learning control;open-loop P-type learning law;nonlinear gain;measurement noise;robustness","Noise measurement;Robustness;Convergence;Measurement uncertainty;Iterative methods;Gain measurement;Nonlinear systems","","7","","","","10 Jun 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

This paper proposes a master/slave parallel computing architecture and studies the computation of CA in a large-scale power system through high performance computing, adopting a message passing interface for implementation. In particular, although the execution time of CA varies, there is a tradeoff between having an imbalanced workload and “paying” a synchronization penalty for parallel computing: either factor blocks the progress of scalability. The proposed layered dynamic scheduling method is effective to tackle the challenge of high synchronization cost and workload imbalance and have the potential to further scale for the $N-2$ contingency analysis.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-013-0024-0","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939493","Massive parallel computing;Power system;Contingency analysis","Task analysis;Dynamic scheduling;Program processors;Processor scheduling;Synchronization","","7","","18","","23 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

The generation of L1C codes is quite different from the generation of traditional ranging codes. Thus, it is necessary to find a method for the correct generation to pave the way for future research. L1C codes are based on only one Legendre sequence which consists of Legendre symbols. To calculate these Legendre symbols, the Euler criterion is always used to evaluate quadratic residues. However, due to the great length of L1C codes, this procedure causes overflow problems. Therefore, the quadratic reciprocity law, some related theorems and properties are introduced to solve the problems. More-over, if the quadratic reciprocity law, some related theorems and properties are used to calculate different Legendre symbols, the combination modes may vary, which causes a complex generation process. The proposed generation method deals with this complex generation process effectively. In addition, through simulations, it is found that the autocorrelation features of obtained Legendre sequences and L1C codes are in accordance with theoretical results, which proves the correctness of the proposed method.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6545429","L1 Civil (L1C) signal;Legendre sequence;Weil code;quadratic reciprocity law","Correlation;Global Positioning System;Mathematical model;Gold;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Random sequences","","6","","","","21 Jun 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The dominance of the longitudinal or transverse configurations successfully explains this phenomenon because of the reliance of the different levels of piezoresistance coefficient on the channel orientation. The threshold voltage shifts versus the W-L ratio in the p-channel is in agreement with the result. The result is verified by a quantitative current comparison at a high bias in the n-/p-channels between the strained SiGe and Si-only channels, which shows that an extreme W-L ratio in the original biaxially strained SiGe channel can result in longitudinal or transverse strain, thereby leading to different levels of performance degradation/improvement.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2013.2281397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605597","MOSFET;piezoresistance coefficient;strained SiGe;threshold voltage;transconductance","Silicon germanium;Silicon;Strain;MOSFET;Stress;Degradation;Piezoresistance","","6","2","29","IEEE","20 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The short array can be conveniently placed on autonomous underwater vehicles and deployed for adaptive spatial sampling. However, the use of such small aperture passive sonar systems makes it difficult to acquire sufficient spatial gain for localizing long-range sources. To meet the requirement, a localization approach that employs matched-field based techniques that enable the short horizontal linear array is used to passively localize acoustic sources in shallow water. Furthermore, the broadband processing and inter-position processing provide robustness against ocean environmental mismatch and enhance the stability of the estimation process. The proposed approach's ability to localize acoustic sources in shallow water at different signal-to-noise ratios is examined through the synthetic test cases where the sources are located at the endfire and some other bearing of the mobile short horizontal linear array. The presented results demonstrate that the positional parameters of the estimated source build up over time as the array moves at a low speed along a straight line at a constant depth.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661869","passive source localization;shallow water;short horizontal array;matched-field based technique;broadband processing;inter-position processing","Arrays;Broadband communication;Program processors;Water resources;Mobile communication;Oceans;Acoustics","","6","","","","20 Nov 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

A heterogeneity test proved the existence of homogeneity in this study. Upon analysis using random effects models, the weighted sensitivity was 0.68, the specificity 0.77, the positive likelihood ratio 2.84, the negative likelihood ratio 0.40, and the SROC Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.8133.

The designed structure consists of MG deposited on a substrate positioned upside down above a conventional KC at a certain distance. Mode coupling and resonant interactions between KC and MG create two new hybrid plasmon modes with narrow bandwidths and unique spectra features, resulting in two obvious dips in the reflection spectrum. Although both dips respond nonlinearly to the refractive index (RI) of the dielectric layer, surprisingly, the sum of two resonance wavelengths has a good linear approximation in a wider RI range. The simultaneous measurement of two resonance dips makes it more attractive as a surface plasmon resonance analysis technology, which is valuable for high-sensitivity optical sensors.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2278983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6585754","Nanostructures;plasmonics;subwavelength structures;theory and design;waveguides","Plasmons;Gratings;Metals;Nanostructures;Optical surface waves;Reflection;Dielectrics","","5","","23","IEEE","23 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A bias is invariably imposed when a mixture is manually composed, and the structure is rarely representative of the process by which composites are fabricated. Properties such as packing density and anisotropies that seem to easily occur in nature are very difficult to obtain with manual arrangements. This paper addresses the creation of complex 3D mixtures, comprising crystals embedded in a matrix, for subsequent electromagnetic (EM) analysis. The physically realistic arrangement of the crystals is facilitated by the use of physics engine software, specifically the Bullet physics library, which renders the realistic effects in advanced computer games. A composite mixture of crystals is created by pouring a series of random crystals into a box with the crystals bouncing against each other and aligning just as they do in the real world. Higher packing densities are obtained than can be reasonably obtained with manual construction. The arrangement of the obtained crystals reflects the real world alignment of asymmetric crystals. A composite is created here and used with EM simulation software to investigate energy localization in materials.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2262014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514917","Automated crystal modeling;electric energy density;electromagnetic analysis;gaming software;mixtures;relative permittivity;transient simulation","Crystals;Physics;Libraries;Educational institutions;Electromagnetics;Software","","5","","8","OAPA","10 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Constrained interleavers can be constructed to achieve dSCC=dodi while almost maintaining the interleaver gain of uniform interleaving. By imposing additional inter-row constraints, dSCC of constrained interleaving is increased beyond dodi up to do2di, however, at the expense of some interleaver gain. Numerical results demonstrate that constrained interleaving is an efficient way to construct SCCs with low error floors while achieving interleaver gain at relatively short interleaver sizes.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2013.052013.122654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6519404","Serial concatenation;interleaving;inner recursive codes","Magnetohydrodynamics;Convolutional codes;Bit error rate;Concatenated codes;Block codes;Gain;Signal to noise ratio","","5","1","7","IEEE","23 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, TSO mainly focuses on fault detection and isolation, but they cannot provide an effective guide for the design for testability (DFT) to improve the PHM performance level. To solve the problem, a model of TSO for PHM systems is proposed. Firstly, through integrating the characteristics of fault severity and propagation time, and analyzing the test timing and sensitivity, a testability model based on failure evolution mechanism model (FEMM) for PHM systems is built up. This model describes the fault evolutiontest dependency using the fault-symptom parameter matrix and symptom parameter-test matrix. Secondly, a novel method of inherent testability analysis for PHM systems is developed based on the above information. Having completed the analysis, a TSO model, whose objective is to maximize fault trackability and minimize the test cost, is proposed through inherent testability analysis results, and an adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm (ASAGA) is introduced to solve the TSO problem. Finally, a case of a centrifugal pump system is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed models and methods. The results show that the proposed technology is important for PHM systems to select and optimize the test set in order to improve their performance level.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661872","test selection and optimization (TSO);prognostics and health management (PHM);failure evolution mechanism model (FEMM);adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm (ASAGA)","Prognostics and health management;Sensitivity;Analytical models;Signal to noise ratio;Optimization;Fault diagnosis","","5","","","","20 Nov 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The key issue of this process is how to determine a threshold to eliminate interference in the frequency domain, which has been extensively studied. However, these previous methods are tedious or very complex. A simple and efficient algorithm based on medians is proposed. The elimination threshold is only related to the median by a scale factor, which can be obtained by the numerical analysis. Simulation results show that the algorithm provides excellent narrow-band interference suppression while only slightly degrading the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A one-pass algorithm using logarithmic segmentation is further derived to estimate medians with low computational complexity. Finally, the FDIS is implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) of Xilinx. Experiments are carried out by connecting the FDIS FPGA to a DSSS receiver, and the results show that the receiver has an effective countermeasure for a 60 dB interference-to-signal ratio (ISR).","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6473980","direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS);discrete Fourier transform (DFT);frequency-domain interference suppression (FDIS);adaptive median threshold;one-pass approximate medians","Interference;Spread spectrum communication;Discrete Fourier transforms;Frequency domain analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Probability density function;Threshold analysis","","5","","","","10 Jun 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Typical grid disturbances such as voltage deviation, frequency fluctuation, voltage unbalance, and distortion can be simulated. A grid adaptability testing methodology was developed and applied to a doubly fed wind turbine with a focus on analyzing real test data to ascertain its three-phase voltage unbalance adaptability, which was successfully demonstrated.

"Mutations in hemagglutinin of a novel avian-origin H7N9 virus that are critical for receptor binding specificity","W.

Adaptation of avian viruses to efficiently infect humans requires the viral hemagglutinin (HA) binding switches from avian to human type receptors with help of some mutations in HA. As such it is critical for pandemic assessment to discover these mutations as hallmarks of adaptation. To continue our previous study of this novel H7N9 virus, we identified two sets of mutations in HA. The first set of mutations are present in the current circulating strains of 2013 H7N9 in China, and the second set are potential mutations that were found when compared to the HAs of previous human H7 subtype. These two sets of mutations exhibited unique features. The first group of mutations, on average, enhanced the HA binding to human type receptors whereas reduced that to avian types. Further the reduction of avian binding was almost three times of the increase of the human binding. The second group increased the binding to both human and avian types. But the increase in human types was almost three times of that in the avian types. Though different in their way of changing the binding preference, these two sets of mutations both contained more mutations to decrease the avian binding and increase the human binding than those that did the opposite. Our research highlighted the pandemic potential of this novel virus by showing the important mutations that could potentially help it to adapt to human hosts. Our findings offered new insights into the current state of evolution of this virus, which might be helpful for the continued surveillance of the emergence of H7N9 strains having the ability of human-to-human transmission.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6616525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616525","H7N9;influenza;receptor binding specificity;mutation;HA gene","Viruses (medical);Proteins;Amino acids;Birds;Diseases;Discrete Fourier transforms","","4","","","","3 Oct 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Since the linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal has a good energy concentration in the FRFD, by choosing an appropriate fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) order, the presented architecture can concentrate the broadband LFM signal into only one sub-channel and that will prevent it from crossing several sub-channels. Thus the performance of the signal detection and parameter estimation after the sub-channel output will be improved significantly. The computational complexity is reduced enormously due to the implementation of the polyphase filter bank decomposition, thus the proposed architecture can be realized as efficiently as in the Fourier domain. The related simulation results are presented to verify the validity of the theories and methods involved in this paper.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6473983","digital channelized receiver;fractional Fourier domain (FRFD);convolution theorem;sampling theorem","Computer architecture;Receivers;Convolution;Time frequency analysis;Digital systems;Systems engineering and theory;Fourier series;Sampling methods","","4","","","","10 Jun 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Although the generalized reliability theory for the least square has been discussed for many decades, the generalized reliability theory of KF is not widely discussed. Compared with the least square, KF includes not only the measurement model, but also the dynamic model. In KF, the predicted value of the state parameters from the dynamic model is considered as pseudo-measurements and combined with the observed measurements to compose the form of the least square. According to the reliability of the least square, the generalized reliability of KF is derived. Then, the dynamic model failure of precise point positioning is simulated to demonstrate the usage of the generalized reliability theory. The results show that the adverse influence of the dynamic model failure is more severe than that of the measurement model. Moreover, it is recommended that the model failure identification should always be used even if the overall model test passes. It is shown that the derived generalized reliability measures are suitable for the generalized KF estimation.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587343","Kalman filtering (KF);reliability;separability;failure detection;failure identification","Reliability theory;Failure analysis;Analytical models;Position measurement;Kalman filters","","4","","","","28 Aug 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The DC-noise in a holographic fringe pattern can be efficiently reduced by applying a second derivative operation while maintaining the two real and twin terms. For the performance evaluation, the proposed method is compared with the existing approaches, including the intensity average subtraction and frequency-domain filtering, which are generally used for the numerical holographic reconstruction.

Reactive power plays an important role in the power system reliability, because it is closely related to the system voltage stability and voltage collapse. However, reactive power-related reliability issues are seldom emphasized in conventional power reliability evaluations. This article investigates power system reliability of real and reactive power. Real and reactive power shortages and the associated voltage violations due to system failures are considered on reliability evaluation of power systems. A three-stage load-shedding technique for post contingencies is implemented to determine the contributions of real and reactive power on the system reliability and to find an optimal way to release network violation. The results provide the detailed information on power system planning and operation for system planners and operators from real and reactive power aspects.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-013-0016-0","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939501","Reactive power;Risk analysis;Reliability;Voltage stability","Reactive power;Power system stability;Power system reliability;Stability analysis;Voltage control","","4","","25","","23 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

However, it is also well-known that shortest path routing suffers from uneven distribution of traffic load, especially in dense wireless networks. Recently, several new routing protocols are proposed in order to balance traffic load among nodes in a network. One of them is Circular Sailing Routing (CSR) which maps nodes on the surface of a sphere and select routes based on surface distances. CSR has been demonstrated with better load balance than shortest path routing via simulations. However, it is still open that what load distribution CSR can achieve. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the traffic load distribution of CSR in a dense circular wireless network. Using the techniques developed by Hyttiä and Virtamo, we are able to derive the traffic load of any point inside the network.

By reinforcing the optimal action selected, the action policy of cyclic states is optimized gradually. The state list extracting is repeatedly learned and used as the experience knowledge which is shared by teams. Agents speed up the rate of convergence by experience sharing.

In such approaches, an image usually can be decomposed into a geometrical (or structure) component and a textured (or noise) feature. In this paper we propose an edge-preserving variational model which can split an image into four components: a first one containing the structure of the image, a second one the texture of the image, a third one the noise and a forth one the edge. Our decomposition model relies on the use of three different terms: the edge-preserving regularization for the geometrical component and the edge, a negative Sobolev norm for the texture, and a negative Besov norm for the noise. We explicitly give numerical scheme that is the synthesis of a projection algorithm, a redundant wavelet (or curvelet) soft threshold and two coupled Partial differential equations (PDE's). Finally we show image decomposition results on synthetic and real image.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJE.2013.10284741","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61070087); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284741","Image decomposition;Edge-preserving;Structure;Texture;Noise;Edge;Variational approach","Image edge detection;Partial differential equations;Minimization;Mathematical models;Image decomposition;Numerical models;Projection algorithms","","3","","10","","12 Oct 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

The total optical power at this target idler wavelength depends on the relative phase of each pump and signal wavelength. This concept has been applied to form a correlator where signal wavelengths are modulated by an input bit stream and mixed with pump wavelengths representing a reference bit pattern. This approach provides a correlation function with smaller unwanted noise peaks due to cancelation in the subtraction process.

The effect of the high sidelobe on the coherence is analyzed and deduced. Based on the interferometric characteristics of the slight difference in the viewing angles and the potential pixel offset in the interferometric SAR (InSAR) images, a relation between the radar impulse response and the coherence loss function is derived. From the relational model, the coherence loss function due to the high sidelobe of CSAR is then deduced, and compared with that of the conventional SAR. It is shown that the high sidelobe of CSAR focusing signal will severely affect the baseline decorrelation and coregistration decorrelation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the direct proof that a bandpass filter is not indispensible to achieve stable DS in ps fiber lasers.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2252608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6479216","Fiber lasers;mode-locked lasers","Laser mode locking;Chirp;Optical fiber dispersion;Optical fiber polarization;Cavity resonators;Band pass filters;Bragg gratings","","2","","17","IEEE","13 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The network designers need to overcome the NGN's challenges namely; heterogeneous wireless access environments, multiple traffic types, flexible bandwidth allocation and cross layer design issues among others. To guarantee quality of service for these NGN's, a call admission control scheme addressing the main challenges of NGN's is presented. This is a cross layer call admission control (CAC) scheme featuring multiple traffic types. The featured model effectively combines call level and packet level call admission control issues. It is based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) air interface which together with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple (OFDM) access are the most popular air interface technologies. Traditionally, signal to interference ratio (SIR) has solely been used as the call admission control parameter for CDMA networks. However, the results indicate that due to the nature of the multimedia traffic more parameters need to be incorporated in the call admission control scheme. The presented CAC scheme uses extended user specified QoS parameters of signal to interference ratio (SIR) and delay to accept or reject a call and guarantee a certain call blocking probability QoS metric. The results from the developed model clearly indicate that a CAC algorithm incorporating more parameters outperforms one with less admission control parameters.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2013.8531573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531573","Call admission control;CDMA;multimedia","Quality of service;Delays;Multiaccess communication;Call admission control;Cross layer design;Next generation networking","","2","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

The intermittency midterm dynamic impact must be studied. For the studied system, the instability is expected to be about 25 % RPS with current reserves. Besides, the most vulnerable peak hour to instability is the afternoon peak hour when solar begins to drop off.

Combs",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2013","54","suppl_1","i61","i68","Modern radiotherapy (RT) techniques are widely used in the irradiation of moving organs. A crucial step in ensuring the correct position of a target structure directly before or during treatment is daily image guidance by computed tomography (CT) or X-ray radiography (image-guided radiotherapy, IGRT). Therefore, combinations of modern irradiation devices and imaging, such as on-board imaging (OBI) with X-rays, or in-room CT such as the tomotherapy system, have been developed. Moreover, combinations of linear accelerators and in-room CT-scanners have been designed. IGRT is of special interest in hypofractionated and radiosurgical treatments where high single doses are applied in the proximity of critical organs at risk. Radiographically visible markers in or in close proximity to the target structure may help to reproduce the position during RT and could therefore be used as external surrogates for motion monitoring. Criteria sought for fiducial markers are (i) visibility in the radiologic modalities involved in radiotherapeutic treatment planning and image guidance, such as CT and kilovoltage (kV) OBI), (ii) low production of imaging artifacts, and (iii) low perturbation of the therapeutic dose to the target volume. Photon interaction with interstitial markers has been shown to be not as important as in particle therapy, where interaction of the particle beam, especially with metal markers, can have a significant impact on treatment. This applies especially with a scanned ion beam. Recently we commenced patient recruitment at our institution within the PROMETHEUS trial, which evaluates a hypofractionation regime, starting with 4 x 10 Gy (RBE), for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this work is, therefore, to evaluate potential implantable fiducial markers for enabling precise patient and thus organ positioning in scanned ion beams. To transfer existing knowledge of marker application from photon to particle therapy, we used a range of commercially available markers of different forms and sizes, consisting of carbon and gold materials, and evaluated them for their potential use in the clinical setup with scanned ion beams at our institution. All markers were implanted in a standardized Alderson phantom and were examined using CT scans and orthogonal kV OBI in our clinical routine protocol. Impact on beam perturbation downstream of the markers in the plateau region of a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) was estimated by using radiographic films for clinical proton and carbon ion beams of high and low energies. All tested markers achieved good visibility in CT and kV OBI. Disturbances due to artifacts and dose perturbation were highest in the arbitrarily folded gold and the thickest gold marker, but especially low in the carbon marker. Dose perturbation was highest in the arbitrarily folded gold marker. In summary, the analyzed markers offer promising potential for identifying target structures in our treatment setup at HIT and will soon be used in clinical routine. However, a careful choice of marker, depending on the tumor localization and irradiation strategy, will need to be made.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8199209","carbon ion therapy;liver tumors;fiducial marker;raster-scanning technique;moving organs","","","2","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here, we have investigated the relationship between the ""funnel likeness"" of protein folding and the size/structure of the proteins based on a set of non-homologous proteins we have recently evaluated using a statistical mechanicsbased scoring function ITScorePro. It was found that larger proteins that consist of more helix/sheet structures tend to have a higher score-Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) correlation (or a more funnel like energy landscape). Another measurement in protein folding, Z-score, has also shown some correlation with the size of the proteins. As expected, proteins with a better ""olding funnel likeness"" (or score-RMSD correlation) tend to have a betterpredicted conformation with a lower RMSD from their native structures. These findings can be extremely valuable for the development and improvement of sampling and scoring algorithms for protein structure prediction.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6616520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616520","energy landscape;folding funnel;protein structure prediction;scoring function;protein folding","Proteins;Correlation;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Prediction algorithms;Periodic structures;Algorithm design and analysis","","2","","","","3 Oct 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper, a robust algorithm of feature extraction for non-contact gaze tracking with eyeglasses is presented. The algorithm uses a pyramidal multi-scale screening strategy to locate the pupil at first, and then utilizes knowledge of essential characteristics to distinguish the real corneal-reflections from interference of eyeglasses. On this basis, the feature extraction of gaze is more robust and accurate. An experiment has been taken to evaluate the algorithm's performance to the interferences in some different situations. Comparing to a former algorithm that has been used, the success rate of the proposed algorithm has risen significantly.

The competition for spectrum resources often results in the misuse of the spectrum resources as networks experience contention in attempt to access unoccupied spectrum bands. The competitive scenario causes cognitive radio networks to incur a huge amount of loss, which constitutes a major problem of self-coexistence among networks. As a way to minimize these losses we present a self-coexistence mechanism that allows cognitive radio networks to coexist with each other by implementing a risk-motivated channel selection based on deference structure. Cognitive radio networks form deference structure community to have more efficient access to a channel of interest and can defer transmission to one another on that channel, thereby minimizing the chances of conflicts. As part of the decision making process to become a member of a deference structure community, cognitive radio networks rely on a risk-motivated channel selection scheme to evaluate the tentative deference structure channel. We provide numerical and simulation results that demonstrates the benefits of the proposed self-coexistence mechanism and show how it helps networks to coordinate their spectrum activities, minimize contention experienced and improve their utility. We also emphasize on the importance of the deference structure community size with regards to the average performance of member networks.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6522583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522583","dynamic spectrum access;cognitive radio;self-coexistence;deference;deference structure","","","1","","","","3 Jun 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Non-Gaussian noise caused significant performance degradation to communication receivers. The new constant modulus blind equalizer based on Fractional lower-order statistics of the equalizer input, which is defined as FLOS_CMA, is able to mitigate impulsive channel noise while restoring the constant modulus character of the transmitted communication signal. However, like the Constant modulus algorithm (CMA), the steady-state Mean square error (MSE) of the FLOS_CMA algorithm may not be sufficient low for the system to obtain adequate performance. This paper proposes a concurrent equalizer, in which a Decision-directed least mean p norm (DD_LMP) equalizer operates cooperatively with a FLOS_CMA equalizer, controlled through a non-linear link. Simulation results using M-QAM and 8-PSK signaling have shown that besides the capability of compensating the phase offset, the proposed concurrent FLOS_CMA and DD_LMP blind equalizer has faster convergence rate and lower steady-state MSE than the FLOS_CMA approach.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJE.2013.10285722","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61171175,61001090); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2011QN116); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10285722","Alpha-stable distribution;Fractional lower-order statistics;Least mean p norm;Constant modulus algorithm;Concurrent equalizer","Blind equalizers;Degradation;Equalizers;Simulation;Receivers;Mean square error methods;Cost function","","1","","17","","16 Oct 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

A new steganographic method, deemed the Spatial-Spectral Watermarking Scheme (SSWS), has been developed and utilises both the spatial and the spectral domains for the encoding process. A developed mathematical model of the scheme predicts a maximum gain in terms of steganographic capacity of 4.9 over an existing algorithm, JSteg.

Five important practical factors are considered in the proposed switching scheme: transmit correlation, ARQ technique, packet loss probability (PLP) constraint, discrete rate transmission (DRT) and channel coding. Under the spatially correlated channel, the distributions of the post signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the SM mode and the STBC mode are obtained by using Gamma approximations. Then this paper derives the closed-form expressions of the PLP and the throughput for different modes when the ARQ technique is employed, based on which the mode switching algorithm is proposed to improve the spectral efficency. In the simulation, the correction of the expressions is first verified. Then, the significant gain observed by the proposed algorithm is presented. Since the switching point is the key parameter to implement the mode switching, this paper also shows how the switching point is affected by the practical factors considered.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6473979","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);mode switching;transmit correlation;automatic repeat request (ARQ);throughput","Switches;Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Throughput;MIMO;Automatic repeat request;Feedback communications","","1","","","","10 Jun 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Aiming at this problem, the differences among the edge, linear target, and range anomaly are analyzed and a novel algorithm based on neighborhood pixels detection is proposed. Firstly, the range differences between current pixel and its neighborhood pixels are calculated. Then, the number of neighborhood pixels is detected by the range difference threshold. Finally, whether the current pixel is a range anomaly is distinguished by the neighborhood pixel number threshold.

These markers are used as external fiducials during patient positioning and dose delivery. This study reports the results of a comparative analysis between in-room imaging and optical tracking data for patient positioning within the framework of high-precision particle therapy. Differences between the optical tracking system (OTS) and the imaging system (IS) were on average within the expected localization accuracy. On the first 633 fractions for head and neck (H&N) set-up procedures, the corrections applied by the IS, after patient positioning using the OTS only, were for the mostly sub-millimetric regarding the translations (0.4±1.1 mm) and sub-gradual regarding the rotations (0.0°±0.8°). On the first 236 fractions for pelvis localizations the amplitude of the corrections applied by the IS after preliminary optical set-up correction were moderately higher and more dispersed (translations: 1.3±2.9 mm, rotations 0.1±0.9°). Although the indication of the OTS cannot replace information provided by in-room imaging devices and 2D-3D image registration, the reported data show that OTS preliminary correction might greatly support image-based patient set-up refinement and also provide a secondary, independent verification system for patient positioning.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8199198","IGRT;patient positioning;optical tracking system;particle therapy;head and neck;pelvis localizations","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Adapting the IEEE 802.11 DCF access method to PbP leads B_w to be organized into primary channel, in which contention occurs, and secondary narrow orthogonal channels. Upon winning a contention in the primary channel, nodes also get access to each secondary channel but in a sequential way rather than All-at-Once (AaO). Based on infinite horizon steady-state simulations and analytic results, we show that PbP causes the IEEE 802.11 access method to put up to twice more data bits into B_w in comparison to the conventional AaO paradigm.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2013.091913.131699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6612765","Multiple access protocol;VHT IEEE 802.11;dynamic channel width;performance evaluation","IEEE 802.11 Standards;Throughput;Wireless LAN;Analytical models;Media Access Protocol;OFDM","","1","","12","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then an optimized dimensionality reduction algorithm is applied on the compound features to get lower dimensional and compressed feature representations. In the following, the dimensionality reduced features are clustered by a $k$-means based adaptive clustering algorithm to form a proper visual codebook, and each image is represented by the codebook histogram. Finally, the support vector machine is exploited to do the scene categorization tasks using the robust image representations.

This was a retrospective study of 25 consecutive implants. The high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk were defined according to the GEC-ESTRO Working Group definitions. A dose of 6 Gy was prescribed. The uniform cost function for dose constraints was applied to all IPSA-generated plans. The coverage of the HR-CTV by IPSA for combination-BT was equivalent to that of manual optimization, and was better than that of the Manchester system using only tandem and ovoids. The mean V 100 achieved by IPSA for combination-BT, manual optimization and Manchester was 96 ± 3.7%, 95 ± 5.5% and 80 ± 13.4%, respectively. The mean D 100 was 483 ± 80, 487 ± 97 and 335 ± 119 cGy, respectively. The mean D 90 was 677 ± 61, 681 ± 88 and 513 ± 150 cGy, respectively. IPSA resulted in significant reductions of the doses to the rectum (IPSA D 2cm3 : 408 ± 71 cGy vs manual optimization D 2cm3 : 485 ± 105 cGy; P = 0.03) and the bladder (IPSA D 2cm3 : 452 ± 60 cGy vs manual optimization D 2cm3 : 583 ± 113 cGy; P < 0.0001).

However, tracing the full route path of each packet could be highly challenging, due to the hard resource constraint in WSNs. Our previous work proposes a hash-based path tracing mechanism, and leverages network connectivity and node locations to reduce the computational complexity. However, the node locations may be unavailable in some scenarios. In this work, we further propose a location-free enhancement to the hash-based path tracing mechanism, called P-Zone. P-Zone requires only network connectivity information to reduce the computational complexity. Theoretical analysis and practical simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of our design. The results indicate that P-Zone can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the hash-based path tracing mechanism, while effectively tracing the full route path of each packet in the network in a real-time manner, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJE.2013.10283972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10283972","Location-free;Packet path tracing;Restricted witness graph;Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Real-time systems;Behavioral sciences;Computational complexity","","","","24","","12 Oct 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

For the sake of breaking through the problems brought about by depending on emotion lexicons, we first recognize word emotions in a sentence based on Maximum entropy model. And then homogeneous Markov model is built for clause emotion recognition; After that, a strategy based on emotion selection is proposed for a sentence with multiple clauses, and genetic algorithm is used for clause selection by textual feature weighting. The experimental results show that, comparing with the baseline, there are 9.1% and 3.6% improvement respectively for two different evaluations.

"Triggering of microearthquakes in Iceland by volatiles released from a dyke intrusion","H. R. Martens; R. S. White",NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2013","194","3","1738","1754","We suggest that carbon dioxide exsolved from a mid-crustal basaltic dyke intrusion in Iceland migrated upwards and triggered shallow seismicity by allowing failure on pre-existing fractures under the relatively low elastic stresses (100–200 kPa; 1–2 bar) generated by the dyke inflation. Intense swarms of microseismicity accompanied magmatic intrusion into a dyke at depths of 13–19 km in the crust of Iceland's Northern Volcanic Rift Zone during 2007–2008. Contemporaneously, a series of small normal earthquakes, probably triggered by elastic stresses imposed by the dyke intrusion, occurred in the uppermost 4 km of crust: fault plane solutions from these are consistent with failure along the extensional fabric and surface fissure directions mapped in the area, suggesting that the faults failed along existing rift zone fabric even though the mid-crustal dyke is highly oblique to it. Several months after the melt froze in the mid-crust and seismicity associated with the intrusion had ceased, an upsurge in shallow microseismicity began in the updip projection of the dyke near the brittle–ductile transition at 6–7 km depth below sea level. This seismicity is caused by failure on right-lateral strike-slip faults, with fault planes orientated 23 ± 3°, which are identical with the 24 ± 2° orientation in this area of surface fractures and fissures caused by plate spreading and extension of the volcanic rift zone. However, these earthquakes have T-axes approximately aligned with the opening direction of the dyke, and the right-lateral sense of failure is opposite that of regional strike-slip faults. We suggest that the fractures occurred along pre-existing weaknesses generated by the pervasive fabric of the rift zone, but that the dyke opening in the mid-crust beneath it caused right-lateral failure. The seismicity commenced after a temporal delay of several months and has persisted for over 3 yr. We propose that fluids exsolved from the magma in the dyke, primarily carbon dioxide, percolated updip and to shallower depths predominantly along pre-existing fractures. Increased pore pressure from the volatiles reduced the effective normal compressive stress on faults, increasing the likelihood of failure and allowing the modest stress changes generated by the intrusion to cause failure. Propagation of volatiles through the crust would also account for the observed time delay between the intrusion at depth and the shallow earthquake clusters. A further short-lived cluster of earthquakes at 2–4 km depth beneath the surface exhibits left-lateral strike-slip faulting with epicentres well orientated along a lineation which is identical with other subparallel strike-slip faults in the area that transfer motion between two adjacent spreading segments. These shallow earthquakes lie beyond lobes of significant positive Coulomb stress change caused by the intrusion, implying minimal modifications to the stress field in their vicinity; hence, they continue to respond to the regional stress field rather than the local stress field generated by the dyke intrusion.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggt184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227197","Fracture and flow;Earthquake interaction, forecasting, and prediction;Volcano seismology;Rheology and friction of fault zones;Dynamics and mechanics of faulting;Volcanic gases","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The analysis shows that metadata cache deallocation of current Linux causes large latency in file-request processing when the operational throughput of a file server becomes large. To eliminate the latency caused by metadata cache deallocation, a new method, called “split reclaim,” which divides metadata cache deallocation from conventional cache deallocation, is proposed. It is experimentally shown that the split-reclaim method reduces the worst response time by more than 95% and achieves three times higher throughput under a metadata-intensive workload. The split-reclaim method also reduces latency caused by cache deallocation under a general file-server workload by more than 99%. These results indicate that the split-reclaim method can eliminate metadata cache deallocation latency and make possible the use of commodity servers as enterprise file servers.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2013.2252605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522267","Cache memory;file servers;memory management;scalability","Linux;Servers;Throughput;Resource management;Time factors;Memory management;Time measurement","","","","21","IEEE","30 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Taking maximization of the expected sum rate of cognitive system as the objective function, we solve this optimization problem by a Lagrangian dual method under the introduced primary user outage probability constraint.

We considered general situations, where the number of sensors was arbitrary as well as their sampling rates and initial sampling instants. A two-layer fusion structure was adopted. For each target, a pseudo-measurement of sensor bias was generated by fusing sensor measurements of this target. To make the pseudo-measurement decoupled from the target state, the fusion coefficient matrix was determined to be a basis for the left null space of an augmented observation matrix. The bias estimation algorithm was proposed based on the Strong tracking filter (STF) by fusing pseudomeasurements. The proposed algorithm makes use of all available sensor information, has strong tracking ability to abrupt changes, and avoids the matrix inversion for large dimensional matrices.

It is very well structured. A blueprint is planned, based on the classical topics in electrodynamics. The author then lays the foundation and builds the framework of the book by developing and expanding on related physical concepts in each chapter. The “house” of electrodynamics is completed by adding boards, siding and a roof of a clearly mathematical origin. As mentioned in the introduction, all this is done with “an engaging writing style and strong focus on physical understanding.” Different from many classical textbooks on electromagnetism that are mathematically heavy, the author uses mathematics as an enabling tool. He succeeds in using qualitative arguments to clarify complex mathematics. In this way, Zangwill gives prominence to the development of electrodynamics, and makes this book a real electrodynamics book.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2013.7909831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7909831","","Electrodynamics;Book reviews;Writing;Mathematics;Presses;Electromagnetic scattering","","","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

Innovative test circuits are designed using FPGA's internal resources to build Iterative logic arrays (ILAs) for Look-up tables (LUTs), distributed random access memories, configurable registers and other logics. The programmable interconnects needed to connect CLBs in these test circuits are also repeatable, making the configuration process much easier and the test speed much faster. The test method is transplantable and independent of FPGA's array size, so it can be applied to the test of different FPGAs. Xilinx's Virtex FPGA is taken as an example to explain our method, where only 19 test configurations are needed to achieve 100% coverage for all CLBs.

The insert box includes a spiral film box used for dose-distribution measurement, and a film holder for positioning a radiochromic film. The film holder has two parallel walls whose facing inner surfaces are equipped with spiral grooves in a mirrored configuration. The film is inserted into the spiral grooves by its side edges and runs along them to be positioned on a spiral plane. Dose calculation was performed by applying clinical VMAT plans to the spiral water phantom using a commercial Monte Carlo-based treatment-planning system, Monaco, whereas dose was measured by delivering the VMAT beams to the phantom. The calculated dose distributions were resampled on the spiral plane, and the dose distributions recorded on the film were scanned. Comparisons between the calculated and measured dose distributions yielded an average gamma-index pass rate of 87.0% (range, 91.2–84.6%) in nine prostate VMAT plans under 3 mm/3% criteria with a dose-calculation grid size of 2 mm.

The total period of the structure is equal to L = L1 + L2 . The transfer matrix for the unit cell is written. The Bloch equation for the infinite system is formulated from the conditions of periodicity. The solutions of the Bloch equation determine the Bloch wave vector and the spectral structure of our infinite system. The numerical calculations of an important model system were performed. The model system consisted of two periodic subsystems (eight elements in either of the two), with different parameters of periodicity. The analog of the Tamm state was observed as a crowding of electromagnetic waves propagating through the system at the transition between two subsystems. The concentration of electromagnetic-wave energy takes place at the border point of one-dimensional subsystems.

In this paper, we take advantage of similarity querying method to find out novel patterns in order to reduce the negative effect brought by high dimension and stochastic noise. Firstly, we reduce the dimension and eliminate the stochastic noise of flight data by piecewise linear representation method. Then, the indexical tree based on distance reduction rate is created to achieve efficient search.

Two Lorentz transformations, one from the stationary reference coordinate system to the moving system and the other vice versa, are employed to derive the the-oretical model for analysis of the propagation characteristics of the vertical polarized plane time-harmonic waves, which is oblique incidence to the train. The calculation results show that for the transmitting wave reflected by the moving high-speed train, two main signals can be received. One is at the transmitting frequency and the other is at the second-order radiated frequency. The frequency spectrum between these two frequencies are much larger than which is introduced by the Doppler shift. The frequency and the reflection angle of the reflected wave are no longer equal to the frequency and the incident angle of the incident wave. The changed reflection frequency and angle are related to the train's velocity, the incident angle and the azimuth angle of the incident wave. The frequency shift is mainly decided by the $y$-component of the train's velocity. It has nothing to do with x-component of the train's velocity. The reflection angles will be smaller than the related incident angles when the train goes along -y direction. The reflection angles will be larger than the related incident angles when the train goes along + $y$ direction. The reflection angle will become larger and larger with the increase of the incident angle and the $y$-component of the train's velocity. The induced current density and the charge density on the surface of the train are increased with the train's velocity, and the induced charge is much smaller than the induced current.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJE.2013.10285852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10285852","Propagation characteristics;High-speed train;Second-order radiation","Doppler shift;Industries;Polarization;Analytical models;Azimuth;Surface waves;Reflection","","","","14","","16 Oct 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

Its quiescent spectrum is unusually rich in helium, showing broad, double-peaked emission lines from the accretion disc. We measure a line flux ratio He I 5875/Hα = 0.81 ± 0.04, a much higher ratio than typically observed in cataclysmic variable stars (CVs). The outburst spectrum shows hydrogen and helium in absorption, with weak emission of Hα and He I 6678, as well as strong He II emission.From our photometry, we find the superhump period to be 56.34 ± 0.18 min, in agreement with the previously published result. The spectroscopic period, derived from the radial velocities of the emission lines, is found to be 55.3 ± 0.8 min, consistent with a previously identified photometric orbital period, and significantly below the normal CV period minimum. This indicates that the donor in SBSS 1108+574 is highly evolved. The superhump excess derived from our photometry implies a mass ratio of q = 0.086 ± 0.014. Our spectroscopy reveals a grazing eclipse of the large outbursting disc. As the disc is significantly larger during outburst, it is unlikely that an eclipse will be detectable in quiescence. The relatively high accretion rate implied by the detection of outbursts, together with the large mass ratio, suggests that SBSS 1108+574 is still evolving towards its period minimum.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stt169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8185681","accretion, accretion discs;binaries: close;stars: individual: SBSS 1108+574;novae, cataclysmic variables;white dwarfs","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, the accuracy rates of previous methods are not high. The reason is that the manifold of face image data is not utilized sufficiently and some patitcular characters of the individual image are neglected in these methods. Thus a new method to form graph of data is proposed in this paper and is used to develop two face recognition algorithms. The maximum minimum value of manifold can be preserved based on the new graph. At the same time the pixels correlation in individual image is considered sufficient under the constrain of spatial smoothness in the two developed algorithms. Therefore, the right recognition rates are enhanced by the two proposed algorithms. This is further confirmed by experiments.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJE.2013.10284725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284725","Manifold learning;Face recognition;Spatially smooth;Subspace learning","Manifolds;Correlation;Face recognition","","","","15","","12 Oct 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

In the lower correlation atoms, only a few are correct which usually impact the reconstructive performance and decide the reconstruction dynamic range of greedy pursuit methods. The others are redundant. In order to avoid redundant atoms impacting the reconstructive accuracy, the Bayesian pursuit algorithm is used to eliminate them. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the reconstructive dynamic range and the reconstructive accuracy.

Multi-NAT, which is desired in large scale IPv4-IPv6 coexistent network, has inherent difficulties in the stateful traffic balancing and failure recovery. The existing schemes cannot handle them due to the absence of state synchronization. In this paper we propose a novel Load balancer (LB) to build a Scalable multi-NAT (SMNAT) in large scale network for various IPv4-IPv6 coexistent scenarios. The LB is specifically designed to have a translation pattern related hash keys and load-balance bi-directional traffic in two modes. Additionally an Adaptive reassigning algorithm (ARA) running in LB is presented to schedule flows adaptively to reduce the cost of state synchronization as well as guarantee the performance in load balancing. Comparing SMNAT with the existing load balancing schemes, the simulation result shows that our SMNAT outperforms other schemes and meets the goals of large scale NAT.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJE.2013.10285819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10285819","Load balancer;Stateful traffic;Multinetwork address translation (MNAT);Carrier grade NAT (CGN);Large scale IPv4-IPv6 coexistence","Schedules;Costs;Protocols;Simulation;Scalability;Bidirectional control;Production","","","","17","","16 Oct 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

For conventional TR approaches, the assigned value to reserved subcarriers just considers one peak value and this brings peak value up again easily. In this paper, a novel scheme named Metric-based angle-rotated (MBAR) for TR is presented. The scheme employs a metric to measure how much each subcarrier contributes to the output signal samples of large magnitude and then subcarriers with the largest positive metrics are selected to reduce PAPR. The simulation results show that when the reserved subcarriers number is 1.46 percent, the PAPR gain of the proposed method can achieve 0.47dB at least at the probability of 10-3.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJE.2013.10285833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10285833","OFDM system;Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction;Tone reservation (TR);Metric value;Metric-based angle-rotated (MBAR)","Measurement;Costs;Computer simulation;Peak to average power ratio;Distortion","","","","10","","16 Oct 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

When delivering an IPv6 packet over a route consisting of multiple unreliable links, the probability that the IPv6 packet reaches the destination via MUR is very low. This drawback is remedied by the proposed Cost-aware and reliable MUR (CAR-MUR) scheme, which extends the MUR to incorporate a packet redelivery mechanism in the transport layer and is able to find the best number of trials in the transport layer, the best number of the retrials in the MAC layer, and the best number of fragments in each packet so that the total cost for packet delivery is minimized while guaranteeing all the packets to reach the destination with a preset probability.

Cells were either held in the non-cycling G 0 phase of the cell cycle for 12 h, or forced to proliferate immediately after irradiation. Fusion premature chromosome condensation (PCC) was combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to study chromosomal aberrations in interphase. The culture condition had no impact on the rejoining kinetics of PCC breaks during the 12 h after X-ray or heavy-ion irradiation. However, 12 h after X-ray and silicon irradiation, cycling cells had more chromosome exchanges than non-cycling cells. After 6 Gy X-rays, the yield of exchanges in cycling cells was 2.8 times higher than that in non-cycling cells, and after 2 Gy of 55 keV/μm silicon ions the yield of exchanges in cycling cells was twice that of non-cycling cells. In contrast, after exposure to 2 Gy 200-keV/μm or 440-keV/μm iron ions the yield of exchanges was similar in non-cycling and cycling cells. Since the majority of repair in G 0 /G 1 occurs via the non-homologous end joining process (NHEJ), increased PLDR in X-ray and silicon-ion irradiated cells may result from improved cell cycle-specific rejoining fidelity through the NHEJ pathway, which is not the case in high-LET iron-ion irradiated cells.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8162563","heavy ion;PLDR (potentially lethal damage repair);premature chromosome condensation;FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization);misrepair","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To test competing hypotheses concerning the mechanisms for this deformation, we assembled a high-quality data set of approximately 14000 P- and 4000 S-wave arrival times from earthquakes at teleseismic distances from the International Deep Profiling of Tibet and the Himalaya, Phase IV broad-band seismometer deployments. We analyse these arrival times to determine tomographic images of P- and S-wave velocities in the upper mantle beneath this part of the plateau. To account for the effects of major heterogeneity in crustal and uppermost mantle wave velocities in Tibet, we use recent surface wave models to construct a starting model for our teleseismic body wave inversion. We compare the results from our model with those from simpler starting models, and find that while the reduction in residuals and results for deep structure are similar between models, the results for shallow structure are different. Checkerboard tests indicate that features of∼125 km length scale are reliably imaged throughout the study region. Using synthetic tests, we show that the best recovery is below∼300 km, and that broad variations in shallow structure can also be recovered. We also find that significant smearing can occur, especially at the edges of the model. We observe a shallow dipping seismically fast structure at depths of∼140–240 km, which dies out gradually between 33°N and 35°N. Based on the lateral continuity of this structure (from the surface waves) we interpret it as Indian lithosphere. Alternatively, the entire area could be thickened by pure shear, or the northern part could be an underthrust Lhasa Terrane lithospheric slab with only the southern part from India. We see a deep fast wave velocity anomaly (below 300 km), that is consistent with receiver function observations of a thickened transition zone and could be a fragment of oceanic lithosphere. In NE Tibet, it appears to be disconnected from faster wave velocities above (i.e. it is not downwelling or subducting here). Our models corroborate results of previous work which imaged a relatively slow wave velocity region below the Kunlun Shan and northern Songpan-Ganzi Terrane, which is difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis of southward-directed continental subduction at the northern margin. Wave velocities in the shallow mantle beneath the Qaidam Basin are faster than normal, and more so in the east than the west.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggt476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8144198","Tomography;Mantle processes;Body waves;Seismic tomography;Continental margins: convergent;Asia","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Crystal–Melt Relationships and the Record of Deep Mixing and Crystallization in the ad 1783 Laki Eruption, Iceland","D. A. Neave; E. Passmore; J. Maclennan; G. Fitton; T. Thordarson",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Petrology,"18 Jan 2018","2013","54","8","1661","1690","Concurrent mixing and crystallization of magmas has been identified in the plumbing of Icelandic magmatic systems from investigation of their erupted products. Thermobarometric calculations constrain the depth of these processes to the mid- to lower crust. It is currently unknown whether similar processes also occur in the magmas that feed the large fissure eruptions characteristic of the Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ). We therefore present the results of an investigation of crystal–melt relationships in the ad 1783 Laki (Skaftár Fires) eruption. The trace element composition of olivine-hosted melt inclusions indicates that concurrent mixing and crystallization of variable mantle melts has occurred in the deep parts of the Laki plumbing system. Magmatic evolution is also recorded in crystal zonation patterns. Zoned plagioclase macrocrysts are made up of three distinct domains: high-anorthite cores, oscillatory zoned mantles and low-anorthite rims. Published mineral–melt equilibrium partition coefficients indicate that macrocryst rims are in equilibrium with the carrier liquid erupted at the surface. High-anorthite cores are more primitive than any other crystal or melt inclusion composition in the magma and are never in equilibrium with melts generated by fractional crystallization models that assume a single liquid line of descent related to the carrier liquid. High-anorthite crystals may have grown from depleted, high-Ca/Na melts of the shallow mantle, which may have been mixed into melts parental to the carrier liquid early in magmatic evolution. The crystal size distribution (CSD) of plagioclase macrocrysts suggests that plagioclase cores represent an assimilated or accumulated crystal population. Cores have acted as nuclei for the growth of oscillatory zoned plagioclase mantles. It is possible to relate the range of plagioclase mantle compositions to the carrier liquid using fractional crystallization models involving eutectic co-crystallization with clinopyroxene and olivine macrocrysts. Negative correlation of titanium and anorthite content in plagioclase mantles confirms that oscillatory zoning is driven by variations in melt composition, most probably the result of repeated recharge and fractionation events. Melt barometry indicates that the melt last equilibrated with olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene in the shallow crust at 1–2 kbar, whereas clinopyroxene–melt barometry suggests that the bulk of macrocryst growth occurred within the mid-crust at 2–5·4 kbar. Much of the macrocryst content of the Laki magma occurs as glomerocrysts, of which only rims in contact with the groundmass are in equilibrium with the carrier liquid. This indicates that the formation of glomerocrysts occurred before rim growth, during deposition of crystal mushes in the mid-crust, which subsequently disaggregated upon transport to the shallow crust.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egt027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8183272","Laki;fractional crystallization;melt inclusions;Iceland;mixing;plagioclase","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

As with associated finite element methods, their solution relies upon the construction of conforming bases. While lowest order (RWG) spaces are near ubiquitous, their extension to higher order offers, potentially, a number of benefits in terms of accuracy and efficiency, which has been well documented in both finite elements and integral equation formulations. A further evolution of higher order conforming bases is the hierarchical basis. These have demonstrated considerable gains in efficiency in finite element applications. Such bases allow for the development of effective acceleration schemes, for instance, the multilevel Schwarz type preconditioner (p-MUS). An obvious question arises as to the applicability of such hierarchical bases and their associated acceleration schemes to integral equations. It is seen that the conclusions as to their efficacy depend strongly on the scattering regime. In particular, high-frequency problems (those where the wavelength is the principal determinant of mesh size) are shown to benefit little from hierarchical functions. On the other hand, for “low-frequency” problems (where geometry is the main determinant of mesh size), there are significant improvements in performance over corresponding interpolatory schemes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2013.2276926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575140","Integral equation (IE);hierarchical;pre conditioner","Convergence;Geometry;Equations;Integral equations;Acceleration;Accuracy;Mathematical model","","","","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A total of 56 patients with lower rectal cancer of cT3N1M0 (Stage III b) was treated with SC-HART followed by radical surgery, and were analyzed in the present study. SC-HART was performed with a dose of 2.5 Gy twice daily, with an interval of at least 6 hours between fractions, up to a total dose of 25 Gy (25 Gy in 10 fractions for 5 days) combined with S-1 for 10 days. Radical surgery was performed within three weeks following the end of the SC-HART. The median age was 64.6 (range, 39–85) years. The median follow-up term was 16.3 (range, 2–53) months. Of the 56 patients, 53 (94.4%) had no apparent adverse events before surgery; 55 (98.2%) completed the full course of neoadjuvant therapy, while one patient stopped chemotherapy because of Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (CTCAE v.3). The sphincter preservation rate was 94.6%. Downstaging was observed in 45 patients (80.4%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 43 patients (76.8%). The local control rate, disease-free survival rate and disease-specific survival rate were 100%, 91.1% and 100%, respectively. To conclude, SC-HART combined with S-1 for locally advanced rectal cancer was well tolerated and produced good short-term outcomes. SC-HART therefore appeared to have a good feasibility for use in further clinical trials.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8162573","rectal cancer;accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy;preoperative radiotherapy;short-course radiotherapy;radiotherapy;S-1","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

If the polarity of the first exceeding threshold sample is different with that of predefined sequence, the current received sample is estimated to be the right timing point; otherwise the algorithm is put forward to find out a peak of correlation summation to figure out timing point.

A Swift/XRT follow-up observation confirmed the uncatalogued point source, and localized it to the position at $(13^\textrm h06^\textrm m56_\cdot^\textrm s44,-70^\circ27^\prime4.^{\prime\prime}91)$. The source continued its activity for about five months, until 2012 August. The MAXI/GSC light curve in the 2–10 keV band and the variation of the hardness ratio of the 4–10 keV to the 2–4 keV flux revealed the hard-to-soft state transition on the the sixth day (April 15) in the brightening phase and the soft-to-hard transition on the ∼60th day (June 15) in the decay phase. The luminosity at the initial hard-to-soft transition was significantly higher than that at the soft-to-hard transition in the decay phase. The X-ray spectra in the hard state are represented by a single power-law model with a photon index of ∼2.0, while those in the soft state need such an additional soft component as represented by a multi-color disk blackbody emission with an inner disk temperature of ∼0.5–1.2 keV.

To visualize and compare different DNA sequences in less space, a novel descriptors extraction approach was proposed for numerical characterizations and similarity analysis of sequences. Initially, a transformation method was introduced to represent each DNA sequence with dinucleotide physicochemical property matrix. Then, based on the approximate joint diagonalization theory, an eigenvalue vector was extracted from each DNA sequence, which could be considered as descriptor of the DNA sequence. Moreover, similarity analyses were performed by calculating the pair-wise distances among the obtained eigenvalue vectors. The results show that the proposed approach can capture more sequence information, and can jointly analyze the information contained in all involved multiple sequences, rather than separately, whose effectiveness was demonstrated intuitively by constructing a dendrogram for the 15 beta-globin gene sequences.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6616518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616518","descriptors;approximate joint diagonalization;dendrogram;physicochemical property;similarityanalysis","DNA;Sequential analysis;Symmetric matrices;Feature extraction;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Proteins","","","","","","3 Oct 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Design as part of Systems Engineering (SE) and Project Management (PM) is an important process for product development. The interaction between SE and PM can influence the success of a product development project. A model has been developed to better understand why design iterations are fundamental to the design process. This model has been expanded into a constrained design influencing model that provides a better understanding of the influence of project management in the design process. This model shows that the project manager, particularly if he is under unrealistic constraints, can force a premature design release for integration to the next system level.

Totani",NA,Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan,"19 Jan 2018","2013","65","5","L12","L12","Fast radio bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances have recently been discovered, whose duration is about milliseconds. We argue that the observed short duration is difficult to explain by giant flares of soft gamma-ray repeaters, though their event rate and energetics are consistent with FRBs. Here, we discuss binary neutron star (NS–NS) mergers as a possible origin of FRBs. The FRB rate is within the plausible range of the NS–NS merger rate and its cosmological evolution, while a large fraction of the NS–NS mergers must produce observable FRBs. A likely radiation mechanism is coherent radio emission, like radio pulsars, by magnetic braking when magnetic fields of neutron stars are synchronized to binary rotation at the time of coalescence. Magnetic fields of the standard strength (∼1012-13 G) can explain the observed FRB fluxes, if the conversion efficiency from magnetic braking energy loss to radio emission is similar to that of isolated radio pulsars. Corresponding gamma-ray emission is difficult to detect by current or past gamma-ray burst satellites. Since FRBs tell us the exact time of mergers, a correlated search would significantly improve the effective sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/65.5.L12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202686","gravitational waves;radio continuum: general;binaries: general;stars: neutron","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The model leads to a new approach to solving optimal power flow (OPF) that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints. Part I introduces our branch flow model, explains the two relaxation steps, and proves the conditions for exact relaxation.

Here, the same technology may be used in very dirty environments and in a clean room manufacture. This paper reviews the development of simple factory automation (FA) IPT systems for both today's complex applications and onward to a much more challenging application—IPT roadway. The underpinning of all IPT technology is two strongly coupled coils operating at resonance to transfer power efficiently. Over time the air-gap, efficiency, coupling factor, and power transfer capability have significantly improved. New magnetic concepts are introduced to allow misalignment, enabling IPT systems to migrate from overhead monorails to the floor. However, the demands of IPT roadway bring about significant challenges. Here, compared with the best FA practice, air-gaps need to be 100 times larger, power levels greater than ten times, system losses ten times lower to meet efficiency requirements, and systems from different manufacturers must be interoperable over the full range of operation. This paper describes how roadway challenges are being met and outlines the problems that still exist and the solutions designers are finding to them.","2168-6785","","10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2264473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6517868","Inductive power transfer (IPT);roadway powered electric vehicles;strongly coupled magnetic resonance;wireless charging systems","Inductive power transmission;Magnetic resonance;Electric vehicles","","1010","9","93","Crown","21 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The wind turbine system (WTS) started with a few tens of kilowatt power in the 1980s. Now, multimegawatt wind turbines are widely installed even up to 6-8 MW. There is a widespread use of wind turbines in the distribution networks and more and more wind power stations, acting as power plants, are connected directly to the transmission networks. As the grid penetration and power level of the wind turbines increase steadily, the wind power starts to have significant impacts to the power grid system. Therefore, more advanced generators, power electronic systems, and control solutions have to be introduced to improve the characteristics of the wind power plant and make it more suitable to be integrated into the power grid. Meanwhile, there are also some emerging technology challenges, which need to be further clarified and investigated. This paper gives an overview and discusses some development trends in the technologies used for wind power systems. First, the developments of technology and market are generally discussed. Next, several state-of-the-art wind turbine concepts, as well as the corresponding power electronic converters and control structures, are reviewed, respectively.

Globally, the cloud fraction derived by the MODIS cloud mask is ~ 67%, with somewhat more clouds over land during the afternoon and less clouds over ocean in the afternoon, with very little difference in global cloud cover between Terra and Aqua. Overall, the cloud fraction over land is ~ 55%, with a distinctive seasonal cycle, whereas the ocean cloudiness is much higher, around 72%, with much reduced seasonal variation. Aqua and Terra have comparable zonal cloud top pressures, with Aqua having somewhat higher clouds (cloud top pressures lower by 100 hPa) over land due to afternoon deep convection. The coldest cloud tops (colder than 230 K) generally occur over Antarctica and the high clouds in the tropics. The cloud effective particle radius of liquid water clouds is significantly larger over ocean (mode 12-13 μm) than land (mode 10-11 μm), consistent with the variation in hygroscopic aerosol concentrations that provide cloud condensation nuclei necessary for cloud formation. We also find the effective radius to be 2-3 μm larger in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, likely reflecting differences in sources of cloud condensation nuclei.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2227333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422379","Aqua;cloud remote sensing;clouds;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);satellite applications;Terra;terrestrial atmosphere","Clouds;MODIS;Integrated optics;Optical sensors;Ice;Histograms;Satellites","","482","","58","IEEE","28 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new pan-sharpening method named Sparse F usion of Images (SparseFI, pronounced as “sparsify”). SparseFI is based on the compressive sensing theory and explores the sparse representation of HR/LR multispectral image patches in the dictionary pairs cotrained from the panchromatic image and its downsampled LR version. Compared with conventional methods, it “learns” from, i.e., adapts itself to, the data and has generally better performance than existing methods. Due to the fact that the SparseFI method does not assume any spectral composition model of the panchromatic image and due to the super-resolution capability and robustness of sparse signal reconstruction algorithms, it gives higher spatial resolution and, in most cases, less spectral distortion compared with the conventional methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2213604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6319382","Data fusion;dictionary training;pan-sharpening;SL1MMER;sparse coefficients estimation;Sparse Fusion of Images (SparseFI)","Image reconstruction;Spatial resolution;Image fusion;Data integration","","374","","22","IEEE","2 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the model enables the determination of the probability of receiving status and safety messages from all vehicles within a transmitter's range and vehicles up to a certain distance, respectively. The proposed model is built based on a new mobility model that takes into account the vehicle's follow-on safety rule to derive accurately the relationship between the average vehicle speed and density. Moreover, the model takes into consideration 1) the impact of mobility on the density of vehicles around the transmitter, 2) the impact of the transmitter's and receiver's speeds on the system reliability, 3) the impact of channel fading by modeling the communication range as a random variable, and 4) the hidden terminal problem and transmission collisions from neighboring vehicles. It is shown that the current specifications of the DSRC may lead to severe performance degradation in dense and high-mobility conditions. Therefore, an adaptive algorithm is introduced to increase system reliability in terms of the probability of successful reception of the packet and the delay of emergency messages in a harsh vehicular environment.

The first step eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints.

It exploits the time-variant phase noise model with insights into the phase noise conversion mechanisms. The proposed oscillator is based on enforcing a pseudo-square voltage waveform around the LC tank by increasing the third-harmonic of the fundamental oscillation voltage through an additional impedance peak. This auxiliary impedance peak is realized by a transformer with moderately coupled resonating windings. As a result, the effective impulse sensitivity function (ISF) decreases thus reducing the oscillator's effective noise factor such that a significant improvement in the oscillator phase noise and power efficiency are achieved. A comprehensive study of circuit-to-phase-noise conversion mechanisms of different oscillators' structures shows the proposed class-F exhibits the lowest phase noise at the same tank's quality factor and supply voltage. The prototype of the class-F oscillator is implemented in TSMC 65-nm standard CMOS. It exhibits average phase noise of -136 dBc/Hz at 3 MHz offset from the carrier over 5.9-7.6 GHz tuning range with figure-of-merit of 192 dBc/Hz.

The form of active compensation (e.g., series, shunt, back to back, multiterminal), quantity, and rating of the compensator should be chosen to realize the best cost-benefit ratio. Distributed-generator and compensator placement algorithms are used with a power-flow and constraint satisfaction algorithm to analyze a large number of case studies (using real U.K. network data). From these cases, assessments of compensator performance are made and summarized statistically. When considering incremental deployment across all networks, with the site of greatest benefit chosen at each increment, it is found that static synchronous compensators provide the most favorable cost-benefit ratio.

These applications use data from many satellites; for the data to be interoperable, the instruments must be cross-calibrated. To meet the stringent needs of such applications, instruments must provide reliable, accurate, and consistent measurements over time. Robust techniques are required to ensure that observations from different instruments can be normalized to a common scale that the community agrees on. The long-term reliability of this process needs to be sustained in accordance with established reference standards and best practices. Furthermore, establishing physical meaning to the information through robust Système International d'unités traceable calibration and validation (Cal/Val) is essential to fully understand the parameters under observation. The processes of calibration, correction, stability monitoring, and quality assurance need to be underpinned and evidenced by comparison with “peer instruments” and, ideally, highly calibrated in-orbit reference instruments. Intercalibration between instruments is a central pillar of the Cal/Val strategies of many national and international satellite remote sensing organizations. Intercalibration techniques as outlined in this paper not only provide a practical means of identifying and correcting relative biases in radiometric calibration between instruments but also enable potential data gaps between measurement records in a critical time series to be bridged. Use of a robust set of internationally agreed upon and coordinated intercalibration techniques will lead to significant improvement in the consistency between satellite instruments and facilitate accurate monitoring of the Earth's climate at uncertainty levels needed to detect and attribute the mechanisms of change. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art of postlaunch radiometric calibration of remote sensing satellite instruments through intercalibration.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2228654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6410022","Calibration;comparison;constellations;correction;cross-calibration;Earth Observing (EO) System;infrared;intercalibration;international collaboration;microwave;monitoring;radiometric calibration;reflective solar band (RSB);satellite;satellites;thermal infrared;traceability;validation;visible","Instruments;Calibration;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Measurement uncertainty;Uncertainty;Standards","","188","","240","IEEE","11 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting model, compatible with SPICE, is then used to understand trends in terms of switching times and energy consumption, which in turn are important for choosing device operating points and handling interactions with other circuit elements.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2013.2264476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542012","Crossbar;device dynamics;memristor;resistive memory (RRAM);SPICE","Memristors;Data models;Switches;Resistance;Voltage measurement;Integrated circuit modeling;Electrical resistance measurement","","186","","32","IEEE","17 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is considered a significant untraditional method of human computer interaction. Head movement detection has also received researchers' attention and interest as it has been found to be a simple and effective interaction method. Both technologies are considered the easiest alternative interface methods. They serve a wide range of severely disabled people who are left with minimal motor abilities. For both eye tracking and head movement detection, several different approaches have been proposed and used to implement different algorithms for these technologies. Despite the amount of research done on both technologies, researchers are still trying to find robust methods to use effectively in various applications. This paper presents a state-of-art survey for eye tracking and head movement detection methods proposed in the literature.

We find a clear advantage in using regularized discriminant analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines. No unique optimal classifier was found for all conditions tested, but we highlight the possibility of improving support vector machine classification with a better optimization of its free parameters. We also confirm that a combination of spectral and spatial information increases accuracy of species classification: we combine segmentation and species classification from regularized discriminant analysis to produce a map of the 17 discriminated species. Finally, we compare different methods to assess spectral separability and find a better ability of Bhattacharyya distance to assess separability within and among species. The results indicate that species mapping is tractable in tropical forests when using high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2199323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241414","Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO);hyperspectral imaging;image classification;tree species identification;tropical biodiversity","Vegetation;Training;Accuracy;Image segmentation;Measurement;Hyperspectral imaging;Imaging","","169","","66","IEEE","16 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We prove that this scheme is indistinguishable against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks under the bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion problem and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the $q$-strong Diffie-Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages. First, it achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in a logical single step. Second, it allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to an Internet host in a public key infrastructure. Third, it splits the signcryption into two phases: i) offline phase; and ii) online phase. In the offline phase, most heavy computations are done without the knowledge of a message. In the online phase, only light computations are done when a message is available.

Part I presents the theoretical background, algorithmic approaches and suitable examples to address challenges associated with the application of the mechanism and provides an implementation framework. Non-convexities in reschedulable demand participants' price response and their impacts on the ability of the basic LR structure to reach feasible market clearing solutions are identified and a simple yet effective LR heuristic method is developed to produce both feasible and high quality solutions by limiting the concentrated shift of reschedulable demand to the same low-priced time periods.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2245686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6510477","Demand side participation;electricity pool markets;Lagrangian relaxation","Power markets;Lagrangian functions;Electricity supply industry deregulation;Power system economics","","145","","28","IEEE","30 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A retrospective analysis on two public Holter databases was performed, analyzing the data of 12 patients suffering from mild CHF (NYHA I and II), labeled as lower risk, and 32 suffering from severe CHF (NYHA III and IV), labeled as higher risk. Only patients with a fraction of total heartbeats intervals (RR) classified as normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (NN/RR) higher than 80% were selected as eligible in order to have a satisfactory signal quality. Classification and regression tree (CART) was employed to develop the classifiers. A total of 30 higher risk and 11 lower risk patients were included in the analysis. The proposed classification trees achieved a sensitivity and a specificity rate of 93.3% and 63.6%, respectively, in identifying higher risk patients.

Since different sea ice types can have similar backscattering coefficients at C-band HH polarization, it is necessary to use textural features in addition to the backscattering coefficients. The analysis revealed that the most informative texture features for the classification of multiyear ice (MYI), deformed first-year ice (FYI) (DFYI), and level FYI (LFYI) and open water/nilas are correlation, inertia, cluster prominence, energy, homogeneity, and entropy, as well as third and fourth central statistical moments of image brightness. The optimal topology of the NN, trained for ENVISAT wide-swath SAR sea ice classification, consists of nine neurons in input layer, six neurons in hidden layer, and three neurons in output layer. The classification results for a series of 20 SAR images, acquired in the central part of the Arctic Ocean during winter months, were compared to expert analysis of the images and ice charts. The results of the NN classification show that the average correspondences with the expert analysis amount to 85 $\%$, 83$\%$, and 80$\%$ for LFYI, DFYI, and MYI, respectively. The Bayesian pixel-based method can provide a higher resolution in the classified image and, therefore, better capability to identify leads compared to the NN method.

HAI analyses would benefit from techniques that support investigating the possible combinations of system conditions and HAIs that might result in failures. Formal verification is a powerful technique used to mathematically prove that an appropriately scaled model of a system does or does not exhibit desirable properties. This paper discusses how formal verification has been used to evaluate HAI. It has been used to evaluate human-automation interfaces for usability properties and to find potential mode confusion. It has also been used to evaluate system safety properties in light of formally modeled task analytic human behavior. While capable of providing insights into problems associated with HAI, formal verification does not scale as well as other techniques such as simulation. However, advances in formal verification continue to address this problem, and approaches that allow it to complement more traditional analysis methods can potentially avoid this limitation.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2210406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6472094","Cognitive task analysis;formal methods;human performance modeling;human-automation interaction (HAI);mode confusion;model checking;theorem proving;verification","Automation;Analytical models;Usability;Object oriented modeling;Model checking;Interface states;Mathematical model","","137","","177","IEEE","7 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The micropositioning mechanism allows a needle to be positioned within a 22.5° segment of a cylindrical capsule and be extendible by up to 1.5 mm outside the capsule body. The mechanism achieves both these functions using only a single micromotor and occupying a total volume of just 200 mm3.

During this process, agents are exposed to the risk of being exploited by others. These risks, if not mitigated, can cause serious breakdowns in the operation of MASs and threaten their long-term wellbeing. To protect agents from the uncertainty in the behavior of their interaction partners, the age-old mechanism of trust between human beings is re-contexted into MASs. The basic idea is to let agents self-police the MAS by rating each other on the basis of their observed behavior and basing future interaction decisions on such information. Over the past decade, a large number of trust management models were proposed. However, there is a lack of research effort in several key areas, which are critical to the success of trust management in MASs where human beings and agents coexist. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of existing research in trust management in MASs. We analyze existing trust models from a game theoretic perspective to highlight the special implications of including human beings in an MAS, and propose a possible research agenda to advance the state of the art in this field.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2259892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514820","Game theory;multi-agent systems;reputation;trust","Game theory;Decision making;Uncertainty;Analytical models;Context awareness;Multi-agent systems;Computational modeling;Trust management","","133","","105","OAPA","10 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for their widespread adoption, two important issues need to be addressed: the lack of diversity in multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems, and the small field of view of receivers. In this paper, we describe a design using a hemispherical lens in the receiver that solves these problems. By using classical optics, we derive exact expressions for the channel gain and the optical power density of the projected images. Simulation results of a typical indoor scenario show that the new system has a wide field of view, and provides adequate channel gain for angles of incidence as large as 70 degrees. We present the distribution of optical power on the imaging plane for various receiving positions and tilted receivers over a number of representative indoor scenarios. They show that the images of LEDs are clearly distinguishable. The results demonstrate the presence of low channel correlations between individual transmitters and receivers. Consequently, this confirms that the new technique is capable of providing significant diversity order for MIMO optical wireless applications.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2013.2257685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497451","Diversity;field of view;hemispherical lens;imaging receiver;intensity modulation and direct detection;MIMO;optical wireless communications;visible light communications","Light emitting diodes;Photodetectors;Lenses;Optical imaging;Optical receivers","","130","1","24","IEEE","12 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The great tsunami induced by the earthquake of March 11th, 2011, which occurred beneath the Pacific off the northeastern coast of Japan, is adopted as the study case using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar multitemporal PolSAR images. The polarimetric scattering mechanism changes were quantitatively examined with model-based decomposition. It is clear that the observed reduction in the double-bounce scattering was due to a change into odd-bounce scattering, since a number of buildings were completely washed away, leaving relatively a rough surface. Polarization orientation (PO) angles in built-up areas are also investigated. After the tsunami, PO angle distributions from damaged areas spread to a wider range and fluctuated more strongly than those from the before-tsunami period. Two polarimetric indicators are proposed for damage level discrimination at the city block scale. One is the ratio of the dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism observed after-tsunami to that observed before-tsunami, which can directly reflect the amount of destroyed ground-wall structures in built-up areas. The second indicator is the standard deviation of the PO angle differences, which is used to interpret the homogeneity reduction of PO angles. Experimental results from after- and before-tsunami comparisons validate the efficiency of these indexes, since the built-up areas with different damage levels can be well discriminated. In addition, comparisons between before-tsunami pairs further confirm the stability of the two polarimetric indexes over a long temporal duration. These interesting results also demonstrate the importance of full polarimetric information for natural disaster assessment.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2210050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6353568","Damage assessment;model-based decomposition;natural disaster;polarimetry;polarization orientation angle;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);urban area","Scattering;Tsunami;Buildings;Synthetic aperture radar;Urban areas;Spaceborne radar;Earthquakes","","127","","62","IEEE","15 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The increased effective barrier heights of AlGaInN thin barrier led to suppression of carrier leakage as compared to conventional InGaN QW LEDs with GaN barrier only. The current work provides a comprehensive simulation taking into consideration the carrier transport in self-consistent manner, and the finding indicated the use of thin layers of AlGaInN or AlInN barriers as sufficient for suppressing the droop in InGaN-based QW LEDs.

Examples are given for the Meteosat, GOES, MTSAT, Fengyun-2, and COMS imagers. Some channels of these instruments show biases that vary with time due to variations in the thermal environment, stray light, and optical contamination. These results demonstrate how inter-calibration can be a powerful tool to monitor and correct biases, and help diagnose their root causes.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2238544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450081","Calibration;earth observing system;infrared image sensors;international collaboration;meteorology;satellites","Instruments;Low earth orbit satellites;Calibration;Uncertainty;Monitoring;Meteorology","","112","","30","IEEE","5 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Problematically, recent reports have revealed incidents of energy theft in which dishonest customers would lower their electricity bills (aka stealing electricity) by tampering with their meters. The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection. A hybrid detection framework is developed to detect anomalous and malicious activities by incorporating our proposed grid sensor placement algorithm with observability analysis to increase the detection rate. Our simulations have shown that the network observability and detection accuracy can be improved by means of grid-placed sensor deployment.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2274043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6563147","Smart grid;cyber-physical security;state estimation;false data injection attack;energy theft;intrusion detection;sensor placement;observability","State estimation;Power measurement;Smart grids;Current measurement;Network security;Network topology;Real-time systems;Smart meters;Energy management;Sensors","","110","","51","IEEE","18 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Nanomag-MIP particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 106 nm show an increase of the MPS amplitude by a factor of about two at the 3rd harmonic, as compared to Resovist. In particular, the signal improves progressively with the order of the harmonic, a prerequisite for better spatial resolution. To understand this behavior, we investigated the samples using quasistatic magnetization measurements yielding bimodal size distributions for both systems, and magnetorelaxometry providing the mean effective anisotropy constant. The mean effective magnetic diameter of the dominant larger size mode is 19 nm with a dispersion parameter of σ = 0.3 for Nanomag-MIP, and 22 nm with σ = 0.25 for Resovist. However, about 80% of the magnetic nanoparticles of Nanomag-MIP belong to this larger size mode whereas in Resovist only 30% do.

Also, a torque equation, which shows the relation between the ripple and the negative sequence current, is derived. The negative sequence current should be suppressed to eliminate the torque ripple. The dual current controller is utilized for this purpose: in the dual controller, the positive and negative sequences are controlled separately in their own synchronous frames. Notch filters are utilized in each synchronous frame to extract positive or negative sequence component.

A net spectral efficiency (SE) of 8.25 b/s/Hz was achieved, after excluding the 20% soft-decision forward-error-correction (FEC) overhead. Such a result was accomplished by the use of a recently proposed polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) time-domain hybrid 32-64 quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) format, along with improved carrier frequency and phase recovery algorithms. It is shown that time-domain hybrid QAM provides a new degree of design freedom to optimize the transmission performance by fine tuning the SE of the modulation format for a specific channel bandwidth and FEC redundancy requirement. In terms of carrier recovery, we demonstrate that 1) hardware efficient estimation and tracking of the frequency offset between the signal and local-oscillator (LO) can be achieved by using a new feedback-based method, and 2) a training-assisted two-stage phase estimation algorithm effectively mitigates cyclic phase slipping problems. This new phase recovery algorithm not only improves the receiver sensitivity by eliminating the need for differential coding and decoding, but also enables an additional equalization stage following the phase recovery. We have shown that the introduction of this additional equalization stage (with larger number of taps) helps reduce the implementation penalty. This paper also presents the first experimental study of the impact of inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) correlation for a high-order QAM. It is shown that an adaptive equalizer could exploit the correlation between I and Q signal components to artificially boost the performance by up to 0.7 dB for a PDM time-domain hybrid 32-64 QAM signal when the equalizer length is significantly longer than I/Q de-correlation delay.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2013.2243643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422318","Coherent;equalization;fiber;frequency recovery;hybrid QAM;modulation format;optical transmission;phase recovery;QAM;spectral efficiency","Quadrature amplitude modulation;Wavelength division multiplexing;Time domain analysis;Bandwidth;Time division multiplexing;Optical noise;Signal to noise ratio","","107","12","24","IEEE","28 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Along with such data explosion is the fast-growing trend to outsource the image management systems to the cloud for its abundant computing resources and benefits. How to protect the sensitive data while enabling outsourced image services, however, becomes a major concern. To address these challenges, we propose outsourced image recovery service (OIRS), a novel outsourced image recovery service architecture, which exploits different domain technologies and takes security, efficiency, and design complexity into consideration from the very beginning of the service flow. Specifically, we choose to design OIRS under the compressed sensing framework, which is known for its simplicity of unifying the traditional sampling and compression for image acquisition. Data owners only need to outsource compressed image samples to cloud for reduced storage overhead. In addition, in OIRS, data users can harness the cloud to securely reconstruct images without revealing information from either the compressed image samples or the underlying image content. We start with the OIRS design for sparse data, which is the typical application scenario for compressed sensing, and then show its natural extension to the general data for meaningful tradeoffs between efficiency and accuracy. We thoroughly analyze the privacy-protection of OIRS and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the system effectiveness and efficiency. For completeness, we also discuss the expected performance speedup of OIRS through hardware built-in system design.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2273797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562794","Compressed sensing;security and privacy;cloud computing;image reconstruction","Image reconstruction;Image coding;Compressed sensing;Outsourcing;Cryptography;Context awareness;Network security","","100","","32","IEEE","17 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each input channel is modeled in three different ways. First it is modeled as an ideal transmission system together with an additive norm bounded uncertainty, introducing a multiplicative uncertainty to the plant. Then it is modeled as an ideal transmission system together with a feedback norm bounded uncertainty, introducing a relative uncertainty to the plant. Finally it is modeled as an additive white Gaussian noise channel. For each of these models, we properly define the capacity of each channel whose sum yields the total capacity of all input channels. We aim at finding the least total channel capacity for stabilization. Different from the single-input case that is available in the literature and boils down to a typical H∞ or H2 optimal control problem, the multi-input case involves allocation of the total capacity among the input channels in addition to the design of the feedback controller. The overall process of channel resource allocation and the controller design can be considered as a case of channel-controller co-design which gives rise to modified nonconvex optimization problems. Surprisingly, the modified nonconvex optimization problems, though appear more complicated, can be solved analytically. The main results of this paper can be summarized into a universal theorem: The state feedback stabilization can be accomplished by the channel-controller co-design, if and only if the total input channel capacity is greater than the topological entropy of the open-loop system.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2012.2218065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298000","Channel resource allocation;Mahler measure;networked control system;networked stabilization;topological entropy","Channel models;Uncertainty;Channel capacity;State feedback;Quantization;Entropy;Signal to noise ratio","","96","","48","IEEE","10 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A challenge in validating albedo measurements acquired from space is the ability to overcome the spatial scaling errors that can produce disagreements between satellite and field-measured values. Here, we present the results from an accuracy assessment of MODIS and Landsat-TM albedo retrievals, based on collocated comparisons with tower and airborne Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) measurements collected during the 2007 Cloud and Land Surface Interaction Campaign (CLASIC). The initial focus was on evaluating inter-sensor consistency through comparisons of intrinsic bidirectional reflectance estimates. Local and regional assessments were then performed to obtain estimates of the resulting scaling uncertainties, and to establish the accuracy of albedo reconstructions during extended periods of precipitation. In general, the satellite-derived estimates met the accuracy requirements established for the high-quality MODIS operational albedos at 500 m (the greater of 0.02 units or ±10% of surface measured values). However, results reveal a high degree of variability in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and bias of MODIS visible (0.3-0.7 μm) and Landsat-TM shortwave (0.3-5.0 μm) albedos; where, in some cases, retrieval uncertainties were found to be in excess of 15 %. Results suggest that an overall improvement in MODIS shortwave albedo retrieval accuracy of 7.8%, based on comparisons between MODIS and CAR albedos, resulted from the removal of sub-grid scale mismatch errors when directly scaling-up the tower measurements to the MODIS satellite footprint.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2243457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461935","Biosphere;ecosystems;land surface;remote sensing","Satellites;MODIS;Remote sensing;Earth;Poles and towers;Clouds;Land surface","","94","","53","IEEE","14 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper provides a quantitative estimation of temporal decorrelation effects at L-band for a wide range of temporal baselines based on a unique set of multibaseline Pol-InSAR data. A new methodology that allows to quantify individual temporal decorrelation components has been developed and applied. Temporal decorrelation coefficients are estimated for temporal baselines ranging from 10 min to 54 days and converted to height inversion errors caused by them. The temporal decorrelations of γTV (volume temporal decorrelation) and γTG (ground temporal decorrelation) depend not only on the wind-induced movement but also strongly on the rain-induced dielectric changes in volume and on the ground at temporal baseline on the order of day or longer. At temporal baselines on the order of minutes, the wind speed is a critical parameter and the speed of 2 m/s already hampers the application of Pol-InSAR forest parameter inversion. The approach is supported and validated by using L-band E-SAR repeat-pass data acquired in the frame of three dedicated campaigns, BioSAR 2007, TempoSAR 2008, and TempoSAR 2009.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2253448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509461","Height inversion;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry (Pol-InSAR);temporal baseline;temporal decorrelation","Decorrelation;Coherence;Solid modeling;L-band;Dielectrics;Synthetic aperture radar","","93","","17","IEEE","26 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, its application to the analysis of soft cardiovascular tissues has been limited by poor inter-tissue contrast. Recent ex vivo studies have shown that contrast between muscular and connective tissue in micro-CT images can be enhanced by staining with iodine. In the present study, we apply this novel technique for imaging of cardiovascular structures in canine hearts. We optimize the method to obtain high-resolution X-ray micro-CT images of the canine atria and its distinctive regions—including the Bachmann's bundle, atrioventricular node, pulmonary arteries and veins—with clear inter-tissue contrast. The imaging results are used to reconstruct and segment the detailed 3-D geometry of the atria. Structure tensor analysis shows that the arrangement of atrial fibers can also be characterized using the enhanced micro-CT images, as iodine preferentially accumulates within the muscular fibers rather than in connective tissues. This novel technique can be particularly useful in nondestructive imaging of 3-D cardiac architectures from large animals and humans, due to the combination of relatively high speed ($\sim$ 1 h/per scan of the large canine heart) and high voxel resolution (36 $\mu{\rm m}$) provided. In summary, contrast micro-CT facilitates fast and nondestructive imaging and segmenting of detailed 3-D cardiovascular geometries, as well as measuring fiber orientation, which are crucial in constructing biophysically detailed computational cardiac models.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2012.2209183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6242415","Animal models and imaging;heart;tissue modelling;X-ray imaging and computed tomography","Image reconstruction;Optical fiber cables;Image segmentation;Heart;Geometry;Biomedical imaging","Animals;Contrast Media;Coronary Vessels;Dogs;Female;Heart;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Iodine Compounds;Models, Cardiovascular;X-Ray Microtomography","93","","47","IEEE","17 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An example based on a generic 100 wind turbine 5-MW wind farm is used to demonstrate the application of the model. The results show the benefit of the production losses of the different options, which enables the identification of an optimal maintenance support organization based on the reliability, logistic costs, and electricity price. The most cost-efficient maintenance support organization in the case study consists of an offshore accommodation with technicians on service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Solving this problem necessitates: 1) estimation of the wireless propagation environment to identify viable point-to-point communication links; 2) determination of end-to-end routes to support data traffic; and 3) motion control algorithms to navigate through spatial configurations that guarantee required minimum levels of service. Therefore, we present methods for: 1) estimation of point-to-point channels using pathloss and spatial Gaussian process models; 2) data routing so as to determine suitable end-to-end communication routes given estimates of point-to-point channel rates; and 3) motion planning to determine robot trajectories restricted to configurations that ensure survival of the communication network. Because of the inherent uncertainty of wireless channels, the model of links and routes is stochastic. The criteria for route selection is to maximize the probability of network survival—defined as the ability to support target communication rates—given achievable rates on local point-to-point links. Maximum survival probability routes for present and future positions are input into a mobility control module that determines robot trajectories restricted to configurations that ensure the probability of network survival stays above a minimum reliability level. Local trajectory planning is proposed for simple environments and global planning is proposed for complex surroundings. The three proposed components are integrated and tested in experiments run in two different environments. Experimental results show successful navigation with continuous end-to-end connectivity.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2262013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514922","Routing protocols;path planning;wireless networks;autonomous agents","Routing;Wireless communication;Trajectory;Robot kinematics;Planning;Shadow mapping","","92","","41","OAPA","10 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is based on interpretations of the main relief markers and interpolation of a stratigraphic property on a tetahedral mesh covering the domain of study. The tetrahedral mesh provides a convenient way to integrate available data during the interpolation while accounting for discontinuities such as faults.

However, since tumor sections are collected from different laboratories, inherent technical and biological variations impede analysis for very large datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our objective is to characterize tumor histopathology, through the delineation of the nuclear regions, from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections. Such a representation can then be mined for intrinsic subtypes across a large dataset for prediction and molecular association. Furthermore, nuclear segmentation is formulated within a multi-reference graph framework with geodesic constraints, which enables computation of multidimensional representations, on a cell-by-cell basis, for functional enrichment and bioinformatics analysis. Here, we present a novel method, multi-reference graph cut (MRGC), for nuclear segmentation that overcomes technical variations associated with sample preparation by incorporating prior knowledge from manually annotated reference images and local image features. The proposed approach has been validated on manually annotated samples and then applied to a dataset of 377 Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) whole slide images from 146 patients. For the GBM cohort, multidimensional representation of the nuclear features and their organization have identified 1) statistically significant subtypes based on several morphometric indexes, 2) whether each subtype can be predictive or not, and 3) that the molecular correlates of predictive subtypes are consistent with the literature. Data and intermediaries for a number of tumor types (GBM, low grade glial, and kidney renal clear carcinoma) are available at: http://tcga.lbl.gov for correlation with TCGA molecular data. The website also provides an interface for panning and zooming of whole mount tissue sections with/without overlaid segmentation results for quality control.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2012.2231420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6374258","Molecular pathology;nuclear segmentation;subtyping;tumor histopathology","Image color analysis;Tumors;Image segmentation;Bioinformatics;Computer architecture;Laboratories;Genomics","Algorithms;Brain Neoplasms;Brain Neoplasms;Cell Nucleus;Coloring Agents;Databases, Factual;Eosine Yellowish-(YS);Fluorescent Dyes;Glioblastoma;Glioblastoma;Hematoxylin;Histocytochemistry;Humans;Staining and Labeling","89","1","55","IEEE","4 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the smart grid, demand-side management (DSM) based on real-time pricing is an important mechanism for improving the reliability of the grid. Electricity retailers in the smart grid can procure electricity from various supply sources, and then sell it to the customers. Therefore, it is critical for retailers to make effective procurement and price decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretical decision-making scheme for electricity retailers in the smart grid using real-time pricing DSM. We model and analyze the interactions between the retailer and electricity customers as a four-stage Stackelberg game. In the first three stages, the electricity retailer, as the Stackelberg leader, makes decisions on which electricity sources to procure electricity from, how much electricity to procure, and the optimal retail price to offer to the customers, to maximize its profit. In the fourth stage, the customers, who are the followers in the Stackelberg game, adjust their individual electricity demand to maximize their individual utility. Simulation results show that the retailer and customers can achieve a higher profit and higher utility using our proposed decision-making scheme. We also analyze how the system parameters affect the procurement and price decisions in the proposed decision-making scheme.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2273457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560392","Cyber-physical systems;smart grid;demand-side management;real-time pricing","Electricity;Real-time systems;Smart grids;Pricing;Supply and demand;Procurement;Decision making;Marketing management;Power markets","","86","","34","IEEE","16 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper demonstrates for the first time to our knowledge, a real-time implementation of the LM algorithm on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). It was used to train neural networks to solve the eXclusive Or function (XOR), and for 3D-to-2D camera calibration parameter estimation. A Xilinx Virtex-5 ML506 was used to implement the LMA as a hardware-in-the-loop system. The XOR function was approximated in only 13 iterations from zero initial conditions, usually the same function is approximated in thousands of iterations using the error backpropagation algorithm. Also, this type of training not only reduced the number of iterations but also achieved a speed up in excess of 3 ×106 when compared to the software implementation. A real-time camera calibration and parameter estimation was performed successfully on FPGAs. Compared to the software implementation the FPGA implementation led to an increase in the mean squared error and standard deviation by only 17.94% and 8.04% respectively. The FPGA increased the calibration speed by a factor of 1.41 × 106. There are a wide range of systems problems solved via nonlinear parameter optimization, this study demonstrated that a hardware solution for systems such as automated optical inspection systems or systems dealing with projective geometry estimation and motion compensation systems in robotic vision systems is possible in real time.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2183833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6129410","Artificial intelligence;camera calibration;embedded;estimation;FPGA;hardware-in-the-loop;Levenberg–Marquardt;machine learning;mapping;neural networks;nonlinear;on-chip learning;online learning;optical inspection;projective geometry;supervised learning;systems;XOR","Field programmable gate arrays;Cameras;Software;Hardware;Calibration;Training;Optimization","","85","","27","CCBY","11 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Twenty desert sites, historically selected, are revisited, and their radiometric profiles are described for the visible to the near-infrared spectral domain. Therefore, acquisitions by various sensors over these desert sites are collected into a dedicated database, Structure d'Accueil des Données d'Etalonnage, defined to manage operational calibrations and the required SI traceability. The cross-calibration method over desert sites is detailed. Surface reflectances are derived from measurements by a reference sensor and spectrally interpolated to derive the surface and then top-of-atmosphere reflectances for spectral bands of the sensor to calibrate. The comparison with reflectances really measured provides an estimation of the cross calibration between the two sensors. Results illustrate the efficiency of the method for various pairs of sensors among AQUA-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Environmental Satellite-Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectance for Atmospheric Sciences Couples With Observations From a Lidar (PARASOL)-Polarization and Directionality of the Earth Reflectances (POLDER), and Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT5)-VEGETATION. MERIS and MODIS calibrations are found to be very consistent, with a discrepancy of 1%, which is close to the accuracy of the method. A larger bias of 3% was identified between VEGETATION-PARASOL on one hand and MERIS-MODIS on the other hand. A good consistency was found between sites, with a standard deviation of 2% for red to near-infrared bands, increasing to 4% and 6% for green and blue bands, respectively. The accuracy of the method, which is close to 1%, may also depend on the spectral bands of both sensor to calibrate and reference sensor (up to 5% in the worst case) and their corresponding geometrical matching.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2227061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6410413","Calibration;radiometry;remote sensing;spectral analysis","Sensors;Calibration;Standards;MODIS;Atmospheric measurements;Satellites","","84","","35","IEEE","14 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

WBANs could operate in dense environments such as in a hospital and lead to a high mutual communication interference in many application scenarios. The excessive interferences will significantly degrade the network performance, including depleting the energy of WBAN nodes more quickly and even eventually jeopardize people's lives because of unreliable (caused by the interference) healthcare data collections. Therefore, it is critical to mitigate the interference among WBANs to increase the reliability of the WBAN system while minimizing the system power consumption. Many existing approaches can deal with communication interference mitigation in general wireless networks but are not suitable for WBANs because of ignoring the social nature of WBANs by them. Unlike the previous research, we for the first time propose a power game based approach to mitigate the communication interferences for WBANs based on the people's social interaction information. Our major contributions include: 1) modeling the inter-WBANs interference and determine the distance distribution of the interference through both theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations; 2) developing social interaction detection and prediction algorithms for people carrying WBANs; and 3) developing a power control game based on the social interaction information to maximize the system's utility while minimize the energy consumption of WBANs system. The extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of the power control game for inter-WBAN interference mitigation using social interaction information. Our research opens a new research vista of WBANs using social networks.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2274430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567906","Wireless body area networks (WBANs);inter-network interference mitigation;power control;game theory","Interference;Power control;Body area networks;Wireless communication;Bluetooth;Acoustic waves;Social network services;Game theory;Power system control","","83","","38","IEEE","24 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The quadrotor UAV is an underactuated rigid body with four propellers that generate forces along the rotor axes. These four forces are used to achieve asymptotic tracking of four outputs, namely the position of the center of mass of the UAV and the heading. With perfect knowledge of plant parameters and no measurement noise, the magnitudes of the errors are shown to exponentially converge to zero. In the case of parametric uncertainty and measurement noise, the controller yields an exponential decrease of the magnitude of the errors in an $L_{1}$ -optimal sense. In other words, the controller is designed so that it minimizes the $L_{\infty}$ -gain of the plant with respect to disturbances. The performance of the controller is evaluated in experiments and compared with that of a related robust nonlinear controller in the literature. The experimental data shows that the proposed controller rejects persistent disturbances, which is quantified by a very small magnitude of the mean error.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6515079","Feedback linearization;optimal control;quadrotor;robust control;unmanned aerial vehicle","Mathematical model;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Robustness;Feedback;Aerospace electronics;Optimal control;Computational modeling;Robust control;Rotors","","80","","31","OAPA","10 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The facilitation of such a vision faces many challenges in terms of inter operability, resource management, and pricing. In this paper, we present a priced PS framework for IoT architectures. Our framework caters for service-based applications in smart cities where data is provided via a data cloud of multifarious data sources. We propose online heuristics for public data delivery in smart city settings. We also introduce a pricing utility function for data acquisition. Our pricing function considers resource limitations in terms of delay, capacity and lifetime on the data providers' side, as well as user's quality and trust requirements from the requesters' side.

Consider, for example, artifacts due to acoustic reverberation and background noise. The acoustic reverberation depends on the shape and the composition of a room, and it causes temporal and spectral smearing of the recorded sound. The background noise, on the other hand, depends on the secondary audio source activities present in the evidentiary recording. Extraction of acoustic cues from an audio recording is an important but challenging task. Temporal changes in the estimated reverberation and background noise can be used for dynamic acoustic environment identification (AEI), audio forensics, and ballistic settings. We describe a statistical technique to model and estimate the amount of reverberation and background noise variance in an audio recording. An energy-based voice activity detection method is proposed for automatic decaying-tail-selection from an audio recording. Effectiveness of the proposed method is tested using a data set consisting of speech recordings.

We present a blind method for color decomposition of histological images. The method decouples intensity from color information and bases the decomposition only on the tissue absorption characteristics of each stain. By modeling the charge-coupled device sensor noise, we improve the method accuracy. We extend current linear decomposition methods to include stained tissues where one spectral signature cannot be separated from all combinations of the other tissues' spectral signatures. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that our method results in more accurate decompositions than methods based on non-negative matrix factorization and independent component analysis. The result is one density map for each stained tissue type that classifies portions of pixels into the correct stained tissue allowing accurate identification of morphological features that may be linked to cancer.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2013.2239655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6410037","Blind source separation;gastrointestinal tract;image restoration;microscopy;prostate;quantification","Image color analysis;Colored noise;Microscopy;Absorption;Vectors;Educational institutions","Algorithms;Histocytochemistry;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Poisson Distribution;Reproducibility of Results;Stomach","76","9","40","OAPA","11 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The latter one contains relay nodes for communication and operation centers to control power grid. Failure in one network might cause failures in the other. In addition, these failures may occur recursively between the two networks, leading to cascading failures. We propose a k-to- n interdependence model for smart grid. Each relay node and operation center is supported by only one power station, while each power station is monitored and controlled by k operation centers. Each operation center controls n power stations. We show that the system controlling cost is proportional to k. Through calculating the fraction of functioning parts (survival ratio) using percolation theory and generating functions, we reveal the nonlinear relation between controlling cost and system robustness, and use graphic solution to prove that a threshold exists for the proportion of faulty nodes, beyond which the system collapses. The extensive simulations validate our analysis, determine the percentage of survivals and the critical values for different system parameters. The mathematical and experimental results show that smart grid with higher controlling cost has a sharper transition, and thus is more robust.

"Unified Blind Method for Multi-Image Super-Resolution and Single/Multi-Image Blur Deconvolution","E. Faramarzi; D. Rajan; M. P.

The proposed approach is based on alternating minimization (AM) of a new cost function with respect to the unknown high-resolution (HR) image and blurs. The regularization term for the HR image is based upon the Huber-Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a type of variational integral that exploits the piecewise smooth nature of the HR image. The blur estimation process is supported by an edge-emphasizing smoothing operation, which improves the quality of blur estimates by enhancing strong soft edges toward step edges, while filtering out weak structures. The parameters are updated gradually so that the number of salient edges used for blur estimation increases at each iteration. For better performance, the blur estimation is done in the filter domain rather than the pixel domain, i.e., using the gradients of the LR and HR images. The regularization term for the blur is Gaussian (L2 norm), which allows for fast noniterative optimization in the frequency domain. We accelerate the processing time of SR reconstruction by separating the upsampling and registration processes from the optimization procedure. Simulation results on both synthetic and real-life images (from a novel computational imager) confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2013.2237915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408136","Blind estimation;blur deconvolution;Huber-Markov Random Field (HMRF) prior;image restoration;super-resolution","Image edge detection;Estimation;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Smoothing methods;Optimization;Noise","Algorithms;Animals;Computer Simulation;Diagnostic Imaging;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Markov Chains;Phantoms, Imaging;Photography","73","2","45","IEEE","9 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The GPM mission strategy is to measure precipitation globally with high temporal resolution by using a constellation of satellite radiometers logically united by the GPM core satellite, which will be in a non-sun-synchronous medium inclination orbit. The usefulness of the combined product depends on the consistency of precipitation retrievals from the various microwave radiometers. The Tb calibration requirement to achieve such consistency demands first that Tb's from the individual radiometers be free of instrument and measurement artifacts and, second, that these self-consistent Tb's will be translated to a common standard (GPM core) for the unification of the precipitation retrieval. The intersatellite radiometric calibration technique described herein serves both the purposes by comparing individual radiometer observations to radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations (for “self-consistency” check) and by using a double-difference technique (to establish a linear calibration transfer function from one radiometer to another). This double-difference technique subtracts the RTM-simulated difference from the observed difference between a pair of radiometer Tb's. To establish a linear inter-radiometer calibration transfer function, comparisons at both the cold (ocean) and the warm (land) end of the Tb's are necessary so that, using these two points, slope and offset coefficients are determined. To this end, a simplified calibration transfer technique at the warm end (over the Amazon and Congo rain forest) is introduced. Finally, an error model is described that provides an estimate of the uncertainty of the radiometric bias estimate between comparison radiometer channels.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2217148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6340324","Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Intersatellite Radiometer Calibration Working Group (XCAL);intersatellite radiometric calibration;microwave radiometry","Microwave radiometry;Calibration;Atmospheric modeling;Ocean temperature;Instruments;Brightness temperature","","72","","43","IEEE","25 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This set of emotional states is widely used for emotion recognition purposes. It also distinguishes a single emotion versus all the other possible ones, as proven in the proposed numerical results. The system is composed of two subsystems: 1) gender recognition(GR) and 2) emotion recognition(ER). The experimental analysis shows the performance in terms of accuracy of the proposed ER system. The results highlight that the a priori knowledge of the speaker's gender allows a performance increase.

It is widely used in many fields such as image retrieval, image denoising, image authentication, and encryption. FIC, however, suffers from the high computational complexity in encoding. Although many schemes are published to speed up encoding, they do not easily satisfy the encoding time or the reconstructed image quality requirements. In this paper, a new FIC scheme is proposed based on the fact that the affine similarity between two blocks in FIC is equivalent to the absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient (APCC) between them. First, all blocks in the range and domain pools are chosen and classified using an APCC-based block classification method to increase the matching probability. Second, by sorting the domain blocks with respect to APCCs between these domain blocks and a preset block in each class, the matching domain block for a range block can be searched in the selected domain set in which these APCCs are closer to APCC between the range block and the preset block. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can significantly speed up the encoding process in FIC while preserving the reconstructed image quality well.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2013.2268977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542017","Fractal image compression;Pearson's correlation coefficient;block classification;block sorting","Image coding;Fractals;Correlation;Image reconstruction;Encoding;Sorting;Image quality","","70","","27","IEEE","17 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A polarimetric synthetic aperture radar may have a significant contribution in tackling problems concerning land use change, since such data are available with any-weather conditions. Additionally, the discrimination capability can be enhanced by the polarimetric analysis. Recently, an algorithm able to identify targets scattering an electromagnetic wave with any degree of polarization has been developed, which makes use of a vector rearrangement of the elements of the coherency matrix. In the present work, this target detector is modified to perform change detection between two polarimetric acquisitions, for land use monitoring purposes. Regarding the selection of the detector parameters, a physical rationale is followed, developing a new parameterization of the algebraic space where the detector is defined. As it will be illustrated in the following, this space is 6-D complex with restrictions due to the physical feasibility of the vectors. Specifically, a link between the detector parameters and the angle differences of the eigenvector model is obtained. Moreover, a dual polarimetric version of the change detector is developed, in case quad-polarimetric data are not available. With the purpose of testing the methodology, a variety of data sets were exploited: quad-polarimetric airborne data at L-band (E-SAR), quad-polarimetric satellite data at C-band (Radarsat-2), and dual-polarimetric satellite data at X-band (TerraSAR-X). The algorithm results show agreement with the available information about land changes. Moreover, a comparison with a known change detector based on the maximum likelihood ratio is presented, providing improvements in some conditions. The two methodologies differ in the analysis of the total amplitude of the backscattering, where the proposed algorithm does not take this into consideration.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2211883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310048","Change detection;polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Algorithm design and analysis;Synthetic aperture radar;Scattering;Thyristors;Covariance matrix;Radar polarimetry;Change detection algorithms","","69","","21","IEEE","21 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The survey also indicates a significant interest in, and willingness to pay for, public sector information data from companies that do not intend to commercialize data themselves but intend to use it to support or test other business models. From the survey, it is possible to infer that the previous discourse on open data, viewing it as a means for government accountability or e-government, or as the foundation for the commercialization of public sector information data is too limited. Open data should instead be seen as an enabler of innovation outside these traditional sectors.

A by-product is so-called the Water Indication Mask (WAM). The purpose of this supplementary information layer is to support the DEM editing process. Water surfaces usually show lower coherence in an interferometric data set due to temporal de-correlation and low backscattering. Consequently the corresponding elevation values derived from the interferogram are random and produce a virtual relief. This paper introduces the operational water body detection workflow that synergistically evaluates amplitude and coherence information. The presented results of two test sites reveal that the methodology is globally applicable, classifications are highly accurate and the algorithm is appropriate for operational image processing. The water body detection consists of two steps: the Water Body Detection (WBD) derived of one single DEM scene and the mosaicking of multiple WBD to a single Water Indication Mask (WAM). The fusion strategy for the final TanDEM-X WAM considers all WBD acquired at different times in two global coverages and bases on a fusion by union containing the results of the amplitude and the coherence.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2210999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6303842","Amplitude;coherence;DEM editing;TanDEM-X;water body detection","Coherence;Synthetic aperture radar;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Backscatter;Lakes;Land surface","","64","","31","IEEE","14 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to securely retrieve and audit the communicated metering data for validation testing is, however, still challenging for smart grid. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query (PaRQ) scheme over encrypted metering data to address the privacy issues in financial auditing for smart grid. Our PaRQ allows a residential user to store metering data on a cloud server in an encrypted form. When financial auditing is needed, an authorized requester can send its range query tokens to the cloud server to retrieve the metering data. Specifically, the PaRQ constructs a hidden vector encryption based range query predicate to encrypt the searchable attributes and session keys of the encrypted data. Meanwhile, the requester's range query can be transferred into two query tokens, which are used to find the matched query results. Security analysis demonstrates that in the PaRQ, only the authorized requesters can obtain the query results, while the data confidentiality and query privacy are also preserved. The simulation results show that our PaRQ can significantly reduce communication and computation costs.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2273889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566055","Range query;privacy;smart grid;encrypted data;metering data","Privacy;Meter reading;Smart grids;Encryption;Data privacy;Query processing;Real-time systems","","63","","30","IEEE","23 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Validation was performed using synthetic, phantom, and 14 clinical datasets, including the publicly available DIR-Lab dataset. We show that motion discontinuities caused by sliding can be effectively recovered, unlike conventional regularizations that enforce globally smooth motion. In the clinical datasets, target registration error showed improved accuracy for lung landmarks compared to the diffusive regularization.

Eight-date multiangle ENVISAT ASAR images and one-date HJ-1B charge-coupled device image acquired over Beijing in 2009 are selected for this research. The edge-aware region growing and merging (EARGM) algorithm is developed for segmentation of SAR and optical data. Edge detection using a Sobel filter is applied on SAR and optical data individually, and a majority voting approach is used to integrate all edge images. The edges are then used in a segmentation process to ensure that segments do not grow over edges. The segmentation is influenced by minimum and maximum segment sizes as well as the two homogeneity criteria, namely, a measure of color and a measure of texture. The classification is performed using support vector machines. The results show that our EARGM algorithm produces better segmentation than eCognition, particularly for built-up classes and linear features. The best classification result (80%) is achieved using the fusion of eight-date ENVISAT ASAR and HJ-1B data. This represents 5%, 11%, and 14% improvements over eCognition, HJ-1B, and ASAR classifications, respectively. The second best classification is achieved using fusion of four-date ENVISAT ASAR and HJ-1B data (78%).

To quantify the uncertainties of the desired quantities without changing the deterministic model, a nonintrusive projection method was used by approximating these quantities by a polynomial expansion on a multidimensional basis known as polynomial chaos. The coefficients of this expansion were computed with a multidimensional quadrature on sparse Smolyak grids. The deterministic model combines a finite element model based on a digital brain atlas and a multicompartmental model of mammalian nerve fibers. The material properties of brain tissue were modeled as uniform random parameters using data from several experimental studies. Different magnitudes of uncertainty in the material properties were computed to allow predictions on the resulting uncertainties in the desired quantities. The results showed a major contribution of the uncertainties in the electrical conductivity values of brain tissue on the voltage response as well as on the predicted VTA, while the influence of the uncertainties in the relative permittivity was negligible.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2235835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392218","Deep brain stimulation (DBS);finite element methods (FEMs);neural response;sensitivity analysis","Computational modeling;Uncertainty;Electrodes;Conductivity;Permittivity;Voltage control;Satellite broadcasting","Brain;Deep Brain Stimulation;Electric Conductivity;Finite Element Analysis;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","60","","37","IEEE","21 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These effects are frequency-dependent fluctuation rates and frequency-dependent attenuation, where the frequency dependence of the attenuation differs between paths. This frequency selectivity of the medium violates the assumption of uncorrelated taps and requires a UWB channel model.

In this paper, we present known Ethernet related threats and discuss existing solutions from business, hacker, and academic communities. Major issues, like insecurities related to Address Resolution Protocol and to self-configurability, are discussed. The solutions fall roughly into three categories: accepting Ethernet's insecurity and circling it with firewalls; creating a logical separation between the switches and end hosts; and centralized cryptography based schemes.

It aims to improve the patient's quality of life by obtaining rich, real-life data sets. One clinical area of interest is the use of these sensors to accurately measure knee motion in, e.g., osteoarthritic patients. Currently, various methods are used to formally calculate joint motion outside of the laboratory and they include electrogoniometers and inertial measurement units. The use of these technologies, however, tends to be restricted, since they are often bulky and obtrusive. This directly influences their clinical utility, as patients and clinicians can be reluctant to adopt them. The goal of this paper is to present the development process of a patient centered, clinically driven design for an attachable clothing sensor (ACS) system that can be used to assess knee motion. A pilot study using 10 volunteers was conducted to determine the relationship between the ACS system and a gold standard apparatus. The comparison yielded an average root mean square error of  ${\sim}{1}^{\circ}$, a mean absolute error of  ${\sim}{3}^{\circ}$, and coefficient of determination above  $(R^{2})$ 0.99 between the two systems.

Furthermore, we follow a quantum approach to achieve the same performance as the optimal soft-input soft-output classic detectors by replacing them with a quantum algorithm, which estimates the weighted sum of a function's evaluations. We propose a soft-input soft-output quantum-assisted MUD (QMUD) scheme, which is the quantum-domain equivalent of the ML MUD. We then demonstrate its application using the design example of a direct-sequence code division multiple access system employing bit-interleaved coded modulation relying on iterative decoding, and compare it with the optimal ML MUD in terms of its performance and complexity.

We first discuss the FKE in GeSi, and describe the EA modulator device design and fabrication. We then report on the performance of the fabricated device. Finally, we describe the monolithic integration of four modulators with a four channel wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) echelle grating to demonstrate a 112 Gbit/s (4 × 28 Gbit/s) WDM transmitter chip. This chip establishes silicon photonics as an enabling technology for low-power and low-cost data transmission applications.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2013.2278881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606872","Optical modulation;gratings;integrated circuits;silicon on insulator technology;wavelength division multiplexing","Optical waveguides;Silicon;Electric fields;Optical modulation;Optical losses;High-speed optical techniques","","56","18","48","IEEE","23 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to guarantee a robust performance over process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations of the conventional frequency synthesizer, a frequency calibration scheme is proposed to automatically correct a frequency drift of quadrature injection locked oscillators. Implemented by a 65 nm CMOS process, the frequency synthesizer achieves a typical phase noise of -117 dBc/Hz @ 10 MHz offset from a carrier frequency of 61.56 GHz while consuming 72 mW from a 1.2 V supply.

In this paper, we present EPIC, a novel cyber-physical testbed, and a modern scientific instrument that can provide accurate assessments of the effects that cyber-attacks may have on the cyber and physical dimensions of NCIs. To meet the complexity of today's NCIs, EPIC employs an Emulab-based testbed to recreate the cyber part of NCIs and multiple software simulators for the physical part. Its main advantage is that it can support very accurate, real-time, repeatable, and realistic experiments with heterogeneous infrastructures.

CTG consists of the simultaneous recording of fetal heart rate (FHR) signal and uterine contractions and its interpretation is usually performed through visual inspection by trained obstetric personnel. To reduce inter- and intraobserver variabilities and to improve the efficacy of prenatal diagnosis, new quantitative parameters, extracted from the CTG digitized signals, have been proposed as additional tools in the clinical diagnosis process. In this paper, a new parameter computed on FHR time series and based on the phase-rectified signal average curve (PRSA) is introduced. It is defined as acceleration phase-rectified slope (APRS) or deceleration phase-rectified slope (DPRS) depending on the slope sign of the PRSA curve. The new PRSA parameter was applied to FHR time series of 61 healthy and 61 intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetuses during CTG nonstress tests. Performance of APRS and DPRS was compared with 1) the results provided by other parameters extracted from the PRSA curve itself but already existing in the literature, and 2) other clinical indices provided by computerized cardiotocographic systems. APRS and DPRS indices performed better than any other parameter in this study in the distinction between healthy and IUGR fetuses. Our results suggest this new index might reliably contribute to the quality of early fetal diagnosis.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2013.2268423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6530599","Cardiotocography (CTG);fetal monitoring;heart rate variability (HRV);phase-rectified signal average (PRSA)","Cardiotocography;Fetal monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Phase rectified signal average;Pregnancy","Cardiotocography;Female;Heart Rate, Fetal;Humans;Pregnancy;ROC Curve;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","56","1","21","IEEE","12 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is found that the impregnated pressboard is susceptive to discharge erosion occurring on and inside the pressboard, which is characterized by ""tree-shaped white and carbonized marks"". The gaseous ""white mark"" channels would attract the subsequent discharges to follow the same routes, and the accumulative energy dissipation in these channels would then result in the carbonization of the channels and the emergence of a ""carbonized mark"". Once formed, the tree-shaped mark can continue to grow even under a reduced voltage or after a re-impregnation, until it bridges the gap and causes a final flashover.

Direct replay filters an input signal directly with a measured time-varying impulse response, whereas stochastic replay filters an input signal with a synthetic impulse response consistent with the scattering function of the measured channel. The validation uses data from two sea experiments and a diverse selection of communication schemes. Good agreement is found between bit error rates and packet error rates of in situ transmissions and simulated transmissions. Long-term error statistics of in situ signaling are also reproduced in simulation when a single channel measurement is used to configure the simulator. In all except one comparison, the packet error rate in simulation is within 20% of the packet error rate measured on location. The implication is that this type of channel simulator can be employed to test new modulation schemes in a realistic fashion without going to sea, except for the initial data collection.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2013.2262743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6576922","Channel models;computer simulation;multipath channels;time-varying channels;underwater acoustics;underwater communication","Channel models;Computer simulation;Multipath channels;Time-varying channels;Underwater communication;Underwater acoustics","","52","","30","IEEE","8 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our parallel distributed model is an island model where a population of individuals is divided into multiple islands. Training data are also divided into multiple subsets. The main feature of our model is that a different training data subset is assigned to each island. The assigned training data subsets are periodically rotated over the islands. The best rule set in each island also migrates periodically. We demonstrate through computational experiments that our model decreases the computation time of the hybrid fuzzy GBML algorithm by an order or two of magnitude using seven parallel processors without severely degrading the generalization ability of obtained fuzzy rule-based classifiers.

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6449406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406","cloud computing;overlay network;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;hadoop file system;eucalyptus;amazon web service","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Forensics;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Network security;Digital forensics;Web and internet services;Computer security","","52","2","","","7 Feb 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Both methods were compared according to technical feasibility and reliability of classroom implementation, instructors' experiences, word recognition accuracy, and student class performance.

To cope with this demand, a close cooperation between academic researchers and industry/standardization experts is necessary, which hardly exists in practice. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap between researchers and engineers by providing a review of current standard-related research efforts in wireless communication systems. Furthermore, we give an overview about our attempt in facilitating the exchange of information and results between researchers and engineers, via a common simulation platform for 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) and a corresponding webforum for discussion. Often, especially in signal processing, reproducing results of other researcher is a tedious task, because assumptions and parameters are not clearly specified, which hamper the consideration of the state-of-the-art research in the standardization process. Also, practical constraints, impairments imposed by technological restrictions and well-known physical phenomena, e.g., signaling overhead, synchronization issues, channel fading, are often disregarded by researchers, because of simplicity and mathematical tractability. Hence, evaluating the relevance of research results under practical conditions is often difficult. To circumvent these problems, we developed a standard-compliant open-source simulation platform for LTE that enables reproducible research in a well-defined environment. We demonstrate that innovative research under the confined framework of a real-world standard is possible, sometimes even encouraged. With examples of our research work, we investigate on the potential of several important research areas under typical practical conditions, and highlight consistencies as well as differences between theory and practice.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514821","Distributed antenna systems;frequency synchronization;heterogeneous networks;LTE;MIMO;multiuser gains;pilot power allocation;reproducible research","Throughput;Channel estimation;Resource management;Interference;Long Term Evolution;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless communication;Synchronization;Power distribution;MIMO","","52","7","81","OAPA","10 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ASCAT wind vector products are produced and utilized operationally in support of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s weather forecasting and warning mission. The standard ASCAT winds at NOAA are produced using the ASCAT wind data processor developed at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) utilizing the CMOD5.n geophysical model function (GMF). Recent validation of the ASCAT wind retrievals revealed a low bias at high wind speeds when compared to both the QuikSCAT winds and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction numerical weather prediction (NWP) model winds. The goal of this paper is to investigate the ASCAT high-wind-speed performance and to modify, as appropriate, the high-wind-speed portion of CMOD5.n GMF. This effort would potentially improve the utility of ASCAT wind retrievals in supporting wind warning and analysis and thus better mitigate the loss of QuikSCAT data products. Traditionally, the GMF is developed empirically by collocating scatterometer measurements and other truth data such as buoy and NWP model winds. However, NWP models are known to underestimate the intensity of higher wind speeds, and data sources such as ship-based or buoy-based observations provide an inadequate quantity of measurements for empirical GMF development. In this paper, a method utilizing aircraft-based scatterometer measurements in the high-wind-speed regimes is used in conjunction with satellite scatterometer measurements to refine the satellite GMF. As a result of this paper, a high wind C-band satellite GMF, CMOD5.h, was developed and implemented in NOAA's ASCAT processor. The validation comparison of the high wind and standard ASCAT wind products revealed 0.6-m/s reduction in the wind speed bias for winds greater than 15 m/s with respect to QuikSCAT, WindSat, and Step Frequency Microwave Radiometer high wind measurements.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2219871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6361281","Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT);geophysical model function (GMF);high winds;ocean vector winds;QuikSCAT","Wind speed;Wind forecasting;Sea measurements;US Government agencies;Satellites;Spatial resolution","","52","","47","USGov","22 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper aims to extend the range of conditions under which low-cost “handheld” thermal imaging cameras can be employed in such studies, particularly by enabling the effective and efficient geometric correction of thermal imagery collected from such devices, even when viewing far off-nadir (e.g., out of a side door or window). The approach is based on the automated detection of a set of fixed thermal “ground control points,” coupled with the use of a linear transformation matrix for warping the raw IR imagery to a fixed coordinate system. The output set of geometrically corrected brightness temperature and radiance images can be used to derive fire radiative power (FRP) and flame front rate of spread (ROS). We demonstrate and test our IR image processing methods on a series of case study fires, ranging from a small-scale laboratory to a 945-m2 outdoor experimental burn. We compare mapped information on FRP obtained from simultaneous nadir and off-nadir views, where we find differences that are in part controlled by flame structure and/or view angle. In the large open fire case, we compare the mapped fire radiative energy and ROS to simultaneously acquired aerial photography that provides the position of fuel and flames in high detail, and we demonstrate how these data sets can be used to explore various aspects of fire behavior.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2220368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377291","Fire radiative energy (FRE);fire radiative power (FRP);georeferencing algorithm;rate of spread (ROS);thermal imagery","Cameras;Helicopters;Temperature measurement;Fuels;Fires;Geometry","","51","","35","IEEE","10 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Optical data are used for gully mapping on a very local scale, while terrain data are employed for drumlin mapping on a slightly broader scale. After a multiresolution segmentation, a knowledge-based classification approach was developed for the multiscale mapping of targeted landforms. To identify well-suited scale levels for data segmentation, the estimation-of-scale-parameter tool was applied. Contrast information and shape properties of segments were implemented for gully classification. Contextual and shape information was utilized for mapping drumlins. An accuracy assessment was performed by comparing classification results with independent reference data sets that were delineated manually from the input data. We achieved satisfactory agreements between mapped and reference landforms.

By storing a substantial amount of data in commodity disks inside the data center that hosts the cloud, the cloud storage system must consider one question very carefully: how do we store data reliably with a high efficiency in terms of both storage overhead and data integrity? Though it is easy to store replicated data to tolerate a certain amount of data losses, it suffers from a very low storage efficiency. Conventional erasure coding techniques, such as Reed-Solomon codes, are able to achieve a much lower storage cost with the same level of tolerance against disk failures. However, it incurs much higher repair costs, not to mention an even higher access latency. In this sense, designing new coding techniques for cloud storage systems has gained a significant amount of attention in both academia and the industry. In this paper, we examine the existing results of coding techniques for cloud storage systems. Specifically, we present these coding techniques into two categories: regenerating codes and locally repairable codes. These two kinds of codes meet the requirements of cloud storage along two different axes: optimizing bandwidth and I/O overhead. We present an overview of recent advances in these two categories of coding techniques. Moreover, we introduce the main ideas of some specific coding techniques at a high level, and discuss their motivations and performance.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6522585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522585","erasure coding;cloud storage;regenerating codes;locally repairable codes","","","50","","","","3 Jun 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, an increase in the computational cost is incurred. This paper introduces a method to speed up the adaptation process through efficient use of a divide and conquer algorithm by recursively breaking down the scanning process and focusing it into a smaller region in each iteration. The new, fast and efficient angle adaptation algorithm offers the advantages of optimizing the number and pattern (positions) of the spots so as to maximize the receiver's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), regardless of the transmitter's position, the receiver's orientation and its field of view. It can also adapt to environmental changes, providing a robust link against shadowing and signal blockage. Furthermore, a beam delay adaptation method is used to reduce the effect of multipath dispersion and inter-symbol interference. The combination of angle and delay adaptation adds a degree of freedom to the link design, resulting in a compact impulse response and a system that is able to achieve higher data rates (15 Gbit/s). Significant improvements in the SNR, with optical wireless channel bandwidths of more than 15 GHz are obtained, and eye safety is considered while operating at 15 Gbit/s with full mobility in a realistic environment where shadowing exists.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2013.2286743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6655938","Beam angle adaptation;beam delay adaptation;diversity receiver;high-speed optical wireless communication;transmit power adaptation","Optical transmitters;Signal to noise ratio;Delays;Photodetectors;Algorithm design and analysis;Optical receivers","","50","","36","IEEE","5 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Engineering problems that include thermal and optical challenges have not permitted the large-scale commercialization of concentration PV systems, lack of functional reliability-and the concomitant lack of economic bankability-being a major barrier. For increasing the efficiency of single-junction cells beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit, several approaches based on concepts such as multiple exciton generation, carrier multiplication, hot-carrier extraction, etc., have been proposed; however, these do not seem to be commercially viable. Since both bulk-silicon and thin-film (amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium gallium selenide) solar cells remain as the only two commercially viable options for terrestrial PV applications, a multi-terminal multi-junction architecture appears promising for inexpensive PV electricity generation with efficiency exceeding the currently feasible 25%. The architecture exploits the present commercial silicon solar cells along with abundant and ultra-low-cost materials such as Cu2O. With the availability of well-controlled manufacturing processes at the sub 2-nm length scale, it will become possible to manufacture ultra-high efficiency and ultra-low cost PV electricity generation modules based on silicon.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2013.2280887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589128","Manufacturing;multi-terminal multi-junction architecture;nano-silicon;photovoltaics","Photovoltaic cells;Silicon;Electricity;Manufacturing;Computer architecture;Photovoltaic systems","","50","","143","IEEE","5 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We used an existing dataset of 663 DPRs of female patients with bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. The mandibular cortex was located using a previously described computer algorithm. Texture features, based on co-occurrence matrices and fractal dimension, were measured in the bone within the cortex and also in the superior basal bone above the cortex. These, augmented by cortical width measurements, were used by a random forest classifier to identify osteoporosis at femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine. Classification performance was assessed by ROC analysis. Area-under-curve (AUC) values for identifying osteoporosis at femoral neck were 0.830, 0.824, and 0.872 using, respectively, cortical width alone, cortical texture (co-occurrence matrix features) alone, and combined width and texture. At 80% sensitivity, these classifiers produced specificity values of 74.4%, 73.6%, and 80.0%, respectively. Fractal dimension was a less effective texture feature.

Three scalp surface Laplacian estimators were compared to left ear and common average reference (CAR). Contamination was quantified by comparing power after paralysis (brain signal, B) with power before paralysis (brain plus muscle signal, B+M). Brain:Muscle (B:M) ratios for the methods were calculated using B and differences in power after paralysis to represent muscle (M). There were very small power differences after paralysis up to 600 Hz using surface Laplacian transforms (B:M >; 6 above 30 Hz in central scalp leads). Scalp surface Laplacian transforms reduce muscle power in central and pericentral leads to less than one sixth of the brain signal, two to three times better signal detection than CAR.

Lifetime and degradation science (L&DS) is used to understand degradation modes, mechanisms and rates of materials, components and systems to predict lifetime of PV modules. A PV module lifetime and degradation science (PVM L&DS) model is an essential component to predict lifetime and mitigate degradation of PV modules using reproducible open data science. Previously published accelerated testing data from Underwriter Laboratories on PV modules with fluorinated polyester backsheets, which included eight modules that were exposed up to 4000 hrs of damp heat (85% relative humidity at 85$^{\circ}{\rm C}$) and eight exposed up to 4000 hrs of ultraviolet light (80 ${\rm W}/{\rm m}^{2}$  of 280–400 nm wavelengths at 60$^{\circ}{\rm C}$) (UV preconditioning) were used to determine statistically significant relationships between the applied stresses and measured responses. There were 15 different variables tracking aspects of system performance, degradation mechanisms, component metrics and time. Modules were analyzed for three system performance metrics (fill factor, peak power, and wet insulation). The results were statistically analyzed to identify variable transformations, statistically significant relationships (SSRs) and to develop the PVM L&DS model informed by a generalization of structural equation modeling techniques. The SSRs and significant model coefficients, combined with domain analytics, incorporating materials science, chemistry, and physics expertise, produced a pathway diagram ranking the variables' impact on the system performance, which were iteratively examined using sound statistical analysis and diagnostics. The SSRs determined from the damp heat exposure for the system response of Pmax corresponded to the degradation pathway of polyester terephthalate (PET) and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) hydrolysis. A linear change point for the damp heat exposure with the system response of Pmax was determined to be 1890 hrs. The UV preconditioning exposure did not induce sufficient degradation shown by the quality of the $R^{2}$ values for many of the best fitting models. This exemplifies the development of a methodology to determine rank ordered lifetime and degradation pathways present in modules and their effects on module performance over lifetime.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2267611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6527980","Photovoltaics;statistical analytics;lifetime and degradation science;structural equation modeling","Degradation;Heating;Mathematical model;Temperature measurement;Structural engineering;Photovoltaics;Measurement uncertainty","","49","","69","OAPA","10 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The prevalence of IoT is bound to generate large amounts of multisource, heterogeneous, dynamic, and sparse data. However, IoT offers inconsequential practical benefits without the ability to integrate, fuse, and glean useful information from such massive amounts of data. Accordingly, preparing us for the imminent invasion of things, a tool called data fusion can be used to manipulate and manage such data in order to improve process efficiency and provide advanced intelligence. In order to determine an acceptable quality of intelligence, diverse and voluminous data have to be combined and fused. Therefore, it is imperative to improve the computational efficiency for fusing and mining multidimensional data. In this paper, we propose an efficient multidimensional fusion algorithm for IoT data based on partitioning. The basic concept involves the partitioning of dimensions (attributes), i.e., a big data set with higher dimensions can be transformed into certain number of relatively smaller data subsets that can be easily processed. Then, based on the partitioning of dimensions, the discernible matrixes of all data subsets in rough set theory are computed to obtain their core attribute sets. Furthermore, a global core attribute set can be determined. Finally, the attribute reduction and rule extraction methods are used to obtain the fusion results. By means of proving a few theorems and simulation, the correctness and effectiveness of this algorithm is illustrated.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6574675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574675","Internet of Things;data fusion;multidimensional data;partitioning;rough set theory","Partitioning algorithms;Data integration;Internet;Set theory;Data mining;Information management","","48","","","","5 Aug 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Although the results highlight some concerns with volunteered data, notably the low levels of inter-volunteer agreement they also show that such imperfect data may be used to derive credible estimates on accuracy from both a site and non-site specific perspective. Specifically, the estimates of the producer's accuracy of forest and of forest extent derived from the free and volunteered data using a latent class model were of comparable magnitude to those derived in a formal validation by experts; the estimate of forest extent was within 1.38-9.08% of reference estimates while the difference in estimated producer's accuracy from that derived in an authoritative assessment of map accuracy was 2.82% and 0.34% for the forest and non-forest classes respectively.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2250257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6493463","Accuracy;classification;land cover;volunteered geographic information","Accuracy;Remote sensing;Africa;Data models;Labeling;Estimation;Collaboration","","48","","40","IEEE","3 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This assignment of serial numbers allows more complex data to be shared and has applications to other problems in privacy preserving data mining, collision avoidance in communications and distributed database access. The required computations are distributed without using a trusted central authority.

Even in the context of the linear-quadratic regulator in continuous time with Gaussian white noise, subtle difficulties arise, unexpected by many, that are often overlooked. In this paper we propose a new framework for establishing the separation principle. This approach takes the viewpoint that stochastic systems are well-defined maps between sample paths rather than stochastic processes per se and allows us to extend the separation principle to systems driven by martingales with possible jumps. While the approach is more in line with “real-life” engineering thinking where signals travel around the feedback loop, it is unconventional from a probabilistic point of view in that control laws for which the feedback equations are satisfied almost surely, and not deterministically for every sample path, are excluded.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2013.2259207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6506982","Certainty equivalence;separation principle;stochastic control","Process control;Stochastic processes;Noise;Kalman filters;Feedback loop;Linear systems;Riccati equations","","47","","42","IEEE","22 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consider, for example, artifacts due to acoustic reverberation and background noise. The acoustic reverberation depends on the shape and the composition of the room, and it causes temporal and spectral smearing of the recorded sound. The background noise, on the other hand, depends on the secondary audio source activities present in the evidentiary recording. Extraction of acoustic cues from an audio recording is an important but challenging task. Temporal changes in the estimated reverberation and background noise can be used for dynamic acoustic environment identification (AEI), audio forensics, and ballistic settings. We describe a statistical technique based on spectral subtraction to estimate the amount of reverberation and nonlinear filtering based on particle filtering to estimate the background noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested using a data set consisting of speech recordings of two human speakers (one male and one female) made in eight acoustic environments using four commercial grade microphones. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated for various experimental settings such as microphone independent, semi- and full-blind AEI, and robustness to MP3 compression. Performance of the proposed framework is also evaluated using Temporal Derivative-based Spectrum and Mel-Cepstrum (TDSM)-based features. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves AEI performance compared with the direct method (i.e., feature vector is extracted from the audio recording directly). In addition, experimental results also show that the proposed scheme is robust to MP3 compression attack.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2013.2278843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6582548","Acoustic environment identification;acoustic reverberation;audio forensics;background noise;particle filtering","Background noise;Audio recording;Noise measurement;Reverberation;Microphones;Particle filters","","47","9","75","IEEE","16 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, optimized LapSVMs are developed for semisupervised hyperspectral image classification, by introducing distance metric learning instead of the traditional Euclidean distance which is used in the existing LapSVM. In the procedure of constructing graph with distance metric learning, equivalence and non-equivalence pairwise constraints are imposed for better capturing similarity of samples from different classes. In this way, two new optimization problems are reformulated for building LapSVM with normalized and unnormalized graph Laplacian respectively.

In support of the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System project, to improve the quality of calibrated radiances from atmospheric sounders and imaging radiometers, an activity is underway to compare routinely measured radiances with those simulated from operational global numerical weather prediction (NWP) fields. This paper describes the results obtained from the first three years of these comparisons. Data from the High-resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder, Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager, Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer, Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, and Microwave Humidity Sounder radiometers, together with the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, a spectrometer, and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer, an interferometer, were included in the analysis. Changes in mean biases and their standard deviations were used to investigate the temporal stability of the bias and radiometric noise of the instruments. A double difference technique can be employed to remove the effect of changes or deficiencies in the NWP model which can contribute to the biases. The variation of the biases with other variables is also investigated, such as scene temperature, scan angle, location, and time of day. Many of the instruments were shown to be stable in time, with a few exceptions, but measurements from the same instrument on different platforms are often biased with respect to each other. The limitations of the polar simultaneous nadir overpasses often used to monitor biases between polar-orbiting sensors are shown with these results due to the apparent strong dependence of some radiance biases on scene temperature.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2229283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416042","Calibration;numerical weather prediction (NWP) models;remote sensing;satellites","Instruments;Computational modeling;Clouds;Satellites;Ocean temperature;Atmospheric modeling;Monitoring","","46","","35","Crown","21 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is increasing public concern regarding the health risks of radio-frequency (RF) radiation, particularly that produced by mobile phones. Concern regarding the potential risks of exposure to EMFs has led to many epidemiological investigations, but the effects of EMF exposure on human and other mammalian cells are still unclear. Cellular studies of the effects of RF EMFs have been conducted more often than epidemiological and animal studies. This review provides a summary of the potential cellular effects of RF fields, including those generated by cell phones and their base stations. In vitro studies of the effects of RF fields can mainly be classified into those examining genotoxic and nongenotoxic effects. Genotoxic effects include DNA strand breaks, micronucleus formation, mutation, and chromosomal aberration, i.e., changes involving damage to DNA. Nongenotoxic effects refer to changes in cellular functions, including cell proliferation, signal transduction, and gene expression (mRNA and protein). The results of most recent studies show no marked effects of RF exposure at the cellular and genetic levels. However, some studies have suggested RF effects, and these results require further investigation. As the wireless power transfer technologies are gaining more popularity, it is important that the engineering community participate in the health assessment study with medical and biological research groups. Since the electromagnetic environment due to future wireless power technologies continues to increase, biologists also have to promote the research assessment utilizing advanced technologies in the life sciences. This review paper attempts to provide an insight on the cellular and molecular responses to the RF electromagnetic fields and the understanding of such biological impacts are important for wireless power technology applications.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2013.2248111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6492114","Cellular study;genotoxic effect;nongenotoxic effect;radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs)","Wireless communication;Power transmission;Electromagnetic fields ;Safety;Hazards;Genetic mutations;Radio frequency;Biological effects of radiation;Genetics","","46","87","65","IEEE","2 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We extensively investigated the forward-biased operation of the modulators by using equivalent circuit analysis and the measurement of the fabricated devices. We argue carrier recombination time only plays a minor role for the overall performance of the modulator. Dependences of the modulation efficiency on other various critical parameters are discussed. In particular, if we use relatively short phase shifter, the forward-biased operation provides smaller VπL than reversed one even at high frequency of 20 GHz, at the expense of the narrow bandwidth. Our approach enables high-speed operation up to 50 Gb/s, by using phase shifter as short as 250 μm and preemphasis signals.

We identify a new security threat arising from existing secure friend discovery protocols, coined as runaway attack, which can introduce a serious unfairness issue. To thwart this new threat, we introduce a novel blind vector transformation technique, which could hide the correlation between the original vector and transformed results. Based on this, we propose our privacy-preserving and fairness-aware interest and profile matching protocol, which allows one party to match its interest with the profile of another, without revealing its real interest and profile and vice versa.

Cu(In,Ga)Se2 devices with absorbers of different thicknesses and different buffer layers are fabricated. Absorber layers and finished devices are characterized. Good efficiencies are obtained, also for devices of substandard thickness down to 0.3 μm. Best open-circuit voltages and fill factors are found for cells with half the standard absorber thickness, but the highest efficiencies are found for cells with the standard thickness of 1.6 μm due to their higher short-circuit current density. Cu(In,Ga)Se2 cells with Zn(O,S) buffer layers are more efficient than CdS reference devices for the same absorber thickness due to a higher short-circuit current. For cells with thin absorber layers, a part of the higher current is caused by higher quantum efficiency at long wavelengths. Electrical simulations indicate that the loss in the open-circuit voltage for the thinnest devices is due to recombination in the back contact region. The difference in long-wavelength quantum efficiency between the buffer layers is attributed to a difference in the CIGS band bending. Acceptors at the Cu(In,Ga)Se2-CdS interface are proposed as an explanation for this difference. A low-quality back contact region enhances the effect.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2013.2276030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6579660","Photovoltaic cells;semiconductor device modeling","Buffer layers;Thickness measurement;Photonic band gap;Current measurement;Photovoltaic cells;Semiconductor device modeling","","45","","33","IEEE","18 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm computes maximum-flow routings for all smooth unicast traffic demands within the Capacity Region of a network subject to routing cost constraints. The edge cost can be a distance, reliability, congestion or an energy metric. It is shown that every network has a finite Bandwidth-Cost capacity. The Bandwidth-Distance and the Bandwidth-Energy capacities are explored. The routing algorithm requires the formulation of two Linear Programs (LPs). The first LP finds a multicommodity Maximum-Flow, when the flows are constrained to a sub-graph of the network to enforce cost constraints. The second LP minimizes the routing cost, given that the maximum-flow is fixed. A related Constrained Multicast-Max-Flow-Min-Cost algorithm is also presented, to maximize the throughput of a multicast tree using network coding, subject to routing cost constraints. These algorithms have polynomial-time solutions, whereas traditional multipath routing algorithms can be NP-Hard. The addition of routing cost constraints can significantly reduce the size of the LPs, resulting in faster solutions, with lower edge utilizations and with higher energy efficiencies.

The development of transformer lifetime models, however, is hindered by the lack of failure data since most of the transformer fleets have not yet completed their first lifecycle.

This paper analyzes the effect of survival data on the accuracy of lifetime models through a series of Monte Carlo simulations. It has been proved that the accuracy of lifetime models can be improved by taking the survival data into account. However, the degree of improvement is greatly confined by the censoring rate and the sample size of the collected lifetime data. Practical implications of the simulation results and suggestions on measures to further improve the accuracy of lifetime models are subsequently provided.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2264143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529162","Censoring rate;lifetime data;Monte Carlo methods;sample size;statistical lifetime model;suspensions;transformers","Data models;Power transformers;Monte Carlo methods;Suspensions;Accuracy;Sociology","","43","","32","IEEE","11 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The instruments consist of an acoustic device, developed to perform in situ measurements of manganese crust thickness at depths of up to 3000 m, and a vision-based mapping system that generates 3-D color reconstructions of the seafloor. Methods to process the information obtained by these sensors to automatically identify areas of exposed crust using the 3-D reconstructions, and subsequently determine the thickness of the crusts based on the acoustic measurements, are described. Sea trials were performed at #5 Takuyo seamount with the systems mounted onboard the remotely operated vehicle Hyper-Dolphin during the NT10-11 cruise of the R/V Natsushima. The results are that the first time in situ measurements of manganese crust thickness have been performed, and it is demonstrated that, for the types of substrate dominant in the surveyed area, continuous acoustic measurement of manganese crust thickness is possible.

The benefit of using contra-directional couplers is their small bandwidth, as compared to co-directional couplers that do not have gratings. The simulation results show that this device provides numerous performance advantages compared to cascaded racetrack resonators exhibiting the Vernier effect without contra-directional grating couplers.

However, low-cost large-scale video services have remained an intangible goal. The ethernet passive optical network (EPON) is being regarded as one of the promising for next-generation optical access solutions in the access networks attempt to tackle this problem but facing a major challenge to offer scalable large-scale video services. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an architecture which combines the advantages of EPON and P2P architecture to provide scalable Internet Protocol delivery multimedia services and improve quality-of-services. In the proposed architecture, we design new optical network unit (ONU) mechanisms, which support traffic redirection communication among ONUs in combination with caching. Thus, it can reduce the resource consumption and add extra downstream bandwidth at the optical line terminal since the intra-PON traffic is not necessary to be buffered and scheduled in the downstream direction. Finally, we propose a “Redirect” dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme, which can support intra-PON traffic redirection and intertraffic bandwidth allocation. Simulation results have shown that our proposed architecture can improve the overall QoS in terms of end-to-end delay, jitter, system throughput, fairness, and packet dropping rate.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2012.2227941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6353867","Ethernet passive optical network (EPON);intra-PON traffic;peer-to-peer (P2P) applications;quality of services;REDIRECT DBA scheme;system performance","Optical network units;Streaming media;Bandwidth;EPON;IEEE 802.3 Standards;Peer to peer computing;Computer architecture","","41","","26","IEEE","15 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our goal is to minimize total energy while guaranteeing reliability constraints. We approach the problem from two directions based on the two different ways of guaranteeing the reliability of the tasks. The first approach aims at guaranteeing reliability at least as high as that of without speed scaling by reserving recovery job for each scaled down task. Heuristics have been used to guide the speed scaling and shutdown techniques that are used to lower total energy consumption while guaranteeing the reliability. The second way to guarantee the reliability of the tasks is to satisfy a known minimum reliability constraint for the tasks. The minimum reliable speed guarantees the reliability level of tasks, and is used as a constraint in the energy minimization problem. Both static and dynamic co-design methods are explored.

The waveguide structure consists of a thin metal film (silver) inserted into a vertical low-index slot [filled with silicon nanocrystal (Si-nc)] between two high-index dielectrics (silicon), forming two nanoscale low-index Si-nc slot regions. The modes are confined within the two vertical regions. The designed LRHPS waveguide takes advantages of both traditional long-range surface plasmon polariton waveguide and hybrid plasmonic waveguide. The combined effects of long-range surface plasmon polaritons and discontinuity of electric field at the interface between two dielectrics with high-contrast refractive index enable a millimeter-scale propagation range together with a subwavelength mode confinement for potential high-density nanophotonic integration. The resultant quasi-TE mode properties of LRHPS waveguide, including long-range hybrid (LRH) mode and short-range hybrid (SRH) mode, are analyzed, showing a long propagation length up to 14.55 mm (corresponding to a low loss of $3\times 10^{-4}\ \hbox{dB}/\mu\hbox{m}$) with a slot size of 150 nm $\times$ 200 nm. Normalized power and intensity are also calculated, indicating tight mode confinement within subwavelength low-index slot regions. Moreover, nonlinearity and chromatic dispersion are also studied.

The tool can be used for long-term retrospective studies of cardiac patients to study the evolving features with prognostic value. Methods and procedures: To perform the conversion, we: 1) detect the graphical grid on ECG charts using grayscale thresholding; 2) digitize the ECG signal based on its contour using a column-wise pixel scan; and 3) use template-based optical character recognition to extract patient demographic information from the paper ECG in order to interface the data with the patients' medical record. To validate the digitization technique: 1) correlation between the digital signals and signals digitized from paper ECG are performed and 2) clinically significant ECG parameters are measured and compared from both the paper-based ECG signals and the digitized ECG. Results: The validation demonstrates a correlation value of 0.85–0.9 between the digital ECG signal and the signal digitized from the paper ECG. There is a high correlation in the clinical parameters between the ECG information from the paper charts and digitized signal, with intra-observer and inter-observer correlations of 0.8–0.9 (p<0.05), and kappa statistics ranging from 0.85 (inter-observer) to 1.00 (intra-observer). Conclusion: The important features of the ECG signal, especially the QRST complex and the associated intervals, are preserved by obtaining the contour from the paper ECG. The differences between the measures of clinically important features extracted from the original signal and the reconstructed signal are insignificant, thus highlighting the accuracy of this technique. Clinical impact: Using this type of ECG digitization tool to carry out retrospective studies on large databases, which rely on paper ECG records, studies of emerging ECG features can be performed.

Traditionally, it has been proposed that the piezoceramic stack of a Langevin transducer should be located in the nodal plane of the longitudinal mode of vibration, ensuring that the piezoceramic elements are positioned under a uniform stress during transducer operation, maximizing element efficiency and minimizing piezoceramic aging. However, this general design rule is often partially broken during the design phase if features such as a support flange or multiple piezoceramic stacks are incorporated into the transducer architecture. Meanwhile, it has also been well documented in the literature that power ultrasonic devices driven at high excitation levels exhibit nonlinear behaviors similar to those observed in Duffing-type systems, such as resonant frequency shifts, the jump phenomenon, and hysteretic regions. This study investigates three Langevin transducers with different piezoceramic stack locations by characterizing their linear and nonlinear vibrational responses to understand how the stack location influences nonlinear behavior.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6521061","","","","39","","21","IEEE","31 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A maximum bulk thermal conductivity of 3 W/mK was achieved with a 56% volume fraction of MgO filler. This 56 vol% MgO-filled EMC has a thermal conductivity approximately twice that of traditional silica-filled EMCs with the same volume fraction of filler and has equivalent electrical insulative, thermal expansion, and water absorption characteristics.

The excavation unit excavates and clears a space for the robot to tunnel into densely packed soil. In this paper, we discuss strategies for underground excavation. Next, we develop the excavation and propulsion units, and conduct several experiments to test these units. Finally, we develop a prototype subsurface robot with both units integrated in one package.

Based on this method, this paper introduces an automated tool for fast, unsupervised damage detection in urban areas. Ridge-based curvilinear features are extracted from a preevent SAR image, and double-reflection candidates are selected using prior probability distributions derived from a simple geometrical building model. The candidate features are then used with the ratio of a pair of single preevent and postevent SAR single-look amplitude images to estimate damage levels. The algorithm is very efficient, with overall computational complexity of O(Nlogk) for an N-pixel image containing features of mean length k. The technique is demonstrated using COSMO-SkyMed data covering L'Aquila, Italy, and Port-au-Prince, Haiti.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2271564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565347","Earthquake damage detection;feature extraction;multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR);urban areas","Feature extraction;Buildings;Synthetic aperture radar;Earthquakes;Urban areas;Image segmentation;Estimation","","38","","27","IEEE","22 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We observe that our derived solution has a form of maximum ratio transmission per each DAU with full power. Based on the derived optimal beamforming, the outage and ergodic capacity under Rayleigh fading channels are analyzed. To this end, we show that a distribution of the received signal-to-noise ratio is characterized as a Gamma distribution by approximating a sum of non-identical independent Nakagami-m random variables as a single Nakagami-m random variable based on the moment matching method.

This allows analysts to prove that a human-automation interactive system (as represented by the formal model) will or will not satisfy safety properties with both normative and generated erroneous human behavior. Benchmarks are reported that illustrate how this method scales. The method is then illustrated with a case study: the programming of a patient-controlled analgesia pump. In this example, a problem resulting from a generated erroneous human behavior is discovered. The method is further employed to evaluate the effectiveness of different solutions to the discovered problem. The results and future research directions are discussed.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2256129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6519275","Formal methods;human error;human–automation interaction (HAI);model checking;system safety;task analysis","Human factors;System testing;Model checking;Human computer interaction","","37","","67","IEEE","23 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many telemedicine systems based on ubiquitous computing and communication techniques have been proposed for monitoring the user's electrocardiogram (ECG) anywhere and anytime. Usually, wet electrodes are used in these telemedicine systems. However, wet electrodes require conduction gels and skin preparation that can be inconvenient and uncomfortable for users. In order to overcome this issue, a new non-contact electrode circuit was proposed and applied in developing a mobile electrocardiogram monitoring system. The proposed non-contact electrode can measure bio-potentials across thin clothing, allowing it to be embedded in a user's normal clothing to monitor ECG in daily life. We attempted to simplify the design of these non-contact electrodes to reduce power consumption while continuing to provide good signal quality. The electrical specifications and the performance of monitoring arrhythmia in clinical settings were also validated to investigate the reliability of the proposed design. Experimental results show that the proposed non-contact electrode provides good signal quality for measuring ECG across thin clothes.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2013.2253598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523100","Arrhythmia;electrocardiogram (ECG);mobile electrocardiogram monitoring system;non-contact electrode;telemedicine","Real-time systems;Cardiology;Mobile communication;Electrocardiography;Arrhythmia;Telemedicine","","37","","16","OAPA","4 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The APD is grown by molecular beam epitaxy on InP substrates from lattice-matched InGaAs and InAlAs alloys. Avalanche multiplication inside the APD occurs in a series of asymmetric gain stages whose layer ordering acts to enhance the rate of electron-initiated impact ionization and to suppress the rate of hole-initiated ionization when operated at low gain. The multiplication stages are cascaded in series, interposed with carrier relaxation layers in which the electric field is low, preventing avalanche feedback between stages. These measures result in much lower excess multiplication noise and stable linear-mode operation at much higher avalanche gain than is characteristic of APDs fabricated from the same semiconductor alloys in bulk. The noise suppression mechanism is analyzed by simulations of impact ionization spatial distribution and gain statistics, and measurements on APDs implementing the design are presented. The devices employing this design are demonstrated to operate at linear-mode gain in excess of 6000 without avalanche breakdown. Excess noise characterized by an effective impact ionization rate ratio below 0.04 were measured at gains over 1000.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2013.2258072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509920","Avalanche photodiode;optical receiver;photo detector;photon counting","Temperature measurement;Performance evaluation;Semiconductor device measurement;Noise reduction;Metals;Avalanche photodiodes;Gain measurement","","37","1","44","Crown","29 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An increased dependence on CPS led to the collection of a vast amount of human-centric data, which brings the information overload problem across multiple domains. Recommender systems in CPS, which always provide information recommendations for users based on historical ratings collected from a single domain only, suffer from the data sparsity problem. Recently, several recommendation models have been proposed to transfer knowledge across multiple domains to alleviate the sparsity problem, which typically assumes that multiple domains share a latent common rating pattern. However, real-world related domains do not necessarily share such a rating pattern, and diversity across domains might outweigh the advantages of such common pattern, which results in performance degradations. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain recommendation model, which not only learn the common rating pattern across domains with the flexibility in controlling the optimal level of sharing, but also learn the domain-specific rating patterns in each domain involving discriminative information propitious to performance improvement. Extensive experiments on real world data sets suggest that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the cross-domain recommendation task in CPS.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2274044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6563137","Cross-domain recommendation;cyber-physical systems;latent factor model;rating patterns","Optimization;Computational modeling;Data models;Linear programming;Mathematical model;Analytical models","","37","","36","CCBY","18 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep-well QCLs significantly suppress carrier leakage, as evidenced by high values for the threshold-current characteristic temperature T0 (253 K) and the slope-efficiency characteristic temperature T1 (285 K), but, due to stronger quantum confinement, the global upper-laser-level lifetime τ4g decreases, resulting in basically the same room-temperature (RT) threshold-current density Jth as conventional QCLs. Tapered active-region (TA) QCLs, devices for which the active-region barrier heights increase in energy from the injection to the exit barriers, lead to recovery of the τ4g value while further suppressing carrier leakage. As a result, experimental RT Jth values from moderate-taper TA 4.8-μm emitting QCLs are ~14% less than for conventional QCLs and T1 reaches values as high as 797 K. A step-taper TA (STA) QCL design provides both complete carrier-leakage suppression and an increase in the τ4g value, due to Stark-effect reduction and strong asymmetry. Then, the RT Jth value decreases by at least 25% compared to conventional QCLs of same geometry. In turn, single-facet, RT pulsed and continuous-wave maximum wallplug-efficiency values of 29% and 27% are projected for 4.6-4.8-μm-emitting QCLs.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2012.2237387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400209","Lasers;quantum-well lasers;quantum wells (QWs);semiconductor lasers;Stark effect","Quantum cascade lasers;Energy states;Stationary state;Heating;Temperature distribution","","37","","44","IEEE","1 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach does not consider the fact that conventional acoustic feature vectors also reside in a lower dimensional manifold of the feature space, when feature covariance matrices contain close to zero eigenvalues. In this study, based on observations of the covariance structure of acoustic features, we propose a factor analysis modeling scheme in the acoustic feature space instead of the super-vector space and derive a mixture dependent feature transformation. We demonstrate how this single linear transformation performs feature dimensionality reduction, de-correlation, normalization and enhancement, at once. The proposed transformation is shown to be closely related to signal subspace based speech enhancement schemes. In contrast to traditional front-end mixture dependent feature transformations, where feature alignment is performed using the highest scoring mixture, the proposed transformation is integrated within the speaker recognition system using a probabilistic feature alignment technique, which nullifies the need for regenerating the features/retraining the Universal Background Model (UBM). Incorporating the proposed method with a state-of-the-art i-vector and Gaussian Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) framework, we perform evaluations on National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) 2010 core telephone and microphone tasks.

Cleaving as closely as possible to the modeling strategies developed within the mature manipulation literature, self-manipulation models can leverage those insights and results where applicable, while clarifying the fundamental differences.

In this paper, we address the issue of large computation overhead caused by the safety message authentication. Especially, a cooperative message authentication protocol (CMAP) is developed to alleviate vehicles' computation burden. With CMAP, all the vehicles share their verification results with each other in a cooperative way, so that the number of safety messages that each vehicle needs to verify reduces significantly. Furthermore, we study the verifier selection algorithms for a high detection rate of invalid messages in a practical 2-D road scenario. Another important contribution in this paper is that we develop an analytical model for CMAP and the existing probabilistic verification protocol , considering the hidden terminal impact.

Such GRIN fiber microlenses often possess aberrations that cause significant distortions of the focused output beam. Current design methods based on ABCD matrix transformations of Gaussian beams cannot model such effects and are therefore inadequate for the analysis and design of high-performance probes that require diffraction-limited output beams. We demonstrate use of the beam propagation method (BPM) to analyze beam distortion in GRIN-lensed fibers resulting from index profiles that exhibit a deviation from the ideal parabolic shape or artifacts such as ripples or a central dip. Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of this method for exploring novel probe designs that incorporate GRIN phase masks to generate wavefront-shaped output beams with extended depth-of-focus (DOF). We present results using our method that are in good agreement with experimental data. The BPM enables accurate simulation of fiber probes using non-ideal or custom-engineered GRIN fibers with arbitrary refractive index profiles, which is important in the design of high-performance fiber-based micro-imaging systems for biomedical applications.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2250939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6472722","Biomedical optical imaging;optical microscopy","Probes;Indexes;Refractive index;Lenses;Numerical models;Optical imaging;Optical sensors","","34","","34","IEEE","7 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results strongly suggest that in a broad family of structures a simple effective medium approximation model can be applied to characterize the effective response. The model consists in an equivalent circuit composed of a resistance accounting for the percolated chains with an additional parallel RC-branch describing the non-percolated part. The physical meaning of this model is discussed in the frame of the Bergman spectral representation of effective medium.

The noncritical paths are operated in the low energy DML mode, which does not affect the performance of the design, but allows significant energy consumption reduction.

Our research resulted in a unified probabilistic model for ERP spelling, which is based on only three assumptions and incorporates language information. On top of that, the probabilistic nature of our classifier yields a natural dynamic stopping strategy. Furthermore, our method uses the same parameters across 25 subjects from three different datasets. We show that our classifier, when enhanced with language models and dynamic stopping, improves the spelling speed and accuracy drastically. Additionally, we would like to point out that as our model is entirely probabilistic, it can easily be used as the foundation for complex systems in future work.

Hence, physical preventative measures such as antivirus software and firewalls are proving to solve only part of the problem as the employees using them lack adequate information security knowledge. This tends to expose a firm to risks and costly mistakes made by naïve/uninformed employees.

Ordinary all-in-focus image reconstruction from a sequence of multi-focus images achieves extended depth of field, where reconstructed images would be captured through a pinhole in the center on the lens. In this paper, we propose a novel method for reconstructing all-in-focus images through shifted pinholes on the lens based on 3D frequency analysis of multi-focus images. Such shifted pinhole images are obtained by a linear combination of multi-focus images with scene-independent 2D filters in the frequency domain. The proposed method enables us to efficiently synthesize dense 4D light field on the lens plane for image-based rendering, especially, robust scene refocusing with arbitrary bokeh. Our novel method using simple linear filters achieves not only reconstruction of all-in-focus images even for shifted pinholes more robustly than the conventional methods depending on scene/focus estimation, but also scene refocusing without suffering from limitation of resolution in comparison with recent approaches using special devices such as lens arrays in computational photography.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2013.2273668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562776","Multi-focus;multi-view;light field;blur;all-in-focus","Image reconstruction;Lenses;Trajectory;Robustness;Rendering (computer graphics);Photography","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Lighting;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","32","10","52","IEEE","17 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper models the dynamic multipreferences of learners using the multidimensional attributes of resource and learner ratings by using data mining technology to alleviate sparsity and cold-start problems and increase the diversity of the recommendation list. The presented approach has two main modules: an explicit attribute-based recommender and an implicit attribute-based recommender. In the first module, a learner preference tree (LPT) is introduced to model the interests of learners based on the explicit multidimensional attributes of resources and historical ratings of accessed resources. Then, recommendations are generated by nearest neighborhood collaborative filtering (NNCF). In the second module, the weights of implicit or latent attributes of resources for learners are considered as chromosomes in a genetic algorithm (GA), and then this algorithm optimizes the weights according to historical ratings. Then, recommendations are generated by NNCF using the optimized weight vectors of implicit attributes.

Complex magnetic nanostructures typically have multiple stable domain structures. MALTS works in conjunction with the open access micromagnetic software Object Oriented Micromagnetic Framework or MuMax. Magnetically stable trial magnetization states of the object of interest are input into MALTS and simulated LTEM images are output. MALTS computes the magnetic and electric phases accrued by the transmitted electrons via the Aharonov-Bohm expressions. Transfer and envelope functions are used to simulate the progression of the electron wave through the microscope lenses. The final contrast image due to these effects is determined by Fourier Optics. Similar approaches have been used previously for simulations of specific cases of LTEM contrast. The novelty here is the integration with micromagnetic codes via a simple user interface enabling the computation of the contrast from any structure. The output from MALTS is in good agreement with both experimental data and published LTEM simulations. A widely-available generalized code for the analysis of Lorentz contrast is a much needed step towards the use of LTEM as a standardized laboratory technique.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2013.2247410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461943","Image simulation;Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy;magnetic thin films;micromagnetism","Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic domains;Magnetic flux;Microscopy;Magnetization;Micromagnetics;Magnetic force microscopy","","32","","24","IEEE","14 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method accounts for the effect of an analog filter being applied before the data analysis, which results in colored noise, by adapting existing muliresolution statistics to this situation. J-SMURF's ability to denoise the signal without missing events even when the signal-to-noise ratio is low is demonstrated on simulations as well as on ion current traces obtained from gramicidin A channels reconstituted into solvent-free planar membranes.

Driver speed control is a complex behavior of longitudinal vehicle control consisting of speed perception, decision making, motor control, vehicle dynamics modeling, and individual driver differences. However, there are few existing models that can integrate all of these aspects in a cohesive manner. To address this problem, this paper introduces a mathematical model for a driver's speed control with analytical solutions based on human cognitive mechanisms in driving. This model includes an integrated queuing network-model human processor structure and the rule-based decision field theory. This new model consequently can predict several aspects of driver speed control behavior at the same time, such as driving speed, throttle/brake pedal angle, acceleration, and the frequency of speedometer inspection. A laboratory session involving a driving simulator is conducted to validate the current model. The model accounted for over 99% of the experimental speed of the average driver, and over 95% of the experimental speed for the majority of individual drivers.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2256854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573359","Individual difference;mathematical model;queuing network;rule-based decision field theory;speed control","Vehicles;Servers;Velocity control;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Foot;Decision making","","31","","49","IEEE","2 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Secondly, based on the obtained polytopic LPV model, the flight envelope is divided into four smaller subregions, and four gain-scheduled controllers are designed for these parameter subregions. Then, by the defined switching characteristic function, these gain-scheduled controllers are switched in order to guarantee the closed-loop FAHV system to be asymptotically stable and satisfy a given tracking error performance criterion.

The algorithms have been tested on two pairs of sensors, TMI/Windsat and TMI/AMSR-E. The differences in the results between the two algorithms are generally small. The contribution of various error sources has also been evaluated. The error analysis suggests similar quality for both algorithms. A comparison of the observed variability in the differences between the two sensors in each pair shows very similar variability for the TMI/AMSR-E pair as for the TMI/Windsat pair.

Considerable research efforts have been invested to develop an efficient quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme over either free-space optical or fiber-optics channels. Most of these research efforts have been focused on a two-dimensional QKD, commonly realized by the use of the polarization state of photons. However, the data rates for the quantum key exchange in two-dimensional QKD are still low, while transmission distance is limited. On the other hand, it is well known that photons can carry both the spin angular momentum (SAM) and the orbital angular momentum (OAM), associated with the polarization and azimuthal phase of the complex electric field, respectively. Accordingly, we can define the combined-OAM-SAM state of a photon as |l, σ〉, where l and σ correspond to OAM and SAM indexes, respectively. Since the OAM eigenstates are orthogonal, an arbitrary number of bits per single photon can be transmitted, which could considerably increase the total secure bit rate. To improve secure data rates, we propose two types of protocols, namely, nonentangled-based (such as weak coherent state) and entanglement-assisted protocols, both employing the photon combined-OAM-SAM state, which can be used for secure key distribution over free-space optical and few-mode fiber channels. Two types of entanglement-assisted protocols are described, namely, two-basis and (D + 1)-basis protocols ( D is dimensionality of corresponding Hilbert space). We further describe how to implement the qudit gates required for implementation of these protocols. Finally, we discuss the security issues of the proposed protocols and determine both infinite and finite secret key fraction rates.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2292301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671930","Quantum information processing (QIP);quantum qudit gates;quantum key distribution (QKD);orbital angular momentum (OAM);spin angular momentum (SAM);low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","Protocols;Photonics;Parity check codes;Optical fibers;Security;Adaptive optics","","29","1","39","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its application domain is vast and has been deployed in scenarios where accurate geometric measurements are needed. Regarding the PrimeSense technology, a limited amount of work has been devoted to calibrating the Kinect, especially the depth data. The Kinect is, however, inevitably prone to distortions, as independently confirmed by numerous users. An effective method for improving the quality of the Kinect system is by modeling the sensor's systematic errors using bundle adjustment. In this paper, a method for modeling the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the infrared and colour cameras, and more importantly the distortions in the depth image, is presented. Through an integrated marker-and feature-based self-calibration, two Kinects were calibrated. A novel approach for modeling the depth systematic errors as a function of lens distortion and relative orientation parameters is shown to be effective. The results show improvements in geometric accuracy up to 53% compared with uncalibrated point clouds captured using the popular software RGBDemo. Systematic depth discontinuities were also reduced and in the check-plane analysis the noise of the Kinect point cloud was reduced by 17%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2271860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6552953","Kinect;camera calibration;quality assurance;quantization;3D/stereo scene analysis","Systematics;Cameras;Three dimensional displays;Distortion measurement;Image color analysis;Calibration;Scene analysis","","29","1","43","OAPA","3 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, processing large volumes of complex data in real-time has become a big challenge. Together with ICU physicians, we have designed and developed an ICU clinical decision support system icuARM based on associate rule mining (ARM), and a publicly available research database MIMIC-II (Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II) that contains more than 40,000 ICU records for 30,000+patients. icuARM is constructed with multiple association rules and an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for care providers to perform real-time data and information mining in the ICU setting. To validate icuARM, we have investigated the associations between patients' conditions such as comorbidities, demographics, and medications and their ICU outcomes such as ICU length of stay. Coagulopathy surfaced as the most dangerous co-morbidity that leads to the highest possibility (54.1%) of prolonged ICU stay. In addition, women who are older than 50 years have the highest possibility (38.8%) of prolonged ICU stay. For clinical conditions treatable with multiple drugs, icuARM suggests that medication choice can be optimized based on patient-specific characteristics. Overall, icuARM can provide valuable insights for ICU physicians to tailor a patient's treatment based on his or her clinical status in real time.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2013.2290113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671936","Intensive care units (ICUs);personalized clinical decision support system;intensive care units (ICUs);association rule mining, clinical risk prediction models","Association rules;Itemsets;Decision support systems;Biomedical measurements;Medical services;Clinical diagnosis;Predictive models;Intensive care units","","29","3","34","CCBY","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The circulant rational covariance extension problem considered in this paper is a modification of this problem to partial stochastic realization of periodic stationary process, which are better represented on the discrete unit circle rather than on the discrete real line . The corresponding matrix completion problem then amounts to completing a finite-dimensional Toeplitz matrix that is circulant. Another important motivation for this problem is that it provides a natural approximation, involving only computations based on the fast Fourier transform, for the ordinary rational covariance extension problem, potentially leading to an efficient numerical procedure for the latter. The circulant rational covariance extension problem is an inverse problem with infinitely many solutions in general, each corresponding to a bilateral ARMA representation of the underlying periodic process. In this paper, we present a complete smooth parameterization of all solutions and convex optimization procedures for determining them.

However, their use with composites requires some technique development because of reflections at the layer boundaries and the effects of attenuation. When used in full matrix capture mode, algorithms such as the total focusing method (TFM) must be applied to obtain the image. In composite materials, improvement to the algorithm is required to include the effects of material anisotropy (affecting wave speed) and optimum aperture limits to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio and location detection for a defect in the material. This paper presents simulations of the ultrasonic array signals in multilayer anisotropic materials with and without a simulated defect. A kernel model for plane wave propagation in the material is combined with an angular spectrum decomposition (for finite transducer elements) and transducer frequency response, to model the full array signals. Inclusion of the defect is through its far-field scattering response. The model facilitates the study of imaging algorithm development by identification of the effects of anisotropy, signal-to-noise ratio, and aperture limit. An analytical method for the calculation of the effective group velocity in the composite at low frequency is demonstrated, permitting rapid calculation of time delay laws in practice.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587402","","Arrays;Mathematical model;Finite element analysis;Acoustics;Transducers;Nonhomogeneous media;Stress","Computer Simulation;High-Energy Shock Waves;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Manufactured Materials;Materials Testing;Models, Chemical;Scattering, Radiation;Ultrasonography","29","","43","IEEE","2 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To extract the vascular anatomy, light scattering in the tissue was modelled using a point spread function (PSF). The PSF was parametrized by optical tissue excitation and emission attenuation coefficients, which were estimated by fitting simulated images of microspheres convolved with the PSF model to the experimental microsphere images. These parameters were then applied within a new model-based method for vessel radius estimation. Current state-of-the-art radii estimation methods and the proposed model-based method were applied on vessel phantoms. In this validation study, the full-width half-maximum method of radii estimation, when performed on the raw data without correcting for the optical blurring, resulted in 42.9% error on average for the ${170}~\mu{\rm m}$  vessel.

Because of the explosive growth of smart devices such as smart phones and sensors, the number of such devices has also grown phenomenally that require real time communication demanding quality of service (QoS)-centric applications for CPSs, such as smart grid, medical, and traffic control systems, which construct smart society. To deal with such situations, the FiWi access networks may be a suitable choice since they are capable of providing both wide bandwidth and flexibility. However, combining the WLAN and PON in FiWi that are inherently different networking technologies leads to inefficient data transmission in the point of junction of the WLAN and PON. Therefore, the QoS of real time communication degrades significantly. In this paper, we address this problem involving QoS degradation in the FiWi networks, and propose a QoS control scheme, which is based on cooperation between the WLAN and PON. Through computer-based simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the QoS performance of the FiWi access networks for CPSs.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2278699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584774","Fiber-wireless (FiWi);passive optical network (PON);quality of service (QoS)","Quality of service;Optical network units;Passive optical networks;Bandwidth;Wireless LAN;IEEE 802.11e Standard;Wireless communication","","28","","21","CCBY","22 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, a fault-tolerant control strategy is presented for the longitudinal model of an AHV, which guarantees that velocity and altitude track their reference trajectories at an exponential convergence rate. However, this method needs to know the minimum value of the actuator efficiency factor and the upper bound of the external disturbances, which makes it not easy to implement. Then an improved adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed, where two adaptive laws are employed to estimate the upper bound of the external disturbances and the minimum value of the actuator efficiency factor, respectively. Secondly, the problem of designing a control scheme with control constraints is further considered, and a new adaptive fault-tolerant control strategy with input saturation is designed to guarantee that velocity and altitude track their reference trajectories. Finally, simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2013.00057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550960","airbreathing hypersonic vehicle (AHV);fault-tolerant control (FTC);adaptive control;input saturation","Fault tolerant systems;Fault tolerance;Actuators;Attitude control;Adaptive control;Vehicle dynamics;Upper bound","","27","","","","10 Jul 2013","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Mobile device challenges such as storage limitation have, however, introduced the problem of mobile multimedia overload to users. To tackle this problem, researchers have developed various techniques that recommend multimedia for mobile users. In this paper, we examine the importance of mobile multimedia recommendation systems from the perspective of three smart communities, namely mobile social learning, mobile event guide, and context-aware services. A cautious analysis of existing research reveals that the implementation of proactive, sensor-based and hybrid recommender systems can improve mobile multimedia recommendations.

These markers form a new diagnosis tool “NAT” aiming at characterizing various brain disorders. Each signal sequence is divided into segments of 0.64 s and its discrete PS consists of eleven frequency components from 4.68 (3 × 1.56) Hz through 20.34 (13 × 1.56) Hz. PS is normalized to its mean and the bias of PS components on each frequency component across the 21 signal channels is reset to zero. The marker sNAT consists often frequency components on 21 channels, characterizing neuronal hyperactivity or hypoactivity as compared with NLc (normal controls). The marker vNAT consists of ten ratios between adjacent PS components denoting the over- or undersynchrony of collective neuronal activities as compared with NLc. The likelihood of a test subject to a specified brain disease is defined in terms of the normalized distance to the template NAT state of the disease in the NAT space. Separation of MCI-AD patients (developing AD in 12-18 months) from NLc is made with a false alarm rate of 15%. Locations with neuronal hypoactivity and undersynchrony of AD patients agree with locations of rCBF reduction measured by SPECT.

The principle of the filter is based on a vector SBS process, which is different from the previously reported scalar SBS technique. For a radio-frequency (RF) modulated signal launched to the proposed processor, the state of polarization (SOP) of the optical carrier is rotated by 90 $^{\circ}$ through a two-step SBS process. As a result, the RF signals cannot be recovered in the photodetector (PD). To recover the desirable RF signal, the SOP of the RF modulated sideband is rotated by another pump wave. Since the orthogonal polarization condition between the optical carrier and the sideband is destroyed, the desirable RF signal can be recovered. By adjusting the wavelength of the pump wave, the frequency response of the filter is tunable in a frequency range from $\sim$2 to 20 GHz with out-of-band rejection of $\sim$30 dB and $-$3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$ 20 MHz. In addition, for any modulation format, it is converted to the single-sideband (SSB) modulation by the proposed filter. Therefore, the system is expected to be immune to the fiber dispersion-induced power fading. Moreover, it is independent of the modulation formats of the incoming signal wave. The filter structure can be inserted anywhere in conventional fiber-optic links without the need for modifying the link configuration and the transmitter.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2271716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553226","Microwave photonic filter;stimulated Brillouin scattering","Microwave filters;Scattering;Optical fiber filters;Optical fibers;Optical pumping","","26","","35","Crown","4 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the optimal exploration path depends heavily on the objectives and constraints that both these operations and environments introduce. Typical environment constraints include partially known or completely unknown workspaces, limited-bandwidth communications, and sparse or dense clattered spaces. In such environments, the exploration robots must satisfy additional operational constraints, including time-critical goals, kinematic modeling, and resource limitations. Finding the optimal exploration path under these multiple constraints and objectives constitutes a challenging non-convex optimization problem. In our approach, we model the environment constraints in cost functions and utilize the cognitive-based adaptive optimization algorithm to meet time-critical objectives. The exploration path produced is optimal in the sense of globally minimizing the required time as well as maximizing the explored area of a partially unknown workspace. Since obstacles are sensed during operation, initial paths are possible to be blocked leading to a robot entrapment. A supervisor is triggered to signal a blocked passage and subsequently escape from the basin of cost function local minimum. Extensive simulations and comparisons in typical scenarios are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed approach.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2283031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605521","Autonomous agents;optimization methods;path planning;cognitive robotics","Robot sensing systems;Cost function;Robot kinematics;Approximation methods;Mobile robots","","26","","41","OAPA","20 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper aims to validate the quality indicators provided as uncertainty estimates with the GSICS correction. The methodology presented provides a framework to allow quantitative tradeoffs between the collocation criteria and the number of collocations generated to recommend further algorithm improvements. It is shown that random errors dominate systematic ones and that combined standard uncertainties (with coverage factor k = 1) in the corrected brightness temperatures are ~ 0.01 K for typical clear sky conditions but increase rapidly for low radiances - by more than one order of magnitude for 210 K scenes, corresponding to cold cloud tops.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2236330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450080","Calibration;Earth Observing System;infrared (IR) image sensors;measurement uncertainty;meteorology","Uncertainty;Systematics;Instruments;Standards;Sensitivity;Calibration;Clouds","","26","","18","IEEE","5 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lobula giant movement detectors (LGMD) and directional selective neurons (DSNs) are two types of identified neurons found in the visual pathways of insects such as locusts. Recent modeling studies showed that the LGMD or grouped DSNs could each be tuned for collision recognition. In both biological and artificial vision systems, however, which one should play the collision recognition role and the way the two types of specialized visual neurons could be functioning together are not clear. In this modeling study, we compared the competence of the LGMD and the DSNs, and also investigate the cooperation of the two neural vision systems for collision recognition via artificial evolution. We implemented three types of collision recognition neural subsystems - the LGMD, the DSNs and a hybrid system which combines the LGMD and the DSNs subsystems together, in each individual agent. A switch gene determines which of the three redundant neural subsystems plays the collision recognition role. We found that, in both robotics and driving environments, the LGMD was able to build up its ability for collision recognition quickly and robustly therefore reducing the chance of other types of neural networks to play the same role. The results suggest that the LGMD neural network could be the ideal model to be realized in hardware for collision recognition.","1943-0612","","10.1109/TAMD.2013.2255050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6491449","Collision recognition;competition;directional selective neuron;lobula giant movement detectors (LGMD);locust;redundant function;visual motion","Visualization;Neurons;Switches;Collision avoidance;Machine vision;Robots;Evolution (biology)","","25","","69","IEEE","1 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper details the results of the training using both approaches, and the correlations found between the modeling and/or programming performance and cognitive abilities, interest, workload, expertise, and school grades. In general, the results show that students can be trained to carry out authentic programming tasks within one and a half days, even for beginners in programming. The data distinguish the two approaches. Function Block Diagram programming (IEC 61131-3) can be best predicted by the grade in mathematics, programming experience, and cognitive demand. For performance in UML class diagram and state chart (UML/CD+SC) modeling, the grade in mathematics plays an even more prominent role; this explains the greater variance in modeling performance in the UML group than in the 61131/Function Block Diagram group.

In this paper, to improve the security status of current mobile apps, we propose a methodology to evaluate mobile apps based on cloud computing platform and data mining. We also present a prototype system named MobSafe to identify the mobile app's virulence or benignancy. Compared with traditional method, such as permission pattern based method, MobSafe combines the dynamic and static analysis methods to comprehensively evaluate an Android app. In the implementation, we adopt Android Security Evaluation Framework (ASEF) and Static Android Analysis Framework (SAAF), the two representative dynamic and static analysis methods, to evaluate the Android apps and estimate the total time needed to evaluate all the apps stored in one mobile app market. Based on the real trace from a commercial mobile app market called AppChina, we can collect the statistics of the number of active Android apps, the average number apps installed in one Android device, and the expanding ratio of mobile apps. As mobile app market serves as the main line of defence against mobile malwares, our evaluation results show that it is practical to use cloud computing platform and data mining to verify all stored apps routinely to filter out malware apps from mobile app markets. As the future work, MobSafe can extensively use machine learning to conduct automotive forensic analysis of mobile apps based on the generated multifaceted data in this stage.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6574680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574680","Android platform;mobile malware detection;cloud computing;forensic analysis;machine learning;redis key-value store;big data;hadoop distributed file system;data mining","Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Malware;Cloud computing;Smart phones","","25","","","","5 Aug 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The silicon-doping is performed from pre-patterned solid diffusion sources, which allow for the precise adjustment of phosphorus- and boron-doping levels. Based on the investigated process technologies, BC-BJ solar cells with gap and without gap between adjacent $n^{+}$- and $p^{+}$ -doped areas were processed.

In CPSs, real time and reliable monitoring require an accurate and stable model of the wireless sensor network (WSN)-based monitoring system. Furthermore, WSNs require strict quality of service (QoS) provisioning as the data generated by the monitored equipment is generally delay and reliability-sensitive. QoS provisioning in WSNs has been widely studied in the literature where most of the work addresses the issue by QoS-aware protocol design. However, analytical models that consider delay, throughput, and power consumption have not matured for CPSs. In this paper, we propose a Markov-based model for cluster-tree WSN topologies that enhances the stability of the WSNs. Cluster-tree deployments are particularly of interest to cyber-physical power grid monitoring systems since they are suitable for large-scale deployments. We perform an exhaustive performance evaluation using different traffic and network conditions in star and cluster-tree WSN topologies. Furthermore, we test the accuracy of our model by performing simulations in environments that are consistent with the analytical model.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2281192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6594851","Cyber-physical systems;IEEE 802.15.4;smart grid;wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks;IEEE 802.15 standards;Quality of service;Analytical models;Smart grids;Real-time systems;Mathematical model;Monitoring","","24","","44","CCBY","9 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some earlier relevant engineering approaches in multistream automatic recognition of speech (ASR) that aimed at processing of noisy speech and at dealing with unexpected out-of-vocabulary words are reviewed. The paper also reviews some currently active research in multistream ASR, focusing mainly on feedback-based techniques involving fusion of information between individual processing streams. The difference between the system behavior on its training data and during its operation is proposed as a substitute for the human ability of “knowing when knowing.” Most recent results indicate 9% relative improvement in error rates in phoneme recognition of high signal-to-noise ratio speech and as high as 30% relative improvements in moderate noise.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2012.2236871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6428587","Auditory perception;confidence measures;machine learning;speech recognition;unexpected information","Speech processing;Information processing;Speech recognition;Context awareness;Acoustic signal processing;Noise measurement;Audio systems","","24","","96","IEEE","1 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their pros and cons are highlighted and compared with the features of the well-known impact factor (IF) to show how alternative metrics are specifically designed to address the flaws that the IF was shown to have, especially in the last few years. We also report the results of recent studies in the bibliometric literature showing how the scientific impact of journals as evaluated by bibliometrics is a very complicated matter and it is completely unrealistic to try to capture it by any single indicator, such as the IF or any other. As such, we conclude that the adoption of more metrics, with complementary features, to assess journal quality would be very beneficial as it would both offer a more comprehensive and balanced view of each journal in the space of scholarly publications, as well as eliminate the pressure on individuals and their incentive to do metric manipulation which is an unintended result of the current (mis)use of the IF as the gold standard for publication quality.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2261115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6515033","Bibliometrics;Impact Factor;Journal Ranking;Eigenfactor;Popularity Indicators;Prestige Indicators;Research Evaluation","Bibliometrics;Indexes;Market research;Measurement;Terminology;Publishing;Citation analysis","","24","","57","OAPA","10 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current methods for monitoring waterborne pathogens are often time consuming, expensive, and labor intensive, making them not suitable for these regions. Electrochemical detection in a microfluidic platform offers many advantages such as portability, minimal use of instrumentation, and easy integration with electronics. In many parts of the world, however, the required equipment for pathogen detection through electrochemical sensors is either not available or insufficiently portable, and operators may not be trained to use these sensors and interpret results, ultimately preventing its wide adoption. Counterintuitively, these same regions often have an extensive mobile phone infrastructure, suggesting the possibility of integrating electrochemical detection of bacterial pathogens with a mobile platform. Toward a solution to water quality interventions, we demonstrate a microfluidic electrochemical sensor combined with a mobile interface that detects the sequences from bacterial pathogens, suitable for rapid, affordable, and point-of-care water monitoring. We employ the transduction of DNA hybridization into a readily detectable electric signal by means of a conformational change of DNA stem-loop structure. Using this platform, we successfully demonstrate the detection of as low as 100 nM E. coli sequences and the automatic interpretation and mapping of the detection results via a mobile application.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2013.2281819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6600752","Biosensors;electrochemical devices;biomedical telemetry;mobile computing;cellular phones","Mobile communication;Pathogens;Electrodes;DNA;Water pollution;Microfluidics;Water resources;Biosensors;Biomedical telemetry;Cellular phones;Wireless communication","","24","","45","IEEE","16 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Similar bias was found previously for GOES-12 and for other instruments (the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) in the similar spectral region. It was often suspected that the spectral response function (SRF) of these instruments may be in error; in some cases, it had been demonstrated that an altered SRF can eliminate most of the differences between the measured and the expected values. Using products recently developed for the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System, this paper concluded that an SRF error is the root cause for the GOES Imager Channel 6 bias. Based on this theory, an algorithm was developed to correct for the bias. Application of this correction to GOES-13 Imager Channel 6 resulted in an SRF shift of -2.1 cm-1. The remaining biases have mean of nearly zero and much reduced standard deviation and are independent of the thermal structure of the interlaying atmosphere. This correction has also been successfully applied of other channels and of other GOES, which was described in a companion paper.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2236100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450090","Calibration;Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES);Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS);spectral response","Calibration;Instruments;Satellites;Atmospheric measurements;Sea measurements;Atmosphere;Water pollution","","23","","30","IEEE","5 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fringe capacitance is a parasitic effect that leads to a decrease of about 20% in the modulation bandwidth of typical SOI diodes without a corresponding increase in the modulation efficiency. From the scaling relations, the most effective way to increase the modulation bandwidth is to reduce the series resistance of the diode.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2240381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413159","Silicon photonics;$pn$ junctions;optical modulators;analytical modeling","Capacitance;Analytical models;Optical waveguides;Optical modulation;Junctions;Bandwidth","","23","","38","IEEE","16 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome these limitations, we combine suitable slices of broadened and nonbroadened spectra. The concept was experimentally verified: A total number of 325 consecutive equidistant subcarriers span a bandwidth of 4 THz. All subcarriers have an optical carrier-power-to-noise-power-density ratio (OCNR) larger than 25.8 dB (0.1 nm) and were derived from one mode-locked laser with a mode linewidth of approximately 1 kHz. The signal quality of the comb and in particular of each subcarrier was ultimately tested in a terabit-per-second communication experiment.

The process can be repeated to obtain higher aspect ratios. The relief structures fabricated with this technology are presented and discussed. In order to explore a possible application of our technique optical waveguides were created in the best quality structures by means of a multi-step carbon ion implantation process with ten different energies followed by an annealing at 280°C for 30 minutes. In this way a step-like enhanced extraordinary refractive index profile was obtained inside the ridges extending from surface to a depth of 2.75 μm.

Choosing an appropriate reference surface to contain an antenna element, an associated generalized transition matrix (GTM) is defined to establish the relationships between the rotated tangential components of incident field and scattered field on the reference surface. Meanwhile, a mapping vector is constructed to map the excitation sources onto the reference surface as the rotated tangential radiation field components. A GTM module for an antenna unit with feeding source consists of a GTM, a mapping vector, and a specified reference surface. The radiation pattern and mutual coupling effects among units can be analyzed by using the GTM modules of all units, in conjunction with the generalized surface integral equations (GSIEs). The interaction of the excitation port information is included in the field transmission process between the GTM modules as well. For a phased antenna array with fixed element structure and array size, the GTM modules and the coupling matrices among units do not change with the amplitude or phase of the feeding sources. The proposed method is particularly efficient to analyze the property of beam scanning and sidelobe level adjustment of a large-scale phased antenna array.

The design uses “active-shunt” current diversion principles. At its core, the design employs a low-voltage high-current switch-mode amplifier to divert current out of the mechanical contacts and into a pair of anti-parallel thyristors. Commutation between transformer taps may then be performed by the thyristors. The amplifier and thyristors are placed outside the normal load current path and only conduct during a tap change, producing efficiency savings and improving robustness when compared to previous hybrid onload tap changer implementations. An amplifier control loop that autonomously produces zero-current conditions at switch opening and zero-voltage conditions at switch closure is demonstrated. Experimental results investigating the wear characteristics of contacts operated under the new hybrid diverter are presented, along with comparison results from a passive-type switching scheme.

Currently used generalization error estimation procedures, such as cross-validation (CV) or bootstrap, are stochastic and, thus, require multiple repetitions in order to produce reliable results, which can be computationally expensive, if not prohibitive. The correntropy-inspired density-preserving sampling (DPS) procedure proposed in this paper eliminates the need for repeating the error estimation procedure by dividing the available data into subsets that are guaranteed to be representative of the input dataset. This allows the production of low-variance error estimates with an accuracy comparable to 10 times repeated CV at a fraction of the computations required by CV. This method can also be used for model ranking and selection.

Most of the existing devices employ complex circuitry, and are thus bulky. These devices are usually connected to the electrode that is implanted into the animal brain using long fixed wires. In long term behavioral trials, however, laboratory animals often need to continuously receive brain stimulation for days without interruption, which is difficult with existing technology. This paper presents a low power and lightweight portable microdeep brain stimulation device for laboratory animals. Three different configurations of the device are presented as follows: 1) single piece head mountable; 2) single piece back mountable; and 3) two piece back mountable. The device can be easily carried by the animal during the course of a clinical trial, and that it can produce non-stop stimulation current pulses of desired characteristics for over 12 days on a single battery. It employs passive charge balancing to minimize undesirable effects on the target tissue. The results of bench, in-vitro, and in-vivo tests to evaluate the performance of the device are presented.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2013.2264093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523118","Deep brain stimulation;long-term stimulation;low-power lightweight device;stimulation current pulse","Psychology;Biological tissues;Electrodes;Bioelectric phenomena;Patient treatment;Brain models;Low power electronics","","21","1","10","Crown","4 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our CUSP (Course and Unit of Study Portal) system tackles this challenge, by helping subject teachers define the curriculum of their subject, linking it to Faculty and institutional goals. The same information is available to students, enabling them to see how each subject relates to those goals. It then gives additional big-picture views of the degree for the academics responsible for the whole degree, including the ability to easily assess if a degree meets accreditation requirements. CUSP achieves this by exploiting a lightweight semantic mapping approach that gives a highly flexible and scalable way to map learning goals from multiple internal and external accrediting sources across the degree. We report its validation as used in a live university environment, across three diverse faculties, with 277 degrees and 7,810 subject sessions over a period of three years. Data from this evaluation indicates steady improvement in the documentation of the relationships between subjects, assessments, learning outcomes, and program level goals. This is driven by the reporting tools and visualizations provided by CUSP, which enable program designers and lecturers to identify parts of the curriculum that are unclear. This improved documentation of the curriculum enables more accurate and immediate quality reviews. Key contributions of this work are: a validated new approach for curriculum design that helps address the complexity of ensuring learners progressively develop generic skills; and a validated lightweight semantic mapping approach that can flexibly support visualizing the curriculum against multiple sets of learning goal frameworks.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2012.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6261335","Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning;Curriculum mapping;Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning;graduate attributes;Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning;accreditation competencies;Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning;learner model","Education courses;Accreditation;Computer science education;Education;Electronic learning","","21","","52","IEEE","6 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This template aging effect manifests as a shift in the authentic distribution, resulting in an increased false non-match rate. Analyzing results from a three-year time-lapse data set, we find ${\sim}{\rm 150}\%$ increase in the false non-match rate at a decision threshold representing a one in two million false match rate.

This paper presents novel sensing-enabled defenses to unauthorized reading and relay attacks against RFID systems without necessitating any changes to the traditional RFID usage model. Specifically, this paper proposes the use of cyber-physical interfaces, on-board tag sensors, to (automatically) acquire useful contextual information about the tag's environment (or its owner, or the tag itself). First, such context recognition is leveraged for the purpose of selective tag unlocking-the tag will respond selectively to reader interrogations. In particular, novel mechanisms based on an owner's posture recognition are presented. Second, context recognition is used as a basis for transaction verification in order to provide protection against a severe form of relay attacks involving malicious RFID readers. A new mechanism is developed that can determine the proximity between a valid tag and a valid reader by correlating certain (specifically audio) sensor data extracted from the two devices. Our evaluation of the proposed mechanisms demonstrate their feasibility in significantly raising the bar against RFID attacks.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2290537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663617","RFID;relay attacks;context recognition;sensors","Radiofrequency identification;Magnetometers;Context awareness;Authorization;Accelerometers;Privacy;Tagging;Computer security;Authentication","","20","","38","CCBY","13 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this contribution, we measure the charge state distributions of aluminum and chromium ions from Al–Cr composite cathodes of different Al to Cr ratios. The arc discharges are pulsed, with pulse duration of around 300 $\mu{\rm s}$ and currents of 175 A, operated at high vacuum and in gases with a pressure of up to 1.3 Pa of Ar, ${\rm N}_{2}$, and ${\rm O}_{2}$. For comparison with literature data, the measurements also included the plasma compositions of discharges using pure Al and Cr cathodes. As expected, the charge distributions are found to be affected by the cathode conditions, the type of gas, and the pressure of the gas into which the arc spot plasma is expanding. Generally, large effects of gas are observed when the pressure exceeded 0.1 Pa, which can be mainly associated with the ions' mean-free path with respect to charge exchange collisions. Differences between ions can be attributed to the energy- and species-dependent charge-exchange cross sections. Considering different cathode compositions, we found that Cr ions tend to have lower charge states from the composite cathodes compared with the pure element cathode, whereas Al ions are relatively unaffected by the cathode composition. Despite the wealth of detailed experimental results, it is difficult to discern trends and rules that could be generalized because measured data involve a convolution of cathode phenomena and gas collisional effects.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2013.2254135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6507332","AlCr;cathodic arc;composite cathode;ionization;process gas","Cathodes;Ionization;Aluminum;Chromium;Arc discharges","","20","","40","IEEE","23 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To carry out the computation of the trajectory of the system, a hierarchical structure of the ODEs is exploited, and an ARK solver is implemented in compute unified device architecture/C++ (CUDA/C++) on GPUs. The result is a 75-fold speedup for calculations of 2436 independent modules within the genetic network describing clock function relative to a comparable CPU architecture. These 2436 modules span one-quarter of the entire genome of a model fungal system, Neurospora crassa. The power of a GPU can in principle be harnessed by using warp-level parallelism, instruction level parallelism or both of them. Since the ARK ODE solver is entirely sequential, we propose a new parallel processing algorithm using warp-level parallelism for solving ${\sim}{10\,000}$ ODEs that belong to a large genetic network describing clock genome-level dynamics.

Both encoders transmit a common message and, in addition, the encoder that knows the states noncausally transmits an individual message. We find explicit characterizations of the capacity region of this communication model in both discrete memoryless and memoryless Gaussian cases. In particular, the capacity region analysis demonstrates the utility of the knowledge of the states only strictly causally at the encoder that sends only the common message in general. More specifically, in the discrete memoryless setting, we show that such a knowledge is beneficial and increases the capacity region in general. In the Gaussian setting, we show that such a knowledge does not help, and the capacity is same as if the states were completely unknown at the encoder that sends only the common message. Furthermore, we also study the special case in which the two encoders transmit only the common message and show that the knowledge of the states only strictly causally at the encoder that sends only the common message is not beneficial in this case, in both discrete memoryless and memoryless Gaussian settings. The analysis also reveals optimal ways of exploiting the knowledge of the state only strictly causally at the encoder that sends only the common message when such a knowledge is beneficial. The encoders collaborate to convey to the decoder a lossy version of the state, in addition to transmitting the information messages through a generalized Gel'fand–Pinsker binning. Particularly important in this problem are the questions of 1) optimal ways of performing the state compression and 2) whether or not the compression indices should be decoded uniquely. By developing two optimal coding schemes that perform this state compression differently, we show that when used as parts of appropriately tuned encoding and decoding processes, both compression à-la noisy network coding by Lim  or the quantize-map-and-forward by Avestimeher , i.e., with no binning, and compression using Wyner–Ziv binning are optimal. The scheme that uses Wyner–Ziv binning shares elements with Cover and El Gamal original compress-and-forward, but differs from it mainly in that backward decoding is employed instead of forward decoding and the compression indices are not decoded uniquely. Finally, by exploring the properties of our outer bound, we show that, although not required in general, the compression indices can in fact be decoded uniquely essentially without altering the capacity region, but at the expense of larger alphabets sizes for the auxiliary random variables.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2013.2265553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6555864","Capacity;channel state information;multiaccess channels;noisy network coding;Wyner-Ziv binning","Decoding;Encoding;Random variables;Tin;Noise measurement;Indexes;Network coding","","20","","50","IEEE","9 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Quality depends on the regularity of the initial mesh, and in mechanical simulations it evolves in time, with deformations causing changes in volume and distortion of mesh elements. Mesh quality metrics are therefore relevant for both mesh personalization and the monitoring of the simulation process. This work evaluates the significance, in meshes with high order interpolation, of four quality metrics described in the literature, applying them to analyse the stability of the simulation of the heart beat. It also investigates how image registration and mesh warping parameters affect the quality and stability of meshes. Jacobian-based metrics outperformed or matched the results of coarse geometrical metrics of aspect ratio or orthogonality, although they are more expensive computationally. The stability of simulations of a complete heart cycle was best predicted with a specificity of 61%, sensitivity of 85%, and only nominal differences were found changing the intra-element and per-element combination of quality values. A compromise between fitting accuracy and mesh stability and quality was found. Generic geometrical quality metrics have a limited success predicting stability, and an analysis of the simulation problem may be required for an optimal definition of quality.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2012.2231094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6373735","Computational cardiac physiology;computational mesh;image registration;mesh quality;mesh stability","Measurement;Computational modeling;Jacobian matrices;Accuracy;Stability criteria;Mathematical model","Algorithms;Analysis of Variance;Computer Simulation;Heart;Heart;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Cardiovascular;Sensitivity and Specificity","20","","26","IEEE","3 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the critical limitations in the compact 3D photonic integration circuit is the through-Si-via (TSV)-induced stress, which affects the performances of Si photonic devices integrated in interposer. We build a model to analyze and simulate the wavelength shift of the ring resonator caused by the effective-refractive-index change in the waveguide, arising from TSV-induced stress in the SOI interposer. Double-cascaded ring resonators integrated in the SOI interposer were fabricated and their wavelength shifts were characterized. The results show that the resonance wavelength shift on the order of 0.1 nm can be caused by the TSV-induced stress for  $d/R\ <\ 3$, where $d$ and $R$ are the distance between the TSV and the Si waveguide, and the radius of TSV, respectively. This shift results in performance deviation from the target of design.

The cloud synchronization mechanism (in particular, how to deliver the user-side data updates to the cloud) plays a critical role in cloud sync services because it greatly affects the cloud operation cost (in terms of sync traffic) and user experience (in terms of sync delay). By comprehensively measuring tens of popular cloud sync services, we find that their cloud sync mechanisms differ greatly in sync performance and design granularity. Quite surprisingly, some very popular services (like GoogleDrive and 115 SyncDisk) utilize a quite coarse-grained cloud sync mechanism that may lead to severe traffic overuse. For example, updating 1-MB data may sometimes result in 260-MB sync traffic. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of various cloud sync mechanisms by analyzing their respective pros and cons under different situations, unravel the pathological processes for their traffic overuse problems, and finally provide insights/solutions for better choosing/designing a cloud sync service.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2013.6522587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522587","cloud storage;data synchronization;operation cost;user experience;design granularity","","","19","","","","3 Jun 2013","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

An important element in supporting shared access is coordinating the scheduling of the laboratory usage. Optimized scheduling can significantly decrease access waiting times and improve the utilization level of RL resources, with associated reductions in per-use costs. Current RL systems have typically supported scheduling based on either reservations or queuing, though rarely both. In this paper, we investigate issues that arise when a single RL resource (or pool of resources) supports both modes for gaining access, and how these two approaches can be effectively integrated. This research analyzes the scheduling algorithm utilized by the Sahara RL system to investigate any limitations that affect the system utilization. We identify a number of current issues and propose specific modifications to address them. The proposed modifications will lead to increased utilization and improved student experiences.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2013.5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413147","Remote laboratories;Scheduling;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Scheduling algorithms;Resource management;Electronic learning;Education;Computer-assisted instruction;Remote laboratories;Scheduling;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Scheduling algorithms;Resource management;Electronic learning;Education;education;Remote laboratories;Scheduling;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Scheduling algorithms;Resource management;Electronic learning;Education;physical sciences and engineering;Remote laboratories;Scheduling;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Scheduling algorithms;Resource management;Electronic learning;Education;scheduling","Remote laboratories;Scheduling;Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Scheduling algorithms;Resource management;Electronic learning;Education","","19","","37","IEEE","16 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we venture into exploring high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or imaging radar method for melt pond mapping, which is not severely disrupted by cloud or low solar zenith angle. We analyzed high-resolution airborne SAR images (0.3-m resolution) of midsummer sea ice, acquired from a helicopter-borne SAR system in the northern Chukchi Sea. The pond area and shape (circularity) derived from the airborne SAR images showed that the statistics were comparable to those previously observed from aerial photographs. We argue that high-resolution SAR, together with one-to-one comparison with coincident aerial photographs, can be used to map melt ponds at a level of detail comparable to aerial photography or high-resolution optical satellite remote sensing. Our encouraging results suggest the possibility of using high-resolution SAR (current or future systems) to map melt ponds in the Arctic region.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2012.2226411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407652","Future synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system;high-resolution SAR;melt pond;sea ice","Synthetic aperture radar;Image resolution;Sea surface;Sea ice;Satellites;Arctic;Remote sensing;Photography;Aerial photography","","19","","31","IEEE","9 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After FY-3A, FY-3B MERSI is the second launched in November 2010. Nineteen of the 20 MERSI spectral bands are the reflective solar bands, which cannot be absolutely calibrated onboard. The annual vicarious calibration (VC) based on synchronous in situ measurements at the Dunhuang site is the baseline calibration method for MERSI. To assure frequent and stable calibration updates, a multisite calibration tracking method is developed. This paper presents the FY-3B MERSI postlaunch daily calibration updating method based on multisite calibration tracking with the Dunhuang VC correction, the long-term sensor response on-orbit change, and the calibration performance evaluation. A reflectance-based method is used for the Dunhuang VC, and the reflectance calibration uncertainties are within 3% for most MERSI bands. The multisite calibration tracking method relies on simulated radiation over several stable sites without synchronous in situ measurements. A postlaunch daily calibration updating model is established using a linear function of days since launch to describe the long-term trend. The calibration updating model is validated by the Dunhuang VC, showing the relative bias within 3.5% for most bands. It is found that the shortwave channels of MERSI experience large degradation, particularly the 412-nm band with an annual degradation rate of approximately 18%, whereas most red and near-infrared bands are relatively stable. Using the calibration updating model with the Dunhuang VC correction, the recalibrated MERSI data are validated against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer by near synchronous-nadir-observation analysis, and good agreement is achieved.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2217345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6336809","Dunhuang site vicarious calibration (VC);FY-3B MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI);multisite calibration tracking;on-orbit response change;reflective solar bands (RSBs)","Calibration;MODIS;Satellites;Atmospheric measurements;Aerosols;Optical surface waves","","19","","24","IEEE","22 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this new swarm, the evolution operation is maintained with the PSO algorithm, using the parameter of pop_distr to balance the global and local search capacity of the algorithm, as well as, adopting the parameter of mix_gen to control mixing times of the algorithm.

These factors which affect the adequacy and security of the power supply in a similar manner as the transmission congestion of physical grids does, can be called by a generic term as generalized congestion. Competitive manipulations and “game-playing” between various interested parties further intensifies these congestions. Here, from the perspective of generalized congestions, the paper reflects the inevitability of India's massive blackouts, discusses occasional effects of trigger events, inherent evolution law of blackouts and the enlightenment on power industry in China, and explores risk control measures to defend blackouts in China.

X-to-MapReduce (X is a program language) translator is a possible solution to help traditional programmers easily deploy an application to cloud systems through translating sequential codes to MapReduce codes. Recently, some SQL-to-MapReduce translators emerge to translate SQL-like queries to MapReduce codes and have good performance in cloud systems. However, SQL-to-MapReduce translators mainly focus on SQL-like queries, but not on numerical computation. Matlab is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming, which is very popular in engineering. We propose and develop a simple Matlab-to-MapReduce translator for cloud computing, called M2M, for basic numerical computations. M2M can translate a Matlab code with up to 100 commands to MapReduce code in few seconds, which may cost a proficient Hadoop MapReduce programmer some days on coding so many commands. In addition, M2M can also recognize the dependency between complex commands, which is always confusing during hand coding. We implemented M2M with evaluation for Matlab commands on a cluster. Several common commands are used in our experiments.

Existing solutions either tend to compromise propagation delay or do not reach high reliability due to broadcast storm problem caused by excessive retransmissions. We propose Receiver Consensus, which exploits geographical information to help nodes autonomously achieve agreement on forwarding strategies. Each forwarding candidate ranks itself and its neighbors (who affirmatively or potentially received the message already) by distance to the centroid of neighbors in need of message, to assign different priority in forwarding among neighboring nodes and remarkably suppress unnecessary retransmission, while enabling best nodes to transmit the packet without waiting. The effectiveness and efficiency of this method are validated through extensive simulations under 802.11p settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves the high reliability of leading state-of-the-art solutions, while at the same time significantly enhances timeliness, dedicating itself to disseminating emergency messages in 2D vehicular networks. Our solution is also superior to all existing solutions in 1-D scenarios. The algorithm is also generalized for vehicles with heterogeneous transmission ranges as follows. Candidate neighbors are ranked using d-r instead of d for ranking, where d is the distance to the ideal forwarding location and r is the communication range of a node.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2273445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560349","VANET;location-assisted;routing;mobile computing","Ad hoc networks;Vehicle ad hoc networks;Receivers;Intelligent vehicles;Relays;Road vehicles;Delays","","18","","26","IEEE","16 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In many applications, especially those aggregating or processing a large amount of data over large spatial regions or long spans of time or both, the workload would be too heavy for any CPS element (or node) to finish on its own. How to enable the CPS nodes to efficiently collaborate with each other to accommodate more CPS services is a very challenging problem and deserves systematic research. In this paper, we present a cross-layer optimization framework for hybrid crowdsourcing in the CPSs to facilitate heavy-duty computation. Particularly, by joint computing resource management, routing, and link scheduling, we formulate an offline finite-queue-aware CPS service maximization problem to crowdsource nodes' computing tasks in a CPS. We then find both lower and upper bounds on the optimal result of the problem. In addition, the lower bound result is proved to be a feasible result that guarantees all queues in the network are finite, i.e., network strong stability. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the proposed algorithms' performance.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2273358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558766","Cyber-physical systems;crowdsourcing;stochastic optimization;network strong stability","Crowdsourcing;Base stations;Resource management;Processor scheduling;Interference;Heuristic algorithms;Computational modeling;Stochastic systems","","18","","38","CCBY","15 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

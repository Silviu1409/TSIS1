The grid integration of renewables will be continuously enhanced in the future. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), renewable technology is the main pathway to reach zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2060. Power electronics have played and will continue to play a significant role in this energy transition by providing efficient electrical energy conversion, distribution, transmission, and utilization. Consequently, the development of power electronics technologies, i.e., new semiconductor devices, flexible converters, and advanced control schemes, is promoted extensively across the globe. Among various renewables, wind energy and photovoltaic (PV) are the most widely used, and accordingly these are explored in this paper to demonstrate the role of power electronics. The development of renewable energies and the demands of power electronics are reviewed first. Then, the power conversion and control technologies as well as grid codes for wind and PV systems are discussed.

The hierarchical topology is a combination of clustering and the labeling of sensor nodes as Gaussian integers. Accordingly, the network area is divided into small square grids, the cluster head of each grid is represented by a Gaussian integer. These cluster heads are connected together to create a Gaussian network. Through node symmetry, and the shortest distance in the Gaussian network, as well as the advantages of multi-path routing, this paper proposes a hybrid fault-tolerant clustering routing protocol based on Gaussian network for wireless sensor network (FCGW). The purpose of FCGW is to improve fault tolerance, increase data reliability and reduce energy consumption for wireless sensor networks. The experimental results of the proposed scheme show that FCGW protocol has high data reliability. In addition, the FCGW protocol consumes about 48% of the energy in the network, while other protocols consume 70% more energy.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9541338","Clustering;fault-tolerance;Gaussian network;multi-path routing;wireless sensor network","Fault tolerant systems;Fault tolerance;Wireless sensor networks;Routing;Energy consumption;Routing protocols;Network topology","","31","","","","20 Sep 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

A key operational aspect in UAV-aided 5G/6G networks is the UAV path optimization (or trajectory planning as it is also commonly referred to). In this paper, we address this problem using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for FBS path optimization in terms of traveling time considering co-channel interference and time windows in serving ground users (GUs) at cluster points (CPs) for constructing the multiple UAV paths in both a single-cell and a multi-cell wireless network. In the proposed technique, we assume that all FBSs depart and return to a single depot, which is considered to be a terrestrial 5G/6G base station (BS). The novelty of the proposed solution compared to previous techniques is that we take explicitly into account the interference under the unit disk graph (UDG) model to create interference-aware UAV's trajectory. Numerical investigations reveal that the proposed interference-aware path optimization approaches improve the overall performance of the network up to approximately 21% in terms of throughput for the FBSs. Notably, these gains come with an unnoticeable increase in the total completion time, which is comparable to well-known previously proposed solutions. Additionally, the proposed heuristic algorithms provide competitive decision making with low underlying computational complexity rendering them amenable for real-time implementation.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2022.000006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9718364","Flying base station (FBS);interference model;mixed integer linear programming (MILP);multi-cell;path planning;unit disk graph (UDG);unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Interference;Trajectory planning;Optimization;Trajectory;Wireless networks;Power control;Autonomous aerial vehicles","","22","","","","23 Feb 2022","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Similarly, molecular fingerprint similarity and information entropy similarity of metabolites are integrated as the final metabolite similarity. Then, DeepWalk is used to extract metabolite features based on the network of metabolite-gene associations. Finally, a random forest algorithm is employed to infer metabolite-disease associations. The experimental results show that DWRF has good performances in terms of the area under the curve value, leave-one-out cross-validation, and five-fold cross-validation.

There is a general tendency that multiple users share the same computing cluster. The schedule of multiple jobs becomes a serious challenge. Over a long period in the past, the Shortest-Job-First (SJF) method has been considered as the optimal solution to minimize the average job completion time. However, the SJF method leads to a low system throughput in the case where a small number of short jobs consume a large amount of resources. This factor prolongs the average job completion time. We propose an improved heuristic job scheduling method, called the Densest-Job-Set-First (DJSF) method. The DJSF method schedules jobs by maximizing the number of completed jobs per unit time, aiming to decrease the average Job Completion Time (JCT) and improve the system throughput. We perform extensive simulations based on Google cluster data. Compared with the SJF method, the DJSF method decreases the average JCT by 23.19% and enhances the system throughput by 42.19%. Compared with Tetris, the job packing method improves the job completion efficiency by 55.4%, so that the computing platforms complete more jobs in a short time span.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552662","big data;job scheduling;job throughput;job completion time;job completion efficiency","Schedules;Throughput;Big Data;Yarn;Sparks;Scheduling;Internet","","14","","","","29 Sep 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Particularly, our contributions are threefold: (1) Different from existing methods, we propose a new strategy to calculate sorting values and verify their importance for graph classification. Our strategy does not only use features of simple nodes but also their neighbors for the accurate evaluation of its importance. (2) We design a new graph convolutional layer architecture with the residual connection. By feeding discarded features back into the network architecture, we reduce the probability of losing critical features for graph classification. (3) We propose a new method for graph-level representation. The messages for each node are aggregated separately, and then different attention levels are assigned to each node and merged into a graph-level representation to retain structural and critical information for classification. Our experimental results show that our method leads to state-of-the-art results on multiple graph classification benchmarks.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645437","graph neural network;graph pooling;information loss","Feature extraction;Convolution;Stacking;Task analysis;Graph neural networks;Aggregates;Topology","","14","","","","9 Dec 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To overcome this issue, we develop a visual information based social force model to simulate the interpretable evacuation process from the perspective of visual perception. Numerical experiments indicate that the evacuation efficiency and decision-making ability promote rapidly within a small range with the increase in unbalanced prior knowledge. The propagation of acceleration behavior caused by emergencies is asymmetric due to the anisotropy of visual information. Therefore, this model effectively characterizes the effect of visual information on crowd evacuation and provides new insights into the information perception of individuals in complex scenarios.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9614079","crowd evacuation;visual information;social force model;decision-making","Visualization;Force;Numerical models;Friction;Visual perception;Psychology;Safety","","13","","","","12 Nov 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Although Polysomnography (PSG) is considered as one of the assessment methods, it is poorly tolerated and expensive. In this paper, with the recent development of Internet-of-Things devices and edge computing techniques, we propose a detrended fractal dimension (DFD) feature for the analysis of heart-rate signals, which can be easily acquired by many wearables, of good sleepers and insomniacs. This feature was derived by calculating the fractal dimension (FD) of detrended signals. For the trend component removal, we improved the null space pursuit algorithm and proposed an adaptive trend extraction algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed DFD index through numerical statistics and significance testing for healthy and insomnia groups, which renders it a potential biomarker for insomnia assessment and management.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552660","insomnia;fractal dimension;adaptive signal separation;hypothesis testing","Market research;Sleep;Fractals;Heart rate variability;Physiology;Indexes;Null space","","12","","","","29 Sep 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Consequently, the handover rate for these extremely dense networks is expected to be very high. To reduce the burden caused by rapid handover requests, and to support a massive number of highly mobile devices in 5G and beyond networks, this study suggests using proximity-based clusters as nomadic cells integrated with Aerial Access Networks (AANs). These nomadic cells are formed by two-levels hierarchical partitioning of the mobile devices into proximity-based clusters. Previous distributed mobility management schemes are not sufficiently efficient to support the handover rate expected for 5G and beyond networks. Due to their high computational complexity, previous group-based methods are not applicable for real-time services. In contrast to these schemes, the proposed scheme is scalable with the number of devices. Moreover, the creation of a mobility group raises practical as well as security and privacy issues that were overlooked by previous schemes.

In this study, an optimized relinearization algorithm of CDKS19 is proposed. This algorithm reorganizes the evaluation key during the key generation process, decreases the complexity of relinearization, and reduces the error growth rate during homomorphic evaluation. First, we reduce the scale of the evaluation key by increasing its modulus instead of using a gadget vector to decompose the user's public key and extend the ciphertext of homomorphic multiplication. Second, we use rescaling technology to optimize the relinearization algorithm; thus, the error bound of the ciphertext is reduced, and the homomorphic operation efficiency is improved. Lastly, the average-case error estimation on the variances of polynomial coefficients and the upper bound of the canonical embedding map are provided. Results show that our scheme reduces the scale of the evaluation key, the error variance, and the computational cost of the relinearization process.

Instead of deleting the unidirectional links in the whole networks used in traditional ant colony algorithm (TACA), we make the best of unidirectional links, and then the performance of network will be improved. Also, in order to control the energy consumption speed of nodes and prevent premature death of nodes, we put the node energy as the routing factor in the routing, thus the lifetime of the whole network will be increased.

By making use of the stochastic hybrid system (SHS) method, we provide a derivation of the average AoI of a system of two parallel queues (with and without buffer capabilities) and compare the results with those of a single queue. We show that known results of packets delay in Queuing Theory do not hold for the AoI. Unfortunately, the complexity of computing the average AoI using the SHS method increases highly with the number of queues. We therefore provide an upper bound of the average AoI in a system of an arbitrary number of M/M/1/(N+1)∗ queues and show its tightness in various regimes. This upper bound allows providing a tight approximation of the average AoI with a very low complexity. We then provide a game framework that allows each source to determine its best probabilistic routing decision.

On one hand, it is important for large-scale re-ID to provide constant or sublinear search time and dramatically reduce the storage cost for data points from the viewpoint of efficiency. On the other hand, the semantic affinity existing in the original space should be preserved because it greatly boosts the accuracy of re-ID. To this end, we use the deep hashing method, which utilizes the pairwise similarity and classification label to learn deep hash mapping functions, in order to provide discriminative representations. More importantly, considering the great advantage of asymmetric hashing over the existing symmetric one, we finally propose an asymmetric deep hashing (ADH) method for large-scale re-ID. Specifically, a two-stream asymmetric convolutional neural network is constructed to learn the similarity between image pairs. Another asymmetric pairwise loss is formulated to capture the similarity between the binary hashing codes and real-value representations derived from the deep hash mapping functions, so as to constrain the binary hash codes in the Hamming space to preserve the semantic structure existing in the original space. Then, the image labels are further explored to have a direct impact on the hash function learning through a classification loss. Furthermore, an efficient alternating algorithm is elaborately designed to jointly optimize the asymmetric deep hash functions and high-quality binary codes, by optimizing one parameter with the other parameters fixed. Experiments on the four benchmarks, i.e., DukeMTMC-reID, Market-1501, Market-1501+500k, and CUHK03 substantiate the competitive accuracy and superior efficiency of the proposed ADH over the compared state-of-the-art methods for large-scale re-ID.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552666","person re-identification;deep hashing;asymmetric hashing;large-scale","Codes;Training;Semantics;Hash functions;Binary codes;Streaming media;Hamming distance","","2","","","","29 Sep 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In most practical asynchronous circuits, a pipeline forms the micro-architecture backbone, and its characteristics play a vital role in determining the overall circuit performance. In this paper, we investigate a series of typical asynchronous pipeline circuits based on bundled-data encoding, spanning different handshake signaling protocols such as 2-phase (micropipeline, Mousetrap, and Click), 4-phase (simple, semi-decoupled, and fully-decoupled), and single-track (GasP). An in-depth review of each selected circuit is conducted regarding the handshaking and data latching mechanisms behind the circuit implementations, as well as the analysis of its performance and timing constraints based on formal behavior models. Overall, this paper aims at providing a survey of asynchronous bundled-data pipeline circuits, and it will be a reference for designers interested in experimenting with asynchronous circuits.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9614074","asynchronous pipeline circuits;bundled-data encoding;asynchronous circuit modeling","Pipelines;Protocols;Latches;Encoding;Timing;Integrated circuit modeling;Solid modeling","","1","","","","12 Nov 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

"Do not forget the past: A buffer-aided framework for relay based key generation","R. K. Mangang; H. Jagadeesh","Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Delhi, India; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Delhi, India",Journal of Communications and Networks,"16 Mar 2022","2022","24","1","1","16","We address relay-assisted key generation wherein two wireless nodes, that have no direct channel between them, seek the assistance of an intermediate relay to generate secret keys. In a celebrated version of the relay-assisted protocol, as applied by Lai et al., Zhou et al., Wang et al., and Waqas et al., the relay node generates pair-wise keys with the two nodes, and then broadcasts an XOR version of the two keys. Although such protocols are simple and effective, we observe that they face reduction in key rates due to two problems. First, for confidentiality, the relay broadcasts an XOR function of the pair-wise keys thereby pruning the length of the shared key to be the minimum of the key lengths of the pair-wise keys. Secondly, the broadcast phase may also experience outages thereby not being able to share the generated key in every round of the protocol. Identifying these issues, we propose a buffer-aided relaying protocol wherein buffer is used at the relay to store unused secret bits generated in the previous rounds of the protocol so as to provide confidentiality in the subsequent rounds of broadcast. On this buffer-aided protocol, we propose a power-allocation strategy between the phases of key generation and broadcast so as to maximize the throughput and key rate. Rigorous analyses show that buffer-aided relay when implemented along with the proposed power-allocation strategy offer remarkable advantages over existing baselines.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9718361","Buffers;key generation;power-allocation","Relays;Protocols;Wireless communication;Throughput;Optimization;Cryptography;Standards","","","","","","23 Feb 2022","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Furthermore, precise path computation considering detailed intra-node structures is enabled by the functional block-based disaggregation approach, which is important not only for online use cases, such as optical path establishment/removal operations, but also for offline use cases, such as node functionality analysis or generation of node-setting tables. This study developed an optical path computation prototype, based on an open-source solution, that employs a functional block-based disaggregation approach and supports a computationally intensive flexible grid mechanism. To realize universal path computation that is applicable to any node structure without algorithm modification, integer linear programming was employed as a generic computational method. The computation time of the developed prototype was evaluated over multiple node structures, providing different functionalities and node scales. Approaches for reducing the computation time were also investigated. The developed path computation system achieved reasonable computation times for the offline use cases and online use cases with limited scales.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.439820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9673703","","Optical network units;Computational modeling;Optical devices;Optical switches;Mathematical models;Optical coupling;Scalability","","","","","","7 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we consider this quantity on a probabilistic model of complex networks introduced by Krioukov et al. (2010, Phys. Rev. E, 82, 036106). This model views a complex network as an expression of hidden popularity hierarchies (i.e. nodes higher up in the hierarchies have more global reach), encapsulated by an underlying hyperbolic space. For certain parameters, this model was proved to have typical features that are observed in complex networks such as power law degree distribution, bounded average degree, clustering coefficient that is asymptotically bounded away from zero and ultra-small typical distances. In the present work, we investigate its modularity and we show that, in this regime, it converges to one in probability.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnab051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717038","random geometric graphs;hyperbolic plane;complex networks;modularity","","","","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Generally, collected information is transmitted to a centralized resource-intensive cloud platform for service implementation. Edge Computing (EC) that deploys physical resources near road-side units is involved in IoV to support real-time services for vehicular users. Additionally, many measures are adopted to optimize the performance of EC-enabled IoV, but they hardly help make dynamic decisions according to real-time requests. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of enhancing the learning capacity of edge devices and thus assists in allocating resources dynamically. Although extensive research has employed AI to optimize EC performance, summaries with relative concepts or prospects are quite few. To address this gap, we conduct an exhaustive survey about utilizing AI in edge service optimization in IoV. Firstly, we establish the general condition and relative concepts about IoV, EC, and AI. Secondly, we review the edge service frameworks for IoV and explore the use of AI in edge server placement and service offloading.

On the basis of these solutions, a task offloading strategy with a centralized low-latency, secure and reliable decision-making algorithm having powerful emergency handling capacity (LSRDM-EH) is designed to facilitate the resource-constrained edge devices for task offloading. Additionally, to well ensure the security of the entire network, a comprehensive blockchain-based two-layer and multidimensional security strategy is proposed.

We employ a DL-based feature extracting model, ResNet-34, as the encoder of the U-Net. To achieve high accuracy classifications, we integrate the dual-attention mechanism into the original U-Net to improve the feature representations, forming a dual-attention U-Net model (DAU-Net). The SAR images are obtained from Sentinel-1A. The dual-polarized information and the incident angle of SAR images are model inputs. We used 15 dual-polarized images acquired near the Bering Sea to train the model and employ the other three images to test the model. Experiments show that the DAU-Net could achieve pixel-level classification; the dual-attention mechanism can improve the classification accuracy. Compared with the original U-Net, DAU-Net improves the intersection over union (IoU) by 7.48.% points, 0.96.% points, and 0.83.% points on three test images.

However, it takes a long time and huge energy consumption for the UAV to fly from the stay charging station to the mission areas disorderly. In this paper, we design a pre-dispatch UAV-assisted VECNs system to cope with the demand of vehicles in multiple traffic jams. We propose an optimal UAV flight trajectory algorithm based on the traffic situation awareness. The cloud computing center (CCC) server predicts the real-time traffic conditions, and assigns UAVs to different mission areas periodically. Then, a flight trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize the cost of UAVs, while both the UAV flying and turning energy costs are mainly considered.

In addition, the weak grid condition is a great challenge for the system. Therefore, this study first presents an overview of the existing PLLs together with their general structures and basic working principles. Depending on the implementation of the phase detector, the PLL can be divided into three categories: power-based PLL (pPLL), orthogonal-signal-generator-based PLL (OSG-PLL) and adaptive-filter-based PLL (AF-PLL). Then, from the above classification, seven typical single-phase PLLs are selected for further study.

In the processing of the information transmission of the SUAV relay, a secondary eavesdropper (SE) wiretaps the information transmitted by the UAV relay with imperfect location information. In order to confuse the SE, a friendly SUAV jammer is employed to transmit jamming signals to the SE. To prevent the SE wiretapping information as much as possible, we aim to maximize average worst-case secrecy rate of the secondary relay network by jointly optimizing robust trajectories and power of the SUAV relay and jammer under the power, trajectories, information causality and multiple interference temperature (IT) threshold constraints. Thus, we formulate the original problem which is a challenging non-convex problem. We propose an effective algorithm to solve the original problem and attain locally optimal solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technology and the alternate optimization method.

A spatial-temporal convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model is proposed to predict the vehicle's lateral and longitudinal driving intentions simultaneously. This network includes two modules: the first module mines the information of the target vehicle using the long short-term memory (LSTM) network and the second module uses ConvLSTM to capture the spatial interactions and temporal evolution of surrounding vehicles simultaneously when modeling the influence of surrounding vehicles.

This paper proposes a soft SC fault diagnosis method based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for on-board applications in EVs. In the proposed method, the EKF is used to estimate the state of charge (SOC) of the faulty cell by adjusting a gain matrix based on real-time measured voltages. The SOC difference between the estimated SOC and the calculated SOC through coulomb counting for the faulty cell is employed to detect soft SC faults, and the soft SC resistance values are further identified to indicate the degree of fault severity. Soft SC experiments are developed to investigate the characteristics of a series-connected battery pack under different working conditions when one battery cell in the pack is short-circuited with different resistance values. The experimental data are acquired to validate the proposed soft SC fault diagnosis method.

Many models are being used in this task with the development of deep learning. However, most of the existing methods cannot accurately obtain the degree of association between different tokens and events, and event-related information cannot be effectively integrated. In this paper, we propose an event information integration model that integrates event information through multilayer bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and attention mechanism. Although the above scheme can improve the extraction performance, it can still be further optimized. To further improve the performance of the previous scheme, we propose a novel relational graph attention network that incorporates edge attributes. In this approach, we first build a semantic dependency graph through dependency parsing, model a semantic graph that considers the edges' attributes by using top-k attention mechanisms to learn hidden semantic contextual representations, and finally predict event temporal relations. We evaluate proposed models on the TimeBank-Dense dataset. Compared to previous baselines, the Micro-F1 scores obtained by our models improve by 3.9% and 14.5%, respectively.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515702","temporal relation extraction;neural network;attention mechanism;graph attention network","Semantics;Task analysis;Biological system modeling;Feature extraction;Data mining;Syntactics;Predictive models","","29","","","","17 Aug 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

UWB is low power-consuming and resistant to complex multipath environments, thanks to a short pulse signal. Since the main desired characteristics of the UWB antennas for radio-frequency localization systems are wide bandwidth, omnidirectional radiation pattern, and low profile for simple integration with printed circuit boards, various planar monopole antennas for UWB applications were proposed to meet the requirements. In order to satisfy these conditions, in this paper, a novel compact UWB planar monopole antenna operating in 3.1 GHz–10.8 GHz is designed on FR-4 substrate. The overall size of the antenna is  $12.5\times 12.5\times $  1 mm3, which is  $0.129\,\,\lambda _{0} \times 0.258\,\,\lambda _{0} \times 0.01\,\,\lambda _{0}$  in free space at the lowest frequency. The transmission line is designed based on a coplanar waveguide with ground (CPWG) and vias in the CPWG are employed to eliminate non-radiating phenomenon at some specific frequencies. The shape of the radiator is modified from the hexagonal shape and a ribbon-shaped slot inside the radiator is adapted to improve the operating frequency range. The proposed UWB planar monopole antenna is fabricated and measured. The proposed antenna provides good antenna performance from 3.1 to 10.8 GHz and also the radiation patterns at various frequencies are omnidirectional pattern.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3182443","Technology Innovation Program (Development of Industrial Intelligent Technology for Manufacturing, Process, and Logistics) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, South Korea)(grant numbers:20013726); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794699","UWB;planar monopole antenna;slot","Ultra wideband antennas;Antenna measurements;Slot antennas;Reflector antennas;Reflection coefficient;Shape;Antennas","","28","","30","CCBY","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the potential candidates for edge computing is a memristor, an emerging nonvolatile memory device that has the capability of in-memory computing. In this article, from the perspective of edge computing, we review recent progress on memristor-based signal processing methods, especially on the aspects of signal preprocessing and feature extraction.

Different from capacity insufficiency-caused power crises in the past, the Texas electric power crisis of 2021 directly resulted from the long-duration extreme cold weather as well as fundamentally from the insufficiency of sustainable supply capability of energy. We begin this paper with a brief retrospect of the event and its consequences. Definitions of energy/capacity insufficiency-caused power crises are given, as well as an overview of the supply and demand during the event, based on realistic operation data. Quantitative simulations are then conducted to reveal the underlying reasons for the power crisis and reveal how to better prepare for the future.

These characteristics make the centralized resource management policy not apply. Meanwhile, existing routing protocols can't meet the performance challenges of high dynamic, topology and link frequency changes of ultra-dense scenarios with swarm UAVs. To solve the above challenges of resource management and routing protocol, a cross-layer optimization method is presented with a novel mean field game (MFG) in this paper. It is based on the cross-layer design method of the MFG theory and jointly considers the power resources in the physical layer, frequency resources in the medium access control (MAC) layer, and routing resources in the network layer. By dividing into subproblems, the original problem is solved. Meanwhile, the optimal data transmission path can be selected through the management and allocation of frequency resources and power resources. A cross-layer resource management dynamic source routing (CLRM-DSR) protocol is designed based on that which adds link quality measurement. The simulation results show that the presented CLRM-DSR with the proposed resource management scheme can improve the data packet transmission rate, reduce end-to-end delay, and lower routing overhead for the multi-hop swarm UAV communication network.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623653","Cross-layer optimization;MFG;multi-hop communications;UAV","Resource management;Routing;Vehicle dynamics;Network topology;Topology;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms","","24","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

The proposed method can be employed for load frequency control with nonlinearities. The simulations are based on two and three areas of the power system with load frequency control. From the simulation results, it is apparent that the frequency deviation and ACE (area control error) converge to zero when using the proposed method. In addition, the simulation results validate the robustness of the proposed method in the case of parameters change.

The large-scale parallel corpora for high-resource languages is easily obtainable. However, the translation quality of NMT for morphologically rich languages is still unsatisfactory, mainly because of the data sparsity problem encountered in Low-Resource Languages (LRLs). In the low-resource NMT paradigm, Transfer Learning (TL) has been developed into one of the most efficient methods. It is difficult to train the model on high-resource languages to include the information in both parent and child models, as well as the initially trained model that only contains the lexicon features and word embeddings of the parent model instead of the child languages feature. In this work, we aim to address this issue by proposing the language-independent Hybrid Transfer Learning (HTL) method for LRLs by sharing lexicon embedding between parent and child languages without leveraging back translation or manually injecting noises. First, we train the High-Resource Languages (HRLs) as the parent model with its vocabularies. Then, we combine the parent and child language pairs using the oversampling method to train the hybrid model initialized by the previously parent model. Finally, we fine-tune the morphologically rich child model using a hybrid model. Besides, we explore some exciting discoveries on the original TL approach. Experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms five SOTA methods in two languages Azerbaijani (Az) and Uzbek (Uz). Meanwhile, our approach is practical and significantly better, achieving improvements of up to 4.94 and 4.84 BLEU points for low-resource child languages Az ! Zh and Uz !

Cross-lingual entity alignment aims at integrating complementary KGs from different languages and thus benefits various knowledge-driven social network studies. Recent entity alignment methods often take an embedding-based approach to model the entity and relation embedding of KGs. However, these studies mostly focus on the information of the entity itself and its structural features but ignore the influence of multiple types of data in KGs. In this paper, we propose a new embedding-based framework named multiview highway graph convolutional network (MHGCN), which considers the entity alignment from the views of entity semantic, relation semantic, and entity attribute. To learn the structural features of an entity, the MHGCN employs a highway graph convolutional network (GCN) for entity embedding in each view. In addition, the MHGCN weights and fuses the multiple views according to the importance of the embedding from each view to obtain a better entity embedding. The alignment entities are identified based on the similarity of entity embeddings. The experimental results show that the MHGCN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art alignment methods. The research also will benefit knowledge fusion through cross-lingual KG entity alignment.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645442","knowledge graph;entity alignment;graph convolutional network","Semantics;Road transportation;Knowledge engineering;Task analysis;Social networking (online);Aggregates;Fuses","","23","","","","9 Dec 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

MSC has attracted considerable attention because of its wide applications in social computing and opinion mining. However, improper correlation strategies can cause erroneous fusion as the texts and the images that are unrelated to each other may integrate. Moreover, simply concatenating them modal by modal, even with true correlation, cannot fully capture the features within and between modals. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Cross-Modal Complementary Network (CMCN) with hierarchical fusion for MSC. The CMCN is designed as a hierarchical structure with three key modules, namely, the feature extraction module to extract features from texts and images, the feature attention module to learn both text and image attention features generated by an image-text correlation generator, and the cross-modal hierarchical fusion module to fuse features within and between modals. Such a CMCN provides a hierarchical fusion framework that can fully integrate different modal features and helps reduce the risk of integrating unrelated modal features. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645438","multimodal sentiment analysis;multimodal fusion;Cross-Modal Complementary Network (CMCN);hierarchical fusion;joint optimization","Feature extraction;Correlation;Sentiment analysis;Visualization;Generators;Videos;Fuses","","21","","","","9 Dec 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

It has been substantiated that the variability of wind power, in addition to contributing hugely to the instability of power grids, can also send the balancing costs of electricity markets soaring. Existing studies on the same establish that curtailment of such variability can be achieved through the geographic aggregation of various widespread production sites; however, there exists a dearth of comprehensive evaluation concerning different levels/scales of such aggregation, especially from a global perspective. This paper primarily offers a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the wind power variations and aggregations from a systematic viewpoint based on extensive wind power data, thereby enabling the benefits of these aggregations to be quantified from a state scale ranging up to a global scale. Firstly, a meticulous analysis of the wind power variations is undertaken at 6 different levels by converting the 7-year hourly meteorological re-analysis data with a high spatial resolution of 0.25° χ 0.25° (approximate 28 km χ 28 km) into a wind power series globally. Subsequently, the proposed assessment framework employs a coefficient of variation of wind power as well as a standard deviation of wind power ramping rate to quantify the variations of wind power and wind power ramping rate to exhibit the characteristics and benefits yielded by the wind power aggregation at 6 different levels. A system planning example is adopted to illustrate the correlation between the coefficient of variation reduction of wind power and investment reduction, thereby emphasizing the benefits pertaining to significant investment reduction via aggregation. Furthermore, a wind power duration curve is used to exemplify the availability of wind power aggregated at different levels. Finally, the results provide insights into devising a universal approach towards the deployment of wind power, principally along the lines of Net-Zero.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2021.03070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606956","Energy quality;meteorological re-analysis data;wind power aggregation;wind power ramping rate;wind power variation;wind power variability","Wind power generation;Europe;Wind;Meteorology;Spatial resolution;Costs;Wind turbines","","19","","","","9 Nov 2021","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Unlike most of the other converters, the subject converter has the advantage of exhibiting minimum phase behavior in the boost mode. However, a major issue that arises in the classical control of the converter is the dead zone near the transition of the buck and boost mode. The reason for the dead zone is practically unrealizable duty cycles, which are close to zero or unity, of pulse width modulation (PWM) near the transition region. To overcome this issue, we propose to use DMPC. In DMPC, the switches are manipulated directly by the controller without the need of PWM. Thereby, avoiding the dead zone altogether. DMPC also offers several other advantages over classical techniques that include optimality and explicit current constraints. Simulations of the proposed DMPC technique on the converter show that the dead zone has been successfully avoided. Moreover, simulations show that the DMPC technique results in a significantly improved performance as compared to the classical control techniques in terms of response time, reference tracking, and overshoot.","2096-3564","","10.30941/CESTEMS.2022.00043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9910365","Noninverting buck-boost DC-DC converter;Direct model predictive control;Dead zone avoidance","Couplings;Computational modeling;DC-DC power converters;Pulse width modulation;Predictive models;Control systems;Time factors","","19","","40","","4 Oct 2022","","","CES","CES Journals"

Indeed, AtH grating lobes are often present during cell scanning due to the large interelement spacing in BS array antennas for achieving higher gains with a reduced number of RF chains. In this letter, we propose an approach based on an electrically thin metasurface-based dome for the reduction of AtH grating lobes in 5G-NR BS antennas. The proposed scanning range shifting approach exploits the natural lower amplitude of the grating lobes when the antenna array scans in an angular region closer to the broadside direction. The grating lobe reduction is here demonstrated considering a 1×4 phased linear antenna array operating under dual-liner ±45°-slant polarization. A simple design procedure for designing the metasurface dome is reported, together with the antenna performances, evaluated through a proper set of numerical experiments. It is shown that the grating lobe radiation toward the satellite region is significantly reduced, whereas the overall insertion loss is moderate.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2022.3196324","Italian Ministry of University and Research(grant numbers:Protocol 2017BHFZKH); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9850351","Fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR);angular scanning range;metasurface;millimeter waves;phased array antenna;radome","Antenna arrays;Gratings;Phased arrays;Metasurfaces;5G mobile communication;Antennas;Satellite broadcasting","","18","","22","CCBY","4 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to improve the energy utilization rate and reduce the energy storage cost under multiple-line power distribution conditions, this paper investigates a new interline DC dynamic voltage restorer (IDC-DVR) scheme with one SMES coil shared among multiple compensating circuits. In this new concept, an improved current-voltage (I/V) chopper assembly, which has a series of input/output power ports, is introduced to connect the single SMES coil with multiple power lines, and thereby satisfy the independent energy exchange requirements of any line to be compensated. Specifically, if two or more power lines have simultaneous compensating demands, the SMES coil can be selectively controlled to compensate the preferable line according to the priority order of the line. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is technically verified to maintain the transient voltage stability in multiple-line voltage swell and sag cases caused by either output voltage fluctuations from external power sources or power demand fluctuations from local sensitive loads. The simulation results provide a technical basis to develop a cost-effective SMES-based IDC-DVR for use in various DC distribution networks.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2020.05440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420345","DC distribution;dynamic voltage restorer (DVR);interline DC dynamic voltage restorer;superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES);transient voltage stability","Switches;Superconducting magnetic energy storage;Magnetic flux;Choppers (circuits);Batteries;Voltage control;Vehicle dynamics","","18","","","","30 Apr 2021","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Active sensors such as low-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operating at the P-band, with a wavelength of ~69 cm, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) are able to penetrate thick vegetation layers. While NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is collecting spaceborne LiDAR data, the ESA’s next Earth Explorer BIOMASS mission will acquire multiple acquisitions over the same areas to form 3-D images through the SAR tomography (TomoSAR) technique. Our study shows the potential value of GEDI and TomoSAR acquisitions in producing accurate estimates of forests’ vertical structure. By analyzing the airborne P-band TomoSAR, airborne LiDAR, and spaceborne GEDI LiDAR at a tropical forest site in Paracou, French Guiana, South America, we show that both GEDI and P-band TomoSAR can directly measure surface, vegetation heights, and vertical profiles with high resolution and precision. Airborne TomoSAR is of higher quality than GEDI due to better penetration properties and precision. However, GEDI vegetation height root-mean-square error (RMSE) is less than 5 m, for an average forest height value around 30 m at the Paracou site, which is similar to the expected performance of the future spaceborne BIOMASS mission. These results suggest that GEDI measurements, i.e., shots with sensitivity greater than 98%, will provide a good reference of forest structure to calibrate the BIOMASS mission algorithms.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3208744","Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales/Terre, Ocean, Surfaces Continentales, Atmosphere (CNES/TOSCA—project BIOMASS-valorisation); “Land, Environment, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information” Joint Research Unit (UMR TETIS), Institut national de recherche en agriculture, alimentation et environnement (INRAE); Center for the Study of the Biosphere from Space (CESBIO); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900356","Canopy height model (CHM);digital terrain model (DTM);Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI);Paracou;tomography;vertical structure profile","Forestry;Laser radar;Tomography;Biomass;Synthetic aperture radar;Sensitivity;Vegetation mapping","","17","","25","CCBY","22 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the hot topics in this area is the construction of feature interactions to facilitate accurate prediction. Factorization machine provides second-order feature interactions by linearly multiplying hidden feature factors. However, real-world data present a complex and nonlinear structure. Hence, second-order feature interactions are unable to represent cross information adequately. This drawback has been addressed using deep neural networks (DNNs), which enable high-order nonlinear feature interactions. However, DNN-based feature interactions cannot easily optimize deep structures because of the absence of cross information in the original features. In this study, we propose an effective CTR prediction algorithm called CAN, which explicitly exploits the benefits of attention mechanisms and DNN models. The attention mechanism is used to provide rich and expressive low-order feature interactions and facilitate the optimization of DNN-based predictors that implicitly incorporate high-order nonlinear feature interactions. The experiments using two real datasets demonstrate that our proposed CAN model performs better than other cross feature- and DNN-based predictors.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515791","click-through rate prediction;global attention mechanism;feature interaction;neural network","Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;Frequency modulation;Advertising;Task analysis;Predictive models;Optimization","","17","","","","17 Aug 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Publishing social network data not only brings benefit for public health, disaster response, commercial promotion, and many other applications, but also gives birth to threats that jeopardize each individual's privacy and security. Unfortunately, most existing works in publishing social graph embedding data only focus on preserving social graph structure with less attention paid to the privacy issues inherited from social networks. To be specific, attackers can infer the presence of a sensitive relationship between two individuals by training a predictive model with the exposed social network embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel link-privacy preserved graph embedding framework using adversarial learning, which can reduce adversary's prediction accuracy on sensitive links, while persevering sufficient non-sensitive information, such as graph topology and node attributes in graph embedding.

This alternative approach is promising to overcome the drawbacks usually observed for the classic 1T concept like limited endurance, reduced retention, and high device-to-device variability. Electrically, the 1T1C FeFET consists of a series connection of the FE capacitor and the gate oxide capacitance. To operate at low voltages, a large fraction of the applied voltage must drop across the FE, which can be achieved by optimizing the capacitance ratio.

The radiated EMI model is then developed for a flyback power converter with critical ground impedance included. Based on the developed model, accurate high-frequency parameter extraction techniques and a radiated EMI prediction technique are developed and experimentally validated. Finally, essential measurement techniques are identified and developed to accurately extract parameters for accurate EMI prediction. The effects of the resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer and critical PCB ground impedance on the radiated EMI are experimentally validated. PCB's impact on the common-mode (CM) choke's impedance and the radiated EMI is further validated. Techniques for minimizing the undesired near-field couplings in parameter extraction are discussed.

Graph data, which provide knowledge on interactions among entities, can be locally generated and held by distributed data owners. These data are usually sensitive and private, because they may be related to owners' personal activities and can be hijacked by adversaries to conduct inference attacks. Current solutions either consider private graph data as centralized contents or disregard the overlapping of graphs in distributed manners. Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework for distributed graph publication. In this framework, differential privacy is applied to justify the safety of the published contents. It includes four phases, i.e., graph combination, plan construction sharing, data perturbation, and graph reconstruction. The published graph selection is guided by one data coordinator, and each graph is perturbed carefully with the Laplace mechanism. The problem of graph selection is formulated and proven to be NP-complete. Then, a heuristic algorithm is proposed for selection. The correctness of the combined graph and the differential privacy on all edges are analyzed. This study also discusses a scenario without a data coordinator and proposes some insights into graph publication.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552653","graph data;distributed data publication;differential privacy","Distributed databases;Differential privacy;Privacy;Standards;Heuristic algorithms;Data models;Data analysis","","15","","","","29 Sep 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper, we present a secure scheme for locating disease-causing genes based on Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE), which reduces the risk of leaking genetic data. First, we combine MKHE with a frequency-based pathogenic gene location function. The medical institutions use MKHE to encrypt their genetic data. The cloud then homomorphically evaluates specific gene-locating circuits on the encrypted genetic data. Second, whereas most location circuits are designed only for locating monogenic diseases, we propose two location circuits (TH-intersection and Top-q) that can locate the disease-causing genes of polygenic diseases. Third, we construct a directed decryption protocol in which the users involved in the homomorphic evaluation can appoint a target user who can obtain the final decryption result. Our experimental results show that compared to the JWB+17 scheme published in the journal Science, our scheme can be used to diagnose polygenic diseases, and the participants only need to upload their encrypted genetic data once, which reduces the communication traffic by a few hundred-fold.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552661","public key encryption;Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE);fully homomorphic encryption;disease-causing genes;secure location of disease-causing genes","Genetics;Diseases;Protocols;Medical diagnostic imaging;Integrated circuit modeling;Genomics;Bioinformatics","","14","","","","29 Sep 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

(2021) claimed (see, in particular, the Discussion and Recommendation Section in their article) that the advanced differential SAR interferometry (InSAR) algorithms for surface deformation retrieval, based on the small baseline approach, are affected by systematic biases in the generated InSAR products. Therefore, to avoid such biases, they recommended a strategy primarily focused on excluding “the short temporal baseline interferograms and using long baselines to decrease the overall phase errors.” In particular, among various techniques, Ansari et al. (2021) identified the solution presented by Manunta et al. (2019) as a small baseline advanced InSAR processing approach where the presence of the above-mentioned biases (referred to as a fading signal) compromises the accuracy of the retrieved InSAR deformation products.

In DYSON, to maximize the offloading effect of OFN, when IoT device cannot use OFN, it delays the task offloading with the expectation of future contacts of OFN. To assess the performance of DYSON, we develop an analytic model for the opportunistic offloading probability that the task can be offloaded to OFN.

The SPP modes can be inspired by two gold-wires to improve the filter characteristics and the effect of surface plasmon resonance is further enhanced by cladding monocrystalline silicon surrounding gold-wires. An asymmetric structure of leakage channel is introduced in y-pol direction axis which intensifies the energy leakage to external cladding, high polarization extinction ratio is occurred. By using the finite element method (FEM), the structural parameters and optical properties are quantitatively analyzed. Numerical analysis shows that two main adjacent resonance peaks appear in y-pol direction, confinement losses of y-pol core mode at the resonance wavelength of 1519 and 1664 nm are 573.33 and 543.21 dB/cm, while the losses of x-pol core mode are 16.97 and 0.98 dB/cm. When the fiber length L=3 mm, the maximum ER reaches 1449 dB at the wavelength of 1519 nm, and the bandwidth with ER better than 20 dB reaches 405 nm.

In smart grids, power generations and loads become intermittent and much more uncertain, and the topology also changes more frequently, which may result in significant state shifts and further make NRPF or FDPF difficult to converge. To address this problem, we propose a data-driven PF (DDPF) method based on historical/simulated data that includes an offline learning stage and an online computing stage. In the offline learning stage, a learning model is constructed based on the proposed exact linear regression equations, and then the proposed learning model is solved by the ridge regression (RR) method to suppress the effect of data collinearity. In online computing stage, the nonlinear iterative calculation is not needed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDPF method has no convergence problem and has much higher calculation efficiency than NRPF or FDPF while ensuring similar calculation accuracy.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2020.000738","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52077076); State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources(grant numbers:LAPS202118); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447250","Data driven;exact linear regression equation;Fast-decoupled power flow;Newton-Raphson method","Mathematical model;Topology;Power systems;Computational modeling;Linear regression;Smart grids;Load flow","","13","","8","","4 Jun 2021","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

The proposed model of the induction motor consists of a three-phase equivalent circuit with eighteen circuit elements per phase to ensure model accuracy. The per phase circuit structure is symmetric concerning its phase-start and phase-end points. This symmetry enables the proposed model to be applicable for both star- and delta-connected induction motors without having to recalculate the circuit element values when changing the motor connection from star to delta and vice versa. Motor physics knowledge, namely per-phase impedances, are used in the artificial neural network to obtain the values of the circuit elements.

Because of the high fluctuation caused by the intermediate routers on the Internet, it is unavoidable that the RTTs of the captured packets contain outlier values. In this paper, we first propose an efficient algorithm to eliminate most of the possible RTT outliers of the packets captured in the Internet environment. We then develop an efficient SSI detection algorithm by mining network traffic using an improved version of k-Means clustering. Our proposed detection algorithm for SSI is accurate, effective, and efficient in the context of the Internet.

Despite having robotic systems paving the way towards reducing the perioperative risks faced by interventionists and patients, modeling and sensing of distal force feedback remain as an unsolved challenge. Of all sensing techniques adopted to solve this challenge, a fiber Bragg grating-based technique seems to be the most promising. In this letter, a prototype of a 3-D-printed 2-D distal force sensor is proposed for acquiring tool-vessel contact forces during robot-assisted cardiac procedures. The prototype consists of a symmetrical sensing structure designed with four optical fibers. Simulation and experimental studies were carried out to validate the applicability of the sensor. The simulation result shows that the force sensor could experience a minimal deformation under lateral forces of up to 1.0 N, whereas the in-lab temperature characterization study indicates that the sensor prototype has good linearity with increasing temperature between 35 and 54 °C.

A novel multiple-step greedy policy based on the consensus Q- learning (MSGP-CQ) strategy is proposed in this paper, which is an automatic generation control (AGC) for distributed energy incorporating multiple-step greedy attribute and multiple-level allocation strategy. The convergence speed and learning efficiency in the MSGP algorithm are accelerated through the predictive multiple-step iteration updating in the proposed strategy, and the CQ algorithm is adopted with collaborative consensus and self-learning characteristics to enhance the adaptability of the power allocation strategy under the strong stochastic disturbances and obtain the total power commands in the power grid and the dynamic optimal allocations of the unit power. The simulations of the improved IEEE two-area load-frequency control (LFC) power system and the interconnected system model of intelligent distribution network (IDN) groups incorporating a large amount of distributed energy show that the proposed strategy can achieve the optimal coordinated control and power allocation in the power grid. The algorithm MSGP-CQ has stronger robustness and faster dynamic optimization speed and can reduce generation costs.

In general, this method divides the studied system into two subsystems at AC and DC sections. Subsequently, the impedance produced by these subsystems can be used to determine the system stability by implementing Nyquist criterion or generalized Nyquist stability criterion. However, the existing impedance analysis methods usually assume the subsystems to be stable and disregard certain special cases with potentially unstable subsystems, where the unstable poles of these subsystems must be evaluated before applying Nyquist criterion. In view of this consideration, a simplified method for identifying unstable subsystem poles is presented in this paper. Hence, the shortcoming of existing impedance analyses is rectified by considering the unstable subsystem poles. The proposed method and the stability analyses are validated by the electromagnetic transient simulation performed in PSCAD/EMTDC.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2020.04900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465785","AC/DC side impedance method;harmonic resonance;MMC-HVDC;small-signal stability;wind farm","Impedance;Wind farms;HVDC transmission;Power system stability;Impedance measurement;Stability criteria;Wind turbines","","12","","11","","25 Jun 2021","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

This system grasps the movement of the bather with a depth sensor and informs others, such as the bather's family, when drowning might be occurring. In this letter, we mainly analyzed depth data from depth sensors and developed automatic detection of drowning conditions. Automatic detection of the drowning state was experimentally evaluated in an actual bathroom. The scenario for the experiment was the natural flow of a series of general bathing movements (e.g., normal bathing, wiping the face, and touching the shoulders) and reproduction of the drowning state. As a result, it was shown that the automatic detection rate of the drowning state was at the applicable level.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2021.3139636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9667212","Sensor applications;Bathing accident prevention;depth sensor;drowning detection;monitoring system;skeleton point analysis","Sensors;Cameras;Nose;Skeleton;Monitoring;Accidents;Sensor systems","","11","","18","CCBY","31 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Globally, regionally, or locally, elevation datasets have many grid points. Many software packages calculate gradients over every grid cell or point, but in the mountains, shading by nearby terrain must also be assessed. Terrain may obscure a slope that would otherwise face the Sun. Four decades ago, a fast method to calculate topographic horizons at every point in an elevation grid required computations related only linearly to the size of the grid, but grids now have so many points that parallel computing still provides an advantage. Exploiting parallelism over terrain grids can use alternative strategies: among columns of a rotated grid, or simultaneously at multiple rotation angles, or on different tiles of a grid.

Although problem has been considered in the literature, most approaches achieve stability at the expense of smooth limited functions on the controller terms, which may reduce the performance. The limited integrator anti-windup (LIAW) approach is a known solution to improve stability and performance in presence of actuator saturation. In general, to the best of the author’s knowledge, this approach has not been analyzed with Lyapunov’s theory and known applications seem to rely on intuition rather than on a formal study. In this brief, a proportional (P) plus LIAW scheme is proposed as solution to the constrained trajectory tracking control of mobile robots. For the first time, in this brief, a Lyapunov stability analysis is provided for the P+PIAW approach when applied to trajectory tracking control of a mobile robot. A numerical simulation comparison among a known scheme based on smooth saturation functions, the classical linear proportional-integral controller, and the proposed P+LIAM scheme is provided. Better results are obtained for the proposed solution since the windup problem is avoided, which is very useful in practical applications.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2021.3111827","“Fondo Sectorial de Investigación para la Educación” through Project CONACYT(grant numbers:A1-S-24762); Secretaría de Investigación y Posgrado, Instituto Politécnico Nacional (SIP-IPN), Mexico; Proyecto Apoyado por el Fondo Sectorial de Investigación para la Educación; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534777","Actuator saturation;limited integrator anti-windup;mobile robot;trajectory tracking control;stability%","Mobile robots;Actuators;Trajectory tracking;Windup;Numerical stability;Closed loop systems;Circuits and systems","","11","","23","CCBY","10 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The auxiliary gate under a proper fixed voltage is able to induce additional electrons to compensate the channel carrier loss during main gate switching, leading to a lower dynamic on-resistance. In this work, we benchmarked the fundamental electrical properties of both single-gate and dual-gate HEMTs.

An issue is a rich source of software information that contains different reports including a problem, a request for new features, or merely a question about the software product. As the number of these issues increases, it becomes harder to manage them manually. Thus, automatic approaches are proposed to help facilitate the management of issue reports. This paper describes CatIss, an automatic Categorizer of Issue reports which is built upon the Transformer-based pre-trained RoBERTa model. CatIss classifies issue reports into three main categories of Bug report, Enhancement/feature request, and Question. First, the datasets provided for the NLBSE tool competition are cleaned and preprocessed. Then, the pre-trained RoBERTa model is fine-tuned on the preprocessed dataset. Evaluating CatIss on about 80 thousand issue reports from GitHub, indicates that it performs very well surpassing the competition baseline, TicketTagger, and achieving 87.2% F1-score (micro average). Additionally, as CatIss is trained on a wide set of repositories, it is a generic prediction model, hence applicable for any unseen software project or projects with little historical data. Scripts for cleaning the datasets, training CatIss and evaluating the model are publicly available. 1","","978-1-4503-9343-0","10.1145/3528588.3528662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9808639","Issue report Management;Classification;Repositories;Transformers;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing","Training;Conferences;Machine learning;Predictive models;Transformers;Software;Natural language processing","","11","","9","CCBY","30 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such differentiated weights form a phonetic attention mask (PAM). The neural acoustic-phonetic framework consists of two training pipelines, one for SV and another for speech recognition. Through the PAM, we leverage the phonetic information for SV. We evaluate the proposed neural acoustic-phonetic framework on the RSR2015 database Part III corpus, that consists of random digit strings.

The TMI threshold improved from 772 W, 1149 W and 1458 W to 1641 W when the bending diameter of YDF increase from 9 cm, 10 cm, 11 cm to 12 cm, accompanied by the deterioration of beam quality from 1.60, 1.67, 1.87 to 1.95. This is mainly because tightly bending in few-mode fiber will promote the overlap between modes and lead to mode coupling, which may trigger TMI. Besides, the bending losses of HOMs decrease while bending diameter increasing, so that there is higher output efficiency and deteriorated beam quality when bending diameter increase. Although the phenomenon is not agreed with common TMI with near single-mode fiber laser, the result will be helpful for the design and power scaling of few-mode fiber lasers.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3187417","Training Program for Excellent Young Innovations of Changsha(grant numbers:kq2106008); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62005315); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811353","High power fiber lasers;transverse mode instability;bending diameters;few-mode fibers","Bending;Optical fiber amplifiers;Optical fiber polarization;Fiber lasers;Optical fiber devices;Laser beams;Optical fiber theory","","10","","38","CCBY","30 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results show that the non-wavelength-stabilized LD pump has a higher TMI threshold compared to the wavelength-stabilized LD pump. By optimizing the operating current of the non-wavelength-stabilized 976 nm LD, a ∼4kW output laser with near single-mode beam quality (M2∼1.3) is achieved, with a slope efficiency of ∼84.4%. The analysis yields that when the pumping wavelength deviates from the 976 nm peak, the TMI threshold can be increased.

The first one is named EF-SIGNGD, in which we use the 1-bit (sign-based) gradient quantization method to save the communication bits. Moreover, the error feedback technique, i.e., incorporating the error made by the compression operator into the next step, is employed for the convergence guarantee. The second algorithm is called LE-SIGNGD, in which we introduce a well-designed lazy gradient aggregation rule to EF-SIGNGD that can detect the gradients with small changes and reuse the outdated information. LE-SIGNGD saves communication costs both in transmitted bits and communication rounds. Furthermore, we show that LE-SIGNGD is convergent under some mild assumptions.

And then the dynamical behaviors of the discrete memristor-based neuron are analyzed by experiments including phase diagram, bifurcation, and spectral entropy complexity algorithm. The results show that the resistance of memristor has an important effect on the system dynamics, which delays the occurrence of bifurcation, in particular, the bifurcation disappears and the system reaches the fixed point of the neuron when the resistance is greater than a threshold. It is also found that with the increase of the current gain, the bursting activity becomes higher in frequency and wider range of high complexity is obtained.

This letter proposes coastline extraction from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Since collecting in-situ data is expensive and not always possible, the Doppler parameter is used to delineate coastlines when neither in-situ data nor cloud-free optical images are available. We propose a novel coastline extraction method based on classic coastal dynamic variation, such as Doppler centroid ( $f_{\text {DC}}$ ), since the coastline is static and has zero Doppler with respect to the dynamic sea-state. The results of the Doppler-based novel technique allow us to investigate the impact of natural hazards on coastline degradation. We compare the proposed method to state-of-the-art (SOA) coastline extraction methods based on polarimetric correlations and the reference method from Sentinel-2. The results show that using scattering from dual and cross-polarization for coastline extraction is more reliable than using co-polarization. Based on empirical distributions and using the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) method, the relevant threshold has been adapted to distinguish land and sea in an unsupervised manner. We compare the results of polarimetric and Sentinel-2 with Doppler-based coastline extraction, which emphasizes the accuracy of the proposed  $f_{\text {DC}}$  method for extracting coastlines at full resolution.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3214496","Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Innovative Training Networks (MSCA-ITNs) through the Multimodal Environmental Exploration Systems–Novel Technologies (MENELAOS-NT)(grant numbers:GA 860370); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9919186","Coastline extraction;constant false alarm rate (CFAR);Doppler parameters;polarization;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Doppler effect;Correlation;Clouds;Feature extraction;Data mining;Sea measurements","","10","","20","CCBY","13 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing studies lack a prediction model that can accurately describe the dual dynamic changes of EVs charging the load time and space. Therefore, a spatial-temporal dynamic load forecasting model, dilated causal convolution-2D neural network (DCC-2D), is proposed. First, a hole factor is added to the time dimension of the three-dimensional convolutional convolution kernel to form a two-dimensional hole convolution layer so that the model can learn the spatial dimension information. The entire network is then formed by stacking the layers, ensuring that the network can accept long-term historical input, enabling the model to learn time dimension information. The model is simulated with the actual data of the charging pile load in a certain area and compared with the ConvLSTM model.

Thanks to the use of next-generation pluggable coherent optics, it is possible to create connectivity services (CSs) across multiple optical transport domains. In this multi-domain CS scenario, cloud operators and transport operators have to work together in the most dynamic way possible. To do so, they need a common place (i.e., a market) where the transport operators may expose their available optical resources and the cloud operators request (e.g., rent) them to be used in order to create end-to-end (E2E) CSs between DCs. Having multiple transport operators exposing their resource information in a common place requires a set of common rules (i.e., how much of the topology to show) to create E2E CSs requested between cloud operators. This paper makes use of the blockchain technology to present a blockchain-based extension for the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to allow each optical transport operator domain to become a peer in a blockchain network. In there, each peer follows the same rules and shares the same exact level of topology information by using a specific abstraction model to map the optical domain resources. This paper uses a set of three different abstraction models to validate their behavior on a blockchain system when managing multiple domain resources and the deployment of CSs across these domains. To do so, an experimental comparison on how the different abstraction models affect the performance of the blockchain system is presented.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.447833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714451","","Blockchains;Optical fiber networks;Topology;Data models;Network topology;Computer architecture;Peer-to-peer computing","","9","","","","16 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have proposed to position liquid-crystal (LC) matrix elements in front of the receivers in order to block unwanted light – so effectively acting as filter and reducing the interference. To do so, the appropriate pixels of the LC filter are switched either to a transmissive state or to an opaque state. The selection of the correct pixel patterns is a high-order optimization problem, which makes it challenging for classic algorithms. In this paper, we suggest applying a genetic optimization to find suitable pixel patterns. We combine this kind of receiver-side optimization with conventional convex precoding at the transmitter side in an iterative manner.

The fundamental and harmonic planes and the zero-sequence plane are taken into consideration to synthesis the reference voltage vector. To suppress the ZSC, a non-zero zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) is generated to compensate the third harmonic back-EMF. Rather than triangular carrier modulation, the sawtooth carrier modulation strategy is used to generate asymmetric PWM signals. The modulation range is investigated to explore the variation of modulation range caused by considering the zero-sequence plane. With the proposed method, the ZSC can be considerably reduced.

In this article, we present a more convenient and practical mode converter between HG and LG modes based on CP combined with a lens. The feasibility of the converter for the conversion between two modes is theoretically analyzed. The conversion can be accomplished in the determined plane and the width of converted beam can be controlled by adjusting the parameter of converter. Proof-of-concept experiment is carried out to verify theoretical analysis and the experimental results are agree well with theoretical simulations. The transfer of orbital angular momentum (OAM) between two modes after passing through the converter is also analyzed.

Therefore, it is necessary to use a technology that provides the performance needed for real-time target detection, and at the same time meets the satellite payload requirements. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have very interesting properties in terms of performance, size, and power consumption, which have become the standard option for on-board processing. In this letter, we present a hardware optimized implementation for FPGAs of the automatic target detection and classification algorithm (ATDCA) using the Gram–Schmidt (GS) method for orthogonalization purposes.

Relay transmission power (TP) increases with the number of nodes using the relay, which is a bottleneck.

To effectively reduce the power consumption, this paper presents an anti-interference low-power DETFF based on C-elements. The improved C-element is used in this DETFF, which effectively blocks the glitches in the input signal, prevents redundant transitions inside the DETFF, and reduces the charge and discharge frequencies of the transistor. The C-element has also added pull-up and pull-down paths, reducing its latency. Compared with other existing DETFFs, the DETFF proposed in this paper only flips once on the clock edge, which greatly reduces the redundant transitions caused by glitches and effectively reduces power consumption. This paper uses HSPICE to simulate the proposed DETFF and other 10 DETFFs. The findings show that compared with the other 10 types of DETFFs, the proposed DETFF has achieved large performance indexes in the total power consumption, total power consumption with glitches, delays, and power delay product. A detailed analysis of variance indicates that the proposed DETFF features less sensitivity to process, voltage, temperature, and Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI)-induced aging variations.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515696","Double-Edge Triggered Flip-Flop (DETFF);glitch;low-power;C-element","Clocks;Power demand;Latches;Multiplexing;Transistors;Logic gates;MOSFET","","8","","","","17 Aug 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

This is because the beam radius has not largely expanded yet at shorter transmission distances and the received optical power decreases as the receiver moves away from the center of the beam. In this letter, we address an adaptive beam divergence control method to expand the range of the FSO link distance within which the FSO link can be maintained.

At the same time, graphene has attracted much attention due to its unique electromagnetic responses in different Fermi levels. Here, graphene-based Pancharatnam-Berry metasurfaces are numerically built to achieve beam steering in terahertz band. When graphene is in the low Fermi level 0.01 eV, eight meta-atoms are designed to form a gradient Pancharatnam-Berry phase. After Pancharatnam-Berry phase is formed, a dual-beam metasurface is constructed, and then a gradient metsurface is designed to produce anomalous reflection. Finally, convolution operation is used to design two metasurfaces, and they generate dual- and quad-beams under circular and linear polarizations, respectively. Therefore, the designed metasurfaces can generate multiple beams in space. When graphene is in the high Fermi level 0.50 eV, phase difference between eight meta-atoms disappears, and only mirror reflection exists. Meanwhile, there must be a middle value in Fermi level of graphene to get multiple beams. At this moment, there are anomalously reflected beams and mirror beam. Using different responses of graphene in different Fermi levels, beam steering is achieved in terahertz band. Our design may provide a method for beam steering and terahertz communication.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3175811","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11974294); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515010375); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9779082","Beam steering;graphene;metasurface;pancharatnam-Berry;terahertz","Metasurfaces;Graphene;Reflection;Encoding;Metamaterials;Beam steering;Mirrors","","8","","43","CCBY","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An electrical coupling method based on a feeding capacitor, otherwise, excites the wavelength dipole mode of the suspended metal strip, and this higher mode resonance is further controlled by a tuning capacitor. In this way, the suspended metal strip involves a dual-port MIMO antenna pair, and both antennas operate as dipole-type radiators while having high port-to-port isolation because of the modal orthogonality.

In FDD systems, the PIM products may lie on the receiver band, thus possibly desensitizing the receiver chain. Unlike previous PIM cancellation works, we consider a challenging rank-2 dual-carrier MIMO transceiver scenario, with two spatially multiplexed signals per component carrier (CC). Stemming from the PIM modeling, we first present a cancellation method based on a complete set of identified basis functions (BFs). Additionally, to relax the processing complexity, we propose an alternative canceller solution with a reduced number of BFs, inspired by the problem modeling.

A stepped hybrid GaN/AlN buffer layer is adopted and the step is near the interface of the gate and drain. First, the breakdown voltage (BV) of the proposed S-HEMT is significantly improved with the introduction of a stepped hybrid GaN/AlN buffer layer, which can effectively modulate the electric field distributions along the channel. Second, the AlN buffer layer below the stepped GaN buffer has a large band offset and a strong polarization, which results in a much lower leakage current and a better carrier confinement. Consequently, the BV of the proposed S-HEMT will be improved at no expense of the specific on-resistance ( ${R} _{\mathrm{ on,sp}}$ ). Compared with those of the conventional p-GaN gate AlGaN/GaN HEMT on the same gate-to-drain distance of  $12 ~\mu \text{m}$ , a higher BV of 1781 V and FOM of 0.72 GW/cm2 are obtained for the proposed S-HEMT, which are both about five times.

The reliability of approximate computing circuits is calculated on the basis of the iterative Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM) model. During the calculation, the correlation coefficients are derived and combined to deal with the correlation problem caused by fanout reconvergence. The accuracy and scalability of the two methods are verified using three sets of approximate computing circuit instances and more circuits in EvoApprox8b, which is an approximate computing circuit open source library. Experimental results show that relative to the Monte Carlo simulation, the two methods achieve average error rates of 0.46% and 1.29% and time overheads of 0.002% and 0.1%.

Upon completion of the first difference, a second difference was performed by subtracting between TG and SRA data. The results obtained from the DD method were compared against that of: 1) a single-difference (SD) method through subtraction between measurements from TG and SRA and 2) a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) precise point positioning (PPP) method. The results showed that the DD method improved the performance of VLM estimation with an uncertainty below 1.0 mm/yr at most TG stations. Meanwhile, the estimated VLM trends acquired from the DD method correlated better to that of the ground-truth GNSS PPP solutions than the SD method.

This paper proposes a novel model, namely I-CNet, which leverages involution and convolution for improving the accuracy of image classification tasks, by extracting feature representations on both channel domain and spatial domain. The proposed I-CNet has been experimented on three image classification datasets. The experimental results show that involution component employed in I-CNet model can effectively represent cross-channel features in images and I-CNet is superior to other comparatives with higher classification accuracy achieved on all the three datasets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665787","Image classification;involution;convolution;hybrid architecture","Convolution;Transfer learning;Kernel;Feature extraction;Training;Task analysis;Optimization","","7","","20","CCBYNCND","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, dynamically switchable metasurfaces are proposed based on phase change material-vanadium dioxide. They consist of vanadium dioxide blocks, silicon dioxide spacer, and gold film. By changing the size of vanadium dioxide block, vanadium dioxide in the metallic state forms a gradient metasurface. A specially arranged gradient metasurface is designed to achieve a 360° phase modulation capability. Normally incident plane wave is reflected to the right side at the angle of 36.9° at 2.5 THz. When vanadium dioxide switches from the metallic state to the insulating state, the switching of anomalous reflection and specular reflection is realized. In addition, when vanadium dioxide is metal, a vortex beam generator is implemented to generate orbital angular momentum beams with l = 1 and l = 2. The number of orbital angular momentum mode can be switched from l = 0 to l = 1 or l = 2 by changing the state of vanadium dioxide. Since the structure of meta-atom is a square block, the design is simple and easy to integrate. At the same time, the switchable function is accurately implemented without side lobe. The proposed design has potential applications in terahertz switching and communication.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3183569","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11974294); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797794","Metasurface;vanadium dioxide;anomalous reflection;orbital angular momentum","Metasurfaces;Reflection;Optical switches;Electromagnetic scattering;Vanadium;Optical filters;Metamaterials","","7","","43","CCBY","16 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dual-band self-diplexing operation is achieved by coupling two microstrips (one for each band) to two radiating patches through H-shaped slots. The operating bandwidth has been enhanced by adding two parasitic patches above the radiating ones.

The nitrogen plasma treatment was more effective at reducing the sheet resistance ( ${R} _{\mathrm{ sheet}}$ ) of IGZTO films than the commonly used argon plasma treatment. Furthermore,  ${R} _{\mathrm{ sheet}}$  for nitrogen-plasma-treated IGZTO films remained low, even when the RF power and radiation time during the plasma treatment were increased when the minimum  ${R} _{\mathrm{ sheet}}$  was achieved. The same trends were also observed in OS films with different compositions, such as In-Ga-Zn-O and In-Sn-Zn-O. These results indicate that nitrogen plasma treatment is effective for achieving a reduction of  ${R} _{\mathrm{ sheet}}$  for various OS films with a wide process window regarding plasma processing parameters. The advantages could be attributed to the smaller sputtering effect on the OS films due to the lower mass of nitrogen ions than argon ions, which was verified by X-ray reflectivity and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. For further validation, SA IGZTO TFTs with a channel length ( ${L}$ ) of 3 to 100  $\mu \text{m}$  were fabricated with nitrogen or argon plasma treatment. The width-normalized parasitic SD resistance ( $R_{\mathrm{ SD}} {W}$ ) with the nitrogen plasma treatment was determined to be 11.3  $\Omega \cdot $ cm, which was ca. 40% lower than that with the argon plasma treatment. This improvement in  $R_{\mathrm{ SD}} {W}$  resulted in higher mobility ( $\mu $ ) in the nitrogen-plasma-treated SA IGZTO TFTs.

The accuracy of FOE can be improved effectively with lower additional computational complexity. Simulation results show that the mean square error of APFFT-FOE is reduced by more than one order of magnitude compared with the FFT-FOE.

In DOPF, all the generating units, including the ones that model the exports and imports of the BESS, across the entire network and the complete time horizon are integrated on to a single network. Subsequently, an AC-OPF is applied to dispatch their power outputs to minimize the total generation cost, while satisfying the power balance equations, and handling the unit and network constraints at each time step coupled with intertemporal constraints associated with the state of charge (SOC). Furthermore, the DOPF developed here entails the frequently applied constant current-constant voltage charging profile, which is represented in the SOC domain. Considering the practical application of a 1 MW BESS on a particular 33 kV network, the scheduling framework is designed to meet the pragmatic requirements of the optimum utilization of the available energy capacity of BESS in each cycle, while completing up to one cycle per day.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2020.03710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666819","Battery energy storage;day(s)-ahead scheduling;dynamic optimal power flow;load smoothing;renewable energy","Time-domain analysis;Schedules;Predictive models;Load modeling;Generators","","7","","","","30 Dec 2021","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Numerical simulations predict the dynamic range of the sensor as 160 dB after removal of the filters that can decrease this value. Applications based on the Internet of Things can be realized via mass production at low cost by eliminating the additional processes required to form the conventional color filters in front of the sensor.

Because transvenous access to the heart is difficult in patients with small veins, the majority of young children receive epicardial CIEDs. Unfortunately, however, once an epicardial CIED is placed, patients are no longer eligible to receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams due to the unknown risk of MRI-induced radiofrequency (RF) heating of the device. Although many studies have assessed the role of device configuration in RF heating of endocardial CIEDs in adults, such case for epicardial devices in pediatric patients is relatively unexplored. In this study, we evaluated the variation in RF heating of an epicardial lead due to changes in the lateral position and orientation of the implantable pulse generator (IPG). We found that changing the orientation and position of the IPG resulted in a five-fold variation in the RF heating at the lead's tip. Maximum heating was observed when the IPG was moved to a left lateral abdominal position of patient, and minimum heating was observed when the IPG was positioned directly under the heart. Clinical Relevance- This study examines the role of device configuration on MRI-induced RF heating of an epicardial CIED in a pediatric phantom.

We observe that the coherent supermode switches from out-of-phase to in-phase supermode with increasing equal current injection. The switching is found to be consistent with coupled mode theory and a 1-dimensional spatial supermode model. The calculated modal gain of the out-of-phase and in-phase array supermodes are consistent with the observed switching of the coherent supermodes.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2021.3117236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9556619","Optical coupling;semiconductor laser arrays;vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL)","Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Couplings;Indexes;Optical switches;Current measurement;Semiconductor laser arrays;Power measurement","","7","","17","CCBY","1 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have found that the main cause of the brightness increase is electron trapping into the gate insulator of driving thin-film transistor (DTFT) which operates in the saturation mode prone to hot carrier injection. We propose a novel driving method to suppress the brightness variation by applying a high voltage to the source and drain of the DTFT during the non-emitting time which is inserted periodically for dimming the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display.

Because the transition voltages play an important role in the oscillation behavior, area and thickness scaling analysis of NbOx-based devices is performed to identify the underlying mechanism. The threshold voltage ( $V_{th}$ ) is sensitive to the device area, indicating that the on state of the device is achieved by the local formation of a conductive phase. On the other hand, the area-independent hold voltage ( $V_{\mathrm{ hold}}$ ) becomes smaller due to the higher compliance current and increased temperature ambient, which implies that spontaneous dissolution of the phase is retarded.

There are various graphene tunable metamaterial absorbers in the mid-infrared region, whose absorption spectrum can be dynamically tuned by varying the Fermi potential of graphene. However, graphene absorbers working in the low mid-infrared region (4–7 μm) has limited tuning. In this work, the spectral tuning efficiency of a graphene based metal disc pattern and a graphene ribbon pattern metamaterial absorber is studied using FDTD simulation. The tunability in absorption spectrum achieved by metal disc absorber is 2–4%, which increased to 5–20% for graphene ribbon absorber with more than 85% absorption rate. Thus, the graphene pattern absorber significantly improves the tunability and provides broad tuning in 4–7 μm wavelength range. However, the graphene ribbon absorber is polarization dependent due to its non-symmetric shape. Hence, a new type of nano square hole (NSH) graphene absorber is proposed, which can easily be externally biased and provide polarization independent absorption. The NSH graphene absorber has wide tunability of 5–20% and high absorption rate of 85% similar to the graphene ribbon absorber. These results are very helpful to design tunable sensors and multispectral devices for gas sensor and biosensor applications.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3159447","Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Kerala, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743979","Absorber;Graphene;Metamaterial;Mid-infrared region;Tunable","Graphene;Absorption;Metals;Conductivity;Metamaterials;Optical surface waves;Surface waves","","7","","23","CCBYNCND","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Bayesian network, as an effective way to deal with the problem of uncertainty, can be used to track the change of the target threat level. Unfortunately, the traditional discrete dynamic Bayesian network (DDBN) has the problems of poor parameter learning and poor reasoning accuracy in a small sample environment with partial prior information missing. Considering the finiteness and discreteness of DDBN parameters, a fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm based on correlation of feature quantities (CF-FKNN) is proposed for DDBN parameter learning. Firstly, the correlation between feature quantities is calculated, and then the KNN algorithm with fuzzy weight is introduced to fill the missing data. On this basis, a reasonable DDBN structure is constructed by using expert experience to complete DDBN parameter learning and reasoning. Simulation results show that the CF-FKNN algorithm can accurately fill in the data when the samples are seriously missing, and improve the effect of DDBN parameter learning in the case of serious sample missing. With the proposed method, the final target threat assessment results are reasonable, which meets the needs of engineering applications.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2022.000076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9867956","discrete dynamic Bayesian network (DDBN);parameter learning;missing data filling;Bayesian estimation","Bayes methods;Estimation;Radio frequency;Filling;Correlation;Cognition;Uncertainty","","7","","30","","25 Aug 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The architecture of the system is based on a semiconductor laser (SL) under multi-path optical feedback (MPOF) provided by a 2 × 2 fiber coupler (FC) and a fiber mirror (FM). The results show that SLs with MPOF are more beneficial for achieving TDS suppressed chaotic output than those with single optical feedback (SOF) systems. In addition, the TDS of the chaotic signal generated by the SL under MPOF is insensitive to the length deviation of the feedback cavities, and therefore such a scheme is convenient for practical application. Furthermore, the influence of FC coupling ratio in the MPOF module, feedback strength, and bias current of the SL on the TDS is comprehensively studied. By selecting suitable parameters, the TDS of the chaotic signal generated by the SL under MPOF can be completely concealed. Finally, permutation entropy (PE) is adopted to evaluate the complexity of the generated chaotic signal, and the result demonstrates that the suppression of TDS does not lead to the degradation of complexity for the proposed scheme.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3133659","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61775184,61875167); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645382","Chaos;multi-path optical feedback (MPOF);semiconductor laser (SL);time-delay signature (TDS)","Optical feedback;Chaotic communication;Optical attenuators;Couplings;Fiber optics;Optical coupling;Time series analysis","","6","","28","CCBY","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because the S/D epi is grown separately at the bottom and the NS channels, nanosheet field-effect transistors (NSFETs) have unwanted GB within the S/D epi which fully relaxes the channel stresses. This GB changes the doping profiles and the stress values, which thus degrade the DC performances. We focused on single GB with different inclined angles and positions. N-type NSFETs have similar DC performances regardless of the GB since the changes of doping and stress were small. P-type NSFETs suffer from DC performance degradations but different depending on the GB positions. As the GB splits the p-type S/D epi into two, lower S/D below the GB has tensile stress and upper S/D above the GB has compressive stress. Since tensile stress increases boron diffusivity, more boron dopants diffuse into the NS channels as the device has lower S/D region, thus suffering the short channel effects greatly. The device having upper S/D region loses the channel stress much, so it degrades the on-state performance.

Unlike the parameter estimation method of the probability distribution in previous studies, NMTF can obtain several dependent latent variables simultaneously, and each latent variable in NMTF is associated with the cluster of the corresponding node in the HIN. The method is suited to co-clustering leveraging multiple metapaths in HIN, because NMTF is employed for multiple nonnegative matrix factorizations simultaneously in our study.

These challenges also make VLSI circuits more susceptible to soft-errors, particularly when subjected to harsh environmental conditions. Hybrid spintronic/CMOS technology has emerged as one of the promising techniques to achieve low leakage power and non-volatility. Moreover, the spintronic memories are inherently resistant to the radiation effects such as heavy-ion irradiation and total ionizing dose. However, its CMOS peripheral circuitry is more susceptible to radiation-induced single-event upset (SEU) and double-node upset (DNU).

From the perspective of networking, this letter proposes an OAM-based different modes networking method (OAM DMN) that sets adjacent cells with OAM carriers of different modes, so as to improve the signal quality and spectrum efficiency of wireless network and better adapt to the high-density base station distribution scenario. This letter firstly analyzes the characteristics of atmospheric channel on OAM waves by regarding turbulent as random phase screen based on Kolmogorov turbulence theory. Combining with stochastic geometry, we get the outage probability function of wireless cells. Then two types of OAM DMN schemes are proposed to test the performance of the network under different channel conditions. Simulation shows that OAM DMN wireless network has lower outage probability compared with other OAM-based and conventional networks and better performance on high-density base station distribution.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2022.3152735","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1803303); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L202002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717298","Orbital angular momentum;mobile communication;different modes networking;atmospheric turbulence","Base stations;Atmospheric modeling;Atmospheric waves;Interference;Harmonic analysis;Multiplexing;Power system reliability","","6","","19","CCBY","18 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The IISE can efficiently assess the impacts of low-order contingencies. The accuracy is, however, sacrificed as highorder contingencies are usually neglected. The IIMC is more suitable for large-scale contingency spaces compared with IISE, although the calculation process is time-consuming. In this paper, the proposed IIHybrid takes advantage of its strengths while avoiding its shortcomings. The IISE and the IIMC are applied to lower and higher contingency spaces respectively. The high-order contingencies elimination technique proposed in our previous studies is still applicable to the IIHybrid. In addition, efficiency can be controlled by modifying the preset parameters to adapt to various scenarios. Case studies are performed on the IEEE 118-bus test system and PEGASE System.

To realize the AC fault ride-through (FRT) of SLVHI, a new strategy based on DC chopper (DCC) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the mathematical model is built to investigate the VSC DC overvoltage mechanism after SLVHI commutation failure (CF) and related factors. Secondly, a modified DCC topology of SLVHI is designed to adjust the unbalanced power dissipation based on voltage drop depth. Thirdly, an enhanced voltage-dependent current order limiter (VDCOL) is proposed to deal with the unbalanced power after DCC switch-off. With the cooperation between modified DCC and enhanced VDCOL, the proposed FRT strategy can realize CF mitigation and VSC DC overvoltage suppression simultaneously. Finally, the inverter side AC FRT performances of the HVDC link with SLVHI were studied using PSCAD software/EMTDC algorithm. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy, with better CF mitigation and VSC DC overvoltage suppression abilities than offered by other existing FRT strategies under different fault scenarios.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2020.03510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465814","AC fault-ride through strategy;commutation failure;DC chopper;DC overvoltage;serial-connected LCC-VSC hybrid inverter","Voltage control;Inverters;Hybrid power systems;Surges;Power conversion;HVDC transmission;Topology","","6","","","","25 Jun 2021","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Due to the steadily increasing center frequency of front-end circuits, on-chip antennas are the preferred choice over PCB antennas and horn antennas when frequencies get close to THz. However, conventional on-chip antennas are severely limited in bandwidth, leading to increased use of wideband and multiresonant on-chip antennas. Besides a more complex design process of multiresonant antennas, they have the disadvantage of a nonconstant dispersive group delay (GD). This reduces the resolution of sensing systems, such as the range resolution and angular resolution of a radar system. In this work, we show how GD affects the imaging properties of a radar system. The measured S-parameter data from a 240-GHz multiresonant antenna are used to generate synthetic intermediate frequency (IF) signals of a rectangular array. Subsequently, simulated 3-D radar images are generated using the backprojection algorithm. These images are compared with those of a nondispersive imaging system.

This technique is performed by a real-time current reading while a pulsed bias is applied. The switching from a high resistive state, anti-parallel (AP) alignment, to a low resistive state, parallel (P) alignment, is investigated as well as the impact of the cell diameter on the switching parameters. We demonstrate that preswitching and switching times and energies have a log-linear relationship with the applied voltage. Increasing the applied voltage leads to a higher spin torque on the free layer in a shorter time. This decreases the time needed to change the magnetization orientation of this layer, thus the time required before the switching occurs. We have also shown that for a given applied voltage, the smaller the cell the longer the time before switching. For low applied voltages, the preswitching time increases exponentially dominating the whole reversal time. The longer switching times can be explained by a lower Joule heating not sufficient to induce the thermally activated reversal process. This phenomenon is accentuated for smaller cells, where the heating is more significant and the time before switching is shorter than for larger cells.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2022.3185324","French National Research Agency (ANR)(grant numbers:ANR-19-CE39-0010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9803020","Magnetic switching;MRAM devices;perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction;spin transfer torque","Switches;Voltage measurement;Semiconductor device measurement;Current measurement;Time measurement;Resistance;Real-time systems","","6","","23","CCBY","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to commonly developed toxic content detection systems that use lexicon and keyword-based detection, this work tries to embrace a different approach by the meaning of the sentence. Meaning representation is a way to grasp the meaning of linguistic input. This work proposed a data-driven approach utilizing Abstract meaning Representation to extract the meaning of the online text content into a convolutional neural network to detect level profanity. This work implements the proposed model in two kinds of datasets from the Offensive Language Identification Dataset and other datasets from the Offensive Hate dataset merged with the Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset.

Monitoring sea ice thickness and the mean sea level (MSL) of the frozen sea are performed using the interference frequency obtained by the GNSS interference pattern (IP) technique. The height variations between the GNSS antenna and the sea surface evaluated using the IP of the direct and reflected carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N0) are used to find the corresponding MSL. The GNSS-reflectometry (GNSS-R) derived MSL for open sea conditions agreed well with the mareograph data with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 2.72 cm with an R-squared value of 0.9644. For frozen sea, a notable difference was observed between the measured MSL and ground-truth MSL values. This difference was caused by the combined thickness of snow and ice above the frozen sea surface, also known as the total freeboard. Assuming the conditions for hydrostatic equilibrium is satisfied, total freeboard was converted to ice thickness. The ice thickness values agreed well with the published ice charts by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). The main uncertainty in the extracted ice thickness was due to the thick snow accumulation and unknown snow properties.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3198189","Academy of Finland 6Genesis Flagship(grant numbers:346208); 5G VIIMA project funded by Business Finland(grant numbers:6381/31/2018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854861","Freeboard;global navigational satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R);ice thickness;propagation;reflection;remote sensing;sea ice;snow","Snow;Sea surface;Sea measurements;Antenna measurements;IP networks;Global navigation satellite system;Reflector antennas","","6","","15","CCBY","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In many cases, such as magnets protected by active protection systems, this transient can be accurately simulated with a two-dimensional model. However, a more complex 3D model is required in the case of a self-protected magnet. Simulations are particularly challenging due to physical and geometrical features, such as highly non-linear material properties, sudden appearance of localized heat generation, non-isotropic conductors, and relatively thin insulation layers. In this work, it is shown how the quench and heat diffusion in 3D geometry can be accurately yet rapidly simulated using the finite-difference method. The coupled electro-thermal problem is solved with a semi-implicit Euler method. This 3D approach is included as a new feature in the STEAM-LEDET quench simulation software. As a study case, a simulation of the transient following a quench occurring in one of the self-protected LHC magnets is presented. Simulation results are found in excellent agreement with experimental results. The influence of 2D and 3D geometry, inter-filament coupling loss, and quench location on the simulated transient is discussed.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2022.3162798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743807","Accelerator magnet;numerical methods;quench protection;simulation;superconducting coil;thermal diffusion","Three-dimensional displays;Superconducting magnets;Solid modeling;Transient analysis;Computational modeling;Geometry;Thermal quenching","","6","","39","CCBY","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to meet the high voltage requirements and reduce costs, implementing a SSFCL based on series-connected insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) is a promising approach. However, voltage unbalancing of IGBTs would be introduced if the gateloops of the IGBTs are non-identical. In this paper, a plug-in gate-loop compensator with discrete gate voltage feedback and pulsewidth current compensation is proposed. The main merits are: 1) with the plug-in structure, the extra current sources only provide small power to fine-tune the gate-loop without affecting the functions provided by the commercial IGBT gate driver; 2) the gate-emitter voltages of IGBTs are compared with the preset thresholds to obtain control criterion, and the pulsewidths of the current sources are controlled for gate-loop compensation, thus both analog-digital and digital-analog converters are avoided; 3) the control law is easy to implement in FPGA, and is robust to voltage variation of power-loops. With the proposed compensator, the voltage unbalancing is alleviated immediately at the present switching cycle, and further eliminated cycle-by-cycle during the current limitation process. Experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed compensator.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2019.02450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8993696","Current limitation;direct current distribution network;insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs);voltage balancing","Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Logic gates;Voltage control;Gate drivers;Threshold voltage;Switches;Integrated circuits","","6","","","","13 Feb 2020","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Channel bonding imposes a new challenge in the DBA algorithm as the grant time interval allocated to a ONU must be the same in all its channel-bonded wavelengths. In this work, we propose a new DBA algorithm for NG-PONs supporting data services which is a combination of a proportional fairness strategy and a max-min fairness strategy and guarantees the constraints imposed by channel bonding.

These models are either employed in the SE domain with little to no change, or they are greatly tailored to source code and its unique characteristics. Many of these approaches are considered to be outperforming or complementing existing solutions. However, an important question arises here: Are these models evaluated fairly and consistently in the SE community?. To answer this question, we reviewed how NLP-based models for SE problems are being evaluated by researchers. The findings indicate that currently there is no consistent and widely-accepted protocol for the evaluation of these models. While different aspects of the same task are being assessed in different studies, metrics are defined based on custom choices, rather than a system, and finally, answers are collected and interpreted case by case. Consequently, there is a dire need to provide a methodological way of evaluating NLP-based models to have a consistent assessment and preserve the possibility of fair and efficient comparison.","","978-1-4503-9343-0","10.1145/3528588.3528665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9808680","Evaluation;Natural Language Processing;Software Engineering","Measurement;Protocols;Codes;Conferences;Natural language processing;Task analysis;Software engineering","","6","","18","CCBY","30 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, although we optimize the general quantum Hamiltonian on the basis of the structure of the multiplication table (factor up to 1 005 973), this study attempts to explore the simplification of Hamiltonian derived from the binary structure of the integers to be factored. A simple factorization on 143 with four qubits is provided to verify the potential of further advancing the integer-factoring ability of the D-Wave device.

Various effects of the curvature in the channel on the program and erase operation of the device have been investigated. When the channel is wave-shaped, the electric field tends to be concentrated on the corner region of the blocking oxide during the program operation, which causes increase of the electron back tunneling to the gate. Therefore, program speed degraded as the WF value higher. During the erase operation, the same with program operation, the electric field concentrated on the corner of the blocking oxide increased, enhanced electron back tunneling from the metal gate occurred while less amount of hole charge trapped. As a result,  $\text{V}_{\mathrm {TH}}$  shift after the erase operation decreased according to increased WF. This phenomenon becomes more serious on the short channel condition.

However, to maximize the transmission speed of such an OTDM system, it is necessary to generate the sinusoidal input light operating at the frequency much faster than the modulator’s bandwidth. As a result, the extinction ratio (ER) of the generated sinusoidal input light can be significantly reduced, which, in turn, causes a large crosstalk in this OTDM system. To solve this problem, we propose to enhance the ER of the sinusoidal input light simply by decreasing the bias voltage applied to the Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) used for its generation (from the quadrature point toward the null point). We estimate that, by using this technique, it is possible to increase the ER from 3.1 dB to 14.9 dB when the required sinusoidal frequency is three times faster than the MZM’s bandwidth. To verify the effectiveness of this ER enhancement technique, we realize the 2-channel OTDM system with a sinusoidally modulated input light source by using the MZMs having a 3-dB bandwidth of 17.2 GHz and demonstrate the transmission of the 300-Gb/s PAM8 signal.

In order to overcome the limitations of a geometric or deterministic modeling of existing obstacle loss models (ITU-R, W-I, and W-B model) and increase the accuracy of prediction of excess loss below 10 GHz in real urban environments, the improved empirical model is proposed by adding new variable and optimized fitting parameter values to the existing ITU-R model's formula. New variable and optimized parameter values reflect complex building structure and building height and their propagation impact through measurement. For validation of the proposed model, the self-verification and cross-verification were performed using the measured data from Korea and Japan. The measured data as well as the proposed model were presented as root-mean-square error that can be compared with other existing models in accuracy. The new proposed empirical model showed good agreement with the measured data compared to the existing geometric and deterministic models.

Irregular placement of array elements in a two-dimensional (2-D) array can achieve low-cost targets, but may generate large sidelobes if done without care. We introduce an optimization method to determine placement of array elements in a vehicular volumetric beam-scanning radar to minimize sidelobe power for typical automotive beam steering angles. Optimization with array constraints is realized using a gradient-based nonlinear programming technique. Optimization is accelerated by extending uv-projection planes beyond the unit circle. For a grating lobe-free scan area based on vehicular applications, the azimuth scanning FOV is increased by 11° bidirectionally to $\pm$54° compared to a reference triangular grid array with 24 elements.

However, during fabrication, the thermal reflow that occurs during the baking process and overdevelopment induces an inclination in the sidewalls of the waveguide. The construction of the angled sidewalls can influence the propagation mode properties of the waveguide, such as the evanescent field and loss. Hence, in this study, we designed and analyzed S-bend resonators to investigate the influence of the sidewall slope on the optical modes of the waveguide and the sensing performance of the resonator with respect to the variation of slope angles. The simulation results revealed that, as the sidewall slope deviated from the right angle (90°–65°), the sensitivity of the device increased by a factor of 1.8 due to the field leakage, whereas, the extinction ratio and Q-factor decreased by 54% and 37%, respectively. The results indicated that the sidewall slope induces a trade-off between the resolution and the sensitivity of the S-bend resonator.

Finally, the refined estimations are obtained by compensating the offsets, which are obtained via least squares (LS) without any complex searches. In addition, the refinement can be iteratively implemented to enhance the estimation results.

In this paper, a CMOS THz detector array at 0.65 THz with on-chip SPR antennas is designed in standard CMOS technology and the pixel crosstalk related to the SPR antenna parameters are investigated. Simulation results show that the adjacent SPR antenna spacing significantly affect the antenna crosstalk due to the surface wave propagation. To suppress the pixel crosstalk, the adjacent SPR antenna spacing is designed as 1.65 times larger than half of the antenna size. Under the condition, the S12 parameter between the adjacent antennas is reduced to -15 dB. High antenna isolation can be further available by the increase of the isolation layer thickness of the pixel up to 1 μm. Based on the simulation results, a 1×16 THz detector array at 0.65THz was fabricated. The experimental results show that the pixels in the array achieve uniform NEP, with an average value of about 32.6 pW/Hz0.5 and a standard deviation coefficient of about 9.6%.

These variabilities are assumed to cause a domain shift in the images of different hospitals. It is crucial to overcome this domain shift because an ideal machine-learning model must be able to work on the diverse sources of images, independent of the acquisition center. A domain generalization technique is leveraged in this study to improve the generalization capability of a Deep Neural Network (DNN), to an unseen histopathology image set (i.e., from an unseen hospital/trial site) in the presence of domain shift.

It is found that a layer of white powder was formed on the surface of the sheds, the hydrophobicity level of which come to a range from HC1 to HC4, and the tensile stress tolerance and mechanical strength of the silicone rubber decreased significantly. Further, XPS analysis, FTIR detection, and TG analysis were carried out to explore the microscopic process inside the material during its chalking. The results show that the oxidation reaction of Si-C bond transforms the composition of silicone rubber, bringing damage to its apparent performance; the generation of strong polar groups such as –C=O group is the main reason for the decrease in the flexibility of the silicone rubber structure and then the formation of a powdered layer; and above all, the chalking process is based on a series of chemical decomposition reactions, in which the decomposition of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as silicone rubber matrix plays a predominant role, and the decomposition of aluminum hydroxide (ATH) serves as a secondary.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3140764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9672132","composite insulator;chalking;mechanism analysis;decomposition","Surface treatment;Powders;Rubber;Aging;Tensile stress;Surface cracks;Inspection","","5","","","CCBYNCND","6 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Adversarial attacks that can lead ANNs to misrecognize images have been reported in many studies. However, the characteristics of TTFS-based SNNs trained using a backpropagation algorithm against adversarial attacks have not yet been clarified. In particular, the dependence of the robustness against adversarial attacks on spike timings has not been investigated. In this brief, we investigated the robustness of SNNs against adversarial attacks and compared it with that of an ANN.

Because of attractive features of the well-known wind turbine baseline controller, the proposed controller acts as an augmented controller and works in parallel to the baseline controller. As typical variable-speed wind turbines have different controllers for different operation regions, for each operation region, a dedicated interval type-2 fuzzy controller is designed. Because of the uncertainty in wind speed measurement, modern control techniques try to estimate this value. However, in contrast to these modern control techniques, the proposed controller is independent of the wind speed estimation. Thus, there is a better saving in cost and computational burden. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, simulations are conducted with wind profiles which span all operation regions. Results show that, compared with the baseline controller, the proposed controller enhances power generations and reduces mechanical loads concurrently.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2019.000374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290329","Interval type-2 fuzzy control;baseline controller;wind speed measurement;wind turbine","Wind turbines;Wind speed;Rotors;Observers;Fuzzy systems;Torque;Standards","","5","","33","","10 Dec 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

By heating the tapered PMF, the localized peak may be discretely tuned with the temperature at the step, depending on the intermodal interference. Tunability may become continuous when additional stress is exerted longitudinally on the tapered PMF. The tapered PMF Sagnac interferometer is inserted into the laser cavity to achieve broadly and continuously tunable output.

First, the frequency regulation reserve classification is proposed. In the classification, the available frequency response capacity reserves of each interconnection are divided into commercial reserves and regular reserves. While the commercial reserves are procured through long-term contracts, the regular reserves are purchased based on market prices of frequency regulation services. Secondly, based on the proposed frequency regulation reserve classification, a novel frequency regulation control is then introduced for the VSC-MTDC system. This control method could minimize the costs of the disturbed power grid for the needed frequency response supports from the other power grids. Simulation verifications are performed on a modified IEEE 39 bus system and a highly reduced power system model representing the North American grids. The simulation verification indicates that the developed frequency regulation control significantly reduced ancillary service costs of the disturbed power grid.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2020.05800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420359","Frequency regulation control;optimized reserve allocation;response reserve classification;VSC-MTDC","Frequency control;Power conversion;Converters;Frequency response;Resource management;HVDC transmission;Voltage control","","5","","","","30 Apr 2021","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

However, with the widening of scales and deepening of network layers, it has become increasingly challenging to design such algorithms when the issues of message dissemination at high levels and the contention management at the physical layer are considered. Accordingly, the abstract medium access control (absMAC) layer, which was proposed in 2009, is designed to solve this problem. Specifically, the absMAC layer consists of two basic operations for network agents: the acknowledgement operation to broadcast messages to all neighbors and the progress operation to receive messages from neighbors. The absMAC layer divides the wireless algorithm design into two independent and manageable components, i.e., to implement the absMAC layer over a physical network and to solve higher-level problems based on the acknowledgement and progress operations provided by the absMAC layer, which makes the algorithm design easier and simpler. In this study, we consider the implementation of the absMAC layer under jamming. An efficient algorithm is proposed to implement the absMAC layer, attached with rigorous theoretical analyses and extensive simulation results. Based on the implemented absMAC layer, many high-level algorithms in non-jamming cases can be executed in a jamming network.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552655","abstract MAC layer;distributed algorithm;Rayleigh-fading model;jamming networks","Jamming;Interference;Wireless networks;Rayleigh channels;Physical layer;Distributed algorithms;Computational modeling","","4","","","","29 Sep 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The anti-resonant reflecting guidance mechanism in the silica capillary is influenced by the presence of the liquids. By immersing a section of liquid-filled SMF-Capillary-SMF structure into liquids, both the resonant wavelength and transmission intensity are altered due to a liquid-modified resonant condition. Temperature change will lead to the refractive index (RI) variation of liquids, causing the resonant wavelength to shift. Experimental results indicate that the temperature sensitivity is dependent on the RI value of the liquids, and the liquid temperature sensitivity of 2.99 nm/°C is experimentally achieved in the temperature range of 25 °C-60 °C when the liquid RI is 1.39. On the other hand, the transmission intensity at resonant wavelength, which is determined by the reflectivity at the inner and outer surfaces of the ring cladding, can be affected when the RI of the ambient liquid changes. The intensity at resonant wavelength increases as the ambient RI rises, and the RI sensitivity varies from 240 dB/RIU to 60 dB/RIU in the RI range of 1.31 to 1.39.

The wide bandgap barrier on top of the narrow bandgap IGZO channel serves as a protection layer between the IGZO channel and the SiO2 top gate insulator to prevent plasma-induced damage on the IGZO channel caused by the S/D metal etching and the top gate insulator deposition. As for the mobility using the bottom gate operation with the top gate grounded, the DL-TFTs show higher mobility (1.06 $\times$ ) at the room temperature due to less Coulomb scattering caused by the plasma-induced damage for percolation conduction, while the SL-TFTs have higher mobility at low temperatures due to the improved hopping efficiency for thermally activated hopping. The hysteresis is temperature independent down to 160 K, indicating the electrons tunneling between the channel and the top gate insulator is dominant. As for the reliability, DL-TFT has a smaller Vth shift than SL-TFT under both positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) due to less subgap defect in the channel.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2021.3130211","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 110-2218-E-A49-013-MBK,MOST 110-2218-E-002-030,MOST 110-2622-8-002-014); Ministry of Education, Taiwan(grant numbers:NTU-CC-110L892601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624968","Amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO);band alignment;double layers;In-Ga-Zn-O;mobility enhancement;quantum well;thin-film transistor (TFT)","Logic gates;Hysteresis;Plasma temperature;Metals;Insulators;Etching;Thin film transistors","","4","","21","CCBY","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, different stages of the dynamic process are detected based on the continuity of derivatives of the measurement. Second, a complete set of mathematical functions that produce the dynamic responses in electric devices are formulated. Third, a parsimonious set of mathematical functions is selected at each stage by performing feature selection using nonlinear principal component analysis. The proposed model is further formulated based on the parsimonious set of mathematical functions at each stage. Finally, the parameters of the proposed model corresponding to different system events are solved. Based on the formulated model, its possible application in event detection is further analyzed.

It was found that a short time proton irradiation (~ 50 sec) can promote beneficial effects on device performances, which results in great reduction in the off-state leakage current and the gate leakage current without degrading the output current and transconductance. The pulsed I-V measurement demonstrated that both devices exhibit greatly improved current dispersion characteristics and, particularly, the device with AlN buffer layer shows stronger radiation hardness than that of the device with GaN buffer layer. These interesting results are believed to be due to the hydrogen passivation with thermal annealing effect during the proton irradiation. It is expected that the proper irradiation condition such as fluence, energy, and time is crucial to improve the device performances, rather than to deteriorate the performances.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2021.3128191","Kyungpook National University Research Fund 2018; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9615384","AlGaN/GaN;HEMT;proton irradiation;hydrogen passivation","Radiation effects;Protons;Buffer layers;Wide band gap semiconductors;Aluminum gallium nitride;MODFETs;HEMTs","","4","","14","CCBY","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The magnitudes of space charge at that interface depend on the applied electric field and the electrode material. In this work, the charge density is computed for a slab model of Cu (111)/PE (001) in its pure condition and then with chemical impurities present in the PE chains. The density-functional theory (DFT) is used as a computational quantum mechanics to evaluate the charge density in the interface region. An electric field is applied between vacuum regions attached to the model to study the effect of presence of chemical impurities on the distribution of charge density along the interface. The chemical impurities used in this study are carbonyl, vinyl and conjugated double bond. It is found that the peak value of negative charge density near the Cu atoms at the interface region decreases as the impurity-created barrier height decreases. It is also found that changes in the charge density near the interface region occur only within 6  $\text{A}^{\mathrm {o}}$  inside PE chains; the charge density becomes constant thereafter, i.e., in the PE bulk. This paper reveals that the position of chemical impurities in PE chain influences the maximum change in charge density relative to its bulk values. The maximum change in charge density is found to be related to the trap depth in PE band gap, which is created by the presence of chemical impurities. It is concluded that the charge density distribution is affected by chemical impurities in PE and, in turn, affects the charge accumulation process.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9779727","Charge density;chemical impurities;polyethylene;copper;barrier height;trap depth;density-functional theory (DFT)","Impurities;Computational modeling;Polyethylene;Space charge;Chemicals;Slabs;Copper","","4","","25","CCBY","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, it becomes imperative to investigate and contextualize the unique climatic conditions in those locations where FSO links are to be deployed. Statistical evaluation of meteorological visibility data collected for various cities in South Africa is thus hereby employed in estimating the availability performance of FSO links transmitting at both 850 nm and 1550 nm. It is determined that the cities of Mbombela and Cape Town have the lowest performance due to the high occurrence of fog events as compared to other regions in South Africa. During foggy periods, FSO links in Mbombela and Cape Town would have availabilities of ∼99.6% for link distances of 500 and 600 metres, respectively. The bit error rate (BER) estimations of intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) FSO links in the presence of weak atmospheric turbulence were also investigated for the identified locations during foggy weather; with the cities of Mafikeng and Kimberley showing the lowest BER performances because of their high wind velocities, altitudes and refractive index values. In order to obtain a BER of 10−6, receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values ranging from ~46 to ~51 dB are required for FSO links deployed for data transmission in the various cities investigated in this work.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2022.9695423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9695423","Aerosol scattering attenuation;atmospheric turbulence;BER;FSO;link availability;minimum required visibility","Urban areas;Meteorology;Scattering;Attenuation;Atmospheric modeling;Aerosols;Optical scattering","","4","","","","27 Jan 2022","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

While the scattering clutters were not able to be converted due to the loss of spatial coherence. Therefore, the target reflected signal and scattering clutters were spatially separated by the SPP. An underwater laser detection simulation using Zemax software was carried out. The numerical simulation showed that when the SPP was placed in front of the receiver, the contrast of signal to clutter of the detection was improved by blocking the scattering clutters which had a Gaussian distribution at the center on the detection plane.

This experiment garnered participation from stations across the country, demonstrating considerable volunteer interest: 45 recordings of WWV’s 5-MHz beacon were collected.

Similar to the modelling of a synchronous generator (SG), the internal dynamics of a DFIGWT are also described with differential equations of newly constructed virtual rotor angle and internal electromotive force (EMF) in the SGM model. Moreover, the power flow of a DFIGWT is expressed by nonlinear functions of its virtual rotor angle and internal EMF. The SGM model bridges the gap between the irregular and complex modelling of DFIGWTs and the well-developed energy function construction techniques for SG models. Based on the SGM model, a numerical energy function is constructed for power systems with DFIGWT generation.

The BCI system, in general, necessitates a calibration technique to obtain subject/session-specific data in order to tune the model each time the system is utilized. This issue is acknowledged as a key hindrance to BCI, and a new strategy based on domain generalization has recently evolved to address it. In light of this, we've concentrated on developing an EEG classification framework that can be applied directly to data from unknown domains (i.e. subjects), using only data acquired from separate subjects previously. For this purpose, in this paper, we proposed a framework that employs the open-set recognition technique as an auxiliary task to learn subject-specific style features from the source dataset while helping the shared feature extractor with mapping the features of the unseen target dataset as a new unseen domain. Our aim is to impose cross-instance style in-variance in the same domain and reduce the open space risk on the potential unseen subject in order to improve the generalization ability of the shared feature extractor. Our experiments showed that using the domain information as an auxiliary network increases the generalization performance. Clinical relevance—This study suggests a strategy to improve the performance of the subject-independent BCI systems. Our framework can help to reduce the need for further calibration and can be utilized for a range of mental state monitoring tasks (e.g. neurofeedback, identification of epileptic seizures, and sleep disorders).","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871434","","Training;Sleep;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Planning;Calibration","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Calibration;Electroencephalography;Humans;Neurofeedback","4","","22","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The experimental results indicate that the PM remanence not only varies at high temperatures, which is well known, but also changes under high mechanical stress. It is shown that the PM remanence increases with the mechanical stress but decreases with the temperature rise. Accordingly, a new demagnetization-curve model of the magnets under multiple stresses is refined to better express the PM characteristics. The performance of a high-speed PM machine is then analyzed as an example to indicate the necessity of the model refinement.

Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation has been proven to be an efficient way to optimize energy consumption in data centers, and many research works have proposed to optimize VM consolidation. However, the performance of different algorithms is related with the characteristics of the workload and system status; some algorithms are suitable for Central Processing Unit (CPU)-intensive workload and some for web application workload. Therefore, an adaptive VM consolidation framework is necessary to fully explore the potential of these algorithms. Neat is an open-source dynamic VM consolidation framework, which is well integrated into OpenStack. However, it cannot conduct dynamic algorithm scheduling, and VM consolidation algorithms in Neat are few and basic, which results in low performance for energy saving and Service-Level Agreement (SLA) avoidance. In this paper, an Intelligent Neat framework (I-Neat) is proposed, which adds an intelligent scheduler using reinforcement learning and a framework manager to improve the usability of the system. The scheduler can select appropriate algorithms for the local manager from an algorithm library with many load detection algorithms. The algorithm library is designed based on a template, and in addition to the algorithms of Neat, I-Neat adds six new algorithms to the algorithm library. Furthermore, the framework manager helps users add self-defined algorithms to I-Neat without modifying the source code. Our experimental results indicate that the intelligent scheduler and these novel algorithms can effectively reduce energy consumption with SLA assurance.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515697","cloud computing;dynamic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation;OpenStack;Neat;reinforcement learning","Heuristic algorithms;Data centers;Central Processing Unit;Libraries;Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Data models","","4","","","","17 Aug 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

It applies to many areas, where it has achieved success, such as healthcare, where a patient is monitored using nodes and lightweight sensors. However, the powerful functions of IoT in the medical field are based on communication, analysis, processing, and management of data autonomously without any manual intervention, which presents many difficulties, such as energy consumption. However, these issues significantly slow down the development and rapid deployment of this technology. The main causes of wasted energy from connected objects include collisions that occur when two or more nodes send data simultaneously and the leading cause of data retransmission that occurs when a collision occurs or when data are not received correctly due to channel fading. The distance between nodes is one of the factors influencing energy consumption. In this article, we have proposed direct communication between nodes to avoid collision domains, which will help reduce data retransmission.

It is an essential component in the radial power combiners to convert the electromagnetic modes between rectangular and circular waveguides. The latter feeds the cylindrical cavity in TM01 mode of which the fields exhibit a circular symmetry. The proposed TM01 mode transducer consists of the dipole antenna, microstrip, and probe on a dielectric substrate. It is an in-line mode transducer. In other words, the rectangular and circular waveguides are aligned along the same axis of wave propagation. Therefore, it does not require the waveguide components such as tee junctions, steps, and bends which are normally used in the traditional mode transducers and increase the complexity, size, and loss of entire power combiner. The eight-way radial junction is also designed using a cylindrical cavity, where the rectangular waveguides are placed along the circumference of the cylindrical cavity. The dimensions of each component are determined based on the full-wave electromagnetic simulations. The designed eight-way radial power combiner consisting of the TM01 mode transducer and radial junction is fabricated in four-split blocks by mechanical machining. In the measurements, the proposed power combiner exhibits a broadband and low-loss performance under a compact size while maintaining the magnitude and phase balances between the eight ports.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3215952","Samsung Research Funding and Incubation Center of Samsung Electronics(grant numbers:SRFC-IT2002-08); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925235","Ka-band;millimeter waveguide power combiner/divider;mode-conversion;radial junction;TM₀₁ mode transducer","Transducers;Rectangular waveguides;Waveguide junctions;Circular waveguides;Power combiners;Dipole antennas;Microstrip antennas","","4","","25","CCBYNCND","19 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose to use the mutual information (MI) of the channel input-output signal pair, which yields to the minimization of the a-posteriori information of the transmitted codeword given the communication channel output observation. The computation of the a-posteriori information is a formidable task, and for the majority of channels it is unknown. Therefore, it has to be learned. For such an objective, we propose a novel neural estimator based on a discriminative formulation. This leads to the derivation of the mutual information neural decoder (MIND). The developed neural architecture is capable not only to solve the decoding problem in unknown channels, but also to return an estimate of the average MI achieved with the coding scheme, as well as the decoding error probability.

However, as the IoT devices within the same coverage of the BS can offload lots of tasks simultaneously, the FN can be overloaded, resulting in scalability issues due to limited computing resources. As a promising solution to this problem, opportunistic FNs (OFNs) which denote FNs with mobility such as smart phones and vehicles have been considered as they opportunistically reduce the load of static FNs. IoT devices can offload a task and receive the result to/from the OFN directly when OFN is close to the device. In addition, the offloading can be conducted indirectly through the BS when the OFN is not in the vicinity of the IoT devices while it is within the coverage of the BS. To assess the offloading performance according to the mobility of the OFN considering the direct and indirect offloading scenarios, we developed an analytic model for the opportunistic offloading probability that the task can be offloaded to the OFN, which can also be interpreted as the load distribution effect. Extensive simulation results are given to validate the analytic model and to demonstrate the performance of the opportunistic offloading probability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3141199","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2020R1G1A1100493); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9673789","Fog computing;opportunistic fog node;load distribution","Task analysis;Internet of Things;Probability density function;Computer architecture;Edge computing;Analytical models;Resource management","","4","","28","CCBY","7 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In 2017, China joined the programme with in-kind prototypes and twelve (four spares) series magnets with WST, IMP, IHEP, and BAMA efforts. The first MCBRD magnet built in China is the second prototype (P2) of the programme. This magnet was subjected to triggered energy extractions at CERN magnet test facility. The energy extraction is used for magnet protection, keeping voltage-to-ground and hot-spot temperature below 560 V and 250 K, respectively. A high magnetic-field change rate during the magnet discharge from high currents causes a substantial quench-back due to the heat generated by the eddy currents in the magnet formers. A specialized software, ProteCCT, was developed as part of the STEAM project to simulate such a unique quench behaviour. This contribution focuses on comparing measured results between the P1 and P2 magnets, and P2 quench measurement and simulation results.

The presence of such signals is considered as indicative of sharp inversion layers associated with planetary boundary layer. We investigate the potential application of deep occultation signals for detection of tropical cyclones often resulting in strong vertical gradients of refractivity. The most prominent deep signatures computed using 1 s running mean filter can reach 400 V/V, whereas the majority of deep signals exceed the noise level by a factor of two.

Thus, the threat of presentation attacks needs to be addressed to strengthen the security of the biometric systems. Since a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) captures static features from video frames, the camera motion might hinders the performance of modern CNNs for video-based presentation attack detection (PAD). Inspired by the egomotion theory, we introduce an adaptive spatiotemporal global sampling (ASGS) technique to compensate the camera motion and use the resulting estimation to encode the appearance and dynamics of the video sequences into a single RGB image. This is achieved by adaptively splitting the video into small segments and capturing their global motion within each segment. The proposed global motion is estimated based on four key steps: dense sampling, FREAK feature extraction and matching, similarity transformation, and aggregation function. This allows using deep models pre-trained on images for video-based PAD detection. Moreover, the interpretation of ASGS reveals that the most important parts for supporting the decision on PAD are consistent with motion cues associated with the artifacts, i.e., hand movement, material reflection, and expression changes. Extensive experiments on four standard face PAD databases demonstrate its effectiveness and encourage further study in this domain.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2022.3169435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761244","Dense sampling;Image warping;Face recognition;Global Motion;Presentation Attack Detection;Deep learning.","Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Face recognition;Motion segmentation;Databases;Circuits and systems;Cameras","","4","","","CCBY","21 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In seismic structure interpretation, it is very difficult, time-consuming, and relatively economic costs to prepare training datasets by directly annotating real seismic data. Seismic convolution method is an efficient way to synthesize seismic data, which can easily and quickly generate a large amount of training datasets. However, there are large differences in feature space between synthetic seismic data and real seismic data. That results in the poor performance of network models trained using synthetic training datasets on real seismic data. In this article, we propose to use Fourier domain adaptation (FDA) to achieve domain transfer. First, the amplitude spectrum of synthetic seismic data is replaced with those of real seismic data to make feature space mapping. Then synthetic seismic data is used for transfer training of network models to improve their performance on real seismic data. The experimental results demonstrate that the FDA performs the domain transfer of synthetic seismic data to real seismic data, which improves the generalization of network models trained based on synthetic seismic data. Meanwhile, the FDA is a promising method for deep learning model transfer training in seismic structure interpretation.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3218911","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U19B2008); Research on Artificial Intelligence Methods for Seismic Processing and Interpretation of Petrochina(grant numbers:2021DJ3505); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42074136,U19B2006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9934908","Deep learning;domain transfer;Fourier domain adaptation (FDA);seismic interpretation","Data models;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Adaptation models;Discrete Fourier transforms;Deep learning;Biological system modeling","","4","","9","CCBYNCND","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we have exploited a special high pressure annealing (HPA) process, called alcohol-thermal method (ATM), to improve the symmetry of TiN/HZO/TiN capacitors. The original control device exhibits asymmetric leakage current and coercive fields. This has been significantly improved by the ATM, which was performed at temperature of 240°C and atmospheric pressure of 70 atm, in C2H6O ambient. The enhancement of ferroelectricity can be attributed to the reduction of the thickness and defects of the non-ferroelectric layers in the device. The improvement of symmetry leads to the operation ability under low voltages, which is critical to the endurance of devices. Under the electric field of 2.4 MV/cm with 10 MHz frequency, the lifetime of the TiN/ HZO/TiN device after HPA process was measured up to 1010 cycles.

The approach, while being application layer transparent, guarantees fluidity to all users but it provides priority-based services to premium users, identified by their Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) profiles. Since different service qualities can be accommodated using WTP, the approach can be extended to XR services, immersive videos, live uplink streaming. To achieve this goal, the allocation problem is firstly formulated as a classical Game Theory problem whose closed form solution is clearly understood in the literature. In a nutshell, the WTP-based, Game Theoretically Optimal Bandwidth Allocation (WTP-GTOBA), firstly satisfies the minimum bandwidth needs of each user and then fairly distributes the residual bandwidth. WTP-GTOBA can be approximately implemented by a greedy, application layer transparent algorithm to be implemented at a DASH-aware network element managing different neighbouring radio access stations. Thereby, the proposed method is suitable for integration of WTP and resource management among multiple service providers and heterogeneous client groups. Numerical simulations carried out under a realistic scenario show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art application-layer transparent competitors, providing premium quality and/or guaranteed fluidity to different users based on their WTP.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9737064","Bandwidth allocation;quality of experience;SAND/DASH;video streaming","Streaming media;Bandwidth;Resource management;Quality of experience;Bit rate;Games;Uplink","","4","","","","16 Mar 2022","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Specifically, the coordination of hierarchical policies implemented among government departments is one of the key challenges to rural revitalization. In recent years, various well-established quantitative methods have been proposed to evaluate policy coordination, but the majority of these relied on manual analysis, which can lead to subjective results. Thus, in this paper, a novel approach called ""policy knowledge graph for the coordination among the government departments"" (PG-CODE) is proposed, which incorporates topic modeling into policy knowledge graphs. Similar to a knowledge graph, a policy knowledge graph uses a graph-structured data model to integrate policy discourse. With latent Dirichlet allocation embedding, a policy knowledge graph could capture the underlying topics of the policies. Furthermore, coordination strength and topic diffusion among hierarchical departments could be inferred from the PG-CODE, as it can provide a better representation of coordination within the policy space. We implemented and evaluated the PG-CODE in the field of rural innovation and entrepreneurship policy, and the results effectively demonstrate improved coordination among departments.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645439","policy knowledge graph;department coordination;topic diffusion;latent dirichlet allocation;rural revitalization","Entrepreneurship;Government;Technological innovation;Data models;Local government;Standards;Resource management","","4","","","","9 Dec 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The extremely compact frequency multiplier is broadly tunable in wavelength and in OFC repetition frequency, making it interesting for high-spectral-purity mm-waves applications. OFC generation with a 2.6 GHz spacing and 19 tones within a 10 dB power range and an optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) higher than 40 dB is reported. Using a 74 GHz-bandwidth photodetector, we achieve a set of 2.6 GHz phase-stabilized electrical tones, reaching carriers up to 39 GHz with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In particular, the OFC-based tenfold-multiplied signal (26 GHz) provides a remarkable low-phase-noise feature, equivalent to the commercially available radiofrequency (RF) generator used as a source at the same electrical power. At 26 GHz, phase-noise of −50 dBc/Hz and −80 dBc/Hz are reported for 10 Hz and 1 kHz offsets, respectively.

This technology could be coupled with micro-pumps, embedded sensors, actuators and electronics to create Micro Transdermal Interface Platforms - smart, wearable infusion systems capable of delivering precise microdoses over a prolonged period. Using 500 µm tall hollow microneedles, ex-vivo human skin and a customized application/retraction device, this work focuses on comparing two infusion control strategies, namely ‘set pressure’ (SP) and ‘set flow’ (SF) infusion. It was found that flow-controlled infusion was capable of delivering higher volumes than pressure-driven delivery, and a mean volume of 3.8 mL was delivered using a set flowrate of 50 µL/minute.

Compared with the conventional VLD structure with the same size, its measured breakdown voltage increases by 11%. The breakdown voltage still has a positive temperature coefficient. And, the leakage current changes very little from −40 to 150 °C. Besides, it is more immune to the deviation of the VLD dosage. The deviation range of the VLD dosage increase from −20% - +20% to −50% - +60% when the breakdown voltage keeps above 90% of the maximum value.

The goal was to evaluate differences in FHR and UP patterns between fetuses with normal outcomes and those who developed hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). For this purpose, we modeled the sequence of FHR patterns and uterine contractions using Multi-Chain Semi-Markov models (MCSMMs). These models estimate the probability of transitioning between FHR or UP patterns and the dwell time of each pattern. Our results showed that in comparison to the control group, the HIE group had: (1) more frequent uterine contractions during the last 12 hours before birth; (2) more frequent FHR decelerations during the last 12 hours before birth; (3) longer decelerations during the last eight hours before birth; and (4) shorter baseline durations during the last five hours before birth. These results demonstrate that the fetuses in the HIE group were subject to a more stressful environment than those in the normal group. Clinical Relevance— Our results revealed statistically significant differences in FHR/UP patterns between the normal and HIE groups in the hours before birth.

This letter analyzes the source of EM noise from the power modules using GaN transistors in half-bridge circuits. EM noise was clearly observed in the proximity of power modules and attributed to two primary sources in the frequency range of interest up to 6 GHz: 1) the periodical switching operation of GaN transistors in the output stage and 2) the logic operation of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor digital circuits to control gate drivers, in the lower and upper side of frequencies, respectively. Measurements analyzed the EM noise characteristics at different probing locations over the assembly of two GaN power modules as well as in different operating conditions by strategically supplying source signals. The influence of EM noise on LTE receiver performance is evaluated with wireless system-level simulation and related to the degradation of its minimum receivable input power.","2637-6423","","10.1109/LEMCPA.2022.3207234","Development of Technical Examination Services Concerning Frequency Crowding, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication, Japan(grant numbers:JPJ000254); ICOM Foundation, Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9893896","DC–DC power conversion;electromagnetic interference (EMI);mobile communication;noise measurements;power semiconductor devices","DC-DC power converters;Gallium nitride;Electromagnetic interference;Frequency measurement;Mobile communication;Power semiconductor devices;Noise measurement","","3","","11","CCBY","16 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These values were an order of magnitude higher than those obtained by manual optimizations. However, further improvement above these values was saturated because of the insufficient accuracy of the neural network model at the high Q regime. Instead of applying the model, we repeated directly calculating Qs, implementing a covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy algorithm to search structures in this study.

Kriging is an outstanding geostatistal interpolation technique that employs variography to understand the spatial variability of known samples at specific locations to predict unmeasured samples, based on the fact that there is an implied connection between the measured value and its location in space. The research we here report is aimed at validating the improvement in predictions when this tool is included for mmWave frequency path loss modeling in a long indoor corridor with break. In order to quantify the accuracy of the proposed methodology, it is compared with a well-established procedure described in the literature. Extensive path-loss measurements were collected through specialized narrowband sounders at 28 and 60 GHz.

Due to the impact of negative capacitance on the source-to-drain potential profile, tunneling distance and its drain-bias dependence, the short-channel effects can be substantially improved for InGaAs NC-FinFETs. Our study indicates that, with the larger NC effect of the III-V channel, the gap in DIBL and subthreshold swing between InGaAs and Si FinFETs in the sub-20 nm gate-length regime can become much closer.

The carry signal (CN) of the driver, being generated through the voltage bootstrapping approach using a CN-connected capacitor, is used to pre-charge the following stage of the driver. As the rising and falling time of CN is much shorter than that of the gate driving signal GN, the bootstrapping voltage is increased and voltage loss of the pre-charge transistor can be much reduced, to avoid the driver’s malfunction at low temperature. This structure further benefits maintaining the driving speed over long operation time at high temperature. On the other hand, the GN, instead of CN, is used to reset the gate driver to suppress the voltage feed-through effects. One single stage of the driver consists of 11 TFTs and 2 capacitors, driven by 4 clock signals with the duty ratio of 25%. An a-Si:H TFTs implemented single stage circuit of the driver occupies an area of 250  $\mu \text{m}\times 1099\,\,\mu \text{m}$ . Measurements show that the output voltage magnitude can be maintained well when temperature varies from  $- 40\,\,^{\circ} \text{C}$  to 80 °C.

The Piecewise Rational Method (PRM) scalar advection scheme in the Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES) solves the moisture flux advection equation based on PRM. Computation of the scalar advection involves boundary exchange, and computation of higher bandwidth requirements is complicated and time-consuming in GRAPES. Recently, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been widely used to solve scientific and engineering computing problems owing to advancements in GPU hardware and related programming models such as CUDA/OpenCL and Open Accelerator (OpenACC). Herein, we present an accelerated PRM scalar advection scheme with Message Passing Interface (MPI) and OpenACC to fully exploit GPUs' power over a cluster with multiple Central Processing Units (CPUs) and GPUs, together with optimization of various parameters such as minimizing data transfer, memory coalescing, exposing more parallelism, and overlapping computation with data transfers. Results show that about 3.5 times speedup is obtained for the entire model running at medium resolution with double precision when comparing the scheme's elapsed time on a node with two GPUs (NVIDIA P100) and two 16-core CPUs (Intel Gold 6142).

To this end, we designed a survey to learn the landscape of intersectional identities in tech, where these populations contribute data, and how marginalized populations feel about the impact technology has on their day to day lives.

For wavelength-stabilization, 7th order, monolithic DBRs are etched on the surface of fully grown epitaxial layer structures. The investigated ETAS reference Fabry-Pérot (FP) BA lasers without DBRs and with 200 µm stripe width and 4 mm cavity length provide Popt = 29 W (still increasing) at 30 A in continuous-wave mode at room temperature, in contrast to the maximum Popt = 24 W (limited by strong power saturation) of baseline ASLOC lasers. The reference ETAS FP lasers also deliver over 10% higher ηE at Popt = 24 W. On the other hand, in comparison to the wavelength-stabilized ASLOC DBR lasers, ETAS DBR lasers show a peak power increment from 14 W to 22 W, and an efficiency increment from 46% to 60% at Popt = 14 W. A narrow spectral width (< 1 nm at 95% power content) is maintained across a very wide operating range.

A variety of modern applications have been developed by leveraging the utilization of locations and items in spatial objects, such as searching points of interest, hot topics, or users' attitude in specified spatial regions. In many scenarios, the high and low-frequency items in a spatial region are worth noticing, considering they represent the majority's interest or eccentric users' opinion. However, existing works have yet to identify such items in an interactive manner, despite the significance of the endeavor in decision-making systems. This study recognizes a novel type of analytical query, called top/bottom-k fraction query, to discover such items in spatial databases. To achieve fast query response, we propose a multilayered data summary that is spread out across the main memory and external memory. A memory-based estimation method for top/bottom-k fraction queries is proposed.

The efficiency of the perovskite solar cells with carbon electrodes increased from 11.28% to 13.34%, and their stability obviously improved. The addition of PbCl2 had no effect on the morphology, crystal structure, and absorption property of the perovskite absorber layer. However, it affected the band energy level alignment of the solar cells and accelerated the electron extraction and transfer at the interface between the perovskite layer and the ETL, thus enhancing the overall photovoltaic performance.

So far, multiplicative and exponential offsets have been applied only to Boyar-Peralta type S-Box variants for optimizing the transformation matrix. In this brief, we apply the offset methods to another S-Box based on the redundant Galois field arithmetic and evaluate the performance by logic synthesis. Specifically, we design and evaluate two new types of S-Box hardware: one for encryption only (ENC) and the other for both encryption and decryption (ENC/DEC). The evaluation result confirms that the proposed ENC and ENC/DEC S-Boxes achieve a performance up to 8.7% and 28.8% higher, respectively, than the highest-performing conventional ones in terms of the area timing (AT) product.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2022.3185632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9804750","AES;S-Box;hardware;linear mapping optimization;ASIC","Encryption;Hardware;Hamming weight;Minimization;Delays;Standards;Sparse matrices","","3","","12","CCBYNCND","23 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study a superconducting transition edge sensor (TES) based on a stack of thin films is combined with a neutron absorbing layer of 10B4C to build a sensitive and robust neutron detector. The difference in lattice structure causes tensile strain in the thin, stacked, structure, which results in changes in the superconducting parameters. The strain was measured along with its effect on the superconducting transition and thereby the sensitivity of the detector. A decrease in Tc of a few percent and in the range of 0.3 to 2.2 K was found from two different samples with varying boron coverage for a calculated strain of < 0.07%. A change in sensitivity due to strain was found to be from −58 to −15%, depending on deposition coverage and the deposition process. Effects on the superconducting properties were found to be within a range that can be compensated by design and setup considerations and these are therefore not expected to pose problems for the future detectors build on this principle.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2022.3145322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9693182","Boron carbide;superconducting transition temperature;superconducting devices;tensile strain","Detectors;Neutrons;Temperature measurement;Strain;Superconducting epitaxial layers;Superconducting transition temperature;Superconducting thin films","","3","","13","CCBY","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem comes from the classical combinatorial problem in graph theory, i.e., the Vertex Cover Problem. A large number of results on algorithms for the MWCVC problem have been reported. In this paper, we proposed two heuristic algorithms, denoted as VCC and LCVCC, to find a connected vertex cover set in a general weighted graph. The time complexity of both two algorithms are less than  $O(n^{4})$ . We compare these two algorithms with two known heuristic algorithms GR and GD (proposed by Dagdeviren in 2021) on connected graphs, and draw a conclusion that both of VCC and LCVCC perform better than GR or GD.

It is possible to implement highly parallel data processing by using tightly coupled FPGAs. We previously proposed a lightweight, fully connected inter-FPGA network called OPTWEB for efficient collective communications. OPTWEB discards the traditional packet communication mechanism and introduces dedicated memory processing to minimize communication overhead. In this paper, we provide the design guidelines for a parallel data application on FPGAs connected by OPTWEB. We then present a generalized diameter-two hypercube network topology for connecting multiple FPGAs, which enables larger applications. In the guidelines, data to be exchanged should be directly processed by the dedicated memory on each FPGA, and parallelism should be implemented to match the collective communications provided by OPTWEB. We illustrate two case studies, one on parallel counting sort and the other on sharing averaged parameters, on eight custom Stratix10 MX2100 FPGA cards with 800 Gbps network bandwidth. The parallel counting sort operates up to 5.3 times faster than a comparable CPU cluster with the conventional InfiniBand network, and with sharing averaged parameters, up to 250 times faster operation is achieved.

In clinical practice the most common method of IH detection is the calculation of the mean value of intracranial pressure (ICP) and the therapeutic intervention is usually introduced when the mean exceeds a certain threshold. This threshold, however, is rather individual for each patient than universal for all. Impaired cerebrovascular reactivity and reduced intracranial compliance are associated with raised ICP. This work explores a new definition of life-threatening hypertension (LTH) which accounts for the state of cerebral compliance. In the proposed method, changes in compliance are analysed through identification of likely pathological and/or pathological shapes of ICP pulse waveforms using a neural network. In terms of predictive power for mortality in TBI, detection of both shape clasess of ICP pulse waveforms during raised ICP offers similar results to previously proposed LTH definition accounting for the state of cerebrovascular reactivity (77.8% vs 76.9% accuracy, respectively). On the other hand, the fully pathological shapes of ICP pulses are present during ICP rises almost only in recordings of patients who died: out of 216 analysed patients only 6% of surviving and as many as 42% of deceased patients developed this type of LTH event. The stricter definition of LTH events including only pathological shape of ICP pulses presents the highest accuracy among the analysed approaches for mortality prediction (87.9%). Clinical relevance—Reliable detection of potentially life-threatening episodes of ICP elevation offers the possibility of improving clinical management of TBI by identifying the patients at risk of unfavourable outcome.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871403","National Science Centre, Poland(grant numbers:UMO-2019/35/B/ST7/00500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871403","","Hypertension;Pathology;Shape;Biology;Recording;Brain injuries;Biological neural networks","Blood Pressure;Brain Injuries, Traumatic;Heart Rate;Humans;Intracranial Hypertension;Intracranial Pressure","3","","16","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This letter proposes a sparse design of a one-third-octave graphic equalizer, where the number of active bands is minimized using orthogonal matching pursuit and linear programming before the least-squares gain optimization. In addition, the bandwidths of the high-frequency band filters are gain dependent in order to optimize their shape relative to an analog prototype.

Body motion patterns are documented intermittently by clinical observations. Changing motion patterns in preterm infants are associated with maturation and clinical events such as late-onset sepsis and seizures. However, continuous motion monitoring in the NICU setting is not yet performed. Video-based motion monitoring is a promising method due to its non-contact nature and therefore unobtrusiveness. This study aims to determine the feasibility of simple video-based methods for infant body motion detection. We investigated and compared four methods to detect the motion in videos of infants, using two datasets acquired with different types of cameras. The thermal dataset contains 32 hours of annotated videos from 13 infants in open beds. The RGB dataset contains 9 hours of annotated videos from 5 infants in incubators. The compared methods include background substruction (BS), sparse optical flow (SOF), dense optical flow (DOF), and oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB). The detection performance and computation time were evaluated by the area under receiver operating curves (AUC) and run time. We conducted experiments to detect motion and gross motion respectively. In the thermal dataset, the best performance of both experiments is achieved by BS with mean (standard deviation) AUCs of 0.86 (0.03) and 0.93 (0.03). In the RGB dataset, SOF outperforms the other methods in both experiments with AUCs of 0.82 (0.10) and 0.91 (0.05).

A 126 kV single-break vacuum interrupter (VI) with 3/4 coil axial magnetic field (AMF) contacts is used in the VCB, which can interrupt short currents of 40 kA. The external insulation of the VI is provided by SF6 at 0.1 MPa. In order to match the 126 kV single-break VI and controlled switching device, a long-stroke electro-magnetic force actuator (EMFA) with 16 kN closing holding force and 3.5 m/s average opening speed is designed. Moreover, a position tracking controlled switching device based on closed-loop control using the technology of a fuzzy control algorithm and pulse width modulation is applied to the controlled switching device. This device is applied to control the coil current of EMFA and the electromagnetic force, so as to control the EMFA to follow the ideal position curve. The type tests of 126 kV VCB are all passed according to the IEC62271-100 and GB1984-2014, including dielectric tests, basic short-circuit tests, short-line fault tests, out-of-phase tests, etc. The strong capacitive current breaking capacity and mechanical strength of the VCB are proved by the capacitive current switching test of class C2, electrical endurance test of class E2 and mechanical endurance test of class M2. The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests are passed according to the IEC61000-4. The controlled switching test of capacitive current was successful according to IEC62271-302 and GB/T30846-2014, and the controlled switching accuracy is less than ± 0.5 ms.

Complex networks will significantly reduce the impact of images on classification recognition accuracy when rotation, translation, and scaling occur. Complex networks’ topological invariance has made it clear that using them to analyze image recognition will considerably increase image classification accuracy. However, most studies of complex networks for image classification have focused on individual networks, neglecting the combination of multiple networks. This paper proposes a new complex network classification method that combines complex networks and convolutional neural networks(CNN) to train classification using deep learning. We show that the method has high classification accuracy and distinct network features and compares well with a single complex network approach.

The gradient binary grating is used to improve the energy distribution of the inside area of the geometric shape. A phase hologram designed with the desired shape and hybrid gratings, is loaded on a phase-only spatial light modulation to achieve arbitrary geometric flattop shapes with high uniformity.

Such refactoring often involves updating not only the type of the element itself, but also the API of all type-dependent references in the code, thus it is tedious and time-consuming. Despite type changes being more frequent than renamings, just a few current IDE tools provide partially-automated support only for a small set of hard-coded types. Researchers have recently proposed a data-driven approach to inferring API rewrite rules for type change patterns in Java using code commits history. In this paper, we build upon these recent advances and introduce IntelliTC — a tool to perform Java type change refactoring. We implemented it as a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, a popular Java IDE developed by JetBrains. We present 3 different ways of providing support for such a refactoring from the standpoint of the user experience: Classic mode, Suggested Refactoring, and Inspection mode. To evaluate these modalities of using IntelliTC, we surveyed 22 experienced software developers. They positively rated the usefulness of the tool.The source code and distribution of the plugin are available on GitHub: https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/data-driven-type-migration.

Because neural networks can tolerate small errors, it is possible to reduce the calculation speed and power consumption at the expense of accuracy. In this study, we propose a method to reduce the power consumption of the circuit by lowering the operating voltage of the static random-access memory (SRAM) that is utilized to store the weights. In the proposed method, using two different operating voltages of SRAM, we used different bit error rates (BERs) for error-tolerant and non-error-tolerant.

The Fano resonator is realized with the use of an add-drop micro-disk resonator (MDR) and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The waveguides at the through and drop ports of the MDR connect to two spiral waveguide arms of the MZI directly. Two independent metallic micro-heaters are incorporated on top of the MDR and the lower arm of the MZI. Thanks to the resonant mode interference between the MDR and the MZI, the Fano resonance occurs. By thermal tuning the resonance coupling between the MDR and the MZI, the generated Fano resonance is fully tunable. In addition to the independent tunable slope rate (SR) and the resonance wavelength, the Fano resonance wavelength can shift while its line shape remains by simultaneously controlling the two micro-heaters. A chip is designed, fabricated and evaluated. The measurement results show that the static Fano resonance has a line shape with an extinction ratio (ER) of 17.1 dB and SR of −13.6 dB/nm. By simultaneously controlling the two micro-heaters, full reconfigurability of the Fano resonance is demonstrated. Thanks to its straightforward configuration, the proposed Fano resonator holds the key advantage in terms of ultra-compactness and fully reconfigurability, which offers a great potential for applications such as on-chip optical switching, modulation and microwave photonics applications.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3190030","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0201800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071042,62105028); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M690390); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826893","Fano resonance;micro-disk resonator;full reconfigurability","Optical waveguides;Optical resonators;Shape;Interference;Tuning;Optical device fabrication;Optical coupling","","3","","26","CCBY","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, drawbacks result from time-consuming cutting and stacking of the high number of just  $W =3$  cm wide sample strips of the standard Epstein tester (SET). Furthermore, the effects of cutting result in increased losses. Needs of annealing impede tests of modern materials with domain refinement that may lose its effectiveness. Results of numerical modeling indicated that both problems can be reduced by a strong enlargement of the strip width. Here, we report a novel giant Epstein tester (GET) with  $W =10$  cm, in combination with increased strip length  $L = 65$  cm. Sufficient averaging over test material is attained with two layers, i.e., from just eight strips. The magnetic field strength is determined by four large 3-D-printed tangential field coils, excluding impact from the four corners of frame. Time-averaged loss  $P$  is computed from instantaneous magnetization power values  $p$ , offering also maximum loss and orientation power. Results of GET were compared to data from single-sheet tester (SST) data, proving close similarities, without needs of annealing which is significant for laser scribed steel, as tested here. Results from SET prove to be higher. Analysis of power  $p$  indicates the impact of supplementary domains in the magnetization process of the scribed material. Compared to SST, the drawbacks of the GET are the need of eight sample strips, as well as lower absolute accuracy, due to higher inhomogeneity. On the other hand, advantages are the absence of a yoke system and simplicity of test apparatus.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2022.3158473","Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the Project “Energy Losses”(grant numbers:P31596); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9734011","Cutting effects;domain refinement;Epstein tester;magnetic loss;silicon iron","Strips;Steel;Magnetic domains;Loss measurement;Frequency measurement;Coils;Licenses","","3","","22","CCBY","14 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study investigates and quantifies the influence of stator winding faults on the motor DM impedance and mode transformation. First, the transmission line model of an induction motor is described based on the scattering (S) parameter measurements of each phase of the motor. It offers the flexibility to emulate different types of stator winding faults at specific locations and various severities, such that the impacts of the faults on the motor DM impedance can be easily estimated. Second, a test setup is proposed to quantify the CM-to-DM transformation due to the stator winding faults.

The results showed that, due to creating CS in the middle of the channel, the horizontal electric field was increased, thus more major carriers were depleted from the middle of the channel. With the analysis of the  $\text{I}_{\mathrm{ DS}} - \text{V}_{\mathrm{ GS}}$  diagrams at different temperatures, it was concluded that in the CS JL MOSFET, while the ON-state current is very close to compared that in the JL MOSFET (same structure without CS), the drain leakage current has decreased by around 103. Furthermore, the  $\text{I}_{\mathrm{ DS}} - \text{V}_{\mathrm{ DS}}$  diagram showed that the drain current in the CS JL MOSFET was much less affected by the drain voltage compared to that in the JL MOSFET. Also in AC analysis and at 1MHz frequency, by using CS the parasitic capacitances were reduced. Due to the improvement obtained in the presence of the charge sheet, the proposed structure was used in designing an inverter. The results showed that in the presence of the charge sheet, logical high input range, and logical low input range were increased, and also, noise margin low (NML) and noise margin high (NMH) were improved.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2022.3166708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9755940","Junctionless transistor;MOSFET;CMOS;inverter;charge sheet;DC analysis;AC analysis","Logic gates;Transistors;Voltage;Silicon compounds;Doping;Charge carrier processes;MOSFET","","3","","21","CCBY","12 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To answer this question we look at adaptation from the sustainability point of view. Sustainability denotes the capacity of a system to both endure and preserve its function over time. We propose an approach which uses decision maps to make sustainability-driven decisions for adaptation in a systematic way.

CVD is caused by atherosclerosis which is the accumulation of fatty deposits, often within the fine arteries of the heart or brain. These blockages reduce blood flow and lead to oxygen starvation (ischemia) which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. To treat blocked arteries an implantable device called a stent re-opens the artery to reinstate blood flow to the organ. The stent itself can become blocked over time by cell growth (intimal hyperplasia) which is characterised by excessive smooth muscle cell proliferation. Sensors based on electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) embedded in a stent could detect this re-blocking to allow for early intervention. Using platinum interdigitated electrodes on silicon sensor wafers we were able to co-culture different ratios of mouse smooth muscle cells and mouse endothelial cells on these sensors. This mimics the complex, multicellular environment which a stent is found in vivo when undergoing neo-intimal hyperplasia. Trends in the cell impedances were then characterised using the detection frequency and the gradient of change between populations over time which we termed 'Peak Cumulative Gradients (PCG). PCGs were calculated to successfully discriminate each cell type. This work moves towards a sensor that may help guide clinician's decision-making in a disease that is historically silent and difficult to detect. Clinical Relevance—This moves towards an early warning system for the detection of neo intimal hyperplasia ultimately leading to a reduction in stent complications.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871936","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; University of Glasgow(grant numbers:EP/S515401/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871936","","In vivo;Sociology;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Muscles;Market research;Mice;Impedance","Animals;Constriction, Pathologic;Coronary Restenosis;Electric Impedance;Endothelial Cells;Hyperplasia;Mice","2","","26","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The device has dc and bidirectional current measurement capability (derived from the magnetic flux density around a current trace) and is operated electrically isolated above the current trace. With permanent magnets as magnetic bias, the setup has a usable bidirectional current range of ±5 A. A phase detector IC measures the phase shift between the 296 MHz, 19 dBm input, and 35 dB attenuated output signal of the delay line sensor. The active sensor area has a distance of 2.5 mm from the current trace. In a 1.2 mT bias, the sensor is operated with a sensitivity of 18.28°/mT and bipolar current range of up to ±5 A. The sensor signal is enhanced by an analog filter to compensate the over 1 µs delay from the delay line and readout circuit.

A short lifetime is one of the main challenges for the fuel cell before large-scale commercial applications, and prognostic is an important method to improve the reliability of fuel cells. Different from the traditional prognostic approaches applied to single-stack fuel cell systems, the key problem in multi-stack prediction is how to solve the correlation of multi-stack degradation, which can directly affect the accuracy of prediction. In response to this difficulty, a standard Brownian motion is added to the traditional Wiener process to model the degradation of each stack, and then the probability density function of the remaining useful life (RUL) of each stack is calculated. Furthermore, a Copula function is adopted to reflect the dependence between life distributions, so as to obtain the remaining useful life for the whole multi-stack system.

Point-of-care testing (POC) would shorten the patients waiting time compared with laboratory molecular analysis. This work evaluates two types of gold nanomaterials, and two assay protocols, to develop a lateral flow (LF) system for Cystatin C (CysC) quantification. Of the protocols, the ‘delayed-release’ shows the alleviation of the hook effects with 1% BSA running buffer (RB), albeit at increased complexity with three steps of washing. The standard method with sample dilution (1: 150 sample dilution for GNPs, and 1:10 sample dilution for GNRs) can ensure the clinical range detection of CysC as 1 mg/L with partial LF assays. GNPs have stronger optical signal intensity compared with GNRs and developed full LF assays with GNPs require 1:1.5 sample dilution in recombinant Cys C detection. The ideal sample dilution ratio is different for partial and full LF assays. Clinical Relevance— This work is the basis of future work that will use LF devices for human serum/plasma monitoring to assess kidney function related to heart failure during medication. The specificity, sensitivity, and limit of detection will be validated via a clinical trial before potential clinical use.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871131","European Union; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871131","","Heart;Protocols;Sensitivity;Point of care;Optical sensors;Public healthcare;Monitoring","Biomarkers;Cardio-Renal Syndrome;Cystatin C;Heart Failure;Humans;Point-of-Care Systems","2","","24","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Measurements of electrical impedance can be a diagnostic tool to monitor implanted electrodes for changing conditions arising from glial scarring, encapsulation, and shorted or broken wires. Such measurements provide information about the electrical impedance between a single electrode and its electrical reference, but offer no insights into the overall network of impedances between electrodes. Other solutions generally rely on geometrical assumptions of the arrangement of the electrodes and may not generalize to other electrode networks. Here, we propose a linear algebra-based approach, Cross-Channel Impedance Measurement (CCIM), for measuring a network of impedances between electrodes which all share a common electrical reference. This is accomplished by measuring the voltage response from all electrodes to a known current applied between each electrode and the shared reference, and is agnostic to the number and arrangement of electrodes. The approach is validated using a simulated 8-electrode network, demonstrating direct impedance measurements between electrodes and the reference with 96.6% $\pm 0.2\%$ accuracy, and cross-channel impedance measurements with 93.3% $\pm 0.6\%$ accuracy in a typical system. Subsequent analyses on randomized systems demonstrate the sensitivity of the model to impedance range and measurement noise. Clinical Relevance- CCIM provides a system-agnostic diagnostic test for implanted electrode networks, which may aid in the longitudinal tracking of electrode performance and early identification of electronics failures.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871954","Promobilia Foundation; Swedish Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871954","","Electrodes;Impedance measurement;Voltage measurement;Sensitivity;Prosthetic limbs;Current measurement;Wires","Cochlear Implantation;Cochlear Implants;Electric Impedance;Electrodes, Implanted;Monitoring, Physiologic","2","","13","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, the RIS is a planar surface consisting of an array of passive reflecting elements, each of which can independently induce a controllable reflection coefficient on the incident signal. By installing an RIS on the facade of buildings, an additional virtual line of sight (LoS) link can be established between the base station (BS) and the user. By judiciously adjusting the phase shifts of the reflecting elements, the reflected signal can be constructively superimposed with the signal from the direct path to enhance the desired signal power or destructively mitigate unfavourable signals such as multi-user interference or signal leakage to eavesdroppers. The RIS is less expensive to deploy than conventional active transmitters since its reflecting elements only passively reflect the incoming signal without any signal processing operations and does not require costly and power-hungry radio frequency (RF) chains. Moreover, it is lightweight and has limited layer thickness, so it can be easily integrated into the environment. Despite the above-mentioned appealing advantages of RIS, it also brings some new signal processing challenges such as channel estimation, robust transmission design, angle/position estimation, distributed algorithm design, etc.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2022.100027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9946992","","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces;Wireless communication;6G mobile communication;Conferences;Special issues and sections;Signal processing;Electrical engineering","","2","","","","11 Nov 2022","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

The produced Raman pulses are then amplified in an RFA, and the pulse profiles can also be precisely maintained. However, it is further noticed that the detuning-induced defects can be amplified if they are with the pulse itself. All these observed phenomena should originate from the transient property of Raman gain, not involving any notable delaying or saturation effects that are typically seen with rare-earth-doped gain fibers. Our results demonstrate that, in the nanosecond scale, the Raman-converted pulse can well maintain its profile and shows strong resistance to detune between PRFs of the pump and Raman pulses. Benefiting from that, we can reasonably neglect the pump depletion effect due to walk-off effect typically seen in various short pulse regimes, which can largely simplify the design of nanosecond pulsed pumping Raman sources.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3195757","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61905146); Shenzhen Key Project for Technology Development(grant numbers:JSGG20190819175801678,JSGG20191129105838333); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9847232","Fiber lasers;laser amplifiers;stimulated Raman scattering","Optical fiber amplifiers;Stimulated emission;Pump lasers;Optical resonators;Optical pumping;Erbium-doped fiber lasers;Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","","2","","32","CCBY","2 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, our algorithm adapts image processing to quantize the input speech feature maps in arbitrary bits. Experiments show that in the 10-keyword KWS task, our 3-bit representation only brings a 0.45% average accuracy drop compared to the full-precision log-Mel spectrograms while others drop over 3%. In the 2 keywords task, our 3-bit representation produces no significant differences, while 1-bit quantization only leads to an average of 1.7% accuracy drop and is even capable of handling similar keywords and imbalanced data distribution. The result proves our method, to the best of our knowledge, is the first practical method that supports as low as 1-bit quantization for single-channel speech features in small-footprint KWS.

N2DB avoids complex data synchronization and logging overhead in the two-layer storage design of disk-oriented databases and in-memory databases. Garbage Collection (GC) is critical in such an NVM-based database because memory leaks on NVM are durable. Moreover, data recovery is equally essential to guarantee atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability properties.

In this experiment, the four beams were compressed using two grating compressors to simulate the situation in ultra-intense and ultra-short laser CBC systems. To achieve real-time measurement of the phase error between the four beams, we introduced a continuous reference laser and the phases of beams 2, 3, and 4 were locked to beam 1.A combined efficiency of 57% was achieved. Although the coherent combining efficiency is not very high, the possibility of a four-beam CBC based on the CPA scheme was confirmed, especially with different grating compressors which can reduce the limitation of gratings in single beam petawatt lasers. Finally, the remaining difficulties in the implementation of CBC of four beams and the methods to improve its efficiency were analyzed.

Research has been conducted on the joint torque individuals can produce, a quantity that indicates the ability of the person to carry out such repetitive movements. Most of the studies surround gait analysis, rehabilitation, the assessment of athletic performance, and robotics. The aim of this study is to develop a model that estimates the maximum shoulder and elbow joint torque an individual can produce based on anthropometrics and demographics without taking a manual measurement with a force gauge (dynamometer). Nineteen subjects took part in the study which recorded maximum shoulder and elbow joint torques using a dynamometer. Sex, age, body composition parameters, and anthropometric data were recorded, and relevant parameters which significantly contributed to joint torque were identified using regression techniques. Of the parameters measured, body mass index and upper forearm volume predominantly contribute to maximum torque for shoulder and elbow joints; coefficient of determination values were between 0.6 and 0.7 for the independent variables and were significant for maximum shoulder joint torque (P<0.001) and maximum elbow joint torque (P<0.005) models. Two expressions illustrated the impact of the relevant independent variables on maximum shoulder joint torque and maximum elbow joint torque, using multiple linear regression. Coefficient of determination values for the models were between 0.6 and 0.7. The models developed enable joint torque estimation for individuals using measurements that are quick and easy to acquire, without the use of a dynamometer. This information is useful for those employing joint torque data in biomechanics in the areas of health, rehabilitation, ergonomics, occupational safety, and robotics.

Myocardial infarction (MI) represents a third of all IHD cases, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used to assess its damage to myocardial viability. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is the current gold standard, but the use of gadolinium-based agents limits the clinical applicability in some patients. Spin-lock (SL) dispersion has recently been proposed as a promising non-contrast biomarker for the assessment of MI. However, at 3T, the required range of SL preparations acquired at different amplitudes suffers from specific absorption rate (SAR) limitations and off-resonance artifacts. Relaxation Along a Fictitious Field (RAFF) is an alternative to SL preparations with lower SAR requirements, while still sampling relaxation in the rotating frame. In this study, a single breath-hold simultaneous $T_{RAFF2}$ and $T_{2}$ mapping sequence is proposed for SL dispersion mapping at 3T. Excellent reproducibility (coefficient of variations lower than 10%) was achieved in phantom experiments, indicating good intrascan repeatability. The average myocardial $T_{RAFF2}, T_{2}$, and SL dispersion obtained with the proposed sequence $(68.0\pm 10.7$ ms, $44.0\pm 4.0$ ms, and $0.4\pm 0.2 \times 10^{-4} s^{2}$, respectively) were comparable to the reference methods $(62.7\pm 11.7$ ms, $41.2\pm 2.4$ ms, and $0.3\pm 0.2\mathrm{x} 10^{-4}s^{2}$, respectively). High visual map quality, free of $B_{0}$ and $B_{1}^{+}$ related artifacts, for $T_{2}, T_{RAFF2}$, and SL dispersion maps were obtained in phantoms and in vivo, suggesting promise in clinical use at 3T. Clinical relevance — and imaging promises non-contrast assessment of scar and focal fibrosis in a single breath-hold using approximate spin-lock dispersion mapping.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871465","","Visualization;Pathology;In vivo;Sensitivity;Magnetic resonance imaging;Phantoms;Myocardium","Contrast Media;Gadolinium;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Myocardial Infarction;Myocardial Ischemia;Myocardium;Reproducibility of Results","2","","13","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The peak value of drain current and collected charge in MOSFET reach the maximum value at 200 K, while the SET fall time decreases monotonously as temperature decrease from 300 K to 77 K at four LET values. The extracted analysis found that the enhancement of bipolar amplification effect is the main reason for the increase of collected charge and broader pulse width at high temperatures.

Dependence of the magnetic flux density and induced electric fields in the human model were obtained by using the impedance method. Results were compared with the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines. Regarding the occupational exposure, safe distances of 120 and 100 cm are derived from the ICNIRP reference level (RL) and basic restriction (BR), respectively. At the distance of 100 cm, the exposure level does not exceed the ICNIRP BR, and although the exposure level exceeds the RL, continued exposure is allowed.

In this coding method, one base is represented by two bits, and four types of bases are associated with two-bit binary numbers. A three-layer perceptron is used as a neural network, and backpropagation is used as a learning rule. The accuracy for the two-bit coding is slightly higher than those for the other coding methods, and it can be decided that the two-bit coding is the best coding method mainly because of its advantage, namely, the amount of information required to indicate the nucleic acid sequences is relatively small.

However, oscillations from unfeasible setpoints and control instabilities both occur at weak grids and near the fundamental frequency. This letter presents an exploratory study to map the conditions where both phenomena occur, using sensitivity studies comprising multiple setpoints and control parameter tunings.

But an understanding of causality is difficult to learn for a machine. For humans however, realising causal relations is often not a difficult process, as we can refer to experience or scientific knowledge. Here we propose the use of structural causal models, represented through direct acyclic graphs, to design, determine, and communicate causal relations hidden beyond the statistical models of an AI. The idea is to make human insight in causal relations explicit and use this knowledge during AI system development. In a joint-industry project we discovered that structural causal models can serve as living boundary objects that facilitate coordination of domain experts, data scientists, systems engineers, and AI experts in AI system development.","","978-1-4503-9275-4","10.1145/3522664.3528615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796403","artificial intelligence;causal reasoning;machine learning;requirement engineering;safety","Adaptation models;Machine learning;Data models;Stakeholders;Plastics;Artificial intelligence;Software engineering","","2","","10","CCBY","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance of the FHSs has a great impact on the performance of FH-CDMA systems. The optimality achieving exactly the Peng-Fan bounds is an important performance measure. However, optimal sets of FHSs do not always exist for all lengths and alphabet sizes. Thus, it is meaningful to seek and design more near-optimal FHS sets whose parameters are near to achieving the Peng-Fan bounds. Let  $q$  be a power of a prime. In this paper, we present some classes of near-optimal sets of FHSs, whose parameters are  $\left({\frac {3(q+1)}{2},\frac {2(q-1)}{3},3;q}\right)$  with  $q\equiv 1 \pmod {12}$ ,  $\left({\frac {q+1}{k},{k(q-1)},2;q}\right)$  with even  $\frac {q+1}{k}$ ,  $\left({2(q^{2}+1),\frac {q^{2}-1}{2},2(q+1);q}\right)$  with  $q \equiv 3 \pmod {4}$ ,  $(19,18,4;7)$ ,  $(7,9,3;4)$  and  $(91,45,7;16)$  respectively.

As for the endurance cycling with the triangular waveforms, the frequencies are ranged from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The results indicate that a shorter rising time (Tr)/falling time (Tf) results in a completely different endurance characteristic, and a longer Twidth leads to an earlier breakdown. Furthermore, the higher frequency of the triangular waveform results in a larger remnant polarization (2Pr) after endurance cycling. Overall, the endurance is highly dependent on the pulsing schemes, suggesting that a standardized methodology for the endurance evaluation is necessary for fair benchmarks and qualification of the ferroelectric-based technologies.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2022.3141756","“Center for the Semiconductor Technology Research” from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 110-2634-F-009-027,MOST 110-2622-8-009-018-SB); Young Scholar Fellowship Program(grant numbers:MOST 110-2636-E-009-023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9677029","Ferroelectrics;endurance","Switches;Capacitors;Reliability;Silicon;Hafnium oxide;Frequency measurement;Electron traps","","2","","24","CCBY","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although our focus is on smart TVs produced by a single company, the proposed approach can readily be applied to any consumer electronics with a screen-based user interface. This is mainly due to the fact that we present a non-intrusive and completely black-box approach that operates by interpreting the images of user interfaces to interact with the system. More specifically, given a test suite, which is known to work on an older version of the system, and a new version of the system, to which the test cases should be adapted, the proposed approach automatically discovers the user interface models of both the older and the new version of the system by systematically crawling the respective user interfaces; figures out the path traversed by a test case in the model discovered from the old system; dynamically (i.e., in a feedback-driven manner) determines the most “semantically” similar path in the model discovered from the new system; and finally executes the path on the new system. The rationale behind using a modelbased approach is to minimize the guesswork (thus, to improve both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the test adaptation) in the presence of significant changes in the user interfaces, such as the ones affecting the order of the screens/interactions.","","978-1-4503-9286-0","10.1145/3524481.3527237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796444","Test adaptation;model-based testing;smart TV testing;consumer electronics testing","Adaptation models;Home appliances;Automation;Smart TV;Europe;Companies;User interfaces","","2","","2","CCBY","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electro-optic modulation (EOM) is one of the main comb-generating methods with the advantageous features of adjustable repetition frequency, high optical signal-to-noise ratio, and intrinsic coherence of the comb teeth. However, the spectral range of the EO-comb is limited by the modulation depth. In this paper, a two-stage nonlinear system is built to broaden a 12.5 GHz EO-comb, namely the fiber-based stage and the on-chip stage. In the fiber-based stage, the pulse width of the comb is compressed to 52 fs from ∼3 ps, meanwhile, the peak power is amplified to 2053 W and the comb spectrum is moderately broadened. In the on-chip stage, the comb is further broadened by an integrated Si3N4 waveguide spanning from 1200 nm up to 2000 nm. It is worth mentioning that the characteristic absorption lines of water vapor can also be observed in the broadened spectrum. These results indicate that the built system may have great application prospects in the field of parallel gas detection.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3203858","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB2205804); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62075240); Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2020JJ2036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9883015","Optical frequency comb;integrated silicon nitride waveguide;electro-optical modulation;gas detection","Optical waveguides;Optical fiber dispersion;Optical pulses;Silicon;Optical fiber amplifiers;Nonlinear optics;System-on-chip","","2","","39","CCBY","9 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The coil turns and the remanence of magnets are adjusted by keeping the magnetic and electrical loading on the motor constant. The distance between the centers of two adjacent stator slots varies due to the introduction of fault-tolerant teeth. According to the variable separation method, the general solution expression of each region can be determined by solving the partial differential systems of equations. The magnetic field distributions of subdomains are obtained by applying the continuity conditions between adjacent regions. Some analytical field expressions are represented as new forms under armature reaction field condition compared to those under no-load condition.

Both approaches attempt to approximate the current sheet of Wheeler. Using spectral Green’s function, the array active impedance is calculated. The impedance mismatch of a connected/capacitively coupled dipole array is less than that of an array of unconnected dipoles of the same size. Both direct and capacitive connections can be used to design a wideband array antenna with a ground plane, although capacitive coupling performs better than a direct connection. This fact resulted from numerous analytical studies using infinite dipole array scan (active) impedance endorsed by full-wave simulations using CST MWS. The maximum mismatch losses over the frequency band for different source (reference) impedances are used to find the best solution at the broadside.

As synchronous machines, HTSGs have rapid rise of field currents during a sudden short circuit fault which cause AC losses in the HTS tapes. This paper applies H-A formulation of Maxwell equations for finite element simulation of electromagnetic behavior of a 10 MW, 9.6 rpm HTSGs. The model is integrated to a short circuit model to calculate the characteristics of the HTS field winding, such as field currents and AC losses during a three-phase no-load short circuit fault at the armature winding terminal. Two HTSG designs are compared. The $n$ value characterizing the sharpness of the superconducting-resistive state transition of the HTS tape and the number of armature winding segments are analyzed as key variables. The result indicates high AC losses are produced but more armature winding segments can effectively reduce the AC loss and the field current. A lower $n$ value can also lower the AC loss level but only for the non-magnetic rotor design.

Owing to the low-power consumption, Si fabrication compatibility and fast switching speed, the HfZrOx (HZO)-based ferroelectric devices attract attention as artificial synapses. By using crossbar architectures, artificial synapse array can greatly speed up the efficiency for neuromorphic applications. However, interconnect resistance effect will cause a serious decrease in calculation accuracy. This paper proposes a crossbar array architecture with the HZO-based ferroelectric synapses, which can restore the current distortion caused by the interconnect resistance. At the device level, the synaptic potentiation and depression behaviors are achieved by adjusting the pulse duration. For the circuit level, the interconnect resistance can be significantly compensated. In neuromorphic computing, a high accuracy rate of 96% is realized, which can be further improved with the expansion of the array size. Our results provide a step towards the development of large-scale ferroelectric HZO-based neuromorphic devices.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2022.3150922","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91964105,62104134,62034006); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFA0201802); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2020JQ28,ZR2020KF016,ZR2019LZH009); Young Scholars Program of Shandong University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9711573","Ferroelectric synapse;residual polarization;interconnect resistance;neurological system","Resistance;Integrated circuit interconnections;Mathematical models;Synapses;Immune system;Switches;Computer architecture","","2","","31","CCBY","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important issue for cryptographic algorithm designers in ensuring sufficient security from linear cryptanalysis, one of the most powerful attacks, is finding an S-box with a sufficiently low linear spectrum. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the published S-box analysis tools cannot generate linear approximation tables for large S-boxes, such as 16-bit S-boxes. Even tools that support the generation of 16-bit linear approximation tables using parallel processing, such as Eval16BitSbox, require a long time. We used bitslice, which can efficiently process bitwise operations in parallel by taking advantage of independent operations, for generating a linear approximation table. In this study, the linear approximation table generation method implemented using the element unit operation of the existing S-box was upgraded to a  $vector$  unit operation in a bitslice manner. This improved method enabled the immediate creation of tables, even for 16-bit S-boxes. This approach allows cryptographic algorithm designers to consider a wider variety of S-boxes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3140242","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2017-0-00520); Development of SCR-Friendly Symmetric Key Cryptosystem and Its Application Modes; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668952","Large size S-box;bitsliced implementation;linear approximation table","Cryptography;Security;Linear approximation;Approximation algorithms;Linearity;Parallel processing","","2","","25","CCBY","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Images of fingertips under dry, wet, and oily surface conditions were obtained in the presence and absence of the reference lines. The results showed that the fingerprints were significantly distorted in anomalous surface environments when the reference lines were not used. However, when the reference lines were used, the sensitivity improved irrespective of the environmental conditions. With the edge-detection processing, the proposed FPS exhibited 9.25 %, 61.49 %, and 8.60 % increase in the ridge sensing improvement (RSI) of dry, oil, and wet condition, respectively, thus significantly enhancing the sensing capability.

To facilitate efficient modeling, this paper proposes a Global Mapping Model Fusion (GMMF) technique. The key idea of GMMF is to reuse the schematic-level model trained by the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, and combine it with few mapping coefficients to build the post-simulation model. Furthermore, as an efficient global optimization algorithm, differential evolution is applied to determine the optimal mapping coefficients with few samples. In GMMF, only a small number of mapping coefficients are unknown, so the number of post-layout samples needed is significantly reduced. To enhance practical utility of the proposed GMMF technique, two specific mapping relations, i.e., linear or weakly no-linear and nonlinear, are carefully considered in this paper. We conduct experiments on two topologies of two-stage operational amplifier and comparator in different commercial processes. All the simulation data for modeling are obtained from a parametric design framework. A more than 5× runtime speedup is achieved over ANN without surrendering any accuracy.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9614071","post-layout simulation performance model;Global Mapping Model Fusion (GMMF);Artificial Neural Network (ANN);few mapping coefficients;differential evolution","Computational modeling;Mathematical models;Integrated circuit modeling;Layout;Data models;Optimization;Predictive models","","2","","","","12 Nov 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, in previous research studies, ultra-high extinction ratio on-chip MZIs have only been achieved by using a multi-stage MZI approach. In this paper, we investigate a high extinction ratio single-stage MZI based on two cascaded multimode interferometers (MMI). We determine that TM noise is an important factor that can prevent us from achieving high extinction ratio MZI. By introducing a bend-based TM filter without additional loss, we experimentally demonstrate that such a TM filter can improve the maximum extinction ratio of the MMI-MZI by more than 10 dB. With the TM filter, we report a record high 61.2 dB extinction ratio on a single stage, thermally tunable MMI-MZI with only 1.5 dB insertion loss and more than 60 nm bandwidth.

Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method in this paper transforms the solution process of the lasing model with multiple unknown parameters into that with only the side mode spacing and coupling coefficient, which significantly reduces the computational workload. Furthermore, the bias current of the measured spectrum can be much higher than the threshold current, which makes the method less affected by noise. This paper theoretically analyzes the changing relationship between multiple parameters by calculating the lasing mode distribution, and the results show that the side mode spacing is only sensitive to the coupling coefficient. In addition, the grating coupling coefficients (57–61 cm−1) of the fabricated DFB laser diodes are experimentally extracted at 40-80 mA currents. The variation of the coupling coefficient with current is less than 2‰/mA, and the method exhibits pretty good stability.

High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) and optical marker motion capture were recorded concurrently from the lower arms of 8 subjects performing a series of wrist and hand movements activating DoFs individually, sequentially, and simultaneously. The root mean square (RMS) feature extracted from the EMG signal and kinematics obtained from motion capture were used to train regression and classification models to predict the kinematics of wrist movements and opening and closing of the hand, respectively. Results showed successful predictions of kinematics when training with the complete training set (r2 = 0.78 for wrist regression and recall = 0.85 for hand closing/opening classification). In further analysis, the training set was substantially reduced by removing the simultaneous movements. This led to a statistically significant, but relatively small reduction of the effectiveness of the wrist controller (r2 = 0.70, p<0.05), without changes for the hand controller (closing recall = 0.83). Reducing the training time and complexity needed to control a prosthesis with simultaneous wrist control as well as detection of intention to close the hand can lead to improved uptake of upper limb prosthetics.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871346","","Wrist;Training;Proportional control;Optical recording;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Motion capture","Biomechanical Phenomena;Hand;Humans;Upper Extremity;Wrist;Wrist Joint","2","","19","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, CCTO layers of different thicknesses were deposited on the spacer surface using magnetron sputtering technology. Then, insulating properties of these sputtered spacers under alternating current, direct current, and polarity reversal (PR) voltages and with the existence of metal particles were researched by experiment and simulation methods. Results show that the short-term (30 and 60 min) sputtering treatments have no obvious effect on improving the insulating properties. The 90 min-sputtered spacer can synthetically upgrade the surface electric field distribution as well as flashover voltages under different testing conditions.

Firstly, a three-dimensional model of the maglev train is established. Then, based on the space harmonic method and the equivalent circuit of the levitation and guidance circuits, the formulas of rolling, pitching and yawing stiffness are presented. Finally, by comparing with the three-dimensional finite element simulation results, the key translational displacements in the rotational motion which has a great impact on the stiffness are obtained.

The MZI setup is very sensitive to external perturbations and mechanical stresses, which can manifest in the output along with the response to hotspots. The disturbance the setup is subject to, varies with the sample being tested and the environment it is being tested in. For example, the sample length and configuration, in addition to the routing of the optical fibre can determine the extent of the stresses on the optical fibre.

Finally, the superiority of the algorithm is verified in simulation and experiments.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2022.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10016243","Active power control;constant power generation (CPG);fast-tracking;photovoltaic system;power oscillations","Photovoltaic systems;Radiation effects;Simulation;Power quality;Process control;Power electronics;Steady-state","","2","","18","","12 Jan 2023","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

The antenna element consists of a main radiator, two baluns, and a reflector. Two methods are used to enhance bandwidth and improve the port-to-port isolation. Firstly, by integrating the parasitic elements to traditional dipoles, new resonant modes are introduced to realize broadband, which can be controlled flexibly. Subsequently, part of the parasitic elements is removed to form asymmetric dipoles. Due to the asymmetry construction of the design, the polarization isolation of the antenna achieves more than 30 dB in the whole working band with stable radiation patterns. In addition, the specially designed parasitic elements achieve enhanced bandwidth without increasing the size of the radiator. The Simulation and measurement results show that the antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 32.7% (690-960 MHz). Moreover, a stable half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of 68°±5° and a high gain of 8.5±0.3 dBi is achieved.

We mainly focused on the angular distributions of backscattered electrons, the ratio of backscattered electron number to incident electron number (RBI), and the distribution of the distance between backscattered electrons and incident electrons (DBI). We studied how these characteristics were affected by the BSB-CMOS surface structure and incident electron energy. Firstly, RBI and the mean DBI vary with the incident electron energy, the surface material type, and passivation layer thickness. Meanwhile, a lower RBI may reduce device noise originating from backscattered electrons (NBE) due to the smaller number of backscattered electrons. Besides, the lower mean DBI may enhance the device resolution, because the backscattered electron beam is more concentrated. The distribution of backscattered azimuths (${\it \Phi}_{\rm B}$) and the backscattered angle (θB) follow uniform distribution and cosine angular distribution respectively, which are difficult to change. Finally, devices with the lowest RBI and a low mean value of DBI were achieved when the BSB-CMOS surface was modified with 60 nm Al2O3 and the incident electrons were at 4 keV, which might improve the NBE and resolution of the EBCMOS.

Traditionally, two different approaches have been used: analytical methods, which take into account most physical impairments that are accurate but complex, and high margin formulas, which require much less computational resources at the cost of high margins. With the recent progress of machine learning (ML) together with software defined networking (SDN), ML has been considered as another option that could be both accurate and that does not consume as many resources as analytical methods. SDN architectures are difficult to scale because they are usually centralized; this is even worse with QoT predictors using ML. In this paper, a solution to this issue is presented using a cloud-native architecture, and its scalability is evaluated using three different ML QoT predictors and experimentally validated in a real wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) over spatial-division multiplexing (SDM) testbed.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.449009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721710","","Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Scalability;Cloud computing;Topology;Telemetry;Optical fiber networks","","2","","","","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because the interstitial fluid is rich in biomarkers, microneedle-based biosensors have the potential to be used in a wide range of diagnostic applications. To act as an electrochemical sensor, the tip or the body of the MN must be functionalized, while the substrate areas are generally passivated to block any unwanted background interference that may occur outside of the skin. This work presents four different passivation techniques, based on the application of SiO2, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), an adhesive film, and varnish to the substrate areas. Optical, SEM and electrochemical measurements were performed to quantitatively assess the performance of each film. The data shows that whilst manual application of varnish provided the highest level of electrical isolation, the spin-coating of a $5\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ thick layer of PMMA is likely to provide the best combination of performance and manufacturability.

The existing popular super-resolution methods usually impose the optical flow between neighboring frames for temporal alignment. However, estimation of accurate optical flow is hard and expends greater computation. To address this problem, we propose a novel grouped spatio-temporal alignment network (GSTAN) that effectively incorporates spatio-temporal information in a hierarchical way. The input sequence is divided into several groups corresponding to different frame rates. These groups provide complementary information, which is helpful to restore missing textures for the reference frame. Specifically, each group employs deformable 3D convolution to incorporate spatio-temporal information, which avoids artifacts from explicit motion estimation. In addition, a Gated-Dconv information filter is proposed to control information flow to focus on the fine details. Finally, these groups provide complementary information, which is integrated with the inter-group fusion module. Extensive experiments have demonstrated our method achieves state-of-the-art SR performance on several benchmark datasets.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3210874","Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Science and Technology Department; Guangdong Key Laboratory of Advanced IntelliSense Technology(grant numbers:2019B121203006); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD20190929172704911); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905902","Video super-resolution;spatio-temporal alignment;inter-group fusion","Convolution;Information filters;Logic gates;Superresolution;Optical flow;Three-dimensional displays;Image restoration","","1","","27","CCBY","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With these significant enhancements enabled by 5G, it is already possible to envision the needs towards 6G. Providing ""connectivity from the sky"" is one innovative trend for upcoming 6G communication systems. Satellites, high and low altitude platforms (HAP and LAP), drones, aircrafts, and airships are being considered as candidates for deploying wireless communications complementing terrestrial communications. Combining these network elements, Aerial Access Networks (AANs) have attracted significant attention from both academia and industry, and are recognized as a candidate solution for 6G communications. AANs are heterogeneous networks that are engineered to utilize satellites, HAPs, and LAPs to build network access platforms. Unlike terrestrial wireless networks, AANs are characterized by dynamic, thus frequently changed, network topologies and more vulnerable communication connections. However, AANs are not intended to replace the existing technologies, but instead to work with them in a complementary and integrated fashion. Therefore, AANs are accompanied with the demand for seamless integration of heterogeneous networks, such that the network Quality-of-Service (QoS) can be improved. Therefore, it is essential to develop new communications, signal processing, and optimization approaches to accommodate diverse services and applications with different QoS requirements in various scenarios.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2022.100008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9775740","","Signal processing;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Special issues and sections;Conferences;Computer science;6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication","","1","","","","16 May 2022","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

However, in practical application, the computational cost and model complexity have become the biggest obstacles of the traditional MC based on DL. To solve this problem, we propose complementary folding algorithm (CFA). This is an algorithm based on classical modulation classification (CMC), which folds and splices the features of the input neural network (NN), so that these features have both large-scale and small-scale dual branch receptive fields. The research results prove that under the same network structure and data quantity, both the correctness rate and the convergence speed of CFA are significantly improved in the communication experiment based on underwater visible light communication (UVLC). It is also worth mentioning that because of the particularity and complexity of the channel, UVLC system can be divided into different regions. In any region, CFA performs better than CMC, so we can prove that this algorithm also has excellent robustness.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3197148","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61925104,62031011); Major Key Project of PCL(grant numbers:PCL2021A14); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852305","Classical modulation classification (CMC);complementary folding algorithm (CFA);neural network (NN);Underwater visible light communication (UVLC)","Modulation;Artificial neural networks;Constellation diagram;Complexity theory;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Information science","","1","","14","CCBY","8 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To optimize the area, coupled inductors in the VCO are used. By employing a switched capacitor (SC) feedback network in the baseband (BB) amplifier, a proper input matching and flexible common-mode (CM) bias is achieved.

An elliptic filter composed of four LC resonators is used to demonstrate the proposed technique. Three experimental prototypes with different component values were fabricated for comparisons. Very good agreements between measured responses and designed responses can be observed. The measured parasitic resonances are higher than the third harmonic frequency.

This rapid hopping is too fast to be noticeable by human vision, which senses only the time-averaged color, as the human vision’s critical fusion threshold and critical color fusion threshold both lie under 100 Hz. That is, color shift keying exploits the human vision’s temporal irresolution of instantaneous fluctuations across chromaticities. Left unexploited, up to now, is the intensity-fluctuation tolerance of the human vision, that humans do not perceive small intensity fluctuations of $\pm 4\%$. This newly proposed constellation-design scheme can raise by $49 \%$ the designed color-shift-keying constellation’s $d_{\min }^\circ$ (i.e. the maximally achievable “minimum distance” $d_{\min }$). Moreover, this enhanced $d_{\min }^\circ$ can be approximated as a simple mathematical expression in terms of the design parameters to serve as a rule-of-thumb to enhance color-shift-keying systems.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3180843","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9790055","Colorimetry;intensity modulation;light emitting diode;optical communication;visible light communication","Color;Symbols;Light emitting diodes;Physiology;Licenses;Fluctuations;Wireless communication","","1","","24","CCBY","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An increase in values for the SDNN, RMSSD and pNN50 was found in the 20 minutes preceding the communicative intervention, when caregiving activities were performed, and was followed by an immediate decrease at the start of the intervention. Features' variability during the intervention appeared to be smaller than in the pre-communicative intervention, indicating improved autonomic regulation.

However, there are some problems in the transformation matrix designed, such as unstable beam gain and high sidelobe. Hence, we propose an optimization method by adjusting array element spacing and random number in frequency offset to get the optimum beam gain. Therefore, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to find the optimal solution. The beam gain comparison before and after the optimization is obtained by simulation, and the results show that the optimized array after beamspace preprocessing has more stable beam gain, lower sidelobe, and higher resolution in parameter estimation.

Our study indicates that, in addition to raising the orthorhombic phase and reducing the grain size of the ferroelectric, using high-k spacers can serve as another way to enhance the scalability of FeFETs because it improves both the mean memory window (MW) and the worst-case MW. More importantly, these improvements increase with the down-scaling of gate length. In addition, we have investigated the impact of high-k spacers on the critical electric field across interfacial layer ( $\text{E}_{\mathrm{ IL}}$ ) for the reliability of FeFET NVMs. Our study suggests that, for scaled FeFETs with high-k spacers, the highest  $\text{E}_{\mathrm{ IL}}$  during write operation is no longer located near the S/D edge but at the mid channel. Using high-k spacers can reduce the mid-channel  $\text{E}_{\mathrm{ IL}}$ , and the reduction increases with decreasing gate length due to the increasing impact of high-k spacers.

In this paper, we propose a system that can superimpose shapes, which are reconstructed from an endoscope image, onto the field of view. The feature of the proposed system is that it reconstructs 3D shapes from the images captured by the endoscope and superimposes them onto the real views. As a result, the superimposed view allows the doctor to keep operating the endoscope while observing the patient's internal body with additional information. The proposed system is composed of the reconstruction module and the display module. The reconstruction module is for acquiring 3D shapes based on an active stereo method. In particular, we propose a novel projection pattern that can reconstruct wide areas of the endoscopic view. The display module shows the 3D shape obtained by the reconstructed module, superimposing on the field of view.

While imaging, care must be taken to minimize the imaging artifacts related to the polarization differences between the sample and the reference signals. Current OCT systems adopt complicated mechanisms, such as the use of multiple detectors, polarization-maintaining fibers, polarization controllers to achieve polarization artifacts free sample images. Often the polarization controllers need readjustment which is not suitable for clinical settings. In this work, we demonstrate a simple approach that can minimize the polarization-related artifacts in the OCT systems. Polarization artifact-free images are acquired using two orthogonally polarized reference signals where the orthogonal polarization is achieved using a Faraday mirror. In the current approach, only a single detector is required which makes the current approach compatible with swept-source or camera-based OCT systems. Furthermore, no polarization controllers are used in the system which increases the system stability while minimizing the artifacts related to the sample birefringence, polarization change due to the sample scattering, and polarization change due to the optical fiber movements present in the system.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3148721","Max-Planck-Gesellschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9705150","Optical coherence tomography;biomedical optical imaging;polarization artifacts;birefringence","Mirrors;Imaging;Optical imaging;Gold;Optical polarization;Optical reflection;Nails","","1","","32","CCBY","4 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to small-scale (floss) refactoring, many refactoring efforts are much larger, requiring entire teams and months of effort, and the role of tools in these efforts is not as well studied. This short paper introduces an industry survey that we conducted. Results from 107 developers demonstrate that projects commonly go through multiple large-scale refactorings, each of which requires considerable effort. While there is often a desire to refactor, other business concerns such as developing new features often take higher priority. Our study finds that developers use several categories of tools to support large-scale refactoring and rely more heavily on general-purpose tools like IDEs than on tools designed specifically to support refactoring. Tool support varies across the different activities (spanning communication, reasoning, and technical activities), with some particularly challenging activities seeing little use of tools in practice. Our study demonstrates a clear need for better large-scale refactoring tools.","","978-1-6654-9590-5","10.1145/3510457.3513074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793940","refactoring;refactoring tools;software automation;software evolution","Industries;Software;Cognition;Software engineering;Business","","1","","6","CCBY","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the proposed method, a monitoring company encrypts sensitive information using a secret key for usage history information, which is combined with general information, and digitally signs it using a private key to register it in a block. A trust group can view and access the information at the time of inquiry by verifying the digital signature with the public key of the monitoring company and then can decrypt the sensitive information using the private key.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.21411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10246906","Theme/background/signal music;monitoring;blockchain;encryption/decryption;music usage history","Music;Companies;Non-repudiation;Multiple signal classification;Blockchains;History;Cryptography","","1","","16","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

We propose an alternative representation of the infant's head shape created from 3D photogrammetric surface scans as 2D distance maps. Those 2D distance maps rely on ray casting to extract distances from a center point to the head surface, arranging them into a 2D image grid. We use the distance map for an original convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classification approach, which is evaluated on a publicly available synthetic dataset for benchmarking and also tested on clinical data. Qualitative differences of different head shapes can be ob-served in the distance maps. The CNN-based classifier achieves accuracies of 100 % on the publicly available synthetic dataset and 98.86 % on the clinical test set.

The forecasts generated by the CNN and the GloSEA5 precipitation forecasts are both compared directly against a benchmark rainfall dataset for each of the regions. Following this, the CNN models are combined with the GloSEA5 forecasts to generate a new ensemble for each region which is then compared with the benchmark rainfall. The results show that the trained CNNs produce errors similar to the GloSEA5 model with RMSEs of 63 mm (single frame), 44 mm (slow fusion), and 37 mm (early fusion) compared with the GloSEA5 error of 33 mm. Regional variability remained consistent throughout the compared models. However, the CNN models all outperform GloSEA5 in the prediction of extreme events.

Consequently, X and Y capacitors, common-mode inductors, and differential-mode inductors used for electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppression suffer from aging effects, and their performance continues to decline. However, the electromagnetic compatibility test is often conducted immediately after the power electronic equipment leaves the factory. The electromagnetic compatibility of power electronic equipment is affected by aging, which is not assessed in current industrial testing. This study conducts aging experiments on passive electronic components in EMI filters and measures the impedance in the frequency range from 150 kHz to 30 MHz. Subsequently, a multi-element aging model based on electromagnetic field analysis is established. The proposed model is suitable for electromagnetic compatibility analysis considering aging. Finally, the aging performance of a commercial two-stage EMI filter is predicted to verify the model proposed in the study. The proposed model explains the degeneration of the EMI filter with aging in the frequency range of 150 kHz to 1 MHz, with a maximum amplitude error of 0.58 dB and phase error of 1.0°.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2022.000021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9915497","EMI filter;passive components;impedance model;multi-element aging model","Analytical models;Electromagnetic interference;Network analyzers;Aging;Electromagnetic compatibility;Data models;Power electronics","","1","","22","","10 Oct 2022","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

For humans with severe speech deficits, imagined speech in the brain-computer interface has been a promising hope for reconstructing the neural signals of speech production. However, studies in the EEG-based imagined speech domain still have some limitations due to high variability in spatial and temporal information and low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we investigated the neural signals for two groups of native speakers with two tasks with different languages, English and Chinese. Our assumption was that English, a non-tonal and phonogram-based language, would have spectral differences in neural computation compared to Chinese, a tonal and ideogram-based language. The results showed the significant difference in the relative power spectral density between English and Chinese in specific frequency band groups. Also, the spatial evaluation of Chinese native speakers in the theta band was distinctive during the imagination task. Hence, this paper would suggest the key spectral and spatial information of word imagination with specialized language while decoding the neural signals of speech. Clinical Relevance— Imagined speech-related studies lead to the development of assistive communication technology especially for patients with speech disorders such as aphasia due to brain damage.

Recent media using 3D spatial data, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, has attracted attention. A point cloud is a data format that consists of a number of points, and thus can express 3D media using coordinates and color information for each point. Since a point cloud has a larger capacity than 2D images, a technology to compress the point cloud is required, i.e., standardized in the international standard organization MPEG as a video-based point cloud compression (V-PCC). V-PCC decomposes 3D point cloud data into 2D patches along orthogonal directions, and those patches are placed into a 2D image sequence, and then compressed using existing 2D video codecs. However, data loss may occur while converting a 3D point cloud into a 2D image sequence and encoding this sequence using a legacy video codec. This data loss can cause deterioration in the quality of a reconstructed point cloud. This paper proposed a method of enhancing a reconstructed point cloud by applying a super resolution network to the 2D patch image sequence of a 3D point cloud.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.21213","IITP; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10247334","Point cloud;super resolution;deep learning network;3D data","Point cloud compression;Three-dimensional displays;Image coding;Superresolution;Transform coding;Media;Spatial databases","","1","","22","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

Recently, $T_{1\rho}$-mapping has been proposed as a fully non-invasive alternative for imaging myocardial fibrosis without the need for contrast agent injection. However, its applicability at high fields $(> 1.5\ \mathrm{T})$ is hindered by susceptibility to MRI system imperfections, such as inhomogeneities in the $B_{0}$ and $B_{1}^{+}$ fields. In this work we propose a single breath-hold ECG-triggered single-shot bSSFP sequence to enable $T_{1\rho}$-mapping in vivo at 3T. Adiabatic $T_{1\rho}$ preparations are evaluated to reduce $B_{0}$ and $B_{1}^{+}$ sensitivity in comparison with conventional spin-lock (SL) modules. Numerical Bloch simulations were performed to identify optimal parameters for the adiabatic pulses. Experiments yield $T_{1\rho}$ values in the myocardium equal to $48.13\pm 54.08$ ms for the best adiabatic preparation and $16.01\pm 20.75$ ms for the reference non-adiabatic SL, with 26.91% against 89.74% relative difference in $T_{1\rho}$ values across two shimming conditions. Both phantom and in vivo measurements show increased myocardium/blood contrast and improved resilience against system imperfections compared to non-adiabatic $T_{1\rho}$ preparations, enabling the use at 3T. Clinical relevance— Adiabatically-prepared $T_{1\rho}$-mapping sequences form a promising candidate for non-contrast evaluation of ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies at 3T.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871870","NWO; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871870","","In vivo;Sensitivity;Magnetic resonance imaging;Phantoms;Myocardium;Nonhomogeneous media;Biology","Contrast Media;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging","1","","12","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ultra-wide-bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors, such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and aluminum nitride (AlN), have many advantages suitable for power-device applications. We implanted silicon (Si) at doses ranging from  $1 \times 10^{11}$  to  $1 \times 10^{15} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$  into  $\beta-\mathrm{Ga}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$  (−201) wafers, and annealed them at 800 and 1000° C in N2 atmosphere. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and cathodoluminescence (CL) were used to evaluate the dopant profile and damage resulting from ion implantation. The CL intensity decreased rapidly with the dose. Even at a dose of  $1 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$ , the intensity dropped by nearly half of its value for the bare wafer. The CL intensity recovered after annealing at all doses; however, the CL intensity did not fully recover even after annealing at 1000°C. Moreover, the CL-depth profile at a dose of  $1 \times 10^{15} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$  after annealing at 1000°C showed pronounced intensity decay near the Si-diffused region. The CL-intensity decay was strongly correlated with Si diffusion. This phenomenon suggests that high-temperature annealing at high dose not only activates the Si dopant through the interaction of the interstitial Si and Ga vacancies but also causes interstitial Si atoms to diffuse into deeper regions. CL spectroscopy is very sensitive to the implantation damage and can be used for optimization of ion implantation and annealing processes in  $\beta_{-\mathrm{Ga}_2 \mathrm{O}_3}$ .","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2021.3134407","“Cathodoluminescence Study of Damage Formation and Recovery in Si-ion-implanted β-Ga2O3” presented at the 20th International Workshop on Junction Technology Technical Co-sponsored by IEEE Electron Device Society; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646253","Cathodoluminescence;ion implantation;defects;Ga₂O₃;power electronics;semiconductor device doping;annealing;dopant diffusion","Annealing;Silicon;Semiconductor device measurement;Temperature measurement;Gallium;Crystals;Ions","","1","","39","CCBY","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The improved thermal stability and contact characteristics of Ti/TiO2/ n-Ge contacts were characterized in terms of Schottky barrier height (SBH) and specific contact resistivity ( $\rho _{c}$ ) using the Schottky diode and circular transmission line model (CTLM). The values of SBH and  $\rho _{c}$  increased after the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) above 550 °C. The current density–bias voltage ( $J-V$ ) curves of the Schottky diode showed a change of contact characteristics from Ohmic-like behavior to rectifying. This thermal instability was mainly caused by the decomposition of the interfacial TiO2 layer after high-temperature annealing. The structural degradation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analyses. When carbon ions were incorporated into the interfacial TiO2 layer, the SBH and  $\rho _{c}$  values showed relatively stable characteristics as the RTA temperature increased up to 600 °C. The EELS mapping showed that the diffusion of oxygen from the interfacial TiO2 layer was effectively suppressed thanks to the incorporation of carbon. Thus, the carbon incorporation can improve the thermal stability of the interfacial TiO2 layer and the metal–insulator–semiconductor contact characteristics for Ge-based device applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3197889","National Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT(grant numbers:2020M3H2A1078045); Samsung-POSTECH Research Center (SPRC) funded by Samsung Electronics(grant numbers:IO201211-08125-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9853537","Germanium;metal–insulator–semiconductor;thermal stability;Schottky barrier height;Fermi-level pinning;contact resistivity","Thermal stability;Germanium;Power system stability;Carbon;Schottky diodes;MIS devices;Temperature measurements","","1","","22","CCBY","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the holograms created with deep neural networks can reproduce images only at a specific distance because their target depth is fixed in the training process. This paper suggested and demonstrated a deep neural network that can continuously control the depth of the phase-only hologram. The network takes a target depth and an input image and generates a phase-only hologram. We added a depth embedding block that moves the hologram latent vector depending on the target depth. Thus, we can change the location of the image plane without retraining. The numerical and optical experiments show that the network understands the relationship between the depth and the appearance of the phase-only hologram. As a result, phase-only holograms generated with the proposed network can reconstruct images with around 25-dB PSNR.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3161225","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea government(grant numbers:NRF2020R1F1A107408912); FOUR Program(grant numbers:BK21); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739941","Holography;phase-only hologram;deep neural network;depth embedding block;hologram latent space","Training;Image reconstruction;Neural networks;Three-dimensional displays;Holography;Optical imaging;Holographic optical components","","1","","25","CCBY","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is therefore not trivial to assess the pump power requirements for comb generation when they have such a large diversity in terms of resonator properties and pump configurations. We propose a suitably normalized threshold pump power as a metric to optimize Kerr comb generation independently of the platform. This method allows one to evaluate the minimum threshold power solely based on the properties of the bare resonator, and independently of dispersion, detuning or coupling considerations. In order to confirm the validity of this approach, we experimentally demonstrate Kerr comb generation in a millimeter-size magnesium fluoride whispering-gallery mode resonator with a threshold pump power of only 1.2 mW, which is one of the lowest pump powers reported to date for a mm-size resonator.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3192490","European Research Council(grant numbers:278616); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-20-1-0357); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9834090","Whispering-gallery mode resonators;Kerr optical frequency combs","Optical resonators;Couplings;Q-factor;Pump lasers;Solitons;Power lasers;Dispersion","","1","","17","CCBY","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A complex multidimensional problem can be transformed into simple one-dimensional problems through signal separations. In the existing localization method for noncircular sources that takes into account the Doppler effect based on signal separation, computationally expensive eigen-decomposition of an  $N\times N$  matrix is required at each search point where  $N$  is the number of snapshots. This paper presents an efficient method that requires no eigen-decomposition. The proposed method finds direction estimates by optimization of the same cost function of two variables that the existing method handles. Their estimation performances are thus identical, although the complexity of the former is far less than that of the latter. The optimization of the cost function with respect to one variable is theoretically solved without eigen-decomposition, which leads to lower complexity.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3170840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9764716","Direction estimation;Doppler effect;noncircular signals;decoupled localization;maximum likelihood","Doppler effect;Source separation;Cost function;Minimization;Maximum likelihood estimation;Sensor arrays;Location awareness","","1","","15","CCBY","28 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The 8B10B code is a de facto standard coding technique in the application but its bit-overhead is 25%. The proposed key coding technique is to reduce the coding overhead and still provides enough bit transition to facilitate clock and data recovery in the receiver. After a key pattern is generated from a certain data stream, input data are encoded and framed as packets along with the generated key for transmission. The packets are transmitted and then decoded as original data in the receiver. Using the proposed coding scheme, 4-, 6-, and 8-bit key coding systems are designed and compared. When a 6-bit key coding encoder/decoder is tested, a packet is composed of a 6-bit OR key header followed by 30 encoded sub-packets, in which each sub-packet has a 6-bit data.

Several obstructive apnea episodes were provoked for different separated sequences of 15 minutes in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. In this recurrent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) model, each episode lasted 15s, while the number of total events per sequence was randomly selected. The beat-to-beat interval ($RR$) and the R-wave amplitude ($Ra$) time-series were extracted and processed for each sequence, and used to train Dynamic Bayesian Networks with different lags. An optimal trade-off between the lag ($\mathcal{L}$) and RMSE values was considered to select the best model to be used when detecting apnea episodes. The selected models were then used to estimate the occurrence probability of apnea episodes, $p(A_{t})$, by using a filtering approach. Finally, the time-series of the estimated probabilities were post-processed using non-overlapped 15-s epochs, to determine whether they are classified as apneic or non-apneic segments. Results showed that those lagged models with orders greater than 5, presented suitable RMSE values and become more sensitive as the order increased. A detection threshold of 0.2 seems to provide the best apnea detection performance overall, with $Acc=0.81,\,Se=0.83$ and $Sp=0.79$, using two ECG parameters and $\mathcal{L}=10$.

Simple approaches for reducing high-frequency disturbances, such as inserting an additional gate resistor, lead to increased power losses. This makes achieving both electromagnetic compatibility and power efficiency difficult. Active gate drivers help to find a trade-off between these two. Typically, only narrow-band disturbances must be reduced. Accordingly, a target signal with a spectrum notched at some frequencies can be defined. The target signal can be reached by a target-signal-oriented control of the transistor's gate. This leads to steeper switching slopes, such that the power losses are less increased. Generating arbitrary target signals is impossible. The transistor signal exhibits some physical limitations. A constraint satisfaction problem must be solved, and the gate drive signal must be optimized by applying a residual and Newton's method. The proposed optimization process in the frequency domain is based on the circuit simulation method named “harmonic balance”.

In PN C the noise from the scanner gradient coils is predicted based on linear time-invariant models, which relate the individual gradient coil (X, Y and Z) input to the acoustic noise output. A model setup was constructed of a custom speaker box and MRI -compatible microphone to demonstrate live noise reduction. Additional tuning steps, including output channel equalization and clock mismatch correction, were performed to maximize noise reduction. A calibration sequence was designed to determine the model and tuning parameters. Analysis of actual scanner noise shows an upper limit of 21 dB noise reduction with the proposed linear model.

These datasets focus on multiple types of activities: UCI HAR dataset includes walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying and WISDM dataset includes 18 hand-oriented and non-hand-oriented activities. Several machine learning models were applied to both datasets for activity recognition. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO) was applied to evaluate the models, where the training set and test set were from different subjects. For UCI HAR dataset, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model obtained the highest f1-scores. Adding a gyroscope on the waist significantly improved the f1-scores of sitting and laying (both $\mathrm{p} < 0.05$). For WISDM dataset, the support vector machines (SVM) model obtained the highest f1-scores. The gyroscope on the wrist improved hand-oriented activities while the gyroscope in the pockets improved non-hand-oriented activities (all $\mathrm{p} < 0.05)$. The results showed the improvement for recognition performance by adding gyroscopes. However, the improvement was dependent on the type of activity and the mounting place of the gyroscope. Clinical relevance— Gyroscopes are common sensors for activity recognition in wearable healthcare systems. This study proves the added value by adding gyroscopes on different mounting places for recognition performance.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871845","","Legged locomotion;Wrist;Support vector machines;Accelerometers;Training;Inertial sensors;Medical services","Hand;Humans;Recognition, Psychology;Reflex, Startle;Somatoform Disorders;Upper Extremity","1","","14","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the importance of emotion analysis is increasing, especially with machine learning for both personal life and companies' management environments. At this time, data reliability is an essential component for data classification. The accuracy of sentiment classification can be heavily determined according to the reliability of data, in which case noise data may also influence this classification. Although there is stopword that does not have meaning in such noise data, data that does not fit the purpose of analysis can also be referred to as noise data. This paper aims to provide an analysis of the impact of profanity data on deep learning-based sentiment classification. For this purpose, we used movie review data on the Web and simulated the changes in performance before and after the removal of the profanity data. The accuracy of the model trained with the data and the model trained with the data before removal were compared to determine whether the profanity is noise data that lowers the accuracy in sentiment analysis.

On the contrary, the planar magnetic component can not only work at such high frequency, but also suitable for high power density applications for its low profile. However, in order to avoid core saturation and change the inductance, the air gap is usually required in the design of the planar magnetic component, which will produce fringing effect and further increase the winding loss. Based on Roshen's assumptions, this paper analyzes the planar magnetic component with center air gap. Firstly, the Schwartz-Christoffel mapping is used to establish the mapping relationship between the air gap fringing region and the strip region. Then the magnetic field intensity in complex form is obtained by the complex potential function and the one in vector form is given, which is represented by the strip region coordinate. Finally, the magnetic field intensity verification and the thermal verification are carried out. The method proposed in this paper provides effective guidance for the design of planar magnetic components operating at high frequency.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2022.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9913417","Analytical method;complex potential function;conformal mapping;fringing effect;planar magnetic component;winding loss","Strips;Magnetic cores;Windings;Air gaps;Wires;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic fields","","1","","15","","6 Oct 2022","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

In this paper, we theoretically investigate real-space anisotropic plasmons in WTe2 thin films by using a phenomenological cavity model, anisotropic near-field plasmonic images with specific interference patterns and isofrequency curves in momentum space have been demonstrated. Due to the frequency selective forbidden of plasmons along b axis, a topological transition from the elliptic to the hyperbolic regime is manifested.

Therefore, it is significant to characterize the dynamics of RI changes induced by UV-light irradiation. However, the in-situ characterization of such devices is seldom explored. Here, we studied the influence of UV-light irradiation on silicon photonic devices by probing resonant wavelength shifts of a racetrack microring resonator. Specifically, we studied the temporary variation of the resonant wavelength and its recovery time under different UV-light exposure durations. Experimental results show that with a UV energy of 21 J/cm2, the resonator had a maximum resonant wavelength shift of 0.31 nm, corresponding to an effective RI change of 0.0009 and recovering time of 95 minutes.

Drug development for the disease is crippled as there is no way of measuring effectiveness of the drug without an invasive procedure. Drug efficacy measurement through assessment of viability of onchocerca worms requires the patients to undergo nodulectomy which is invasive, expensive, time-consuming, skill-dependent, infrastructure dependent and lengthy process. In this paper, we discuss the first-ever study that proposes use of machine learning over thermal imaging to non-invasively and accurately predict the viability of worms. The key contributions of the paper are (i) a unique thermal imaging protocol along with pre-processing steps such as alignment, registration and segmentation to extract interpretable features (ii) extraction of relevant semantic features (iii) development of accurate classifiers for detecting the existence of viable worms in a nodule. When tested on a prospective test data of 30 participants with 48 palpable nodules, we achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85.

Their structure does not always replicate the BM thickness nor diffusion through it. Here, a porous polymeric nanofilm made of poly(D-L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) is proposed to recreate the BM in a microfluidic blood-brain-barrier model.

In this study, predictive analytics were used to examine how blinds, daylighting, and geyser temperature settings can reduce electricity consumption and pricing patterns. A panel of expert judges was used to validate the 5-point Likert scale residential electricity load management questionnaire used to gather survey data for the statistical analysis in a Windhoek suburb, Namibia.

Optimal 0.5 Quetelet curve index offers average citizen energy efficiency awareness, education, and behavior modification for affordable electricity. Females generally set hotter geyser temperatures and are higher energy consumers. Blinds reduce electricity consumption by 50% in summer, 25% in winter, and day-lighting by 25%.

"Quantitative Calibration of Three-Wavelength Road-Condition Sensor Using a Dual-Wavelength Response Ratio","S. Yang","College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China",IEEE Access,"15 Feb 2022","2022","10","","16512","16517","Assessing the condition of a road exposed to the atmosphere is crucial for safety. A three-wavelength road-condition sensor is a noncontact sensor that can be used for qualitative recognition and quantitative measurement of road conditions. However, the sensor is not robust to anomalous changes in the light intensity received that can be caused by several factors (such as changes in distance to the measuring point from a road bump or pothole). These changes cause the measurement state to deviate from the calibration state, reducing the sensor detection accuracy. However, existing studies on reducing the influence of the abovementioned problems on road-condition detection have only focused on how to ensure robustness in the qualitative classification of road-covering types, and no studies have been performed on how to ensure robustness in the quantitative measurement of the road-covering thickness. Thus, a quantitative calibration method for three-wavelength road-condition sensors using a dual-wavelength response ratio is proposed in this study. This method consists of using the response voltage ratio of two wavelengths to replace the response voltage of one wavelength during the quantitative calibration of sensors, making quantitative measurement insensitive to the deviation between measurement and calibration states. Comparison experiments were performed using the three-wavelength road-condition sensor calibrated by different quantitative methods, and an analysis was performed on the influence of the deviation of the measurement state from the calibration state on the quantitative measurement results and the measured covering thickness under changes in the measurement state. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the novel approach compared with the traditional quantitative calibration method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3149778","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2572019BF01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706430","Dual wavelength;quantitative calibration;response ratio;road condition sensor;robustness","Calibration;Thickness measurement;Voltage measurement;Wavelength measurement;Roads;Semiconductor device measurement;Measurement uncertainty","","1","","14","CCBYNCND","7 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fabricated using a combination of epoxy resin microneedles bonded to a flexible substrate, the performance of the FMNE was compared to that of a conventional wet-gel electrode by simultaneously capturing the ECG signal using both electrodes, and estimating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each. Results show that the flexible electrode can acquire ECG signals in which all the characteristic components of the wave are visible, and that are comparable in quality to those obtained using commercial wet electrodes. Bland-Altman plots were drawn to validate the performance of FMNE, and show that the mean difference ± standard deviation in SNR obtained using wet electrodes and FMNE was $0.9\pm 0.7 \text{dB}$.

Comparing with NRCS, the effect of cutoff caused by radial velocity motion showed highly correlation to SWH and potential for SWH retrieval from SAR imagery. Following the scheme of ${{\rm{\lambda }}}_{\mathrm{c}}$ estimation from Chinese GF-3 SAR imagery, the resolution of sub-looks and polarization selection were compared for cutoff wavelength calculation. It is revealed that, for HV polarization, estimated ${{\rm{\lambda }}}_{\mathrm{c}}$ are generally larger than HH ones, the latter already being larger than values estimated in VV polarization. Especially, to propose an objective way to filter unreliable ${{\rm{\lambda }}}_{\mathrm{c}}$, the parameters of kurtosis and skewness are related with unreliable imagery and estimated ${{\rm{\lambda }}}_{\mathrm{c}}$. Moreover, the new quality criterion was performed to establish an empirical method for SWH retrieval under non-fully/fully developed sea states for HH, HV, VV polarization. The systematic comparisons showed the potential of ${{\rm{\lambda }}}_{\mathrm{c}}$ estimation for sea states condition, especially for non-fully developed sea states. In particular, a novel method to retrieve SWH was proposed in consideration of imagery features $( {{\sigma }_0,cvar} )$ and estimated ${{\rm{\lambda }}}_{\mathrm{c}}$ by following the steps focused in this study. The independent validation data provided additional sea state information related to estimated ${{\rm{\lambda }}}_{\mathrm{c}}$. Validation against SWH from ECMWF showed that the performance of $f( {{\sigma }_0,cvar,{\lambda }_c} )$ showed satisfying results, with a Cor of 0.77 (HH), 0.73 (HV), 0.77 (VV), and a RMSE of 0.18 (HH), 0.19 (HV), 0.18 (VV).

This study presents an XGBoost-based machine learning algorithm for forecasting CRS severity (no CRS, mild- and severe-CRS classes) in the 24 hours following the time of prediction utilizing the common vital signs and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) questionnaire inputs. The CRS algorithm was developed and evaluated on a cohort of patients (n=1,139) surgically treated for neoplasm with no ICD9 codes for infection or sepsis during a collective 9,892 patient-days of monitoring in ICU settings. Different models were trained with unique feature sets to mimic practical monitoring environments where different types of data availability will exist. The CRS models that incorporated all time series features up to the prediction time showcased a micro-average area under curve (AUC) statistic for the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.94 for the 3 classes of CRS grades. Models developed on a second cohort requiring data within the 24 hours preceding prediction time showcased a relatively lower 0.88 micro-average AUROC as these models did not benefit from implicit information in the data availability. Systematic removal of blood pressure and/or GCS inputs revealed significant decreases (p<0.05) in model performances that confirm the importance of such features for CRS prediction. Accurate CRS prediction and timely intervention can reverse CRS adverse events and maximize the benefit of immunotherapies in oncology patients.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871716","","Machine learning algorithms;Systematics;Time series analysis;Surgery;Predictive models;Oncology;Sepsis","Area Under Curve;Cytokine Release Syndrome;Glasgow Coma Scale;Humans;ROC Curve;Vital Signs","1","","14","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is a brittle material and is strain-sensitive. To reduce the potential Jc degradation of the conductor, it is crucial to accurately evaluate the stress of the coils owing to the large Lorentz force during magnet excitation. In the traditional stress analysis of magnets, the coils are usually regarded as homogenized structures using isotropic material coefficients; however, most superconducting (SC) coils have hierarchical and complicated structures. To obtain a more accurate estimation, it is necessary to consider the detailed internal structure of the coils during stress analysis. In this study, the homogenization method was applied to multi-scale stress analysis of a high-field accelerator SC magnet. The effective material coefficients of Nb3Sn coils were calculated using this method. Stress analysis of the magnet was performed using the effective material coefficients and isotropic material coefficients for comparison. Compared with the result obtained using isotropic material coefficients, the Von-Mises stress of the coil using effective material coefficients is larger at different load steps. The stress level of most Nb3Sn filaments in the strand was higher than that of the coil. The maximum stress of the Nb3Sn filaments appeared in the strand contact regions. In addition, there was a significant difference in the average stress of all materials in the strand. These findings will help develop more accurate analysis and simulation models for high-field SC magnets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3170462","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)(grant numbers:XDB25000000); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0704200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9763513","Homogenization method;Nb₃Sn;stress analysis;superconducting magnet","Coils;Stress;Magnetomechanical effects;Mathematical models;Superconducting magnets;Magnetic analysis;Thermal expansion","","1","","17","CCBY","26 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Objective: This study is intended as an initial step to fill that gap by investigating the connection between issues and problem reports and team maturity. Method: We conducted a quantitative study with 84 participants from 14 teams and qualitatively validated the result with the Release Train Engineer having an overview of all the participating teams. Results: We find that the more mature a team is, the faster they seem to resolve issues as provided through external feedback, at least in the two initial team maturity stages. Conclusion: This study suggests that working on team dynamics might increase productivity in modern automotive software development departments, but this needs further investigation.","2574-1837","978-1-4503-9342-3","10.1145/3528579.3529173","Swedish Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796368","automotive software development;teams;team maturity;problem reports","Productivity;Industries;Conferences;Psychology;Software;Automobiles;Vehicle dynamics","","","","23","CCBY","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a simple and effective detection method for the special IRC structure is proposed by point-to-point acquisition. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra emitted from different InxGa1-xAs positions are measured by moving the metal mask with a 0.2-mm-diameter light hole. By establishing the relationship between InxGa1-xAs thickness and spectral intensity, the thickness fluctuation of normal In0.17Ga0.83As and indium-deficient In0.12Ga0.88As layers is determined by comparing the intensity of dual peaks. The dual peaks are typical feature of this IRC structure, which is caused by the migration of indium atoms. The significance of this experimental results is that it not only can detect the thickness distribution of InxGa1-xAs materials with different x values, but also determine the critical thickness of indium atom migration in the growth of highly strained quantum well.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3215276","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62204172); Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:22KJB140016); World Prestigious Universities(grant numbers:JSSCBS-20210870); NUIST Binjiang College(grant numbers:550221009); Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Optoelectric Materials Science and Technology(grant numbers:OMST202105); 14th Five-Year Jiangsu Provincial Key Discipline Construction Project-Electronic Science and Technology(grant numbers:161); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921301","InGaAs;indium-rich cluster;indium atom migra- tion;thickness distribution","Indium;Indium gallium arsenide;Strain;Gallium arsenide;Fluctuations;Thickness measurement;Photonic band gap","","","","25","CCBY","17 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we describe a double-pulse superposition technique to detect the signal, which uses a synchronized pulse to raise the avalanche signal above the discriminating threshold so the avalanche signal can be easily detected. This technique provides a simple idea for a practical gated single-photon detector to sense avalanche signals since the parasitic capacitance signal from an applied external circuit is unavoidable and will always be coupled to the avalanche signal. Under the same measurement conditions, a comparison was made with the conventional capacitive balance technique, and the experimental results showed a high agreement between the effects of the two signal extraction techniques under several nanoseconds scale gating widths, and the double-pulse superposition technique is highly efficient and easy to implement even under complicated background noise.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2022.3214664","Major Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province(grant numbers:2018ZI002); Yunnan Research Innovation Fund for Graduate Students(grant numbers:2022Y057); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9919228","InGaAs/InP;single-photon avalanche diodes;avalanche extraction;double-pulse superposition;capacitance balance","Single-photon avalanche diodes;Indium gallium nitride;Indium phosphide;Background noise","","","","21","CCBYNCND","14 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mode crosstalk happens in LNOI waveguide bends because more than one mode is generated from the anisotropy of lithium niobate, which limits the minimum bending radius of MRRs. Mode properties of ridge waveguides on X-cut LNOI with different bend radii and wavelengths have been analyzed to remove the effect of mode hybridization and reduce the mode crosstalk. On this basis, a small radius MRR with large FSR and 3dB bandwidth is achieved. Further, to deal with the wavelength shift caused by fabrication error, a second-order micro-ring resonators (2nd-order MRRs) filter with a box-like response and a high out-of-band rejection ratio is realized. Besides, a multichannel demultiplexing filter is realized based on 2nd-order MRRs with low crosstalk (<−13 dB) at a channel spacing of 1.16 nm.

It is difficult to accurately find and identify important objects in the background if there are obstacles such as pedestrian or car in the video. In order to overcome this problem, the following method is used to detect the background. First, a pixel area histogram is generated to determine the amount of change in pixel units of an image over time. Based on the histogram, we propose an algorithm that estimates the background by selecting the case with the smallest rate of change. In addition, in order to strongly respond to changes in the surrounding environment, even when a change in brightness occurs, this is solved through frame overlap. Finally, the desired object is identified by applying YOLO v3 as a model for object detection in the obtained background. Through the above process, this study proposes a method for effectively identifying static objects in the background by precisely estimated background of the video. Experimental results show that the non-detection and false detection rate for the background object is enhanced by 60.2% and 11.2%, respectively, in comparison with when the proposed method was not applied.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.21513","IITP(grant numbers:2019-0-01834); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10246931","Background obtainment;histogram;object detection;YOLO","Histograms;Pedestrians;Surveillance;Brightness;Estimation;Object detection;Inference algorithms","","","","18","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

The rising demand for data center services is accompanied by massive energy consumption, and it motivates intensive research on cost-effective, reliable, and greener electricity to optimize the utilization of electric power. In datacenter, less than half of the total energy is delivered to the terminal load, such as CPU, GPU, memory, and disk, while the rest is lost during power conversion, distribution, and cooling. This results in high costs, large cooling equipment, and inefficient power utilization. Higher energy efficiency, higher power density, better cooling, and cost reduction are the major driving forces to shape greener datacenter power management technologies.

In this paper, the influence mechanism of series compensation on apparent impedance angle trajectory is analyzed. It reveals that series compensation capacitors reduce the equivalent impedance angle and consequently the apparent impedance angle cannot pass through all four zones, resulting in the risk of failure for the separation devices. A revised method of apparent impedance angle based on compensation principle is discussed, and then an improved out-of-step oscillation detection criterion is proposed. In view of the fact that the apparent impedance angle at the moment of maximum current is equal to the equivalent impedance angle during an oscillation process, a practical algorithm based on the compensated apparent impedance angle is proposed. RTDS tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the new criterion, considering transmission lines with a high series compensation level.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-022-00242-1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10373985","Out-of-step oscillation separation;Series compensated line;Apparent impedance angle;Compensated impedance angle","Power transmission lines;Capacitors;Power grids;Trajectory;Impedance;Reliability;Object recognition","","","","18","","25 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

Many static analysis tools have been developed to facilitate the contract audit process, but not all of them take account of two special features of smart contracts: (1) The external variables, like time, are constrained by real-world factors; (2) The internal variables persist between executions. Since these features import implicit constraints into contracts, they significantly affect the performance of static tools, such as causing errors in reachability analysis and resulting in false positives. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on implicit constraints from three aspects. First, we summarize the implicit constraints in smart contracts. Second, we evaluate the impact of such constraints on the state-of-the-art static tools. Third, we propose a lightweight but effective mitigation method named ConSym to deal with such constraints and integrate it into OSIRIS. The evaluation result shows that ConSym can filter out 96% of false positives and reduce false negatives by two-thirds.","","978-1-6654-9590-5","10.1145/3510457.3513076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793963","Smart contract;Static analysis;Implicit constraints;Code audit","Systematics;Smart contracts;Static analysis;Time factors;Reachability analysis;Software engineering","","","","11","","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three digital ports of a microcontroller, two transistors, and an embedded timer were used to measure the charging times of the inductor through forward- and backward-flow currents using two different initial conditions. The difference between the charging times was used to estimate the sensor inductance accurately without the uncertainty due to the tolerance of threshold voltage of the input port, which delimits these time length measurements. Experimental results show that a conventional low-power microcontroller with an embedded 16 MHz clock and 22  $\Omega $  charge resistance can be used to achieve 2  $\mu \text{H}$  resolution and a systematic error below 2% for a measuring range from 100  $\mu \text{H}$  to 10 mH.

IGBT’s reverse transfer dynamic capacitance is extracted for the first time with a five-contact method. While small-signal capacitance does not allow any current flow in the drift region due to the ground gate, the dynamic capacitance is the output of the time-dependent bipolar carriers during the inductive switching. For this reason, the magnitude and the shape of the dynamic capacitance are quite different from the small-signal capacitance found in most of the commercial datasheet. The discrepancy between the dynamic  ${C}_{\text {GC}}$  and the small-signal  ${C}_{\text {GC}}$  raises a fundamental question of whether the small-signal  ${C}_{\text {GC}}$  in the datasheet is useful for considering the device’s dynamic performance.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2022.3212976","KENTECH(grant numbers:KRG2021-01-001); Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea(grant numbers:20224000000320,20224000000100); National Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Science and Information and Communications Technology (ICT)(grant numbers:NRF-2022M3I8A1077252); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926047","Dynamic capacitance;insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT);inductive switching","Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Capacitance;Logic gates;Switches;Germanium;Charge carrier processes;Transient analysis","","","","27","CCBY","20 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, the influence of back bias on the electrical parameters of these devices is also investigated through DC parameters such as on-to-off-state current ratio and DIBL. The evaluation is conducted by 3D TCAD simulations calibrated with experimental data. The application of negative back bias on nMOS transistors not only shifts the threshold voltage, but also causes mobility degradation due to the negative potential on the channel pushing the charges against the gate oxide interface. On the other hand, when positive back bias is applied, despite the mobility improvement allowed by the back channel’s superior mobility and the front channel’s less compacted inversion layer, at higher substrate bias levels, a strong mobility degradation is observed in the back channel due to the substrate’s high electric field, resulting in reduction of the channel’s overall effective mobility. The application of positive substrate bias degrades the subthreshold slope, leading to smaller on-to-off-state current ratio, as well as the reduced control of channel charges by the gate electrode worsens the DIBL.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2022.3144028","CNPq(grant numbers:307383/2017-2); CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001); São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(grant numbers:2019/15500-5); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684572","Mobility;nanowire MOS transistors;substrate bias;thin BOX","Substrates;Logic gates;Performance evaluation;Nanoscale devices;Threshold voltage;Degradation;Transistors","","","","20","CCBY","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For these newborns, healthcare providers provide positive pressure ventilation. However, the lungs of newborns are stiff and small, and proper ventilation can be difficult to achieve. Flow sensors can improve the technique because they can convey ventilation parameters. In this study, we have developed a flow sensor that can be used for neonatal resuscitation. The results showed that the sensor had low flow resistance (0.18kPa@10L/min), the measurement accuracy at low flow rates was higher than commercially available flow sensors, was robust to noise when intubation tube was connected, and did not increase the dead space.

It features high power efficiency and avoids phase modulation which is critical for upconversion of ultra-wideband signals. In this brief, the problem of unwanted spectral emission, inherent in MP TX architectures, is compensated by a proper data delay. Such an approach is considered for the first time in the multiphase architecture and achieves a spectral improvement of up to 38 dB in adjacent channels and 24 dB at the receiver (RX) duplex distance for a new radio (NR) signal with 20 MHz bandwidth. With the proposed solution the MP TX architecture becomes a highly competitive candidate for wideband signals such as LTE, LTE-CA or NR signals.

One understudied physical aspect of these systems is tertiary tides, wherein the tidal deformation of a tertiary in a hierarchical triple drains energy from the inner binary, causing the inner binary's orbital separation to decrease. This tidal process is difficult to observe directly, since such an observation requires a very compact hierarchical triple, the tertiary of which must be almost large enough to fill its Roche lobe at the epoch of observation. Concurrently, the recently discovered stellar system TIC242132789 is the fourth most compact observed hierarchical triple, and the most compact in which the tertiary is a giant. In this paper, we demonstrate that TIC242132789 provides a rare opportunity to place constraints on the model parameters for tertiary tides, and can even be a rare opportunity to directly observe tertiary-tides-induced orbital shrinkage of the inner binary. We calculate our expectations of how fast the inner orbit will shrink, and demonstrate that our estimates of this rate of shrinkage should be observable using current techniques. We conclude with a call for relevant observations of this system to commence.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stad464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10078799","binaries: close;binaries: eclipsing;stars: evolution","","","","","","","22 Mar 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Their security and privacy vulnerabilities raise concerns about the practical deployment of these systems. The number and variety of the adversarial attacks grow continuously, making it difficult for mitigation approaches to provide effective solutions. Current mitigation techniques often rely on expensive re-training procedures as new attacks emerge. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial mitigation technique for biosignal classification tasks. Our approach is based on recent findings interpreting early exit neural networks as an ensemble of weight sharing sub-networks. Our experiments on state-of-the-art deep learning models show that early exit ensembles can provide robustness generalizable to various white box and universal adversarial attacks. The approach increases the accuracy of vulnerable deep learning models up to 60 percentage points, while providing adversarial mitigation comparable to adversarial training. This is achieved without previous exposure to the adversarial perturbation or the computational burden of re-training.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871347","","Training;Deep learning;Privacy;Perturbation methods;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Decision making","Neural Networks, Computer","","","18","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the sensor with a nanoparticle film is exposed to a headspace vapor from ethanol-water mixtures, we observe a transient impedance response of the sensor depending on the ethanol concentration. A higher ethanol concentration gives a faster decrement of impedance in the response. By using this nanoscale physical phenomenon, we evaluate ethanol concentration in commercial sanitizers within 30 s. The sensor finds the ethanol concentration without contacting the sanitizers.

Currently, the hump, the abnormal transfer characteristic, is also an essential factor of AOSs TFT. The hump phenomenon was observed for AOS-TFTs with a metal capping (MC) layer under various measurement conditions. The mobility in the MC TFT was improved from 14.8 cm2/Vs to 19.2 cm2/Vs compared to that of the conventional TFTs. The improved electrical characteristics in the MC structure are representative of the carrier injection effect and the change of the current path. This reason reveals that the MC structure has a hump phenomenon under the low drain to source voltage ( $V_{DS}$ ). The hump characteristic does not significantly affect the overall MC TFT characteristics (transfer characteristic, improved electrical characteristics through MC structure, etc.). In addition, it was confirmed that it exhibits very stable hump characteristics through repeated measurements and uniformity. It was found that two current paths are formed mainly due to carrier injection from the metal capping layer in the hump phenomenon observed at low  $V_{DS}$ . These divided current paths can lead to two on-currents ( $I_{on}$ ) in the transfer curve. Many studies have recently been conducted to fabricate semiconductor devices with multi-values such as 0, 1, and 2. This divided current path could propose a simple method to achieve multi-values with an easy process.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2021.3130586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627140","Amorphous oxide semiconductor;thin-film transistor;metal capping;hump phenomenon","Thin film transistors;Metals;Stress;Electric variables;Semiconductor device measurement;Electrodes;Electron devices","","","","34","CCBY","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For GR(10/89)- and GR(18/89)-based MPF retrievals, the difference standard deviations were ~3.8%. This is lower than the ~14.3% standard deviation of the GR(23/89)-, GR(36/89)-, and PR(89)-based MPF retrievals. Our results suggest that the GR(10/89) and (18/89) MPF retrievals are available at a product quality similar to the original GR(6/89)-based MPF retrieval. We recommend that the GR(18/89) MPF retrieval adopted is used in nearshore environments such as in the CAA.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2020.3038888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284577","Advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E);AMSR2;Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA);melt pond fraction (MPF);melt season;passive microwave;sea ice","Standards;Spatial resolution;Microwave radiometry;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Sea ice;Arctic","","","","14","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electromyography (EMG) activation of four lower limb muscles and centre of pressure dynamics were recorded. Acute initial knee angles resulted in a change in duration of phases within the STS, and restrictive arm positioning caused the time to completion to increase (p=0.04). Muscle activation patterns across phases were compared and showed significant differences between phases in both the Tibialis Anterior and Rectus Femoris (p<0.006). Acute initial knee angles were also found to significantly increase Biceps Femoris activation across multiple phases (p=0.034).

The phase errors and the duty cycle distortions of the quadrature clocks determine the quality of the output DQS. The proposed QCC simultaneously runs phase correction and the duty adjustment of quadrature clocks for fast correction time. In order to reduce power switching noise induced by output drivers, the proposed transmitter transfers the data at different timings using the phase controller which generates the interpolated quadrature clocks for even and odd channels. Since the even channel is synchronized with the reference quadrature clocks and the odd channel is synchronized with the interpolated quadrature clocks, the peak switching currents consumed by output drivers are spread. The proposed circuit has been designed in 180-nm CMOS process using VDD of 1.8-V and VDDQ of 0.6-V and the target data rate is 3.2 Gbps. The corrected quadrature clocks have the duty cycle distortion of 0.2% and the phase error of 1.18° with input clock distortion.

In particular, the use of activity monitors could help to measure the health-related effects of specific PA interventions. Our study, named as Run4Vit, focuses on evaluating the acute and longterm effects of an eight-week running intervention on PA behaviour and vitality. To achieve this goal, we developed an algorithm to detect running and estimate instantaneous cadence using a single trunk-fixed accelerometer. Cadence was computed using time and frequency domain approaches. Validation was performed over a wide range of locomotion speeds using an open-source gait database. Across all subjects, the cadence estimation algorithms achieved a mean bias and precision of - 0.01 ± 0.69 steps/min for the temporal method and 0.02 ± 1.33 steps/min for the frequency method. The running detection algorithm demonstrated very good performance, with an accuracy of 98% and a precision superior to 99%. These algorithms could be used to extract metrics related to the multiple dimensions of PA, and provide reliable outcome measures for the Run4Vit longitudinal running intervention program.

Traditional and Internet decoration companies have failed to solve these problems effectively. The purpose of this study is to build a new collaborative decoration platform to solve the shortcomings of the decoration industry and promote its healthy development. A crowd-based collaborative decoration platform called Crowd E-home is proposed. Based on the Building Information Modeling (BIM) of houses, the platform constructs collaborative intelligent digital models, which have the characteristics of evolution, coordination, multifaceted, and initiative. These models act as intermediate coordinators to complete the collaborative division of labor. This platform plays a role in matching multiparty transactions among consumers, designers, construction teams, material suppliers, and supervisors to solve the problem of the huge coordination costs of traditional decoration companies. It also breaks the space-time limit of consumer selection during the decoration process, improves the decision-making power of consumers, and meets consumer needs for personalized services.

Aluminum-based biosensors are favored in this category, due to their enhanced stability and profitability. Despite the recent advances in nanotechnology and the significant improvement in development of these biosensors, some deficiencies restrict their utilization. Hence a detailed insight into their behavior in different conditions would be crucial, which can be achieved with nanoscale numerical simulation. With this aim, an Aluminum-based biosensor is chosen to be analyzed with the help of all-atom molecular dynamics model (AA-MD), using large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS). The surface properties and adsorption process through different flow conditions and various concentration of the target, are investigated in this study. In the future work, the results of this study will be used for developing a predictive model for surface properties of the biosensor. Clinical Relevance— The role of biosensors in clinical applications and early diagnosis is evident. This work provides a model for predicting the binding behavior of the target molecules on the biosensor surface in different conditions. Results demonstrate an increase in the adsorption of ethanol on the biosensor surface of 7% up to 80% with changing the velocity from 0.001 m/s to 1 m/s Although for cases with higher concentration this trend becomes complicated necessitating the implementation of machine learning models in the future works","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871498","University of Manchester; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871498","","Biological system modeling;Adsorption;Ethanol;Predictive models;Aerodynamics;Numerical simulation;Nanoscale devices","Aluminum;Biosensing Techniques;Molecular Dynamics Simulation;Nanostructures;Nanotechnology","","","25","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially in osteoporotic bone, toggling of pedicle screws is a common problem that compromises the fixation strength of these screws and can lead to loosening or axial pull-out of the screw. In this study, we explore the use of an in-pedicle expandable anchor that shapes to the pedicle to increase the toggling resistance of the anchor by increasing the contact area between the anchor and the dense cortical bone of the pedicle. A scaled-up, two-dimensional prototype was designed. The prototype consists of a bolt and ten stainless steel wedges that expand by tensioning the bolt. During the expansion, the wedges are required to compress the cancellous bone. Based on the first preliminary experiment, it was found that the expansion of the wedges resulted in successful compression of 5 PCF cancellous bone phantom (Sawbones). This preliminary study shows that an expandable in-pedicle anchor could be a feasible option to increase the toggling resistance of spinal bone anchors, especially in osteoporotic bone. Clinical Relevance- Toggling of pedicle screws is a major cause of screw loosening. In this preliminary study, the use of an in-pedicle expandable anchor to increase the toggling resistance of spinal bone anchors is explored.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871068","","Resistance;Shape;Prototypes;Surgery;Phantoms;Fasteners;Bones","Humans;Osteoporosis;Pedicle Screws;Reoperation;Spine","","","14","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is well-known that the SSCM does not provide consistent estimates of the eigenvalues of the shape matrix (normalized scatter matrix). To alleviate this problem, we propose BASIC (Bias Adjusted SIgn Covariance), which performs an approximate bias correction to the eigenvalues of the SSCM under the assumption that the samples are generated from zero mean unspecified complex elliptically symmetric distributions (the real-valued case is also addressed). We then use the bias correction in order to develop a robust regularized SSCM based estimator, BASIC Shrinkage estimator (BASICS), which is suitable for high dimensional problems, where the dimension can be larger than the sample size. We assess the proposed estimator with several numerical examples as well as in a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification problem with real data sets. The simulations show that the proposed estimator compares well to competing robust covariance matrix estimators but has the advantage of being significantly faster to compute.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3134940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9648030","Covariance matrix;elliptical distribution;spatial sign covariance matrix;robust estimation;shrinkage","Covariance matrices;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Shape;Sensors;Indexes;Electric breakdown;Signal processing algorithms","","","","30","CCBY","13 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the GMDS supplementary run rule, the  $C_{pk}$  chart signals when a point falls in the action region or when a point falls in the warning region after a sequence of  $m$  points, with less than  $k$ , in the central region.

Its coding structure is a multi-type tree (MTT) structure, which consists of two types of trees that are Ternary Tree (TT) and Binary Tree (BT). Due to the use of brute force quest for residual rate-distortion the quad-tree and multi-type tree (QTMT) structure of the coding unit (CU) split and contributes over 98% of the encoding time. This structure is efficient in coding, however, increases computational complexity. The current paper proposes a deep learning technique to predict the QTMT based CU split rather than just the brute-force QTMT method to substantially speed up the time of the encoding process for VVC/H.266 intra mode. In the first phase, we developed an extensive database containing ample CU splitting patterns and various streaming videos. In the second phase, we suggest a multi-level exit CNN (MLE-CNN) model with a redundancy removal mechanism at different levels to determine the CU partition. In the third phase, for the training of MLECNN model we have established the adaptive loss function and analyzing the both unknown number of partition modes and the focus on RD cost minimization. Finally, a variable threshold decision system is established to achieve the targeted low complexity and RD performance.

It is essential to consider the wind power correlation for steady-state related calculations in the modern power system with high wind power penetration. This short article presents a novel continuous permutation method for wind power correlation analysis. With the novel eigen-permutation, the proposed method is applicable to tackle the correlation analysis even the correlation matrix of random variables is not positive definite. A continuous permutation is then proposed to reduce the permutation deviation and, hence, to reduce the error of steady-state related calculations. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in dealing with the nonpositive definite correlation matrix of the wind speeds. Also, compared to the traditional methods, the proposed method achieves more than an 80% reduction of the general error in the correlation analysis, which also contributes to higher accuracy in the power flow calculation.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2022.3144969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9709879","Correlation problem;eigen-decomposition;renewable energy;sample permutation","Correlation;Wind power generation;Wind speed;Steady-state;Matrix decomposition;Random variables;Security","","","","11","CCBY","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, this paper designed a deep model based on Brenier theorem for manifold discovery. Since Brenier theorem can find the optimal transportation mass distance between the reconstructed data distribution and the original data distribution, the manifold discovered from in the reconstructed data distribution can be as close to the original manifold as possible. Results not only show that the proposed method wins over competing methods both the precision of manifold discovery and resistance to data sparsity, but also show those non-linear architectures with deep paradigms outperform those architectures without deep paradigms in terms of manifold discovery. We find that the loss function derived by Brenier theorem can help that models minimize the error between the reconstructed manifold and the original manifold.

Therefore, some radiation protection institutions and health organizations (ICRP, IAEA) make recommendations to monitor kVp in medical diagnostic X-ray equipment in clinics and hospitals. There are some methods for measuring kVp in diagnostic X-ray beams, and the most common is the well-known two-sensor method, which uses two filters to attenuate the radiation beam, and it is based on the measurement of each identical sensor. The purpose of this article is to present a method for non-invasive measurement of kVp in medical diagnostic X-ray beams using the MOSFET device. Actually, MOSFET is well known as a detector for ionizing radiation dosimetry mainly in radiotherapy beams. Recently, MOSFET has also been used as dosimeter in diagnostic X-ray beams. In this work it will be shown a kVp measurement technique with MOSFET, which does not use the attenuation factor of the radiation filters, but instead takes advantage of the effect of the device package itself, known as the buildup cap effect. The results show that even with damage to the device exposed to radiation, MOSFET can be used as sensor for kVp measurement.","2768-7236","","10.1109/OJIM.2022.3196725","CNPq Brazilian Agency(grant numbers:305017/2021-7); Scients Company(grant numbers:200313); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9851457","Instrumentation;MOSFET;peak kilovoltage;radiodiagnostic;X-ray","MOSFET;Electron tubes;Attenuation;Semiconductor device measurement;Current measurement;Switches;Photonics;X-ray imaging;Diagnostic radiography","","","","20","CCBY","5 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, we have demonstrated that epidural sacral spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can be used to activate lower urinary tract nerves and provide both major components of bladder control: voiding and continence. To effectively control these functions, it is necessary to selectively recruit the afferents of the pudendal nerve that evoke these distinct bladder reflexes. Translation of this innovation to clinical practice requires an understanding of optimal electrode placements and stimulation parameters to guide surgical practice and therapy design. Computational modeling is an important tool to address many of these experimentally intractable stimulation optimization questions. Here, we built a realistic MRI-based finite element computational model of the feline sacral spinal cord which included realistic axon trajectories in the dorsal and ventral roots. We coupled the model with biophysical simulations of membrane dynamics of afferent and efferent axons that project to the lower urinary tract through the pelvic and pudendal nerves. We simulated the electromagnetic fields arising from stimulation through SCS electrodes and calculated the expected recruitment of pelvic and pudendal fibers. We found that SCS can selectively recruit pudendal afferents, in agreement with our experimental data in cats. Our results suggest that SCS is a promising technology to improve bladder function after spinal cord injury, and computational modeling unlocks the potential for highly optimized, selective stimulation. Clinical Relevance - This model provides a method to non-invasively establish electrode placement and stimulation parameters for improving bladder function with epidural spinal cord stimulation.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871292","Office Of The Director(grant numbers:OT2OD030537); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871292","","Electrodes;Axons;Technological innovation;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Bladder;Electrical stimulation","Animals;Cats;Electric Stimulation;Humans;Spinal Cord Injuries;Urinary Bladder;Urination","","","17","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This thesis therefore aims to develop an approach for proactive self-adaptive systems and evaluate the impact of reconfiguration cost and proactive adaptation in an edge computing system.

Comments in code largely serve a similar purpose, helping future readers understand the program. It is thus natural to study what happens when these two forms of understanding collide. We ask: what documentation-related comments do reviewers make and how do they affect understanding of the contribution? We analyze ca. 700K review comments on 2,000 (Java and Python) GitHub projects, and propose several filters to identify which comments are likely to be either in response to a change in documentation and/or call for such a change. We identify 65K such cases. We next develop a taxonomy of the reviewer intents behind such “comments on comments”. We find that achieving a shared under-standing of the code is key: reviewer comments most often focused on clarification, followed by pointing out issues to fix, such as typos and outdated comments. Curiously, clarifying comments were frequently suggested (often verbatim) by the reviewer, indicating a desire to persist their understanding acquired during code review. We conclude with a discussion of implications of our comments-on-comments dataset for research on improving code review, including the potential benefits for automating code review.","2574-3864","978-1-4503-9303-4","10.1145/3524842.3528475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796192","","Java;Codes;Taxonomy;Computer bugs;Documentation;Software;Data mining","","","","11","CCBY","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is partially because of the large resistivity of the seed layer and the nonmagnetic layer in the spin-valve. In this study, we have systematically investigated nonmagnetic overlayers and have found that a Ag layer best maintains the perpendicular anisotropy. The corresponding GMR devices have then been fabricated and characterized, achieving the GMR ratio of ~0.03% at room temperature.

CK-Encoder, which can effectively acquire commonsense knowledge to improve the performance of sentence similarity modeling, is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the model first generates a commonsense knowledge graph of the input sentence and calculates this graph by using the graph convolution network.

In this study, we have investigated, on the basis of survey data, interactive-effect relationships among productivity, stress, and work engagement. Survey results obtained from 301 samples self-report questionnaires (including the WHO Health and Work Performance Questionnaire: HPQ; the Perceived Stress Scale: PSS; and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale: UWES) were analyzed using mediation analysis. Results suggest that the interactive positive effects of productivity and work engagement were roughly equal, and that stress decreased both productivity and work engagement. Revealing the relationships among productivity, stress, and work engagement contributes to the efforts of occupational health physicians and of workers in human resource departments trying to plan effective and preferential interventions in order to improve employee working conditions.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871224","","Productivity;Employee welfare;Medical services;Occupational health;Biology;Mediation;Stress","Efficiency;Humans;Job Satisfaction;Mediation Analysis;Surveys and Questionnaires;Work Engagement","","","28","CCBY","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple contact windows under the N- and P-electrodes formed by etching help realize the discontinuous ohmic contacts with the N-GaN layer and the ITO layer, respectively. Similarly, by etching a plurality of discontinuous openings with the same pitch in the CBL, a discontinuous CBL structure is formed. As compared with traditional structures, the discontinuous ohmic contacts can maximize the number of current paths which allow the carriers to be collected from all four directions, leading to a more uniform current spreading and thermal management. Furthermore, as the contacts are not continuous any longer, some of the otherwise removed materials (such as the active region) lying between the patches are saved. The optoelectronic characteristics, junction temperature, thermal resistance, and infrared thermography measurements are conducted and the current distribution is simulated. The results show that the novel LED structure has better optoelectronic performances and current spreading ability compared to traditional devices. At 150 mA current, the luminous efficiency is 15.2% higher than the traditional LED, the junction temperature is reduced by 4.9%, and the thermal resistance is reduced by 12%.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3169218","Fujian province governmental projects(grant numbers:2021HZ0114,2021J01583,2021L3004); Fujian Science & Technology Innovation Laboratory for Optoelectronic Information of China(grant numbers:2021ZZ122,2020ZZ110); National key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0403102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761770","GaN LEDs;discontinuous ohmic contact electrodes;current spreading;thermal management","Light emitting diodes;Temperature measurement;Electrodes;Temperature distribution;Ohmic contacts;Licenses;Thermal resistance","","","","11","CCBYNCND","21 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

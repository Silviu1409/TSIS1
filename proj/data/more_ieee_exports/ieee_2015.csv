To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new short-term load forecasting framework based on big data technologies. First, a cluster analysis is performed to classify daily load patterns for individual loads using smart meter data. Next, an association analysis is used to determine critical influential factors. This is followed by the application of a decision tree to establish classification rules. Then, appropriate forecasting models are chosen for different load patterns. Finally, the forecasted total system load is obtained through an aggregation of an individual load’s forecasting results. Case studies using real load data show that the proposed new framework can guarantee the accuracy of short-term load forecasting within required limits.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2015.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7281129","Association analysis;big data;cluster analysis;decision tree;short-term load forecasting","","","45","","","","2 Oct 2015","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Both cases of grid connection of the wind farm, either displacing synchronous generators or being directly added into the power system, are considered. By using the proposed approach, how much the effect of the change of load flow/configuration brought about by the wind farm can be examined, while the degree of impact of the dynamic interaction of the wind farm with the SGs can be investigated separately. Thus, a clearer picture and better understanding of the power system small-signal angular stability as affected by grid connection of the large-scale wind farm can be achieved.

This paper details the use of decision trees to predict multi-mode damping of power system integrating renewable generations with the help of wide-area measurements system (WAMS). Power systems with renewable source generation are complex with vast amounts of data being collected from WAMS. Decision trees (DTs) are employed as a means to handle vast quantities of wide-area information, which involves the mode damping information indicating the stability. A 16-generator, 68bus system with photovoltaic power generation and wind power generation is used as the test system. Remote signals obtained from phasor measurement units (PMUs) are employed as the input variables of DTs for predicting purposes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed predicting scheme is able to suggest the optimal course of action to remedy any near instability or unstable electromechanical oscillations even without prior knowledge of the varying output of the renewable source power.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2015.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160640","Decision tree;inter-area oscillations;modedamping;prediction;probabilistic density function;wide-areameasurements","","","24","","","","24 Jul 2015","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

A fractional factorial design is used to systematically explore the large optimization space (282 possible combinations), while still accurately determining the effects of optimizations and optimization combinations. Hardware power measurements on each platform are taken to ensure all architectural effects on the energy consumption are captured. We show that fractional factorial design can find more optimal combinations than relying on built-in compiler settings. We explore the relationship between run-time and energy consumption, and identify scenarios where they are and are not correlated. A further conclusion of this study is the structure of the benchmark has a larger effect than the hardware architecture on whether the optimization will be effective, and that no single optimization is universally beneficial for execution time or energy consumption.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxt129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8130281","compilation;energy optimization;optimization selection;fractional factorial design;energy efficiency;embedded systems;benchmarks;power measurement","","","17","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This tensor contains information about the shape and material properties of the object and is independent of position. We apply a recently derived asymptotic formula for the perturbed magnetic field, due to the presence of a conducting inclusion, which is expressed in terms of a new class of rank 4 polarization tensors (Ammari, H., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Garnier, J. & Volkov, D.

For objects with rotational and mirror symmetries we show that the number of coefficients is still smaller. We include numerical examples to demonstrate that the new polarization tensors can be accurately computed by solving a vector-valued transmission problem by $hp$-finite elements and include examples to illustrate the agreement between the asymptotic formula describing the perturbed fields and the numerical predictions.","1464-3634","","10.1093/imamat/hxv015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8212883","polarization tensors;asymptotic expansions;eddy currents;hp-finite elements;metal detectors;land mine detection","","","9","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Endo",NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2015","56","suppl_1","i56","i61","In this report, we have reviewed the basic features of the accident processes and radioactivity releases that occurred in the Chernobyl accident (1986) and in the Fukushima-1 accident (2011). The Chernobyl accident was a power-surge accident that was caused by a failure of control of a fission chain reaction, which instantaneously destroyed the reactor and building, whereas the Fukushima-1 accident was a loss-of-coolant accident in which the reactor cores of three units were melted by decay heat after losing the electricity supply. Although the quantity of radioactive noble gases released from Fukushima-1 exceeded the amount released from Chernobyl, the size of land area severely contaminated by 137Cesium (137Cs) was 10 times smaller around Fukushima-1 compared with around Chernobyl. The differences in the accident process are reflected in the composition of the discharged radioactivity as well as in the composition of the ground contamination. Volatile radionuclides (such as 132Te-132I, 131I, 134Cs and 137Cs) contributed to the gamma-ray exposure from the ground contamination around Fukishima-1, whereas a greater variety of radionuclides contributed significantly around Chernobyl. When radioactivity deposition occurred, the radiation exposure rate near Chernobyl is estimated to have been 770 μGy h−1per initial 137Cs deposition of 1000 kBq m−2, whereas it was 100 μGy h−1around Fukushima-1. Estimates of the cumulative exposure for 30 years are 970 and 570 mGy per initial deposition of 1000 kBq m−2for Chernobyl and Fukusima-1, respectively. Of these exposures, 49 and 98% were contributed by radiocesiums (134Cs + 137Cs) around Chernobyl and Fukushima-1, respectively.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150109","Fukushima accident;Chernobyl accident;ground contamination;radiation exposure;137Cesium, 131Iodine","","","6","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Home energy scheduling is an important function of the HEMS, especially for thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs). Optimization interval is a basic parameter in home energy scheduling, a topic that has been seldom studied before. This paper studies the impacts of optimization interval on home energy scheduling taking into consideration four scheduling strategies for TCAs. A tracking strategy is developed to arrive at a suboptimal solution while avoiding unacceptable solving time. The impact mechanism of optimization interval is analyzed. The optimization interval takes into account the scheduling ability of HEMS, flexibility of TCAs, the feasibility of scheduling, scheduling performances, user experiences, and model accuracy. The flexibility of TCAs, which depends on optimization interval, is defined and modeled. Two time division methods are proposed, namely, consistent interval division method (CIDM) and inconsistent interval division method (IIDM). Numerical simulation is carried out to verify the analysis. The results show that optimization interval impacts the flexibility, feasibility, and performance of scheduling. The proposed tracking strategy is seen as an effective method for HEMS.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2015.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160645","HEMS;optimization interval;scheduling;TCAs","","","6","","","","24 Jul 2015","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"
"Reference Ontology for Cybersecurity Operational Information","T. Takahashi; Y.

Efficient cybersecurity operations require information exchanges that go beyond organizational borders. Various industry specifications defining information schemata for such exchanges are thus emerging. These specifications, however, define their own schemata since their objectives and the types of information they deal with differ, and desirable schemata differ depending on the purposes. They need to be organized and orchestrated so that individual organizations can fully exchange information and collaborate with one another. To establish the foundations of such orchestration and facilitate information exchanges, this paper proposes a reference ontology for cybersecurity operational information. The ontology structures cybersecurity information and orchestrates industry specifications. We built it from the standpoint of cybersecurity operations in close collaboration with cybersecurity organizations including security operation centers handling actual cybersecurity operations in the USA, Japan and South Korea. This paper demonstrates its usability by discussing the coverage of industry specifications. It then defines an extensible information structure that collaborates with such specifications by using the ontology and describes a prototype cybersecurity knowledge base we constructed that facilitates cybersecurity information exchanges among various parties. Finally, it discusses the usage scenarios of the ontology and knowledge base in cybersecurity operations. Through this work, we wish to contribute to the advancement of cybersecurity information exchanges.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxu101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8205615","cybersecurity;ontology design;information structure;knowledge model;information schema;knowledge base;information exchange","","","5","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Low-dose energetic protons induce adaptive and bystander effects that protect human cells against DNA damage caused by a subsequent exposure to energetic iron ions","M. Buonanno; S. M. De Toledo; R. W. Howell; E. I. Azzam",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2015","56","3","502","508","During interplanetary missions, astronauts are exposed to mixed types of ionizing radiation. The low ‘flux’ of the high atomic number and high energy (HZE) radiations relative to the higher ‘flux’ of low linear energy transfer (LET) protons makes it highly probable that for any given cell in the body, proton events will precede any HZE event. Whereas progress has been made in our understanding of the biological effects of low-LET protons and high-LET HZE particles, the interplay between the biochemical processes modulated by these radiations is unclear. Here we show that exposure of normal human fibroblasts to a low mean absorbed dose of 20 cGy of 0.05 or 1-GeV protons (LET ∼ 1.25 or 0.2 keV/μm, respectively) protects the irradiated cells (P < 0.0001) against chromosomal damage induced by a subsequent exposure to a mean absorbed dose of 50 cGy from 1 GeV/u iron ions (LET ∼ 151 keV/μm). Surprisingly, unirradiated (i.e. bystander) cells with which the proton-irradiated cells were co-cultured were also significantly protected from the DNA-damaging effects of the challenge dose. The mitigating effect persisted for at least 24 h. These results highlight the interactions of biological effects due to direct cellular traversal by radiation with those due to bystander effects in cell populations exposed to mixed radiation fields.

Neutrophil chemotaxis was not affected by RF-field exposure, and subsequent phagocytosis was not affected either compared with that under sham exposure conditions. These studies demonstrated an initial immune response in the human body exposed to 2.45-GHz RF fields at the SAR of 2 W/kg, which is the maximum value recommended by the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines.

Outcomes of SBRT for liver tumors unsuitable for ablation or surgical resection were evaluated.A total of 79 patients treated with SBRT for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between 2004 and 2012 in six Japanese institutions were studied retrospectively. Patients treated with SBRT preceded by trans-arterial chemoembolization were eligible. Their median age was 73 years, 76% were males, and their Child–Pugh scores were Grades A (85%) and B (11%) before SBRT. The median biologically effective dose (α/β = 10 Gy) was 96.3 Gy.The median follow-up time was 21.0 months for surviving patients. The 2-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and distant metastasis-free survival were 53%, 40% and 76%, respectively. Sex and serum PIVKA-II values were significant predictive factors for OS. Hypovascular or hypervascular types of HCC, sex and clinical stage were significant predictive factors for PFS. The 2-year PFS was 66% in Stage I vs 18% in Stages II–III. Multivariate analysis indicated that clinical stage was the only significant predictive factor for PFS. No Grade 3 laboratory toxicities in the acute, sub-acute, and chronic phases were observed.PFS after SBRT for liver tumor was satisfactory, especially for Stage I HCC, even though these patients were unsuitable for resection and ablation. SBRT is safe and might be an alternative to resection and ablation.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150161","hepatocellular carcinoma;stereotactic body radiotherapy;SBRT","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Quantitative ADF imaging, in which the ADF intensity at each pixel represents the fraction of the incident probe current, allows us to perform direct comparisons with simulations without the use of fitting parameters. Although the conventional comparison suffers from experimental uncertainties such as an amorphous surface layer and specimen thickness, in this study we eliminated such uncertainties by using a single-layer graphene as a specimen. Furthermore, to reduce image distortion and shot noises in experimental images, multiple acquisitions with drift correction were performed, and the atomic ADF contrast was quantitatively acquired. To reproduce the experimental ADF contrast, we used three distribution functions as the effective source distribution in simulations. The optimum distribution function and its full-width at half-maximum were evaluated by measuring the residuals between the experimental and simulated images. It was found that the experimental images could be explained well by a linear combination of a Gaussian function and a Lorentzian function with a longer tail than the Gaussian function.","1477-9986","","10.1093/jmicro/dfv053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8153168","STEM;ADF;quantitative analysis;graphene;image simulation;effective source distribution","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this study, we investigated the effects of fast neutron irradiation on somatic embryogenesis combined with plant regeneration in embryonic leaflet culture to develop new peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) germplasm for breeding. The dry seeds of the elite cultivar Luhua 11 were irradiated with fast neutrons at dosages of 9.7, 14.0 and 18.0 Gy. The embryonic leaflets were separated and incubated in a medium with 10.0-mg/l 2,4-D to induce somatic embryogenesis. Next, they were incubated in a medium with 4.0-mg/l BAP for plant regeneration. As the irradiation dosage increased, the frequency of both somatic embryo formation and plantlet regeneration decreased. The regenerated plantlets were grafted onto rootstocks and were transplanted into the field. Later, the mature seeds of the regenerated plants were harvested. The M 2 generation plants from most of the regenerated cultivars exhibited variations and segregation in vigor, plant height, branch and pod number, pod size, and pod shape. To determine whether the phenotypes were associated with genomic modification, we compared the DNA polymorphisms between the wild-type plants and 19 M 3 -generation individuals from different regenerated plants. We used 20 pairs of simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers and detected polymorphisms between most of the mutants and the wild-type plants (Luhua 11). Our results indicate that using a combination of fast neutron irradiation and tissue culture is an effective approach for creating new peanut germplasm.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150152","peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.);fast neutron irradiation;mutagenesis;in vitro culture;mutant","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In addition to DSBs induced by ionizing radiation, misrepair of non-DSB clustered damage contributes extra DSBs converted from DNA misrepair via pathways for base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair. This study aimed to quantify the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) when DSB induction and conversion from non-DSB clustered damage misrepair were used as biological endpoints. The results showed that both linear energy transfer (LET) and indirect action had a strong impact on the yields for DSB induction and conversion. RBE values for DSB induction and maximum DSB conversion of helium ions (LET = 120 keV/μm) to 60Co gamma rays were 3.0 and 3.2, respectively. These RBE values increased to 5.8 and 5.6 in the absence of interference of indirect action initiated by addition of 2-M dimethylsulfoxide. DSB conversion was ∼1–4% of the total non-DSB damage due to gamma rays, which was lower than the 10% estimate by experimental measurement. Five to twenty percent of total non-DSB damage due to helium ions was converted into DSBs. Hence, it may be possible to increase the yields of DSBs in cancerous cells through DNA repair pathways, ultimately enhancing cell killing.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155207","base excision repair;indirect action;relative biological effectiveness;clustered DNA damage;enzymatic DSB","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Olivine Slurry Replenishment and the Development of Igneous Layering in a Franklin Sill, Victoria Island, Arctic Canada","B. Hayes; J. H. Bédard; C. J. Lissenberg",NA; NA; NA,Journal of Petrology,"18 Jan 2018","2015","56","1","83","112","The Franklin sills and dykes on Victoria Island in the Canadian Arctic represent the sub-volcanic plumbing system to the Natkusiak flood basalts, which are associated with the late Neoproterozoic (c. 723–716 Ma) break-up of Rodinia. The Lower Pyramid Sill (LPS) is the distal end of a sill complex that may be rooted in the Uhuk Massif, a major fault-guided magmatic feeder system. The LPS is unusual for a thin (c. 21 m), shallow, tholeiitic intrusion because it displays well-developed cumulate layering similar to that seen in large layered intrusions. The LPS has an aphanitic, olivine-phyric (c. 5%) Lower Chilled Margin (LCM), a (<1 m thick) dendritic, olivine-phyric Lower Border Zone (LBZ), a (c. 7 m thick) olivine-dominated (up to c. 55%) melagabbro–feldspathic-peridotite zone (OZ), a thin (c. 1 m) clinopyroxene-rich cumulate gabbro (CPZ) containing sector-zoned euhedral clinopyroxene, a (c. 10 m thick) doleritic gabbro zone (DZ), a (<1 m thick) aphyric, dendritic Upper Border Zone (UBZ) and an aphanitic, olivine-phyric (c. 5%) Upper Chilled Margin (UCM). Distinct compositional groups recognized in olivines from the OZ can be associated with specific crystal morphologies, some showing significant reverse zoning. Melt compositions were calculated through application of the olivine–melt Fe = Mg exchange coefficient. The calculations suggest that phenocrystic and primocrystic olivine (Fo88–82) in the LCM–LBZ and lower OZ formed from melts with c. 13–10 wt % MgO. Modeling implies that reversely zoned olivine primocrysts and chadacrysts have rims in equilibrium with melts of c. 10–8 wt % MgO that were saturated only in olivine (+ minor chromite), whereas some olivine cores formed from melts as evolved as c. 6–5 wt % MgO that would have coexisted with a gabbroic assemblage. The presence of multiple olivine populations in the OZ (some reverse zoned) indicates that the LPS did not crystallize from a single pulse of melt that evolved by closed-system fractional crystallization. We propose that the reverse zoning pattern records incorporation of evolved crystals, most derived from the mushy gabbroic host, when an olivine-charged replenishment under- or intraplated the partly crystallized basaltic magma, now preserved as the DZ. The intervening CPZ may also owe its origin to the emplacement of the olivine slurry, possibly as a result of pore-scale melt mixing at this interface. The DZ shows inward differentiation trends that can be explained by in situ differentiation. The data imply that late emplacement of olivine-rich crystal slurries and in situ differentiation both played a role in the development of the layered LPS.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egu072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8181973","differentiation;Franklin;igneous layering;sill;slurry","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

When biased plate rotation is removed from the GPS velocities, errors as large as 0.8mm yr−1 are introduced; a value commonly larger than the predicted GIA signal magnitude.

Planning CT images for 30 patients with NPC treated with definitive IMRT were retrospectively reviewed. Target volumes, the BP and other critical structures were delineated; two separate IMRT plans were designed for each patient: one set no restrictions for the BP; the other considered the BP as a critical structure for which a maximum dose limit of ≤66 Gy was set. No significant differences between the two plans were observed in the conformity index, homogeneity index, maximum dose to the planning target volumes (PTVs), minimum dose to the PTVs, percentages of the volume of the PTVnx and PTVnd receiving more than 110% of the prescribed dose, or percentages of the volume of the PTVs receiving 95% and > 93% of the prescribed dose. Dose constraints significantly reduced the maximum dose, mean dose, V45, V50, V54, V60, V66 and V70 to the BP. Dose constraints significantly reduced the maximum dose to the BP, V45, V60 and V66 in both N0–1 and N2–3 disease; however, the magnitude of the dosimetric gain for each parameter between N0–1 and N2–3 disease was not significantly different, except for the V60 and V66.

Neutrons are generated by the [γ,n] reactions with a high-Z target material. The equivalent neutron dose and gamma dose from activation products have been estimated in a LINAC equipped with a 15-MV photon beam. A Monte Carlo simulation code was employed for neutron and photon dosimetry due to mixed beam. The neutron dose was also experimentally measured using the Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) under various conditions to compare with the simulation. The activation products were measured by gamma spectrometer system. The average neutron energy was calculated to be 0.25 MeV. The equivalent neutron dose at the isocenter obtained from OSL measurement and MC calculation was 5.39 and 3.44 mSv/Gy, respectively. A gamma dose rate of 4.14 µSv/h was observed as a result of activations by neutron inside the treatment machine. The gamma spectrum analysis showed 28Al, 24Na, 54Mn and 60Co. The results confirm that neutrons and gamma rays are generated, and gamma rays remain inside the treatment room after the termination of X-ray irradiation. The source of neutrons is the product of the [γ,n] reactions in the machine head, whereas gamma rays are produced from the [n,γ] reactions (i.e. neutron activation) with materials inside the treatment room. The most activated nuclide is 28Al, which has a half life of 2.245 min. In practice, it is recommended that staff should wait for a few minutes (several 28Al half-lives) before entering the treatment room after the treatment finishes to minimize the dose received.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155356","equivalent neutron dose;activation products;Monte Carlo simulation;OSL","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Parameter uncertainties in such inversions are essential for estimating solution robustness, but are rarely available. We have developed a non-linear moment tensor inversion method in a probabilistic Bayesian framework that also accounts for noise in the data. The method is designed for point source inversion using waveform data of moderate-size earthquakes and explosions at regional distances. This probabilistic approach results in an ensemble of models, whose density is proportional to parameter probability distribution and quantifies parameter uncertainties. Furthermore, we invert for noise in the data, allowing it to determine the model complexity. We implement an empirical noise covariance matrix that accounts for interdependence of observational errors present in waveform data. After we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on synthetic data, we apply it to a Long Valley Caldera, CA, earthquake with a well-documented anomalous (non-double-couple) radiation from previous studies.

There are several reports on the characteristics of these units for small field irradiations. However, there is limited knowledge about use of these units for large fields, which are essential for emerging large-field irregular shape irradiations, namely total marrow irradiation used as a conditioning regimen for hematological malignancies. This work describes characterization of a self-contained Orthovoltage biological irradiator for large fields using measurements and Monte Carlo simulations that could be used to compute the dose for in vivo or in vitro studies for large-field irradiation using this or a similar unit. Percentage depth dose, profiles, scatter factors, and half-value layers were measured and analyzed. A Monte Carlo model of the unit was created and used to generate depth dose and profiles, as well as scatter factors. An ion chamber array was also used for profile measurements of flatness and symmetry. The output was determined according to AAPM Task Group 61 guidelines. The depth dose measurements compare well with published data for similar beams. The Monte Carlo–generated depth dose and profiles match our measured doses to within 2%. Scatter factor measurements indicate gradual variation of these factors with field size. Dose rate measured by placing the ion chamber atop the unit's steel plate or solid water indicate enhanced readings of 5 to 28% compared with those measured in air. The stability of output over a 5-year period is within 2% of the 5-year average.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150160","orthovoltage;dosimetry;Monte Carlo;biological irradiator","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We analyzed 129 patients with localized prostate cancer who were managed from 2002 to 2010 at our institution. They were treated with 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT, 70 Gy/35 fractions, 55 patients) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT, 76 Gy/38 fractions, 74 patients). All radiation treatment plans were retrospectively reconstructed, dose–volume histograms of the rectum were generated, and the doses delivered to the rectum were calculated. Time to rectal bleeding ranged from 9–53 months, with a median of 18.7 months. Of the 129 patients, 33 patients had Grade 1 bleeding and were treated with steroid suppositories, while 25 patients with Grade 2 bleeding received argon plasma laser coagulation therapy (APC). Three patients with Grade 3 bleeding required both APC and blood transfusion. The 5-year incidence rate of Grade 2 or 3 rectal bleeding was 21.8% for the 3D-CRT group and 21.6% for the IMRT group. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in the average values from V65 to V10 between Grades 0–1 and Grades 2–3. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients with V65 ≥ 17% had a significantly increased risk (P= 0.032) of Grade 2 or 3 rectal bleeding. Of the 28 patients of Grade 2 or 3 rectal bleeding, 17 patients (60.7%) were cured by a single session of APC, while the other 11 patients required two sessions. Thus, none of the patients had any further rectal bleeding after the second APC session.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8172527","prostate cancer;3D-CRT;IMRT;late rectal toxicity;DVH analysis","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The vector field is decomposed as the sum of elementary divergence-free vector fields (EDFVFs), each of them corresponding to a basis function. The theory is a generalization of the monomial basis approach introduced in Xue & Zanna (2013, BIT Numer. Math., 53, 265–281) and has the trigonometric splitting of Quispel & McLaren (2003, J. Comp.

We introduce the concept of diagonalizable EDFVFs and identify the solvable ones as those corresponding to the monomial basis and the exponential basis. In addition to giving a unifying view of some types of volume-preserving splitting methods already known in the literature, the present approach allows us to give a closed-form solution also to other types of vector fields that could not be treated before, namely those corresponding to the mixed tensor product of monomial and exponential (including trigonometric) basis functions.","1464-3642","","10.1093/imanum/drt070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8172173","geometric integration;volume preservation;splitting methods;elementary divergence-free vector fields","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Uncertainties on the relevant parameters are systematically taken into account in order to produce a more robust constraint, using a new approach. Surprisingly, we find that the distribution of the magnetic inclination angle (α) in this subset of pulsars peaks at low values, contrary to the predictions of γ-ray models. We find a lack of correlation between these and a set of α values which were derived using γ-ray light curves, suggesting a problem in the interpretation of the data in one or both of these domains.

Our study evaluated the effect of age on the radiosensitivity of rat thyroid glands. Four-week-old (4W), 7 -week-old (7W), and 8-month-old (8M) male Wistar rats were exposed to 8 Gy of whole-body X-ray irradiation. Thyroids were removed 3–72 h after irradiation, and non-irradiated thyroids served as controls. Ki67-positivity and p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) focus formation (a DNA damage response) were evaluated via immunohistochemistry. Amounts of proteins involved in DNA damage response (p53, p53 phosphorylated at serine 15, p21), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), and autophagy (LC3, p62) were determined via western blotting. mRNA levels of 84 key autophagy-related genes were quantified using polymerase chain reaction arrays. Ki67-positive cells in 4W (with high proliferative activity) and 7W thyroids significantly decreased in number post-irradiation. The number of 53BP1 foci and amount of p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 increased 3 h after irradiation, regardless of age. No increase in apoptosis or in the levels of p53, p21 or cleaved caspase-3 was detected for any ages. Levels of LC3-II and p62 increased in irradiated 4W but not 8M thyroids, whereas expression of several autophagy-related genes was higher in 4W than 8M irradiated thyroids. Irradiation increased the expression of genes encoding pro-apoptotic proteins in both 4W and 8M thyroids. In summary, no apoptosis or p53 accumulation was noted, despite the expression of some pro-apoptotic genes in immature and adult thyroids. Irradiation induced autophagy in immature, but not in adult, rat thyroids.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150164","rat;thyroid;X-ray;p53 binding protein 1;apoptosis;autophagy","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A total of 35 patients having NSCLC treated with PBT were enrolled in this analysis. The numbers of TNM stage and lymph node status were IIB (n= 3), IIIA (n= 15) and IIIB (n= 17), and N0 (n= 2), N1 (n= 4), N2 (n= 17) and N3 (n= 12), respectively. Plans for XCRT were simulated based on the same CT, and the same clinical target volume (CTV) was used based on the actual PBT plan. The treatment dose was 74 Gy-equivalent dose (GyE) for the primary site and 66 GyE for positive lymph nodes. The parameters were then calculated according to the normal lung dose, and the irradiation volumes of the doses (Vx) were compared. We also evaluated the feasibility of both plans according to criteria: V5 ≥ 42%, V20 ≥ 25%, mean lung dose ≥ 20 Gy. The mean normal lung dose and V5 to V50 were significantly lower in PBT than in XCRT. The differences were greater with the more advanced nodal status and with the larger CTV. Furthermore, 45.7% of the X-ray plans were classified as inadequate according to the criteria, whereas 17.1% of the proton plans were considered unsuitable. The number of inadequate X-ray plans increased in cases with advanced nodal stage.

"The effect of topography of upper-mantle discontinuities on SS precursors","M. Koroni; J. Trampert",NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2015","204","1","667","681","Using the spectral-element method, we explored the effect of topography of upper-mantle discontinuities on the traveltimes of SS precursors recorded on transverse component seismograms. The latter are routinely used to infer the topography of mantle transition zone discontinuities. The step from precursory traveltimes to topographic changes is mainly done using linearised ray theory, or sometimes using finite-frequency kernels. We simulated exact seismograms in 1-D and 3-D elastic models of the mantle. In a second simulation, we added topography to the discontinuities. We compared the waveforms obtained with and without topography by cross correlation of the SS precursors. Since we did not add noise, the precursors are visible in individual seismograms without the need of stacking. The resulting time anomalies were then converted into topographic variations and compared to the original topographic models. Based on the correlation between initial and inferred models, and provided that ray coverage is good, we found that linearised ray theory gives a relatively good idea on the location of the uplifts and depressions of the discontinuities. It seriously underestimates the amplitude of the topographic variations by a factor ranging between 2 and 7. Real data depend on the 3-D elastic structure and the topography. All studies to date correct for the 3-D elastic effects assuming that the traveltimes can be linearly decomposed into a structure and a discontinuity part. We found a strong non-linearity in this decomposition which cannot be modelled without a fully non-linear inversion for elastic structure and discontinuities simultaneously.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggv471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146988","Body waves;Computational seismology;Wave propagation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Plagioclase Growth Rates Control Three-grain Junction Geometry in Dolerites and Gabbros","M. B. Holness",NA,Journal of Petrology,"18 Jan 2018","2015","56","11","2117","2144","Measurements of dihedral angles at three-grain junctions in gabbros, involving two grains of plagioclase and one grain of another mineral, demonstrate that the median dihedral angle is generally the same for all minerals in any sample. The few exceptions to this can be attributed to reaction or to the cessation of growth of plagioclase during the last stages of solidification of highly evolved liquids that do not crystallize volumetrically important amounts of plagioclase. The dihedral angle is therefore primarily controlled by the growth behavior of plagioclase in the last remaining liquid. The final value of the dihedral angle is controlled by the extent to which plagioclase growth is accommodated on the (010) faces: low angles form when growth on the (010) faces is minor compared with that on the other growth faces, and high angles form when the (010) faces accommodate significant growth. The response of dihedral angles to changes in crystallization time is therefore explained by the changing response of plagioclase growth to cooling rate, with limited growth on (010) faces during rapid cooling (leading to a low dihedral angle) and more significant growth at slow cooling (leading to high dihedral angle). The correspondence between dihedral angle and plagioclase grain shape (as quantified by the average apparent aspect ratio observed in thin section) is clearly evident for non-fractionated bodies such as dolerite sills. Although the stratigraphic variation of the overall plagioclase grain shape in the floor cumulates of the Skaergaard Intrusion is broadly similar to that observed in sills, there is no correspondence to observed augite—plagioclase—plagioclase dihedral angles, which show a step-wise stratigraphic variation, corresponding to changes in the liquidus assemblage. This decoupling occurs because plagioclase growth in layered intrusions occurs in two stages, the first at, or close to, the magma—mush interface and the second within the mush. Chemical maps of samples on either side of the augite-in dihedral angle step demonstrate a step-wise change in the aspect ratio of the plagioclase grown during the second stage, with the aspect ratio of this stage corresponding to that predicted from the dihedral angles. Plagioclase shape in layered intrusions thus records two separate thermal regimes, with the overall shape controlled by the global cooling rate of the intrusion, and the second (minor) stage within the mushy layer reflecting local thermal buffering controlled by the liquidus assemblage of the bulk magma. Dihedral angles in layered intrusions record the second thermal regime.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egv065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227170","microstructure;plagioclase;dihedral angle;gabbro;dolerite;Skaergaard Intrusion;Bushveld Intrusion;Sept Iles Intrusion;Rum Intrusion","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

All groups, except the control group, were exposed to a 5 Gy 60Co γ-ray beam. Blood parameters [including white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and platelet counts and hemoglobin level] were assessed three days before irradiation, and the on the 3rd, 7th and 14th days after irradiation. Spleen, thymus and testicular indices, DNA contents of bone marrow cells, bone marrow nucleated cells, sperm counts, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), testosterone and estradiol levels in the serum were assessed on the 14th day after irradiation. The combined administration of SNP, WR-2721, rhIL-11 and rhG-CSF exerted synergistic recovery effects on peripheral blood WBC, RBC and platelet counts and hemoglobin levels in irradiated mice, and synergistic promotion effects on spleen, thymus, testicle, bone marrow nucleated cells and sperm counts in irradiated mice. The synergistic administration increased the serum SOD activities and serum testosterone content of irradiated mice, but synergy decreased the content of serum MDA and estradiol in irradiated mice. These results suggest that the combined administration of SNP, WR-2721, rhIL-11 and rhG-CSF should increase the efficacy of these drugs for acute radiation sickness, protect immunity, hematopoiesis and the reproductive organs of irradiated-damaged mice, and improve oxidation resistance in the body.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150170","Sipunculus nudus L. polysaccharide;radioprotection;WR-2721;rhG-CSF;rhIL-11;combination administration","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Subjects included 72 patients with early breast cancer who underwent SPECT/CT of the SLNs and received whole-breast irradiation with tangential fields after partial mastectomy. The SLN locations evaluated by using SPECT/CT images were entered into the treatment-planning CT image with a 5-mm-diameter sphere. A 15-mm-diameter sphere including the 5-mm treatment margin around the SLNs was defined as PTV-SLN. The PTV-SLN doses with tangential irradiation were evaluated and expressed as the percentage of the prescribed dose. In 69 patients, SLNs were detected by using SPECT/CT; 68 SLNs were located at axillary lymph node Level I, and one was located at Level II. A total of 62 SLNs (90%) were determined to be located inside the tangential fields on the digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) images. The median doses of SLN center, mean PTV-SLN dose, and PTV-SLN D95 (the minimum dose delivered to 95% of the volume) were 94.1% (range, 15.3–101.9%), 93.7% (range, 29.3–104.0%) and 84.8% (range, 6.8–99.8%). The D95 for the SLNs with treatment margins were ≤90% of the prescribed doses in more than half of the cases.

Date",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2015","56","1","90","99","We have investigated the dose rate effects on cell damage caused by photon-beam irradiation. During a relatively long dose-delivery time with a low dose rate, lesions created in cells may undergo some reactions, such as DNA repair. In order to investigate these reactions quantitatively, we adopted the microdosimetric–kinetic (MK) model and deduced a cell surviving fraction (SF) formula for continuous irradiation. This model enabled us to estimate the SF from dose and dose rate. The parameters in the MK model were determined so as to generate the SF, and we attempted to evaluate the dose rate effects on the SF. To deduce the cell-specific parameters in the SF formula, including the dose rate, we performed a split-dose experiment and a single-dose experiment with a constant dose-delivery time (10 min) (to retain the condition for equivalent behavior of cell lesions) by means of a clonogenic assay. Then, using the MK model parameters, the SFs were reproduced for a variety of dose rates (1.0, 0.31, 0.18, 0.025 and 0.0031 Gy/min) and were compared with reported experimental data. The SF curves predicted by the MK model agreed well with the experimental data, suggesting that the dose rate effects appear in the kinetics of cell lesions during the dose-delivery time. From fitting the analysis of the model formula to the experimental data, it was shown that the MK model could illustrate the characteristics of log-SF in a rectilinear form at a high dose range with a relatively low dose rate.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8172535","microdosimetric–kinetic model;continuous irradiation;dose rate effects;linearity of high dose region","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

First, we compared the LPE, HT and VMAT plans, with all plans including a 1-cm bolus. We also compared HT plans with and without the bolus. The conformity indices for LPE, HT and VMAT were 1.73, 1.35 and 1.49, respectively. The HT plan showed the best conformity and the LPE plan showed the worst. However, the plans had similar homogeneity indexes. The dose to the hippocampus was the highest in the VMAT plan, with a mean of 6.7 Gy, compared with 3.5 Gy in the LPE plan and 4.8 Gy in the HT plan. The doses to the optical structures were all within the clinically acceptable range. The beam-on time and monitor units were highest in the HT plan. The HT plans with and without a bolus showed similar target coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The HT plan showed the best target coverage and conformity, with low doses to the brain and hippocampus. This plan also had the advantage of not necessarily requiring a bolus.

The study examined five human cancer cell lines: TE2, KYSE70, A549, NCI-H460 and WiDr. The proportion of cells surviving X- or carbon-ion beam irradiation was assessed in a clonogenic assay. The D 10 , the dose at which 10% of cells survive, was calculated using a linear–quadratic model. HMGB1 levels in the culture supernatants were assessed by an ELISA. The D 10 dose for X-rays in TE2, KYSE70, A549, NCI-H460 and WiDr cells was 2.1, 6.7, 8.0, 4.8 and 7.1 Gy, respectively, whereas that for carbon-ion beams was 0.9, 2.5, 2.7, 1.8 and 3.5 Gy, respectively. X-rays and carbon-ion beams significantly increased HMGB1 levels in the culture supernatants of A549, NCI-H460 and WiDr cells at 72 h post-irradiation with a D 10 dose. Furthermore, irradiation with X-rays or carbon-ion beams significantly increased HMGB1 levels in the culture supernatants of all five cell lines at 96 h post-irradiation. There was no significant difference in the amount of HMGB1 induced by X-rays and carbon-ion beams at any time-point (except at 96 h for NCI-H460 cells); thus we conclude that comparable levels of HMGB1 were detected after irradiation with iso-survival doses of X-rays and carbon-ion beams.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150168","HMGB1;carbon-ion beams;anti-tumor immunity;damage-associated molecular pattern","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To evaluate normal skin reactions, the thighs of C3H/HeN mice were exposed to 100 and 200 Gy MPBs in comparison with broad beams (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 Gy). Antitumor effects of MPBs were evaluated in C3H/HeN mice with subcutaneous tumors (SCCVII). After the tumors were irradiated with 100 and 200 Gy MPBs and 20 and 30 Gy broad beams, the tumor sizes were measured and survival analyses were performed. In addition, the tumors were excised and immunohistochemically examined to detect γ-H2AX, ki67 and CD34. It was shown that antitumor effects of 200 Gy MPBs at 50/200 μm and 100/400 μm were significantly greater than those of 20 Gy broad beams, and were comparable with 30 Gy broad beams. γ-H2AX-positive cells demonstrated clear stripe-patterns after MPB irradiation; the pattern gradually faded and intermixed over 24 h. The chronological changes in ki67 positivity did not differ between MPBs and broad beams, whereas the CD34-positive area decreased significantly more in MPBs than in broad beams. In addition, it was shown that skin injury after MPB irradiation was significantly milder when compared with broad-beam irradiation at equivalent doses for achieving the same tumor control effect. Bystander effect and tumor vessel injury may be the mechanism contributing to the efficacy of MPBs.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150243","micro-planar beams;antitumor effects;skin reaction;bystander effect","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We previously established a method for evaluating Lgr5+stem cells by tamoxifen-dependent Lgr5-lineage tracing and showed that high-dose-rate radiation stimulated replenishment of colonic stem cells. In this study, we evaluated the effects of low-dose-rate radiation on stem cell maintenance. Tamoxifen (4OHT)-injected Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2× ROSA-LSL-LacZmice were used, LacZ-labeled colonic crypts were enumerated, and the loss of LacZ+crypts under low-dose-rate radiation was estimated. After 4OHT treatment, the number of LacZ-labeled Lgr5+stem cells was higher in the colon of infant mice than in adult mice. The percentage of LacZ-labeled crypts in infant mice rapidly decreased after 4OHT treatment. However, the percentage of labeled crypts plateaued at ∼2% at 4 weeks post-treatment and remained unchanged for up to 7 months. Thus, it will be advantageous to evaluate the long-term effects of low-dose-rate radiation. Next, we determined the percentages of LacZ-labeled crypts irradiated with 1 Gy administered at different dose rates. As reported in our previous study, mice exposed to high-dose-rate radiation (30 Gy/h) showed a marked replenishment (P= 0.04). However, mice exposed to low-dose-rate radiation (0.003 Gy/h) did not exhibit accelerated stem-cell replenishment (P= 0.47). These findings suggest the percentage of labeled crypts can serve as a useful indicator of the effects of dose rate on the stem cell pool.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155195","dose-rate effects;tissue stem cell;Lgr5;low-dose rate","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"The impact of approximations and arbitrary choices on geophysical images","A. P. Valentine; J. Trampert",NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2015","204","1","59","73","Whenever a geophysical image is to be constructed, a variety of choices must be made. Some, such as those governing data selection and processing, or model parametrization, are somewhat arbitrary: there may be little reason to prefer one choice over another. Others, such as defining the theoretical framework within which the data are to be explained, may be more straightforward: typically, an ‘exact’ theory exists, but various approximations may need to be adopted in order to make the imaging problem computationally tractable. Differences between any two images of the same system can be explained in terms of differences between these choices. Understanding the impact of each particular decision is essential if images are to be interpreted properly—but little progress has been made towards a quantitative treatment of this effect. In this paper, we consider a general linearized inverse problem, applicable to a wide range of imaging situations. We write down an expression for the difference between two images produced using similar inversion strategies, but where different choices have been made. This provides a framework within which inversion algorithms may be analysed, and allows us to consider how image effects may arise. In this paper, we take a general view, and do not specialize our discussion to any specific imaging problem or setup (beyond the restrictions implied by the use of linearized inversion techniques). In particular, we look at the concept of ‘hybrid inversion’, in which highly accurate synthetic data (typically the result of an expensive numerical simulation) is combined with an inverse operator constructed based on theoretical approximations. It is generally supposed that this offers the benefits of using the more complete theory, without the full computational costs. We argue that the inverse operator is as important as the forward calculation in determining the accuracy of results. We illustrate this using a simple example, based on imaging the density structure of a vibrating string.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggv440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146963","Inverse theory;Numerical approximations and analysis;Tomography","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It has been demonstrated that cancer cells cultured in 3D matrices are more radio-resistant compared with cells in monolayers. However, the mechanisms causing this difference remain unclear. Here we show that cancer cells cultured in a 3D microenvironment demonstrated an increase in cells with stem cell properties. This was confirmed by the finding that cells in 3D cultures upregulated the gene and protein expression of the stem cell reprogramming factors such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, LIN28 and miR-302a, compared with cells in monolayers. Moreover, the expression of β-catenin, a regulating molecule of reprogramming factors, also increased in 3D-grown cancer cells. These findings suggest that cancer cells were reprogrammed to become stem cell–like cancer cells in a 3D growth culture microenvironment. Since cancer stem cell–like cells demonstrate an increased radio-resistance and chemo-resistance, our results offer a new perspective as to why. Our findings shed new light on understanding the features of the 3D growth cell model and its application in basic research into clinical radiotherapy and medicine.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155200","3D growth microenvironment;matrigel;reprogramming;β-catenin;radio-resistance","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Additionally, transgenerational or heritable effects of radiation exposure are also important public concerns because these effects could cause long-term changes in animal and human populations. Here, we concisely review our findings and implications related to the ingestional and transgenerational effects of radiation exposure on the pale grass blue butterfly, Zizeeria maha, which coexists with humans. The butterfly larval ingestion of contaminated leaves found in areas of human habitation, even at low doses, resulted in morphological abnormalities and death for some individuals, whereas other individuals were not affected, at least morphologically. This variable sensitivity serves as a basis for the adaptive evolution of radiation resistance. The distribution of abnormality and mortality rates from low to high doses fits well with a Weibull function model or a power function model. The offspring generated by morphologically normal individuals that consumed contaminated leaves exhibited high mortality rates when fed contaminated leaves; importantly, low mortality rates were restored when they were fed non-contaminated leaves. Our field monitoring over 3 years (2011–2013) indicated that abnormality and mortality rates peaked primarily in the fall of 2011 and decreased afterwards to normal levels. These findings indicate high impacts of early exposure and transgenerationally accumulated radiation effects over a specific period; however, the population regained normality relatively quickly after ∼15 generations within 3 years.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150106","pale grass blue butterfly;Fukushima nuclear accident;transgenerational effect;internal exposure;ingestional effect;natural selection;radiation resistance;radiation sensitivity;adaptive evolution","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Therefore, I investigated the health condition of the carp in order to elucidate the effects of radiation.Blood neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte counts in the carp from three ponds in Fukushima were lower than those in carp from a non-polluted pond in Tochigi Prefecture. Histological observations indicated abnormal hyperplasia of macrophages in the spleen, kidney, liver and pancreas of carp in Fukushima. Although there are likely to have been deleterious effects on carp health due to the radiation in Fukushima, this has not yet been confirmed because only one control pond was available for comparison, and I was not able to find any symptoms in the carp that correlated with internal cesium concentration. Further research is now being conducted to investigate the effects of radiation on carp.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150110","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The CD34+cells were X-ray–irradiated (up to 2 Gy) and were cultured for 0–48 h under cytokine-free conditions. At various time-points, the CD34+cells were investigated for survival, clonogenic potential and the generation of mitochondrial superoxide. At 12 h after X-ray irradiation, the number of viable cells had decreased to ∼70–80% compared with the 0-h non-irradiated control, whereas the clonogenic potential in the X-ray–irradiated cells had decreased to ∼50%–60% compared with the 0-h non-irradiated control. Furthermore, significant generation of mitochondrial superoxide was observed at 6 h, and reached a maximum value between 12 and 24 h after X-ray irradiation. However, no significant differences were observed between non-irradiated and X-ray–irradiated cells in terms of the generation of reactive oxygen species or in the intracellular mitochondrial contents. In addition, a cDNA microarray analysis showed that the majority of the altered genes in the CD34+cells at 6 h after X-ray irradiation were apoptosis-related genes. These results suggest the possibility that the elimination of the clonogenic potentials of CD34+cells involves the generation of mitochondrial superoxide induced by ionizing radiation.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155206","CD34+cells;radiation;clonogenic potential;superoxide","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The aim of this study was to clarify pertinence of translocation analysis to an industrial set-up where chronic exposure was commonly expected. To be a useful tool for a retrospective biodosimetry, the aberrations need to be persistent for a decade or longer. Therefore we calculated the decline rates and half-lives of frequency for both a reciprocal translocation and a dicentric chromosome and compared them. In this study, while the frequency of reciprocal translocations was maintained at the initial level, dicentric chromosomes were decreased to 46.9% (31.0–76.5) of the initial frequency over the follow-up period.

This study aims to examine whether MSC-derived bioactive components are protective against radiation-induced liver injury in rats. MSC-conditioned medium (MSC-CM) was generated from rat bone marrow–derived MSCs. The effect of MSC-CM on the viability of irradiated SECs was examined by flow cytometric analysis. Activation of the Akt and ERK pathways was analyzed by western blot. MSC-CM was also delivered to Sprague–Dawley rats immediately before receiving liver irradiation, followed by testing for pathological features, changes in serum hyaluronic acid, ALT, and inflammatory cytokine levels, and liver cell apoptosis. MSC-CM enhanced the viability of irradiated SECs in vitroand induced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Infusion of MSC-CM immediately before liver irradiation provided a significant anti-apoptotic effect on SECs and improved the histopathological features of injury in the irradiated liver. MSC-CM also reduced the secretion and expression of inflammatory cytokines and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

The profile of the diamond detector was very similar to those of the EDGE and SFD detectors, although the Semiflex and PinPoint chambers showed volume-averaging effects in the penumbrae region. The temperature dependency was within 0.7% in the range of 4–41°C. A dose of 900 cGy and 1200 cGy was needed to stabilize the chamber to the level within 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively.

The influence of ionizing radiation on the regulation of ROS production is considered as an important factor in the long-term effects of irradiation (such as genomic instability) that might contribute to the development of secondary cancers. In view of the increasing application of carbon ions in radiation therapy, we aimed to study the potential impact of ionizing density on the intracellular production of ROS, comparing photons (X-rays) with carbon ions. For this purpose, we used normal human cells as a model for irradiated tissue surrounding a tumor. By quantifying the oxidization of Dihydroethidium (DHE), a fluorescent probe sensitive to superoxide anions, we assessed the intracellular ROS status after radiation exposure in normal human fibroblasts, which do not show radiation-induced chromosomal instability. After 3–5 days post exposure to X-rays and carbon ions, the level of ROS increased to a maximum that was dose dependent. The maximum ROS level reached after irradiation was specific for the fibroblast type. However, carbon ions induced this maximum level at a lower dose compared with X-rays. Within ∼1 week, ROS decreased to control levels. The time-course of decreasing ROS coincides with an increase in cell number and decreasing p21 protein levels, indicating a release from radiation-induced growth arrest. Interestingly, radiation did not act as a trigger for chronically enhanced levels of ROS months after radiation exposure.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8172530","oxidative stress;high-LET;fibroblasts;reactive oxygen species;growth arrest;genomic instability","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"A Simple Thermodynamic Model for Melting of Peridotite in the System NCFMASOCr","E. S. Jennings; T. J. B. Holland",NA; NA,Journal of Petrology,"18 Jan 2018","2015","56","5","869","892","A new thermodynamic model is presented for calculating phase relations in peridotite, from 0·001 to 60 kbar and from 800°C to liquidus temperatures, in the system NCFMASOCr. This model system is large enough to simulate phase relations and melting of natural peridotite and basaltic liquids. Calculations in the program thermocalc illustrate mantle phase relationships and melting conditions, specifically for the peridotite composition KLB-1. The garnet–spinel transition zone intersects the solidus at 21·4–21·7 kbar, where both Fe3+ and Cr increase spinel stability, expanding the width of the transition. Orthopyroxene is lost at the solidus at 42 kbar in KLB-1, although this pressure is very sensitive to bulk composition. Calculated oxidation states are in excellent agreement with measured log fO2 for xenolith suites with mantle Fe2O3 contents in the range 0·1–0·3 wt %. It appears that mantle oxidation state is not just a simple function of P and T, but depends on phase assemblage, and may vary in a complex way within a single assemblage. The liquid model performs well, such that calculated solidus, melt productivity and liquid compositions compare favourably with those of experimental studies, permitting its use in interpolating between, and extrapolating from, experimental P–T conditions. Experimentally challenging but geologically useful regimes can be explored, such as subsolidus samples and very low melt fractions, with application to both mantle xenoliths and the origin of basalt.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egv020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8181982","basalt;mantle;partial melting;peridotite;thermodynamics","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For that purpose, we investigated miRNome and mRNA expression in the ced-1 Caenorhabditis elegansmutant vs the wild-type, both of which underwent spaceflight, spaceflight 1g-centrifuge control and ground control conditions during the Shenzhou-8 mission. Results showed that no morphological changes in the worms were detected, but differential miRNA expression increased from 43 (ground control condition) to 57 and 91 in spaceflight and spaceflight control conditions, respectively. Microgravity altered miRNA expression profiling by decreasing the number and significance of differentially expressed miRNA compared with 1 g incubation during spaceflight. Alterations in the miRNAs were involved in alterations in apoptosis, neurogenesis larval development, ATP metabolism and GTPase-mediated signal transduction. Among these, 17 altered miRNAs potentially involved in apoptosis were screened and showed obviously different expression signatures between space conditions. By integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA, miR-797 and miR-81 may be involved in apoptosis by targeting the genes ced-10and both drp-1and hsp-1,respectively. Compared with ground condition, space conditions regulated apoptosis though a different manner on transcription, by altering expression of seven core apoptotic genes in spaceflight condition, and eight in spaceflight control condition.

Registration of anatomical structures between the site of beam entrance on the patient surface and the distal target position is particularly important. Here, to improve patient positional accuracy during set-up for particle beam treatment, we propose a new visualization methodology using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), overlaid DRRs, and evaluation of overlaid DRR images in clinical cases. The overlaid method overlays two DRR images in different colors by dividing the CT image into two CT sections at the distal edge of the target along the treatment beam direction. Since our hospital uses fixed beam ports, the treatment beam angles for this study were set at 0 and 90 degrees. The DRR calculation direction was from the X-ray tube to the imaging device, and set to 180/270 degrees and 135/225 degrees, based on the installation of our X-ray imaging system. Original and overlaid DRRs were calculated using CT data for two patients, one with a parotid gland tumor and the other with prostate cancer. The original and overlaid DRR images were compared. Since the overlaid DRR image was completely separated into two regions when the DRR calculation angle was the same as the treatment beam angle, the overlaid DRR visualization technique was able to provide rich information for aiding recognition of the relationship between anatomical structures and the target position. This method will also be useful in patient set-up procedures for fixed irradiation ports.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150163","charged particle beam;positional accuracy;setup;image processing","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The aim of this study was to identify serum biomarkers of RIAISs in cervical cancer patients by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). Serum samples were collected from 66 cervical cancer patients prior to pelvic radiotherapy. In our study, RIAISs occurred in 11 patients. An additional 11 patients without RIAISs were selected as controls, whose age, stage, histological type and treatment methods were matched to RIAISs patients. The 22 sera were subsequently analyzed by SELDI-TOF MS, and the resulting protein profiles were evaluated to identify biomarkers using appropriate bioinformatics tools. Comparing the protein profiles of serum samples from the RIAIS group and the control group, it was found that 22 protein peaks were significantly different (P< 0.05), and six of these peaks with mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios of 7514.9, 4603.94, 6887.41, 2769.21, 3839.72 and 4215.7 were successfully identified. A decision tree model of biomarkers was constructed based on three biomarkers (m/z 1270.88, 1503.23 and 7514.90), which separated RIAIS-affected patients from the control group with an accuracy of 81%.

Retrospective analysis was performed on 20 cervical cancer patients who received WPRT in our center between January 2011 and January 2014. SaS-IMRT and HT treatment plans were generated for each patient. The dosimetric values for target coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing were compared according to the criteria of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements 83 (ICRU 83) guidelines. Differences in beam-on time (BOT) were also compared. All the PTV dosimetric parameters (D5%, D50% and D95%) for the HT plan were (statistically significantly) of better quality than those for the SaS-IMRT plan (P-value < 0.001 in all respects). HT was also significantly more accurate than SaS-IMRT with respect to the D98% and Dmean of the CTV (P-values of 0.008 and <0.001, respectively). The median Conformity Index (CI) did not differ between the two plans (P-value = 0.057). However, the Uniformity Index for HT was significantly better than that for SaS-IMRT (P-value < 0.001). The median of D50% for the bladder, rectum and small bowel were significantly lower in HT planning than SaS-IMRT (P-value < 0.001). For D2%, we found that HT provided better sparing to the rectum and bladder (P-value < 0.001). However, the median of D2% for the small bowel was comparable for both plans. The median of Dmax of the head of the left femur was significantly lower in the HT plan, but this did not apply for the head of the right femur. BOT for HT was significantly shorter than for SaS-IMRT (P-value < 0.001). HT provided highly accurate plans, with more homogeneous PTV coverage and superior sparing of OARs than SaS-IMRT.

This paper reports on a single institution patient cohort of operated rectal cancer patients after SCPRT, evaluated for chronic adverse effects, local control, progression-free survival and overall survival. Altogether, 257 patients were treated with SCPRT and surgery including total mesorectal excision (92% total mesorectal excision = TME) between 2002 and 2009. Local control and survival were analyzed. Chronic adverse effects for 154 patients without local relapse were evaluated according to the NCI–CTCAE version 4.0 classification, with a median follow-up of 48 months. We found a 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of 71%. The 5-year estimated local control (LC) rate was 94%. A positive resection margin was found in 4% of the patients and was significantly correlated with decreased DFS, OS and LC. Chronic adverse effects were reported by 58% of the patients, of which 10% were Grade 3 toxicities. The most frequent Grade 2 toxicity was stool incontinence (13%). Sexual dysfunction was found in 36% of the patients (31% Grade 1 or 2, and only 5% Grade 3). SCPRT combined with TME produced excellent LC rates together with a low rate of high-grade chronic adverse effects.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8172534","rectal cancer;short-course radiotherapy;radiation toxicity; local control; sexual dysfunction","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Caudal epidural anesthesia for 34 cervical cancer patients was performed during HDR intracavitary brachytherapy between October 2011 and August 2013. We used the patients' self-reported Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score at the first session of HDR intracavitary brachytherapy as a subjective evaluation of pain. We compared NRS scores of the patients with anesthesia with those of 30 patients who underwent HDR intracavitary brachytherapy without sacral epidural anesthesia at our hospital between May 2010 and August 2011. Caudal epidural anesthesia succeeded in 33 patients (97%), and the NRS score was recorded in 30 patients. The mean NRS score of the anesthesia group was 5.17 ± 2.97, significantly lower than that of the control group's 6.80 ± 2.59 (P = 0.035). The caudal epidural block resulted in no side-effects.

The volatile emissions associated with these eruptions have been linked to the environmental change yet we understand little of their source and magnitude and how they varied with time. There are a number of possible sources for the volatiles that were emitted during the eruptions: the mantle (including metasomatized lithosphere), volatile-rich sediments (through metamorphism or direct assimilation) and the crustal basement. To assess the relative importance of these sources (with the exception of the metamorphic outgassing source), we have conducted a geochemical study of melt inclusions hosted by clinopyroxene in Siberian Traps low-Ti tholeiitic lavas and sills of the Khakanchansky, Ayansky and Khonnamakitsky Formations. The magmas were not emplaced into or erupted onto evaporite deposits, in contrast to samples studied previously. The trace element compositions of the melt inclusions are highly variable compared with the uniform whole-rocks, exhibiting a wide range of La/Yb ratios from 0.7 to 9.5. The melt geochemistry is consistent with relatively large degrees of partial melting of a dominantly peridotite mantle source. A negative Nb anomaly indicates a degree of crustal contamination, but there is no evidence for contamination by volatile-rich evaporites. Enrichment of some of the melts in large ion lithophile elements (Ba, Sr) indicates their interaction with a fluid. We suggest that, consistent with the observed depletion in other incompatible trace elements in the melt inclusions, the volatile concentrations in the melts were relatively low, and that subsequently the melts underwent variable degrees of degassing in the crust. Overall, the melts are more volatile-poor than those reported previously from the SLIP and were erupted after the first “pulse” of more volatile-rich magmas described by Sobolev et al.(2015). These volatile-poor magmas may have been widespread across the region during the Siberian Traps eruptions once a pyroxenite component in the mantle source had been exhausted.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egv064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227169","melt inclusions;Siberian Traps;trace elements;volatiles;degassing","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We evaluated the effects of MLC positioning errors between the actual treatment gantry angles and nominal gantry angles. A gantry angle correction (GAC) factor was generated by performing a non-gap test at various gantry angles using an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). To convert pixel intensity to dose at the MLC abutment positions, a non-gap test was performed using an EPID and a film at 0° gantry angle. We then assessed the correlations between pixel intensities and doses. Beam-by-beam analyses for 15 prostate IMRT cases as patient-specific quality assurance were performed with a 2D diode detector array at 0° gantry angle to determine the relative dose error for each beam. The resulting relative dose error with or without GAC was added back to the original dose grid for each beam. We compared the predicted dose distributions with or without GAC for film measurements to validate GAC effects. A gamma pass rate with a tolerance of 2%/2 mm was used to evaluate these dose distributions. The gamma pass rate with GAC was higher than that without GAC (P = 0.01). The predicted dose distribution improved with GAC, although the dosimetric effect to a patient was minimal.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150169","MLC;IMRT;prediction;QA;non-gap test","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Bulk-rock geochemistry together with olivine mineral compositions and augite–plagioclase–plagioclase dihedral angles from the drill core are interpreted as a record of the early history of the Skaergaard magma chamber. A detailed geochemical and microstructural study of the mode and morphology of augite reveals no unambiguous markers that can be used to pinpoint the first appearance of cumulus augite in the stratigraphy sampled by the drill core. The early history of the Skaergaard magma chamber involved the arrival of multiple small batches of magma, each with a variable load of olivine and plagioclase phenocrysts. The region of the core between –120 and –108·8 m records at least three separate, but closely spaced, influxes of new magma, with more magma added at –85 and –65 m. The last influx of magma is recorded by the cumulates just below the lowest exposed horizons of the Layered Series, involving a large volume of magma that inflated the chamber to its final size. The Skaergaard magma chamber therefore formed by the progressive inflation of what was likely to have originated as a sill intruded at the discontinuity between the Precambrian gneisses and the overlying plateau lavas. The ‘Skaergaard parental magma’ should therefore be viewed as the integrated and mixed composition of the various magma influxes that filled the chamber.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egv034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8183995","Skaergaard;magma chamber;intrusion;cumulate;gabbro;geochemistry;layered igneous rock;mineral chemistry","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For some choices for the coefficient functions, the equation admits a one-parameter family of nonrational meromorphic solutions. Nevanlinna theory is used to show that all such solutions have been found and allows us to avoid issues that can arise from the fact that resonances can occur at arbitrarily high orders.

"Relative clinical effectiveness of carbon ion radiotherapy: theoretical modelling for H&N tumours","L. Antonovic; A. Dasu; Y. Furusawa; I. Toma-Dasu",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2015","56","4","639","645","Comparison of the efficiency of photon and carbon ion radiotherapy (RT) administered with the same number of fractions might be of limited clinical interest, since a wide range of fractionation patterns are used clinically today. Due to advanced photon treatment techniques, hypofractionation is becoming increasingly accepted for prostate and lung tumours, whereas patients with head and neck tumours still benefit from hyperfractionated treatments. In general, the number of fractions is considerably lower in carbon ion RT. A clinically relevant comparison would be between fractionation schedules that are optimal within each treatment modality category. In this in silicostudy, the relative clinical effectiveness (RCE) of carbon ions was investigated for human salivary gland tumours, assuming various radiation sensitivities related to their oxygenation. The results indicate that, for hypoxic tumours in the absence of reoxygenation, the RCE (defined as the ratio of D 50 for photons to carbon ions) ranges from 3.5 to 5.7, corresponding to carbon ion treatments given in 36 and 3 fractions, respectively, and 30 fractions for photons. Assuming that interfraction local oxygenation changes take place, results for RCE are lower than that for an oxic tumour if only a few fractions of carbon ions are used. If the carbon ion treatment is given in more than 12 fractions, the RCE is larger for the hypoxic than for the well-oxygenated tumour. In conclusion, this study showed that in silicomodelling enables the study of a wide range of factors in the clinical considerations and could be an important step towards individualisation of RT treatments.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155198","hypoxia;RBE;TCP;RCR;carbon ion;fractionation;RCE","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Erdélyi",NA; NA,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,"19 Jan 2018","2015","449","2","1679","1685","High-resolution observations of the solar photosphere have identified a wide variety of spiralling motions in the solar plasma. These spirals vary in properties, but are observed to be abundant at the solar surface. In this work, these spirals are studied for their potential as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave generation mechanisms. The inter-granular lanes, where these spirals are commonly observed, are also regions where the magnetic field strength is higher than average. This combination of magnetic field and spiralling plasma is a recipe for the generation of Alfvén waves and other MHD waves. This work employs numerical simulations of a self-similar magnetic flux tube embedded in a realistic, gravitationally stratified, solar atmosphere to study the effects of a single magnetic flux tube perturbed by a logarithmic velocity spiral driver. The expansion factor of the logarithmic spiral driver is varied and multiple simulations are run for a range of values of the expansion factor centred around observational constraints. The simulations are analysed using ‘flux surfaces’ constructed from the magnetic field lines so that the vectors perpendicular, parallel and azimuthal to the local magnetic field vector can be calculated. The results of this analysis show that the Alfvén wave is the dominant wave for lower values of the expansion factor, whereas for the higher values the parallel component is dominant. This transition occurs within the range of the observational constraints, meaning that spiral drivers, as observed in the solar photosphere, have the potential to generate a variety of MHD wave modes.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208976","MHD;waves;methods: numerical;Sun: oscillations;Sun: photosphere","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The resonant characteristics of SLR and patch as well as the coupling between them are presented. The method of designing the integrated resonator-patch module is explained.

Currently, signal depletion at large imaging depth sets the depth limit for these imaging techniques. As a result, how to further boost signal level is the key to achieving a larger imaging depth. Contrary to the previous thought that overfilling the back aperture of the objective yields the highest multiphoton fluorescence signal, in this paper, through numerical simulation, we show that, due to the effect of exponential decay of the excitation beam, the signal generation is maximized for certain underfilling of the back aperture of the objective lens.

The antenna is excited in a mode like the TM10 mode of the rectangular patch antenna. An L-shaped probe, which is widely used for the conventional patch antenna, is used to excite the water DDPA. A study on the bandwidth performance of the proposed design reveals that wide bandwidth can be achieved for the antenna by choosing a thick supporting substrate between the water patch and the ground plane. A prototype is fabricated to confirm the correctness of the design. An impedance bandwidth of 8%, maximum gain of 7.3 dBi, radiation efficiency up to 70%, and symmetrically unidirectional patterns with low backlobe and low cross polarization levels are obtained.

It is highly desirable if these VLC signals can be detected by using built-in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) cameras as Rxs to provide flexible and low-cost wireless communications. However, using the CMOS camera is challenging. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a VLC link using a CMOS mobile phone camera as Rx. By using the rolling shutter effect of the CMOS sensor, the VLC data rate can be significantly enhanced. We first use a second-order polynomial fitting to mitigate the “blooming effect” (saturation of pixels) of the CMOS sensor. In order to extend the VLC transmission distance and mitigate the influence of the background noise, we also propose and demonstrate using histogram equalization and Sobel filter to enhance VLC signal performance. Finally, a third-order polynomial fitting is used to define the threshold.

Avoiding recommending dishonest or unsatisfactory services is a fundamental research problem in the design of web service recommendation systems. Reputation of web services is a widely-employed metric that determines whether the service should be recommended to a user. The service reputation score is usually calculated using feedback ratings provided by users. Although the reputation measurement of web service has been studied in the recent literature, existing malicious and subjective user feedback ratings often lead to a bias that degrades the performance of the service recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation measurement approach for web service recommendations. We first detect malicious feedback ratings by adopting the cumulative sum control chart, and then we reduce the effect of subjective user feedback preferences employing the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Moreover, in order to defend malicious feedback ratings, we propose a malicious feedback rating prevention scheme employing Bloom filtering to enhance the recommendation performance. Extensive experiments are conducted by employing a real feedback rating data set with 1.5 million web service invocation records.

The growing PHY layer capabilities of WiFi has made it possible to reuse WiFi signals for both communication and sensing. Sensing via WiFi would enable remote sensing without wearable sensors, simultaneous perception and data transmission without extra communication infrastructure, and contactless sensing in privacy-preserving mode. Due to the popularity of WiFi devices and the ubiquitous deployment of WiFi networks, WiFi-based sensing networks, if fully connected, would potentially rank as one of the world's largest wireless sensor networks. Yet the concept of wireless and sensorless sensing is not the simple combination of WiFi and radar. It seeks breakthroughs from dedicated radar systems, and aims to balance between low cost and high accuracy, to meet the rising demand for pervasive environment perception in everyday life. Despite increasing research interest, wireless sensing is still in its infancy. Through introductions on basic principles and working prototypes, we review the feasibilities and limitations of wireless, sensorless, and contactless sensing via WiFi.

Since the vehicle FMCW radar should recognize vehicles in the side/rear area when the driver initiates a lane change, the estimation of the joint TOA/DOA between the radar and targets is an important issue for solving complicated location tasks. However, conventional joint estimation methods such as 2D-ESPRIT and 2D-multiple signal classification (MUSIC) cannot be adopted for real-time implementation due to their high computational loads. To satisfy the required accuracy specifications and reduce complexity compared with the conventional estimator, we propose a low-complexity joint TOA and DOA estimator that uses the combined DFT-ESPRIT algorithm for FMCW radars. The performance of the proposed estimation in multitarget environments was derived and compared with the Monte Carlo simulation results. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed method was compared with that of 2D-ESPRIT with various parameters.

However, despite the outstanding progress, their uptake on a Web scale has been significantly less than initially anticipated. The isolation of services and the lack of social relationships among related services have been identified as reasons for the poor uptake. In this paper, we propose connecting the isolated service islands into a global social service network to enhance the services' sociability on a global scale. First, we propose linked social service-specific principles based on linked data principles for publishing services on the open Web as linked social services.

This type of failure has been called potential-induced degradation (PID). Encapsulant materials provide protection and electrical isolation of the solar components in PV modules. Several researchers have shown that the type of encapsulant can directly affect the severity of the PID. Ionomers, in particular, were amongst the first encapsulants identified as having the ability to prevent this degradation mechanism. In this study, we introduce an ionomer/EVA bilayer encapsulant to the module to determine the effect of ionomer on PID and sodium ion migration in mini- modules. We determined that the encapsulant's volume resistivity is temperature independent with the presence of ionomer. Results confirm that the module's volume resistivity at elevated temperature inversely correlates with leakage current and that ion enrichment at the cell/encapsulant interface correlates with power degradation of a PV module. The rate of sodium ion migration to the cell was also investigated. An analytical method was refined for this application using laser ablation and mass spectrometry to observe the sodium migration within the module. Sodium ion profiles were obtained by elemental mapping of the encapsulant and solar cell cross section after the module had been exposed to a simulated PID test. Results show that sodium ion accumulation at the encapsulant/solar cell region increases linearly with PID testing time when only EVA encapsulant is used and is significantly different when an ionomer/EVA encapsulant is used in the module.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2014.2365465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6963261","Encapsulant;ion migration;ionomer;laser ablation;mass spectrometry;potential-induced degradation (PID);sodium, volume resistivity;Encapsulant;ion migration;ionomer;laser ablation;mass spectrometry;potential-induced degradation (PID);sodium;volume resistivity","Conductivity;Photovoltaic cells;Degradation;Standards;Photovoltaic systems;Temperature measurement","","65","","11","OAPA","20 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Shadows can lead to either a reduction in or a total loss of information in an image. This can potentially lead to the corruption of biophysical parameters derived from pixel values, such as vegetation indexes (VIs). VIs are widely used in remote sensing inversion applications. If the effects of shadows are not properly accounted for, retrieval may be uncertain when using a VI to calculate vegetation parameters. One of the major reasons that the effects of shadows are easy to be ignored in remote sensing is the spatial resolution of the measurement. High spatial and spectral resolutions are typically difficult to achieve simultaneously, and images that have one tend to not have the other. A ground-based imaging spectrometer brings a turning point to solve this problem as it can obtain both high spatial and high spectral resolutions to obtain feature and shadow images simultaneously. The resolution of the system used here was 1 mm at a height of 1 m, and the spectral resolution was better than 5 nm. For each pixel, the spectral curve of the image was almost a pure-pixel spectral curve, which allowed the differentiation of sunlit and shaded areas. To investigate the effects of shadows on different indexes, 14 hyperspectral VIs were calculated. Moreover, the vegetation fractional coverage calculated using the same 14 VIs was compared. The results show that shadows affect not only each narrowband of a VI but also vegetation parameters.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2015.2450218","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41371359,41371362); National Ministry of Environmental Protection through the Special Research Funding for Public Benefit Industries(grant numbers:2011467071); China Geological Survey(grant numbers:1212011120222); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7180331","Imaging spectrometer;remote sensing;shadows;vegetation index (VI);Imaging spectrometer;remote sensing;shadows;vegetation index (VI)","Vegetation mapping;Indexes;Spatial resolution;Imaging;Hyperspectral imaging","","61","","34","OAPA","5 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique is based on a dual-probe-sideband setup in which an optical frequency modulation of the probe waves along the fiber is introduced. This makes the optical frequency of the Brillouin interactions induced by each probe wave on the pump vary along the fiber so that two broadband Brillouin gain and loss spectra that perfectly compensate are created. As a consequence, the pulse spectral components remain undistorted, avoiding nonlocal effects. Therefore, very large probe power can be injected, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in detection for long-range BOTDA. Moreover, the probe power can even exceed the Brillouin threshold limit due to its frequency modulation, which reduces the effective amplification of spontaneous Brillouin scattering in the fiber. Experiments demonstrate the technique in a 50-km sensing link in which 8 dBm of probe power is injected.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2498543","Universidad Pública de Navarra; Universidad de Cantabria, Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación(grant numbers:TEC2013-47264-C2); Feder funds; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320952","Brillouin distributed sensors;Brillouin optical time domain analysis;non-local effects;Brillouin threshold;optical fiber sensors;stimulated Brillouin scattering;Brillouin distributed sensors;Brillouin optical time-domain analysis;nonlocal effects;Brillouin threshold;optical fiber sensors;stimulated Brillouin scattering","Time-domain analysis;Brillouin scattering;Frequency modulation;Optical sensors;Optical pulses;Optical pumping;Optical distortion","","51","","11","OAPA","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose and demonstrate a cost-effective 275-Gb/s direct-detection all-optical OFDM system for access or data center networks. As all wavelength channels (11 wavelengths in the experiment) are produced by one laser source, only the temperature control of one master laser is enough.

By using only two electrical phase shifters with  $\pi$ phase shift and optimizing the biases of the DPMZM, the third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) is completely eliminated by taking all the sidebands in the optical spectrum that produce IMD3 into consideration in theory. Without digital linearization, other optical processers, and symmetrical single-sideband modulation, optical carrier suppression (OCS) is achieved in one of the submodulators of DPMZM, which guarantees the effectiveness of information transmission. Quadrature modulation is achieved in the other submodulator of DPMZM, and the electrical signals on the two electrodes are the same, which result in a simple operation. The simulated results show that IMD3 is completely suppressed when the sinusoidal electrical signals have two tones, such as 11.9 and 12 GHz, and IMD3 is lower than the noise floor at the  $-$120 dBm level. The simulated results show that IMD3 is lower than the noise floor with  $-$120 dBm level, and the simulated results agree well with the theoretical prediction. In addition, IMD3 suppression of approximately 45 dB is experimentally demonstrated in this paper, and the spurious-free dynamic range is improved by  $11.2\ \hbox{dB}\cdot\hbox{Hz}^{2/3} $.

The proposed method compares the polarities of current and voltage traveling waves measured immediately after the fault inception to determine the fault direction. Nuisance tripping is avoided by using the power frequency voltages detected on the busbar to inhibit operation. The power frequency voltages ensure that the system does not mal-operate due to noise and also provide discrimination for phase-to-phase and three-phase faults. The wavelet transform and modulus maxima theories are used to extract the polarity of traveling waves measured at the relaying point.

Different III-V materials (InAs, GaAs) and transport directions (<;100>, <;110>) are considered with Si included for benchmarking for a gate length of 13 nm. For III-V's, depending on the operating condition (OFF-current target for a given supply voltage), there exists an optimum NSD that maximizes ON-current (ION) by balancing source exhaustion versus tunneling leakage. For InAs, sub-threshold swing degrades significantly with increasing NSD due to the light effective mass (m*) and source-drain tunneling, so the optimum NSD is low. For GaAs, such dependence is much weaker due to the larger m*, and the optimum NSD is higher. With optimized NSD's, InAs shows low ballistic ION due to the low density-of-state (DOS) whereas GaAs NW with <;110> transport direction shows good ballistic ION due to the improved DOS with still high injection velocity, making it a better candidate for high performance device.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2014.2363389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923415","III-V semiconductor materials;MOSFET;nanoscale devices;nanowires;semiconductor device modeling;III-V semiconductor materials;MOSFET;nanoscale devices;nanowires;semiconductor device modeling","Gallium arsenide;MOSFET circuits;Silicon;Tunneling;Doping;Logic gates;Scattering","","40","","20","OAPA","14 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As existing anomaly detection techniques usually operate in a point-based manner that handles each observation individually, they are unable to reliably and efficiently report such long-term anomalies appeared in an individual sensor node. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on a new technique for handling data in a segment-based manner. Considering a collection of neighbouring data segments as random variables, we determine those behaving abnormally by exploiting their spatial predictabilities and, motivated by spatial analysis, specifically investigate how to implement a prediction variance detector in a WSN. As the communication cost incurred in aggregating a covariance matrix is finally optimised using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and differential compression, the proposed scheme is able to efficiently detect a wide range of long-term anomalies. In theory, comparing to the regular centralised approach, it can reduce the communication cost by approximately 80 percent. Moreover, its effectiveness is demonstrated by the numerical experiments, with a real world data set collected by the Intel Berkeley ResearchLab (IBRL).","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748064","Wireless sensor network;anomaly detection;distributed computing;spatial analysis;Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient;differential compression","Covariance matrices;Detectors;Correlation;Equations;Manganese;Wireless sensor networks;Temperature measurement","","38","","32","IEEE","25 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle this problem, researchers often first rebalance the class sizes in the training dataset, through oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class, and then use the rebalanced data to train the classifiers. This leads to interesting empirical patterns. In particular, using the rebalanced training data can often improve the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the original, unbalanced test data. The AUC is a widely-used quantitative measure of classification performance, but the property that it increases with rebalancing has, as yet, no theoretical explanation. In this note, using Gaussian-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as the classifier, we demonstrate that, at least for LDA, there is an intrinsic, positive relationship between the rebalancing of class sizes and the improvement of AUC. We show that the largest improvement of AUC is achieved, asymptotically, when the two classes are fully rebalanced to be of equal sizes.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2359660","International Travel; Royal Society of London; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906278","AUC;class imbalance;class rebalancing;linear discriminant analysis;oversampling;ROC;undersampling","Training;Training data;Covariance matrices;Vectors;Educational institutions;Data mining;Linear discriminant analysis","","35","","18","CCBY","22 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At every IN iteration, a system of equations, which involves the Frechet derivative (FD) matrix of the CS operator, is solved for the IN step. A sparsity constraint is enforced on the solution via thresholded Landweber iterations, and the convergence is significantly increased using a preconditioner that levels the FD matrix's singular values associated with contrast and equivalent currents. To increase the accuracy, the weight of the regularization's penalty term is reduced during the IN iterations consistently with the scheme's quadratic convergence. At the end of each IN iteration, an additional thresholding, which removes small “ripples” that are produced by the IN step, is applied to maintain the solution's sparsity. Numerical results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in recovering sparse and discontinuous dielectric profiles with high contrast values.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2014.2349935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6891213","Electromagnetic (EM) imaging;inexact Newton (IN);sparse optimization;thresholded Landweber (LW);Electromagnetic (EM) imaging;inexact Newton (IN);sparse optimization;thresholded Landweber (LW)","Convergence;Imaging;Accuracy;Equations;Scattering;Sparse matrices;Dielectrics","","33","","12","OAPA","4 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Photonic heterodyne beating accomplishes the upconversion of the precoded vector signal from the baseband to the RF band, and thus, the DAC in our proposed scheme is used to generate the precoded vector signal at the baseband rather than that at the RF band, which significantly reduces the DAC bandwidth requirement.

In this paper, we present arguments based on physics that the main reason for higher exposure of children (also women and men with smaller heads and likely thinner pinnae) to radiofrequency energy from mobile phones is the closer placement of the cell phone radiation source by several millimeters to the tissues of the head, e.g., the brain. Using heterogeneous anatomically derived shaped models of the head, we have previously reported that the exposure increases by a compounding rate of 10%–15% for every single millimeter of closer location of the radiating antenna. This is similar to the report of  $\sim 20$ % increase for every millimeter in the Foster and Chou’s paper from their (1) even though their simplistic (1) is valid only for a homogenous tissue slab of infinite size and the radiation source that is a wire dipole rather than a mobile telephone. Both of their assumptions for (1) are obviously not applicable for human exposures to mobile telephones. Actually, the physical reason for such a rapid drop off of coupled energy is that the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields close to a radiating source in the so-called near-field region reduce in strength very rapidly with every millimeter of distance, even faster than in the far-field region, where the electromagnetic fields reduce inversely with the square of the distance from the source.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2438782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131429","Mobile telephones;exposure of children;antennas and radiation;EM compatibility","Cellular phones;Electromagnetic measurements;Hazards;Safety;Radiation effects;Biological effects of radiation","","31","","15","OAPA","23 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Understanding how base stations (BSs) are spatially deployed could prominently facilitate the performance analyses of cellular networks, as well as the design of efficient networking protocols. In this letter, inspired by the clustering reality of BSs and the intrinsic heavy-tailed characteristics of human activities, we aim to re-examine the statistical pattern of BSs in cellular networks, and find the most appropriate spatial density distribution of BSs. Interestingly, by taking advantage of large amount of realistic deployment information of BSs from on-operating cellular networks, we find that the widely adopted Poisson distribution severely diverges from the practical density distribution of BSs. Instead, heavy-tailed distributions could more precisely match the practical distribution. In particular, α-stable distribution, the distribution also found in traffic pattern of broadband networks and cellular networks, is most consistent with the practical one.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2468718","National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2012CB316000); Key Project of Chinese Ministry of Education(grant numbers:313053); Key Technologies R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2012BAH75F01); Program for Zhejiang Leading Team of Science and Technology Innovation(grant numbers:2013TD20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202841","Cellular networks;base stations;spatial density distribution;Poisson point process;heavy-tailed distributions;-stable distribution;Cellular networks;base stations;spatial density distribution;Poisson point process;heavy-tailed distributions;$\alpha$-stable distribution","Urban areas;Probability density function;Base stations;Graphical models;Distribution functions;Broadband communication;Stochastic processes","","31","","16","OAPA","14 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since Choi-Williams distribution (CWD) uses the exponential kernel of bilinear generalized class of time-frequency distribution, it has an excellent time-frequency aggregation. And it is suitable for detecting LPI radar signals in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) condition. A radial integration method based on the integral rotating factor is proposed to detect LPI radar signals when the signals' time-frequency image is obtained. First, the digital image processing method is used to preprocess the LPI radar signals' time-frequency images after CWD transformation; then, the radial integration method based on the integral rotating factor is used to detect LPI radar signals in the binary images. The analytic results of real data show that the method has a good performance on detecting LPI radar signals in a low SNR condition.

Herein, we present a polarization tunable absorber formed by an asymmetric patch and a dielectric layer on top of a metallic board. With this structure, the frequency of the absorber can be tuned by merely changing the polarization of the incident. The tunable mechanism originates from the different length of the patch along the two orthogonal directions. The concept is rather general and applicable to various absorbers, as long as the asymmetric design is valid. The absorber can find practical applications in manipulation of the polarization of the light and detecting waves with specific polarization.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2448718","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61176116,11074069); Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(grant numbers:20120161130003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131430","Metamaterial;perfect absorber;polarization tunable;terahertz;Metamaterial;perfect absorber;polarization tunable;terahertz","Absorption;Broadband communication;Dual band;Metamaterials;Dielectrics;Magnetic resonance","","30","","25","OAPA","23 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, many real-world applications can contain multiple numerical sensitive attributes. Directly applying the existing privacy-preserving techniques for single-numerical-sensitive-attribute and multiple-categorical-sensitive-attributes often causes unexpected disclosure of private information. These techniques are particularly prone to the proximity breach, which is a privacy threat specific to numerical sensitive attributes in data publication. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving data publishing method, namely MNSACM, which uses the ideas of clustering and Multi-Sensitive Bucketization (MSB) to publish microdata with multiple numerical sensitive attributes.

In many countries, like Italy, this has required the revision of the standards concerning the connection to the public distribution network of distributed renewable generation. The new standards require a flexible operation of generation plants that have to be capable to change the active and reactive power dynamically in function of the network parameters (i.e. frequency and network local voltage) in local control or following external commands. Therefore, this paper investigates the use of smart inverter in a critical PV installation, where relevant voltage fluctuations exist.

Traditionally, TL parameters are calculated based on transmission tower geometries, conductor dimension, estimates of line length, conductor sags, etc. These parameters only approximate the effect of conductor sag and ignore the dependence of impedance parameters on temperature variation. Recent development in PMU technology has made it possible to calculate TL parameters accurately. The challenges are that such an application requires highly accurate PMU data while the accuracy of PMU measurements under different working/system conditions can be uncertain. With a large number of PMUs widely installed in its system, CSG plans to improve and update the EMS database using the newly developed TPIS. TPIS provides an innovative yet practical problem formulation and solution for TL parameter identification. In addition, it proposes a new metric that can be used to determine the credibility of the calculated parameters, which is missing in the literature.

Based on the analysis in this study, the ground fault protection in all new PV systems should be capable of detecting any ground fault with 50 mA or more of fault current to address the highest risk faults. For resistively grounded systems, both high- and low-risk faults can be prevented by using a combination of combiner box arc-fault circuit interrupt (AFCI) protection and either continuous isolation monitoring or inverter input differential current protection. For solidly grounded systems, combiner box AFCI protection should be paired with either higher sensitivity current detectors in the ground bond or inverter input differential current protection.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2422142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7120895","Ground fault;ground fault protection (GFP);photovoltaic system design;Ground fault;ground fault protection (GFP);photovoltaic system design","Circuit faults;Conductors;Monitoring;Inverters;Joints;Fault protection;Wires","","25","","4","OAPA","10 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is found in this paper that by controlling the phase coherence of the tones, the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the generated OFC will decrease sharply. This will effectively relieve the distortion caused by fiber nonlinearity, which will enable the loop to support more tones under the condition of constant output power.

Suspended-core photonic crystal fibers are ideal candidates for nonlinear applications, providing small-core waveguides with large index contrast and tunable dispersion.

The controllable optical properties such as the refractive index and the optical conductance between two distinct phases in these materials pave the way for switchable photonic devices with memory.

The relay acts as both a helper and a potential eavesdropper, from which the users' messages need to be kept secret. A constellation-rotation aided approach is proposed to prevent the relay from decoding these messages. By rotating the signal constellation with a proper angle, the complex-valued symbol can be fully represented by its real component. Then, either user utilizes only one dimension of the signal to deliver its information, with the other dimension carrying the artificial noise (AN). In this manner, the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the relay is degraded due to the injection of AN, thereby increasing the difficulty of eavesdropping. Moreover, the desired signal and the AN lie in different directions at the terminal users, which makes the signal detection free-of-interference. The approximate expression for the upper bound of the users' symbol error rate (SER) is derived based on which a criterion is developed to choose the rotation angle that can optimize the system SER performance. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme compared to the competing candidates.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2479231","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61431011, and the); Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory; Southeast University(grant numbers:2012D04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7270269","Untrusted relay;constellation rotation;artificial noise;physical-layer security;Untrusted relay;constellation rotation;artificial noise;physical-layer security","Relays;Signal to noise ratio;Noise measurement;Interference;Constellation diagram;Upper bound;Security","","22","","13","OAPA","16 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The introduction of a DML avoids the need for an external optical modulator and, thus, simplifies the architecture and reduces the cost. The adoption of analog frequency upconversion effectively overcomes the bandwidth limitation of the current commercially available digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and, thus, increases the attained carrier frequency of the generated vector mm-wave signal. Based on our proposed scheme, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of a 40-GHz quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)-modulated vector mm-wave signal. The generated 40-GHz QPSK-modulated vector mm-wave signal can be delivered over a 0.5-m wireless distance with up to a 4-GBd rate and a bit error ratio (BER) less than the hard-decision forward-error-correction (HD-FEC) threshold of 3.8 × 10-3.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2496859","NNSF of China(grant numbers:61325002,61527801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314872","Photonic vector signal generation;directly modulated laser (DML);phase precoding;frequency doubling;quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK);Photonic vector signal generation;directly modulated laser (DML);phase precoding;frequency doubling;quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)","Frequency modulation;Photonics;Phase shift keying;Optical modulation;Wireless communication;Optical harmonic generation;Optical mixing","","20","","26","OAPA","2 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method, in which we are the first to propose, employs the modified stretched exponential decay (SED) model to characterize the OLED degradation and compensates for the associated luminance decrease; the lifetime of an OLED panel can thereby be extended. The OLED panel is fabricated using low-temperature poly-Si thin-film transistors, and measured to verify the modified SED model and the proposed compensation method. The measurement results show that the luminance degradation with and without the proposed method is 0.3% and 6%, 4% and 17.8%, and 7.4% and 30.4%, for red, green, and blue OLEDs, respectively. This measurement is taken after 40 h of operation under a 350 cd/m2 initial luminance.

Under the influence of meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind, snow grains form complex structures of ice bonds enclosing variable portions of air. The characteristics of such structures are important for the formation of snow avalanches. Certain snow types such as surface hoar, ice crusts, or windblown snow play a major role in the formation of weak layers and slabs, which are precondition for dangerous slab avalanches. The reflection properties of snow depend on the optical equivalent grain size of the ice particles that constitute the snow cover. High spatial resolution remote sensing instruments with near-infrared (0.7-1.4 μm) bands are able to detect such differences in the optical reflection of snow.

In addition, the dispersion curve of the second band can pass through the light line and then enter into the radiation region, leading to a frequency-based beam steering radiation. We also find that, below the light line, there exists an anomalous linear dispersion such that the guiding mode propagation length can be extended up to around 200λ.

When superimposed on the load curve, it transforms the load curve into a ‘load belt’, i.e. a range. Furthermore, the large scale development of electric vehicle (EV) will also have a significant impact on power grid in general and load characteristics in particular. This paper aims to develop a controlled EV charging strategy to optimize the peak-valley difference of the grid when considering the regional wind and PV power outputs. The probabilistic model of wind and PV power outputs is developed. Based on the probabilistic model, the method of assessing the peak-valley difference of the stochastic load curve is put forward, and a two-stage peak-valley price model is built for controlled EV charging. On this basis, an optimization model is built, in which genetic algorithms are used to determine the start and end time of the valley price, as well as the peak-valley price. Finally, the effectiveness and rationality of the method are proved by the calculation result of the example.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0117-z","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018450","Renewable energy;Electric vehicle;Controlled electric vehicle (EV) charging;Demand side response;Peak-valley price","Load modeling;Wind farms;Electric vehicle charging;Renewable energy sources;Belts;Probabilistic logic","","19","","16","","28 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

In the proposed scheme, the original data and the delayed versions of this data are transmitted simultaneously by multiplying with orthogonal frequency in order to create diversity effect over the transmission. In addition, RGB LEDs are used for parallel transmission of data, thus resulting in an increase in the data speed. At the receiver, color filters are used to filter out for the desired signal, and SC is performed to obtain the most probable bits. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust and efficient to overcome the effect of multiple reflections with a link margin of approximately 10 dB, as compared with a conventional on-off keying (OOK) modulation scheme at a bit error rate (BER) of 10-6.

The total epilayer thickness is only 3.75μm, offering significant growth time savings and faster manufacturing process throughput. A SiNx interlayer is inserted in the buffer layer to promote lateral overgrowth and improve material quality, resulting in full width at half maximum (0002) and (10-12) of 380 and 390 arcsec, respectively. Reducing dislocation density and optimizing KOH roughening of the n-GaN layer is found to be critical toward improving device performance. The devices were processed as 1 × 1 mm2 vertical thin film dies and mounted into a conventional 3535 package with silicone dome lens. The result is a light output power of 563 mW and an operating voltage of 3.05 V, corresponding to a wall-plug-efficiency of 52.7% when driven at 350 mA.

In this paper, we propose a digitally controlled micro-LED array architecture for the VLC system, which enjoys the benefit of wide modulation bandwidth of the micro-LED array and avoids the disadvantage of the nonlinear distortion.

The principal features in the reflection spectra of the 2-D devices show good quantitative agreement with the corresponding 1-D grating spectra for small modulation strength. Thereby, clear connections are established with the TE and TM modal states of a reflector. For reflectors made with silicon that has a high index of refraction, there is qualitative agreement between the 2-D spectra and the concomitant 1-D modal signatures. Two-dimensional reflectors with periodic rods and holes are treated. In both cases, it is found that the spectra are dominated by contributions from a single polarization state in the 1-D grating equivalent. The results and methods provided herein enable improved understanding of the physical properties of 2-D resonant reflectors and the related 2-D modulated devices, including photonic crystal slabs.

Effective optical carrier suppression can be achieved using the cascaded PolMs, whereas the optical sidebands induced by the RF and the LO signals remain unchanged. Since no additional optical filter is needed, the lower operation frequency limit in other approaches with an optical filter is eliminated, such that a full-frequency-range coverage is ensured in this approach. Meanwhile, the use of optical carrier suppression (OCS) enables high conversion efficiency for microwave downconversion. In the proof-of-concept experiments, the conversion efficiency is improved by over 20 dB within the frequency range from 2 to 15 GHz, as compared to those of cascaded modulators without OCS.

Eigenstructure decomposition of each signal is used to form a cost function. By minimizing the cost function, phase errors and DOAs are jointly estimated through an iterative procedure. For large phase errors situation, a conditional optimization is conducted to provide rough initial estimates for the iterative procedure.

Existing guidelines prove inadequate. This paper analyzes the requirements and the operating scenarios of remote patient monitoring platforms and defines a framework to convey information on the conditions under which observations were made by the device and forwarded by the gateway in order for data to be managed appropriately and to include both reference to local time and an underlying continuous reference timeline. We define the timestamp formats of HL7 to denote the different conditions of operation and describe extensions to the existing definition of the HL7 timestamp to differentiate between time local to GMT (+0000) and universal coordinated time or network time protocol time where no geographic time zone is implied (−0000). We further describe how timestamps from devices having only simple or no clocks might be managed reliably by a gateway to provide timestamps that are referenced to local time and an underlying continuous reference timeline. We extend the HL7 message to include information to permit a subsequent receiver of the data to understand the quality of the timestamp and how it has been translated.

A microwave signal is then generated by beating the recovered optical carrier with the phase-modulated lower sideband, and thus, an MPF is achieved with the shape of the passband optical filter that is mapped from the optical domain to the electrical domain. By tuning the central wavelength of the passband optical filter, a single-passband MPF with a frequency tuning range from 5 to 35 GHz is obtained. The 3-dB bandwidth and the out-of-band suppression ratio are measured to be 4 GHz and 20 dB, respectively.

In this paper, a novel method based on the classical TODIM method is proposed to solve the hybrid MADM problems with unknown weight information on attributes, in which attribute values are represented in four different formats: crisp numbers, interval numbers, triangular fuzzy numbers and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Firstly, the positive-ideal alternative and negative-ideal alternative are determined, and the gain and loss matrices are constructed by calculating the gain and loss of each alternative relatived to the ideal alternatives concerning each attribute based on different distance calculation formulas, which may avoid the information missing or information distortion in the process of unifying multiform attribute values into a certain representation form. Secondly, an optimization model based on the maximizing deviation (MD) method, by which the attribute weights can be determined, is established for the TODIM method. Further, the calculation steps to solve the hybrid MADM problems are given. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method, and the results show that the DM's psychological behavior, attribute weights and the transformed information would highly affect the ranking orders of alternatives.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2015.00111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347862","hybrid multiple attribute decision making;TODIM;ranking","Decision making;Psychology;Systems engineering and theory;Pragmatics;Terminology;Ranking statistics","","15","","","","7 Dec 2015","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

A dynamic frequency control strategy which considers the comfort level of vehicle owners was developed for EVs to regulate their power consumption according to the deviation of system frequency. A simulation model of a population of EVs equipped with such control was implemented in Matlab/Simulink platform.

SNAPR, which can be run on a single library or thousands of libraries, can take compressed or uncompressed FASTQ and BAM files, and output a sorted BAM file, individual read counts, and gene fusions, and can identify exogenous RNA species in a single step. SNAPR also does native Phred score filtering of reads. SNAPR is also well suited for future sequencing platforms that generate longer reads. We show how we can analyze data from hundreds of TCGA samples in a matter of hours while identifying gene fusions and viral events at the same time.

Indeed, many conceptual parameters such as design (shell vs. core) or type of cooling are needed for a more accurate interpretation of the data. Moreover, similarly to water, the measured marker concentrations in oil are temperature-dependent, i.e. an existing partition phenomenon between the oil and the solid insulation modify the solubility of the markers, thus changing their apparent concentrations in the oil. Consequently, to follow the real trend of these species during the transformer's service life, it is crucial to correct their concentrations at a specific temperature, as is done for the water content. Knowing these facts and in order to calibrate a predictive model, Hydro-Québec decided to access equipment when dismantled, which enables a large amount of paper to be sampled from different sections of the windings. This allows for a more accurate representation of the transformer paper conditions in relation to transformer design. The paper condition obtained by measuring the degree of polymerization in accordance with the presence of chemical markers is a valuable process. We believe that it is possible to better understand the behavior of the paper insulation and to assess markers concentration thresholds using the oil analysis. This article discusses the recent experience in this field with specific cases.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2015.005295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7367554","Transformer;chemical markers;post-mortem;methanol;ethanol;furanic derivatives;degree of polymerization;insulating paper;cellulose;model","Power transformer insulation;Oil insulation;Windings;Chemicals;Cooling","","13","","21","IEEE","11 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the ODN sharing scheme, the expense of building new fibers for the next-generation fifth-generation (5G) mobile backhaul networks can be reduced. As many wavelengths are allocated to the already deployed PON systems, there remain limited wavelengths for the mobile backhaul systems. Hence, to efficiently increase the serving cell sites of the 5G systems, spectral-efficient orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted in the mobile backhaul systems. In order to reduce the latency of the system, adaptive adjustment of the OFDM signals for different transmission distances is averted. The OFDM signals are transmitted only using specific available bandwidth. The available bandwidth for each wavelength is studied according to the power fading relationship between the transmission distances and the chirp induced from signal modulation. A proof-of-concept demonstration experiment has been performed. In our results, 20.17 Gb/s with a bit error rate (BER) lower than  $3.8\times 10^{-3}$ was realized with a split ratio of 256 and a 40-km transmission distance of the PON ODN.

Changing the surrounding index affects the scattering properties and, consequently, the leakage of the guided mode. This effect is experimentally investigated through the change in the attenuation coefficient when the surrounding refractive index is changed by dropping different weight ratios of glucose solutions onto the polished side. The measured change of the attenuation coefficient is consistent with the finite-element calculations. The effect of different polished depths was theoretically investigated to optimize the working conditions.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2481606","Research University(grant numbers:(RU 001-2014),UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/SCI/01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7286718","Fiber optics sensors;Nondestructive testing;Scattering measurements;Optical device fabrication;optical sensors","Optical fiber sensors;Optical fiber polarization;Scattering;Optical surface waves","","12","","22","OAPA","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dispersion characteristics of the nondegenerate  $\mathbf{HE}\pm\mathbf{1}$ SSPP modes were numerically obtained, and their spiral electromagnetic distributions were also presented. It was found that the  $\mathbf{HE}\pm\mathbf{1}$ modes were circularly polarized; they were also vortex modes and possessed an orbit angular monument.

The distinct advantages, such as a relatively long focusing length and the circular polarization of the chiral  $\mathbf{HE}+\mathbf{1}$ SSPP modes, make the helically grooved metal wire waveguide a potential for near-field circular dichroism detection.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2501165","Fujian Provincial Excellent Young Scientist Fund(grant numbers:2014J07007); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51005077); Training Program of Fujian Excellent Talents in Universities; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; Chinese Ministry of Education(grant numbers:20133514110008); Chinese Ministry of Health(grant numbers:WKJ-FJ-27); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337550","Terahertz;spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPP);plasmonics","Wires;Metals;Electromagnetic waveguides;Polarization;Surface waves;Corrugated surfaces;Plasmons","","12","","29","OAPA","19 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The wind power penetration of some regions has reached a high level, which brings significant challenges for power system dispatch due to the inherent variability and uncertainty of wind resources. To increase the dispatch capabilities of wind power generation, the spatial smoothing effect among adjacent wind farms needs to be fully utilized. This paper presents the concept of hierarchical coordinated dispatch for wind power based on a new concept of a virtual power generator. The spatial smoothing effect of wind power is analyzed first. Next, the virtual power generator method of a wind farm cluster is defined and established. Then, the hierarchical coordinated dispatch mode is compared with an existing wind power dispatch mode for individual wind farms.

Though our main motivation is related to communications in nanonetworks with electrons that carry magnetic spin as the bipolar information, one can also imagine that the particles may be molecules that use chirality to convey information. Since it is difficult for a particle to carry an identifier that conveys the identity of the source or destination, each node receives particles whose source cannot be ascertained since physical imperfections may result in particles being directed to the wrong destination in a manner that interferes with the correctly directed particles, and particles that should arrive at a node may be received by some other node. In addition, noise may randomly switch the polarity of particles, and in the case of magnetic spin, we can also have the effect of entanglement. We estimate the error probability in such a multipoint network as a function of the rate of flow of particles, and the power consumption per communicating pair of nodes. We then design a bipolar detector and show that it can significantly eliminate the effect of errors.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2015.2446751","U.K. Engineering and Physical Science Research Council through the European Research Area Networks Energy harvesting Communication netwoRks: OPtimization and demonStration Project(grant numbers:EP/K017330/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7132769","Electron spin;nanonetworks;energy;interference;error probabilities;bipolar detector;quantum entanglement;Electron spin;nanonetworks;energy;interference;error probabilities;bipolar detector;quantum entanglement","Circuit synthesis;Detectors;Receivers;Error probability;Interference;Radiation detectors","","10","","27","OAPA","24 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A mathematical model of a free-form reflective surface based on the Lambertian characteristic of LED, ideal diffuse surface, and energy conservation is established. The diffuse free-form surface is constructed by solving a series of equations numerically. Furthermore, several array configurations are used to illustrate the advantages of the free-form surface.

However, the adaptive beamforming will change the array pattern in realtime, which has the potential to introduce phase center biases into the antenna array. For precise applications, these phase biases must be mitigated or compensated because they will bring errors in code phase and carrier phase measurements. A novel adaptive beamforming algorithm is proposed firstly, then the phase bias induced by the proposed algorithm is estimated, and finally a compensation strategy is addressed. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed beamforming algorithm suppresses effectively the strong interference and improves significantly the capturing performance of GNSS signals.

A new concept is proposed in this paper for tandem microlens arrays incorporating a center off-axis microlens array for the generation of an intensity far-field distribution with improved homogeneity under coherent illumination with the envelope of a top hat. The geometric centers of the sub-apertures are randomly offset by the light axis of the sub-lens in the array to break the periodicity. The influences of the various off-axis amounts on the homogeneity are discussed.

We introduced the concept of relaxed TIR, in 2014, to control evanescent waves generated during TIR. These unchecked evanescent waves are the fundamental reason photonic devices are inevitably diffraction limited and cannot be miniaturized. Our key design concept is the engineered anisotropy of the medium into which the evanescent wave extends, thus allowing for skin depth engineering without any metallic components. In this paper, we give an overview of our approach and compare it to key classes of photonic devices such as plasmonic waveguides, photonic crystal waveguides, and slot waveguides.

We show that the transmit optimization for these two schemes can be formulated as an SNR-based max-min-fair (MMF) problem with Gaussian inputs, which can be handled via the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. Apart from transmit optimization, we analyzed the rate performance of the two schemes. Our analytical results show that for BF Alamouti, the multicast rate degrades with the number of users M at a rate of √M, which is better than the traditional transmit beamforming scheme. For SBF, the multicast rate degradation is less sensitive to the increase in the number of users and outperforms BF Alamouti for large M.

To implement this new MRAS scheme, a two-dimensional (2-D) fuzzy rule is designed. The proposed control scheme is employed in the IPMSM drives with cyclic fluctuating loads such as compressors.

Both the approximate theoretic analysis and the numerical results show that the sign of the horizontal complex cross acoustic intensity active component is independent of the range when vertically deployed receiving dual sensors are placed in appropriate depths, the sum of which is equal to the waveguide effective depth, so it can be used to tell whether the sound source is near the surface or underwater; while the range rate is expected to be measured by utilizing the sign distribution characteristic of the reactive component.

In order to fully utilize the application of DR and make DR capable of actively supporting grid operations at all times, this paper builds a DR and wind farm integrated economic dispatch model. The objective is to minimize the total operation costs, such as fuel cost, startup cost, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission costs, and DR cost. DR maximum participating time and DR ramp rate constraints are considered. A system with 10 traditional units, one large-scale wind farm, three types of DR, including interruptible load, direct load control, and load as capacity resource are selected to verify the proposed model. Four DR penetration rates are analyzed: 0%, 10%, 20% and 30%. The results indicate that DR penetration can decrease total operation costs. The lower price DR resource gets the priority to be committed. The DR and wind farm integration is indispensable in the future economic dispatch.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2015.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377168","Demand response;economic dispatch;GHGemission;wind farm.","","","8","","","","11 Jan 2016","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Two different channel cross sections and optical and acoustic phonon mechanisms were considered. The phonon models used reproduce the phonon limited mobility in the cross sections studied. The power dissipation for different combinations of source, channel, and drain dimensions have been calculated. Due to the lack of complete electron energy relaxation inside the device, the Joule heat dissipation over-estimates the power dissipated in small nanotransistors. This over-estimation is larger for large cross sections due to the weaker phonon scattering. On the other hand, in narrow wires, the power dissipation inside the device can be large, therefore, mitigating against fabrication of very narrow nanowire transistors. We have also investigated the cooling of the device source region due to the mismatch of the Peltier coefficients between the source and the channel.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2014.2368357","EPSRC under a Career Acceleration Fellowship Quantum simulations of future solid state transistors of A.

The frequencies of null subcarriers are identified from non-uniform Doppler shift at each tentative scaling factor. Then it is proved that the cost function can be fitted as a quadratic polynomial near the global minimum. An accurate Doppler scale estimation is achieved by the location of the global scarifying precision and increasing the computation minimum through polynomial interpolation, without complexity. A shallow water experiment is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

In this system, virtualization and automation technology are utilized to integrate mobile terminals into the cloud platform as a resource, to achieve a novel cloud service called Testing as a Service (TaaS). The system consists of three functional modules: web front-end module, testing environment module, and automated testing module. We adopted the permeable automated testing tool Metasploit to perform security testing. In our test experiments, we selected 100 apps with diverse vulnerability levels, ranging from secure to vulnerable, to perform a series of functional tests. The experimental results show that this system can correctly test both the number of vulnerable apps and their corresponding vulnerability levels. As such, the designed system can flexibly configure various testing environments for different testing cases or projects, and thereby perform security testing automatically.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2015.7349926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349926","automated security testing; cloud platform; virtualization; Metasploit","Testing;Cloud computing;Mobile communication;Security;Virtualization;Virtual machining","","8","","","","17 Dec 2015","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Moreover, in the case that the input is partially polarized light, the resonant peak positions of split modes are identical with those in the case of inputting linearly or elliptically polarized light under the same deviation angle. The split mode characteristic is further studied by salinity sensing simulation and experiment. The split modes have the same free spectral range, and their resonant peak shifts have the same response to salinity changing.

Leader propagation is one of the main processes in long gap breakdown. In this paper, the leader propagation characteristics of real size ±800 kV UHVDC transmission tower gaps under positive switching impulse voltages (185/ 2290 μs) are investigated. An integrated observation platform consisting of an impulse voltage divider, a coaxial shunt, a high-speed video camera, and a set of integrated optical electric field sensors (IOES), is established. The waveforms of impulse voltage, discharge current, electric field variation at specific positions, and time-resolved photographs of discharge morphology are recorded. Axial leader velocity and the relationship between leader advancements and injected charge are obtained. The typical value of leader stable propagation velocity is 1.7-2.2 cm/μs, which varies slightly with the gap length and applied voltage amplitude. The leader velocity in the re-illumination process is much higher, and is seen as varying from 5 cm/μs to 30 cm/μs, with an average value around 10 cm/μs. The charge in leader channel per unit length is 20- 40 μC/m, which illustrates a near-direct proportion relationship between discharge current and leader velocity. The observed parameters are important for further simulation of the tower gap breakdown processes.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2015.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7281127","Integrated observation platform;leader propagation characteristics;long air gap discharge;positive switching impulses;UHVDC transmission tower","","","7","","","","2 Oct 2015","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Existing evaluation rules of radar RF stealth include too many parameters of radar and interceptors, such as Schleher interception factor, which makes it difficult to evaluate radar RF stealth technologies if interceptor parameters are unknown. In communication, security capacity has been presented to describe the possible ability to communicate in complete security. Since the essential of the security capacity is to have the interceptor get none valued information from the emitter, this paper is proposed to study security information factors taking advantage of mutual information to evaluate radar RF stealth under some conditions. Through analyzing mutual information obtained by the radar and the interceptor, this paper defines the security information factor with and without cooperative jamming. Furthermore, this paper deduces the ratio of the match filter to the match incoherent filter and discuss mutual information received by the interceptor. Numerical simulations illustrate radar RF stealth effects based on the security information factor concept under different conditions.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2015.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111162","mutual information;radar signal;stealth","Radar antennas;Radar cross-sections;Mutual information;Radio frequency;Signal processing;Mutual information","","7","","","","21 May 2015","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Along with the extensive applications of FCMs, there are some limitations that emerge due to the deficiencies associated with FCM itself. In order to eliminate these deficiencies, we propose an unsupervised dynamic fuzzy cognitive map using behaviors and nonlinear relationships. In this model, we introduce dynamic weights and trend-effects to make the model more reasonable. Data credibility is also considered while establishing a machine learning model. Subsequently, we develop an optimized Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for weight learning. Experimental results show the practicability of the dynamic FCM model.

Most importantly, as the conductive n- and p-type regions are formed by electrostatic field ionization but not by the thermal activation, the concentration of field-induced carriers is independent of thermal freeze-out effects.

Within these cells, two isoforms of Cryptochrome, Cry1 and Cry2, participate in a negative feedback loop driving oscillation. Previous work has shown that single, dissociated SCN neurons respond differently to Cry1 and Cry2 knockouts. These differences have led to speculation that CRY1 and CRY2 may play different functional roles in the oscillator. To address this proposition, we have developed a new coupled, stochastic model focused on the Period (Per) and Cry feedback loop, and incorporating intercellular coupling via vasoactive intestinal peptide. We show that single dissociated Cry1 knockouts display partially rhythmic behavior. Additionally, intrinsic molecular noise and differences in relative abundance, rather than differing functions, are sufficient to explain the range of rhythmicity encountered in Cry knockouts in the SCN. The results further highlight the essential role of stochastic behavior in understanding and accurately modeling the circadian network.","2332-7685","","10.1109/LLS.2015.2439498","NIH(grant numbers:1R01GM096873-01); Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies(grant numbers:W911NF-09-0001); U.S. Army Research Office; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7117792","Biological systems;circadian rhythms;stochastic systems;systems biology.;Biological systems;circadian rhythms;stochastic systems;systems biology","Stochastic processes;Systems biology;Biological system modeling;Circadian rhythms","","6","","34","OAPA","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the dark channel prior principle can effectively restore the blurred image at the cost of a large amount of computation, the total variation (TV) and image morphology transform (specifically top-hat transform and bottom-hat transform) have been introduced into the improved method.

However, very fast transient overvoltage (VFTO) increases caused by a rise in voltage levels can lead to GIS insulation failures. In this paper, a generating system of VFTO and standard lightning impulse (LI) is established. The insulation characteristics of SF6 gas with and without insulators under VFTO and standard LI are investigated. Experimental results show that the 50% breakdown voltages of the inhomogeneous electric field rod-plane gap under positive VFTO and standard LI are higher than that under negative VFTO and standard LI. The research shows that the 50% breakdown voltage under VFTO could be lower than that under standard LI at 0.5 MPa for the negative polarity. Moreover, the polarity effect of the insulator without defect is different from that with defect. Similarly, the breakdown voltage of the defective insulator under VFTO could be lower than that under standard LI by 8%. The flashover channel under VFTO is seen as more than that under standard LI. Based on the analysis of discharge images and experimental results, it is concluded that the polarity effect is related to the distortion effect of ion clusters formed by SF6 on the electric field. Additionally, the steepness and front time of impulse plays an important role in the initiation and further development of discharge on insulator surface. Finally, the research shows that different discharge characteristics between VFTO and standard LI may be caused by different wave fronts and oscillation on the tails of the impulses.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2015.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7281123","Breakdown voltage;discharge characteristic;gas insulated switchgear (GIS);lightning impulse (LI);space charge;very fast transient overvoltage (VFTO)","","","6","","","","2 Oct 2015","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Through improved heat dissipation, current uniformity, and light extraction efficiency, the resulting LED matrices fabricated with 6  $\times$ 6 pixels outperform conventional LEDs in terms of light output power and current-induced spectral shift. It was also found that good control of the SU-8 planarization process and optimizing the number of pixels facilitates the fabrication of high-efficiency LED matrices. In addition, the presence of large junction capacitance caused by the parallel connection of the individual pixels prevents these LED matrices with 6  $\times$ 6 pixels from operating at high speed.

With the proposed NCT function, the compression and expansion weights can be applied independently with suitably chosen function parameter values. As a result, the proposed function can easily maintain the average signal power approximately unchanged during the companding process. In this regard, the proposed function is superior to previously proposed schemes. Also, the simulations show the outstanding PAPR reduction performance of the proposed function.

The unique bandgap modulation by the transverse electrical field in the graphene nanoribbon (GNR) offers new opportunity to pursue switches with steep subthreshold not limited by thermal voltage. In this paper, we demonstrate a graphene routing process (GRP), which can implement the side-gate GNR transistor with field-effect bandgap modulation (FEBM). The GRP precisely aligns the side gates to the transistor channel, and provides scalable W/L without registry concerns. Besides, by controlling the pattern sizing, the metallic source/drain, side gates, and semiconducting channel are all defined on the large-area graphene thin-film by one-critical lithography step. The GRP process thus can be adapted to the backend process with thin-film transfer even on flexible substrates. The double side-gate GNR transistors exhibit FEBM and a negative temperature coefficient for the ON-state conductance which can stabilize thermal runaway. In addition, the single-layer routing for simple circuit topology can improve package density and reduce number of contact vias. Combining FEBM with the electrostatic control can bring forth higher ON current and sub-60 mV/decade switching. These device characteristics offer a potential power-gating technology in low-power applications.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2015.2397694","Air Force Office of Scientific Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7035031","Graphene,;nanoribbon;thin-film transistors;bandgap modulation;power gating;Graphene;nanoribbon;thin-film transistors;bandgap modulation;power gating","Graphene;Photonic band gap;Transistors;Modulation;Logic gates;Lithography;Temperature measurement","","6","","30","OAPA","6 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The merging of the networks plays an important role in the distributed online dynamic modeling of power systems. An efficient multi-area networks-merging model that can rapidly match the boundary power flow is proposed in this paper. The iterations of the boundary matching during network merging are eliminated due to the introduction of the merging model, and the dynamic models of the sub-grid can be directly “plugged in” with each other.

This paper presents an efficient method to measure the volume of a large conducting cavity. The proposed method is based on statistical wave theory. By measuring the Q factor in the time and frequency domains, the volume of the cavity can be extracted. In the time domain, the Q factor can be extracted directly from the time domain response, while in the frequency domain, the Q factor depends on the volume of the cavity and the transferred power; the transferred power can be measured directly. By correcting the frequency domain Q with the radiation efficiency of antennas, the Q factors obtained from both the time and frequency domains are equal in a well-stirred chamber; this provides an opportunity to measure the volume of the cavity. Measurements are conducted to verify the proposed method. Although the measurement is conducted using electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves can also be used; in this case, the approach can be applied to any cavity, not limited to a conducting cavity.

A linear perspective SFS method with two images is proposed to deal with the problem. We assume that two images with different light source directions are captured firstly. Orthogonal projection is not as accurate as perspective one to simulate imaging processes. Two reflectance map equations are established based on the Lambertian model under perspective projection, and the equations are further transformed into one linear PDE. Then the iterative semi-Lagrangian algorithm is used to approximate the solution. Finally, 3-D height values of pixel points in imaging planes are solved by the numerical interpolation method.

Firstly, TGCDA relies on the tolerance relation among vertices to form an initial granule set. Then granules in this set which satisfied granulation coefficient are hierarchically merged by tolerance granulation operation. The process is finished till the granule set includes one granule. Finally, select a granule set with maximum granulation criterion to handle overlapping vertices among some granules. The overlapping vertices are merged into corresponding granules based on their degrees of affiliation to realize the community partition of complex networks. The final granules are regarded as communities so that the granulation for a network is actually the community partition of the network. Experiments on several datasets show our algorithm is effective and it can identify the community structure more accurately. On real world networks, TGCDA achieves Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) accuracy 17.55% higher than NFA averagely and on synthetic random networks, the NMI accuracy is also improved. For some networks which have a clear community structure, TGCDA is more effective and can detect more accurate community structure than other algorithms.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2015.7350014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350014","tolerance relation; community; tolerance granulation; Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) accuracy","Partitioning algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Detection algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Complexity theory;Image edge detection;Complex networks","","5","","","","17 Dec 2015","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

On the other hand, the polarization-division multiplexing (PDM) technique has been extensively studied for achieving high-speed and high-spectral-efficiency optical networks. Since the state of polarization of PDM signals are randomly changed along the transmission optical link, it is important to elaborately design a polarization-insensitive conversion scheme in such a network. In this paper, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated an all-optical nonreturn-to-zero–return-to-zero format conversion for PDM on–off keying (OOK), binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signals. Polarization-insensitive operation is achieved by utilizing the merit of the dual-orthogonal-pump four-wave mixing (FWM) process in a highly nonlinear fiber, and receiver-sensitivity-gain operation is observed in the conversion process. The bit error ratio (BER) results show that receiver-sensitivity gains of  $\sim$1.5,  $\sim$0.8, and 0.3 dB for the OOK, BPSK, and QPSK PDM signals at BER values of  $10^{-9}$,  $10^{-9}$, and  $10^{-3}$ are obtained, respectively.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2402155","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401378,61275068,61335005); Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China; Key Lab of Optical Fiber Sensing & Communications (UESTC), Ministry of Education, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045635","Format conversion;polarization division multiplexing (PDM);four-wave mixing (FWM);highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF)","Optical attenuators;Optical fibers;Nonlinear optics;Optical polarization;Optical pumping;Optical receivers;Optical interferometry","","5","","19","OAPA","19 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The GaN microdome shapes and sizes were determined through control of the plasma etching conditions. The antireflection properties of the GaN microdomes with different sizes and shapes were characterized. Two different mechanisms were proposed to explain the surface reflection properties of incidence wavelength below and above GaN band gap, respectively. The trend shows that the surface reflection is reduced with the increase in the aspect ratio of the GaN microdomes for incidence wavelength above the band gap. For incidence wavelength below the band gap, the trend is totally different.

During the period when only one phase circuit is opened, negative sequence voltage with certain duration is obtained at DG side because of the asymmetric operation of the system. After all three phase circuits are opened, the voltage variation direction of the two phases that are secondly disconnected from the grid follows the voltage variation direction of the firstly disconnected phase. Based on the above voltage characteristics, an islanding detection scheme is proposed to identify genuine islanding from system disturbances.

There is a lot of research in agreement and replication techniques that tolerate Byzantine faults. However, most of this work is not suited to large-scale wireless sensor networks, due to its high computational complexity. By introducing Fast ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), which can resist timing and energy attacks, and reduce the proportion of verifying signature algorithm to generating signature algorithm to 1.2 times, we propose a new Byzantine fault-tolerant routing algorithm for large-scale wireless sensor networks with double-level hierarchical architecture. In different levels, the algorithm runs different BFT protocols. Theory and simulation results have proved that this algorithm has high security and the number of communication rounds between clusters is reduced by 1/3, which balances the network load. At the same time, the application of Fast ECDSA improves the security level of the network without burdening it.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2015.7350015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350015","wireless sensor networks; Byzantine Generals Problem; fault-tolerant routing; Elliptic Curve DigitalSignature Algorithm (ECDSA); LEACH-protocol","Clustering algorithms;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Routing;Security","","5","","","","17 Dec 2015","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper, we study an interesting scenario, where we upgrade the conventional OFDM with 4-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) to DCS-OFDM with 16-QAM, which have equal spectrum efficiency and require no change on hardware. We conduct a simulation to compare the tolerance to the laser phase noise and fiber nonlinearity, which are the main concerns for such an upgrading. First, the 16-QAM DCS-OFDM relaxes the laser linewidth requirement and performs better with a smaller fast Fourier transform size. Second, the nonlinear tolerance of 16-QAM DCS-OFDM is better when the nonlinear effects appear. The nonlinear tolerance of DCS-OFDM depends on the dispersion compensation scheme. The maximum SNR improvement is 3.4 dB with full post-dispersion compensation, and it can increase to 6.6 dB with symmetrical dispersion compensation at the launch power of 4 dBm. Finally, we verify that the maximum SNR improvement of 16-QAM DCS-OFDM with full post-dispersion compensation is 3.7 dB at the launch power of 6.2 dBm in the experiment.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2390612","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)(grant numbers:2013AA013403,2012AA011304); Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University(grant numbers:PCSIRT,IRT1218); 111 Project(grant numbers:B14039); NSFC(grant numbers:61405024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7006651","Coherent optical communications;optical OFDM;digital coherent superposition;phase noise mitigation;Coherent optical communications;optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM);digital coherent superposition (DCS);phase noise mitigation","OFDM;Signal to noise ratio;Laser noise;Optical fiber dispersion;Phase noise;Optical fibers","","5","","16","OAPA","12 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analysis of the low-frequency noise considers the non-stationary behavior of traps in time-periodic biasing conditions. In this paper, analysis of the low-frequency noise by deriving a model for RTS noise power spectral density for variable duty cycle switched biasing, is presented. It is concluded that the low-frequency noise can be reduced by using a multi-stage configuration of multiple transistors in place of a single transistor.

Since the computation burden of the existing methods makes them infeasible for multi-component systems, this paper proposes an improved Bayesian approach for the system reliability assessment in light of overlapping data. This approach includes three steps: fristly searching for feasible paths based on the binary decision diagram, then screening feasible points based on space partition and constraint decomposition, and finally simplifying the likelihood function.

In order to overcome the difficulty of dealing with non-smooth objective functions, new methods that can solve the semi-supervised vector machine with desired classification accuracy are in great demand. A quintic spline function with three-times differentiability at the origin is constructed by a general three-moment method, which can be used to approximate the symmetric hinge loss function. The approximate accuracy of the quintic spline function is estimated. Moreover, a quintic spline smooth semi-support vector machine is obtained and the convergence accuracy of the smooth model to the non-smooth one is analyzed. Three experiments are performed to test the efficiency of the model. The experimental results show that the new model outperforms other smooth models, in terms of classification performance.

In other words, successful first time treatments are impacted by challenges, including the generation of linear lesions in certain anatomies like the mitral isthmus of the left atrium. Hence, there is a need to find ways to address the presence of unwanted conduction gaps at the time of lesion creation. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to examine conduction gaps, by using a proof of concept device to examine local electrical activation within the cardiac areas of an applied lesion, i.e., to locate gaps in the lesion set. To accomplish this, both epicardial and endocardial linear ablation lines composed of spot lesions with conduction gaps were created in a porcine model. The forces necessary to elicit monophasic action potentials (MAP) were collected from >200 measurements on the epicardium of the right ventricle. Ablations were then performed on the ventricular epicardium and left atrial mitral isthmus endocardially, while recording MAPs. We were able to successfully demonstrate the use of a proof of concept device to identify conduction gaps in linear lesion sets; furthermore, we were able to determine required contact forces to appropriately determine focal electrical changes of the underlying tissues. New catheter designs that incorporate capabilities to record focal MAPs could be employed clinically to better assess a given lesion quality and/or to determine the existence of an undesired conduction gap.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2015.2473856","Medtronic, Inc.; Institute for Engineering in Medicine, University of Minnesota; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226776","Atrial fibrillation;atrial flutter;monophasic action potential;catheter ablation;coronary sinus;mitral isthmus;Atrial fibrillation;atrial flutter;monophasic action potential;catheter ablation;coronarysinus;mitral isthmus","Catheters;Lesions;Atrial fibrillation;Force;Radio frequency;Licenses;Heart","","4","","22","CCBY","27 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The light extraction efficiency and current-voltage (I–V) performance of membrane LEDs is increased in comparison with LEDs with silicon substrate.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2438438","NSFC(grant numbers:11104147,61322112,61401233); Research Projects(grant numbers:2014CB360507,RLD201204,BJ211026,NY213065); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114210","Thin film devices and applications;Light-emitting diodes;Thin-film devices and applications;light-emitting diodes (LEDs)","Light emitting diodes;Silicon;Substrates;Gallium nitride;Epitaxial growth;Optical films","","4","","28","OAPA","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is due to the very high impedance at the gate making impedance matching at the input extremely difficult. S-parameter characterization is performed and the associated small signal model is developed in order to further analyse and extrapolate the source-pull and load-pull measurement results. A good agreement is observed between small signal model simulation results and source-pull/load-pull measurements.

In this paper, a comparison of the space charge distribution as well as the electrical conductivity of four combinations of transformer oil (Kunlun #25 and Nynas oil) and paper (type I from XD factory, type II imported from France) is carried out. The results show that the combination of type II paper and Kunlun oil performs well with minimal charge accumulation inside the materials. To understand the phenomenon, results of space charge measurements and electrical conductivity are associated. A microscopic inspection of two types of paper is conducted to acquire the surface condition of the paper. The relationship between space charge injection quantity and surface condition of the papers is discussed. It is observed that a relatively higher conductivity of oil as well as a smooth, dense surface of paper can suppress space charge in oil paper insulation.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2015.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7281122","Electric conduction;oil paper composition;microstructure;space charge","","","3","","","","2 Oct 2015","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

The dynamic power allocation between the supercapacitor and batteries are obtained through the voltage cascaded control, upon which the high and low frequency power fluctuation are absorbed by the supercapacitors and batteries respectively to fully exploit the advantages of the supercapacitors and batteries. Moreover, the power capacity is scaled up by connecting storage blocks in parallel. A dual droop control scheme for parallel-connected energy storage system and its operation principle is introduced on the aspect of current sharing characteristic and state-of-charging (SOC) management. After detailed analysis and formula derivation, the corresponding loop parameters are designed. Through this control method, the current sharing performance is ensured and each block makes the self-adaptive adjustment according to their SOC. Consequently, the load power can be shared effectively, which helps to avoid the over-charge/over-discharge operation and contributes to the life cycle of the energy storage system. Each module is autonomous controlled without the necessity of communication, which is easy, economic and effective to realize. Finally, the simulation and experimental results are exhibited to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0123-1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018445","Dual droop control;Frequency diving coordinated control;Hybrid energy storage system;Electric vehicle","Batteries;Supercapacitors;State of charge;Voltage control;Power conversion;Frequency control","","3","","23","","28 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Plasmid incompatibility is caused by shared components of copy number control systems, resulting in mutual inhibition of replication. Incompatible plasmids cannot be stably maintained within a host cell. Unilateral incompatibility, in which the plasmid replicons are compatible but one plasmid encodes for the replication inhibitor of the other, leads to rapid displacement of the inhibited plasmid. Thus, we propose that the unilateral incompatibility can be used to eradicate an undesirable plasmid from a population. To investigate this process, we developed deterministic and stochastic models of plasmid dynamics. An analysis of these models provides predictions about the efficacy of plasmid displacement.","2332-7685","","10.1109/LLS.2015.2465839","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7210151","Biological system modeling;genetic engineering;synthetic biology","Sociology;Statistics;Inhibitors;Microorganisms;Mathematical model;Stochastic processes;Predictive models","","3","","9","OAPA","19 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A hybrid coordinated strategy with parameter α, which indicates the proportion of users employing the CoMP-JP scheme, is proposed to apply the CoMP-JP scheme to improve the poorer communication quality of cell edge and employ the CoMP-CB scheme for other users to enhance average throughput and spectral efficiency. This paradigm selects users defined by the certain threshold of signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) corresponding to the parameter α to the CoMP-JP scheme. This paper compares the BER performance between the block diagonalization (BD) based precoding and the linear precoders by maximizing signal to leakage and noise ratio (SLNR), and also indicates that the SLNR based precoding algorithm gets lower BER than the BD based precoding algorithm with certain signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

In this paper we present the analyses we have been doing to minimise the cost, the R&D topics we derived from that and how we combined all this into a coherent proposal which allows us to come up with a system which not only today fits the budgetary constraints of LHCb, but also will allow profiting from any main-stream technological development. We achieve this by aligning our system needs as much as possible to data-centre mass-market commercial of the shelf (COTS) products; by minimising the number of optical interconnects and by optimising the physical layout of the system.

The algorithm can extract the m-D effects according to different behaviors of signals induced by rotational parts and rigid bodies in time-frequency (T-F) domain. However, by removing m-D effects, some useful short time Fourier transform (STFT) samples of rigid bodies are also extracted, which induces the side lobe problem of rigid bodies. A parameter estimation method for rigid bodies after m-D removal is proposed, which can accurately recover rigid bodies and avoid the side lobe problem by only using m-D removal.

The intra-DM employs an optimization-based scheduling algorithm to match the tasks-platforms assignment request with its own platforms. The inter-DM coordinates the exchange of collaborative request information and platforms among DMs using the blackboard architecture.

This paper proposes a quasi-automated generation control (QAGC) strategy to coordinate multiple ESSs, which responds to the grid dispatch demand rather than smoothing out the intermittent power from individual wind farms. The aims of QAGC are to ensure that multiple ESSs provide a service that is as balanced as possible, so more wind power systems at various scales can be accepted by the grid, as well maximizing the low-carbon benefits of ESSs.

Conventional solutions to reduce device failure rates due to cells with permanent faults, such as populating spare rows and relying on error-correcting codes, have had limited success due to high area overheads. In this paper, we propose CIDR, a novel cache-inspired DRAM resilience architecture, which substantially reduces the area overhead of handling bit errors from these faulty cells. A DRAM device adopting CIDR has a small cache next to its I/O pads to replace accesses to the addresses that include the faulty cells with ones that correspond to the cache data array. We minimize the energy overhead of accessing the cache tags for every read or write by adding a Bloom filter in front of the cache. The augmented cache is programmed once during the testing phase and is out of the critical path on normal accesses because both cache and DRAM arrays are accessed in parallel, making CIDR transparent to existing processor-memory interfaces. Compared to the conventional architecture relying on spare rows, CIDR lowers the area overhead of achieving equal failure rates over a wide range of single-bit error rates, such as 23.6 $\times$  lower area overhead for a bit-error rate of 10$^{-5}$  and a device failure rate of 10$^{-3}$ .","1556-6064","","10.1109/LCA.2014.2324894","IDEC; MOTIE(grant numbers:10044735); KSRC(grant numbers:10044735); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6817525","DRAM, error resilience, permanent faults, row and column sparing, Bloom filter, DRAM-side caching","Random access memory;Resilience;Arrays;Decoding;Circuit faults;Testing","","2","1","14","OAPA","16 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The underwater acoustic channel is considered to be one of the most complicated channels because it suffers from more serious multipath effect, fewer available bandwidths and quite complex noise. Since the signals experience a serious distortion after being transmitted through the underwater acoustic channel, the underwater acoustic communication experiences a high bit error rate (BER). To solve this problem, carrier waveform inter-displacement (CWID) modulation is proposed. It has been proved that CWID modulation is an effective method to decrease BER. The linear frequency modulation (LFM) carrier-waves are used in CWID modulation. The performance of the communication using CWID modulation is sensitive to the change of the frequency band of LFM carrier-waves. The immune particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is introduced to search for the optimal frequency band of the LFM carrier-waves, due to its excellent performance in solving complicated optimization problems. The multi-objective and multi-peak optimization nature of the IPSO gives a suitable description of the relationship between the upper band and the lower band of the LFM carrier-waves. Simulations verify the improved performance and effectiveness of the optimization method.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2015.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170003","underwater acoustic communication;carrier waveform inter-displacement (CWID);multi-objective optimization;immune particle swarm optimization (IPSO)","Optimization;Bit error rate;Underwater acoustics;Particle swarm optimization;Phase modulation;Acoustic communication (telecommunication)","","2","","","","28 Jul 2015","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Traditional Coulomb gauge is applied to remove the null space of the curl operator and hence the uniqueness of the solution is guaranteed. However, as the divergence operator cannot act on edge elements (curl-conforming) directly, the magnetic vector potential is represented by nodal elements, which is too restrictive, since both the tangential continuity and the normal continuity are required. Inspired by the mapping of Whitney forms by mathematical operators and Hodge (star) operators, the divergence of the magnetic vector potential, as a whole, can be approximated by Whitney elements. Hence, the magnetic vector potential can be expanded by the edge elements, where its vectorial nature is retained and only the tangential continuity is required. Finally, the original equation can be rewritten in a generalized form and solved in a more natural and accurate way using finite-element method.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2015.2417492","University Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:201209160031,201211159076,201311159188,AoE/P-04/08); Research Grants Council University Grants Committee Hong Kong(grant numbers:GRF17207114,GRF716112,GRF716713); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7072480","Generalized Coulomb gauge;Whitney forms;magnetostatic;finite element method;Finite-element method (FEM);generalized Coulomb gauge;magnetostatic;Whitney forms","Finite element analysis;Equations;Magnetostatics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Vectors;Toroidal magnetic fields;Magnetic anisotropy","","2","","29","OAPA","30 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The operating mode of power converters consists of several operating stages in one switching period. Each operating stage refers to a sub-circuit or equivalent circuit where different sub-circuits are switched in a fixed order according to the control strategy design. Power converter may operate in different operating modes even with the same control scheme, for example, the DC-DC converter has differing performance under the continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). Thus, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the converter's characteristics in advance to avoid undesired operation in practice. In this paper, the power converter is considered as a graph made up of several meshes. All sub-circuits in power converter can then be obtained by the mesh combination algorithm, and the operating mode can be constructed by considering the preset switching ON/OFF scheme. Ultimately, the typical waveforms in different modes can be predicted, which is useful to identify abnormal phenomena. Cúk converter is taken as an example to demonstrate the proposed multiple mode analysis method. It is found that there are four kinds of phenomena in addition to the well-known CCM and DCM. Finally, the experimental results are provided and show good agreement with the theoretical analysis.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2015.7933139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933139","Graph theory;multiple modes;power converter;sub-circuit;cúk","Equivalent circuits;Switching circuits;Switches;Topology;Power electronics;Graph theory","","2","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

First, through technology computer-aided design simulation with no percolation, both a minimum ΔVth and a critical curve in a mloc - σloc plot are produced. The former constitutes a statistical distribution far away from the conventional log-normal one. In the latter, mloc and σloc are the mean and the standard deviation, respectively, of a well-known normal variable in Mueller-Schulz's percolation theory. The critical mloc - σloc curve divides the plot into the allowed region and the forbidden region and will go down with increasing gate size. Then, ΔVth contours in the allowed region are graphically created. While applying to existing experimental ΔVth statistical distributions of SiON- and high-k metal gate (HKMG)-scaled FETs, resulting paired mloc and σloc at high ΔVth remain intact, regardless of gate size or gate stack type. This means that the underlying percolation patterns resemble each other, due to the same manufacturing process used. However, if these paired mloc and σloc fall in the forbidden region, it is the critical mloc - σloc curve dominating. Application to bias and temperature instability statistical data in literature is straightforwardly well done.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2015.2388787","National Science Council of Taiwan(grant numbers:NSC 101-2221-E-009-057-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7003972","Bias and temperature instability (BTI);field-effect transistors (FETs);fluctuations;percolation;random telegraph signals (RTSs);technology computer-aided design (TCAD);trap;Bias and temperature instability (BTI);field-effect transistors (FETs);fluctuations;percolation;random telegraph signals (RTSs);technology computer-aided design (TCAD);trap","Logic gates;Field effect transistors;Noise;Statistical distributions;Graphics;Standards","","2","1","13","OAPA","7 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This built-in substrate bias, stemming mainly from the large discrepancy in bandgap between Ge and Si, pulls the carriers toward the channel/BOX interface and thus degrades the DIBL of the GeOI PFET beyond what permittivity predicts.

The slope of ln(μ) as a function of 1/T2 dramatically changed before and after the critical temperature Tc of 283 K. Using the variable range hopping theoretical mode, a new trap-filling factor (FF) was proposed as a key parameter to illustrate the effect of the trap on the mobility. According to FF, there are three regions. When FF ≫ 1 and FF≪1, the carrier behavior follows the Fermi and Boltzmann distributions, respectively. When FF~1, the derived transition temperature of 282.4 K represents a transition point from Fermi to Boltzmann distribution, which is consistent with Tc in the experiment. Finally, a universal dependence of ln(μ) on T was concluded based on FF in a disordered system with traps.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2423561","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271066); Foundation of Independent innovation of Tianjin University(grant numbers:60302070); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7086286","Carrier mobility;Time-of-flight technique;trap-filling factor;Fermi distribution;Boltzmann distribution;Carrier mobility;time-of-flight technique;trap-filling factor;Fermi distribution;Boltzmann distribution","Nanocrystals;Indium phosphide;Energy states;Polymers;Temperature dependence;Transient analysis;Boltzmann distribution","","2","","29","OAPA","15 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A domain is defined to represent the VHDL modules that will be verified; these modules will be transformed into Verilog models and be verified by SMV tools. By analyzing the verification results of SMV, deadlocks can be found; after looking back to the VHDL code, the deadlocking code is located and the problem is solved. VHDL verification is particularly important in safety-critical software. As an example, our solution is applied to a Multifunction Vehicle Bus Controller (MVBC) system for a train. The safety properties were tested well in the development stage, but experienced a breakdown during the long-term software testing stage, which was mainly caused by deadlocks in the VHDL software. In this special case, we managed to locate the VHDL deadlocks and solve the problem by the FPGA deadlock detection approach provided in this paper, which demonstrates that our solution works well.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2015.7085635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7085635","Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA);VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL);verification;deadlocks;Multifunction Vehicle Bus Controller (MVBC)","System recovery;Hardware design languages;Automata;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Monitoring;Software","","2","","","","23 Apr 2015","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To examine such interactions, two different methods have been published: 1) sophisticated device simulations and 2) carefully calibrated experiments. To provide a more transparent understanding, we propose a third method in terms of two criteria: 1) one for the occurrence of the plasmon resonance and 2) the other for the strength of the plasmons. The former is determined based on our published dragged mobility data due to the interface plasmons and the bulk plasmons in gate. The latter makes use of our more recently experimentally extracted potential fluctuations due to plasmons in crystalline silicon. The effects of the temperature on the criteria are considered. It is a straightforward task to confirm that for a channel density larger than approximately 5 × 1012 cm-2, the source and drain plasmons act as key limiters in silicon device scaling. Therefore, the underlying device physics, modeling, simulations, experimental analyses, and data interpretation may be inaccurate if the limiting factors are not incorporated.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2015.2389261","National Science Council of Taiwan(grant numbers:NSC 101-2221-E-009-057-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7003971","Drag;field-effect transistors (FETs);fluctuations;long-range Coulomb interactions;plasmon;resonance;scaling;transport;Drag;field-effect transistors (FETs);fluctuations;long-range Coulomb interactions;plasmon;resonance;scaling;transport","Plasmons;Fluctuations;Electric potential;Silicon;Logic gates;Three-dimensional displays;Field effect transistors","","1","","10","OAPA","7 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to ensure algorithm performance, they are typically stored in high-precision formats; this results in a large storage footprint, rendering redistribution costly and difficult. Since for most image and vision applications, pixel values are quantized to 8 bits by the acquisition apparatuses, we show that it is possible to construct a fixed-width, effectively lossless representation of the bases vectors, in the sense that reconstructions from the original bases and from the quantized bases never deviate by more than half of the quantization step-size. In addition to directly applying this result to losslessly compress individual models, we also propose an algorithm to compress appearance models by utilizing prior information on the modeled objects in the form of prior appearance subspaces. Experiments conducted on the compression of person-specific face appearance models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2015.7173455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173455","data compression;principal component analysis;appearance modeling","Quantization (signal);Data models;Computational modeling;Image coding;Analytical models;Training;Image reconstruction","","1","","","","3 Aug 2015","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

This poor network performance has a negative impact on customer experience and satisfaction, which may result in increased churn for CDMA wireless carriers. Previous research on the impact of dirty devices has used computer-based simulations. This paper demonstrates the influence of dirty devices on a live commercial CDMA network using two distinct approaches. The first approach deploys dirty and non-dirty devices in a live commercial cell, and measures the impact on forward base transceiver station (BTS) power and forward link Ec/Io (Ec is the received pilot chip energy and Io is the spectral density of the total power seen by the device). A series of tests on a live CDMA network with known dirty devices shows an increase in BTS transmit power resources compared with non-dirty devices, leading to the degradation of forward link Ec/Io. The second approach uses a statistical study of the aggregated pilot strength measurement messages reported by the mobile to ascertain the impact of known dirty devices on the overall network Ec/Io of non-dirty devices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2441033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7123711","CDMA;cellular;dirty devices","Cellular phones;Receivers;Cellular networks;Multiaccess communication;Power measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication","","1","","10","OAPA","15 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is more useful in situations when cost of technical difficulties is involved or uniqueness of the situation under study makes it difficult/impossible to cover enough observations to quantify the models with real data. Consequently, experts provide opinions in terms of basic probability assignment for focal elements. Usually, it is seen that experts provide basic probability assignment for interval (or crisp) focal elements. However, due to presence of uncertainty focal elements can sometimes be treated as normal/generalized triangular fuzzy number (TFN in short) instead of intervals or crisp sets. TFN encodes only most likely value (mode) and the spread. This paper presents an attempt to combine Dempster-Shafer structures (DSS in short) with generalized/normal fuzzy focal elements using possibilistic sampling technique. To this end, human health risk assessment is carried out under such setting.","1616-8666","","10.1016/j.fiae.2015.03.002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10474424","Fuzzy focal elements;Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence;Generalized/normal fuzzy number;Risk analysis","Uncertainty;Costs;Shape;Evidence theory;Decision making;Mathematical models;Data models","","1","","26","","18 Mar 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

"Incipient mixing by Marangoni effects in slow viscous flow of two immiscible fluid layers","L. M. Rickett; R. Penfold; M. G. Blyth; R. Purvis; M. J. Cooker",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics,"18 Jan 2018","2015","80","5","1582","1618","Ignoring inertia, a deformable interface separating two fluid films is considered, subject to non-uniform tension driven by the solutal Marangoni effect in the presence of a scalar concentration field. Detailed description of adsorption kinetics is abrogated by a simple ansatz directly relating interfacial tension and bulk solute concentration. Consequently, the formal mathematical treatment and some of the results share features in common with the Rayleigh–Bénard–Marangoni thermocapillary problem. Normal mode perturbation analysis in the limit of small interface deformations establishes the existence of an unstable response for low wavenumber excitation. In the classification of Cross & Hohenberg (1993, Pattern formation outside of equilibrium. Rev. Mod. Phys., 65, 851–1112), both type I and type II behaviour are observed. By considering the zero wavenumber situation exactly, it is proved that all eigenvalues are purely imaginary with non-positive imaginary part; hence, a type III instability is not possible. For characteristic timescales of mass diffusion much shorter than the relaxation time of interfacial fluctuations (infinite crispation number): the response growth rate is obtained explicitly; only a single excitation mode is available, and a complete stability diagram is constructed in terms of the relevant control parameters. Otherwise, from a quiescent base state, an infinite discrete spectrum of modes is observed that exhibit avoided crossing and switching phenomena, as well as exceptional points where stationary state pairs coalesce into a single oscillatory standing wave pattern. A base state plane Poiseuille flow, driven by an external pressure gradient, generally exaggerates the response: growth rates of instabilities are enhanced, and stable decay is further suppressed with increasing base flow speed, but the inherent symmetry breaking destroys stationary and standing wave response. Results are obtained in this most general situation by implementing a numerical Chebyshev collocation scheme. The model was motivated by hydrodynamic processes supposed to be involved in gastric digestion of humans.","1464-3634","","10.1093/imamat/hxv009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8180181","liquid–liquid interface;Gibbs elasticity;Stokes flow;linear stability analysis;generalized eigenvalue problem;collocation method;avoided crossing;exceptional point","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Firstly, the signal vector based on the signal passing through a set of partial matched filters (PMFs) is built. Then, wavelet domain filtering is performed on the signal vector value. Since the correlation signal is low in frequency and narrow in bandwidth, the noise out-of-band can be filtered out and the most of the useful signal energy is retained. Thus this process greatly improves the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Finally, the detection variable when the filtered signal goes through the combination process is constructed and the detection based on signal energy is made. Moreover, for the better retaining useful signal energy, the rule of selection of wavelet function has been made. Simulation results show the proposed method has a better detection performance than the normal code acquisition methods under the same false alarm probability.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2015.00127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7375748","code acquisition;wavelet transform;filtering;detection probability","Wavelet transforms;Signal to noise ratio;Discrete cosine transforms;Wavelet domain;Correlation;Bandwidth allocation","","1","","","","11 Jan 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

However, the role of mTOR in radio-resistance has not been fully investigated. Therefore, the effect of mTOR on the radio-resistance of cancer cells under hypoxia was evaluated using the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. Clonogenic survival was examined in the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line under normoxia or hypoxia, with or without temsirolimus. An oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) was calculated using the D 10 values, the doses giving 10% survival. Western blotting was performed to investigate the effect of temsirolimus on mTOR and the HIF-1α pathway under normoxia and hypoxia. A549 cells showed a radio-resistance of 5.1 and 14.2 Gy, as indicated by D 10 values under normoxia and hypoxia, respectively; the OER was 2.8. The cell survival rates under hypoxia and with temsirolimus remarkably decreased compared with those under normoxia. The D 10 values of the cells under normoxia and hypoxia were 4.8 and 5.4 Gy, respectively (OER = 1.1). mTOR expression was suppressed by temsirolimus under both normoxia and hypoxia. HIF-1α expression decreased under hypoxia in the presence of temsirolimus. These results suggest that temsirolimus can overcome the radio-resistance induced by hypoxia. When the fact that mTOR acts upstream of HIF-1α is considered, our data suggest that the restoration of radiation sensitivity by temsirolimus under hypoxia may be associated with the suppression of the HIF-1α pathway. Temsirolimus could therefore be used as a hypoxic cell radio-sensitizer.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155203","hypoxia;radiation;mTOR;HIF-1α;radio-sensitizer","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Archaean continental crust is dominated by rocks of the trondhjemite–tonalite–granodiorite (TTG) suite. These can be divided into (1) a mid- to late Archaean (∼3·5–2·5 Ga) suite with low SiO2 and high MgO, Sr and transition element contents, and (2) an Eoarchaean (>3·5 Ga) suite with higher SiO2 and lower MgO, Sr and transition element concentrations. Cenozoic adakites are considered to be compositionally similar to mid- to late Archaean (∼3·5–2·5 Ga) TTGs, but not the oldest TTG rocks. Conversely, a suite of Early Eocene adakite-like rhyodacites (Jamaican-type adakites: JTA) from Jamaica are shown to be geochemically similar to the Eoarchaean TTGs. In contrast to newly discovered JTA-like rocks (Ryozen low Sr/Y) in Japan, new trace element and Nd–Hf radiogenic isotope data in this study confirm that the Jamaican JTA cannot be formed by complex mixing, assimilation and fractional crystallization processes. New partial melt models here explore several different source compositions (mid-ocean ridge basalt, ocean island basalt and oceanic plateau), mineral modes, melt modes and partition coefficients. The results of these models clearly demonstrate that the JTA and the Eoarchaean TTG can be generated by partial melting of plagioclase- and garnet-bearing amphibolite source regions with oceanic plateau-like compositions. Further modelling shows that the JTA and Eoarchaean TTG low MgO and transition element abundances can be derived from two dominant processes: (1) relatively shallow partial melting of subducting oceanic crust (compositionally similar to Mesozoic oceanic plateau basalt) whereby the slab melts ascend without interacting with a mantle wedge; (2) partial melting of oceanic plateau-like subducting oceanic crust followed by interaction of the slab melts with a thin and/or discontinuous (boudinage-like?) mantle wedge whereby the expected increase of MgO, Ni, and Cr in the slab melts is obliterated by fractional crystallization of ferromagnesian minerals (mostly amphibole). Consequently, using the JTA as a modern analogue for Eoarchaean TTG production, we propose the existence of subduction zones consuming oceanic plateau-like oceanic crust in Eoarchaean times.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egv029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8183791","early Archaean (Eoarchaean) continental crust;high-Nb basalts;Jamaican-type adakite (JTA);mantle metasomatism;oceanic plateau subduction;trondhjemite–tonalite–granodiorite (TTG)","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A total of 17 patients with locally advanced NPC treated with IMRT had a second computed tomography (CT) scan after 17 fractions in order to apply and continue the treatment with an adapted plan after 20 fractions. To simulate the situation without adaptation, a hybrid plan was generated by applying the optimization parameters of the original treatment plan to the anatomy of the second CT scan. The dose–volume histograms (DVHs) and dose statistics of the hybrid plan and the adapted plan were compared. The mean volume of the ipsilateral and contralateral parotid gland decreased by 6.1 cm3 (30.5%) and 5.4 cm3 (24.3%), respectively. Compared with the hybrid plan, the adapted plan provided a higher dose to the target volumes with better homogeneity, and a lower dose to the organs at risk (OARs). The Dmin of all planning target volumes (PTVs) increased. The Dmax of the spinal cord and brainstem were lower in 94% of the patients (1.6–5.9 Gy, P < 0.001 and 2.1–9.9 Gy, P < 0.001, respectively). The D mean of the contralateral parotid decreased in 70% of the patients (range, 0.2–4.4 Gy). We could not find a relationship between dose variability and weight loss.

The aim of the present study was to clarify the details of the antioxidative functions of HST against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by radiation. The hydroxyl radical (•OH)–scavenging ability and the reduction ability was simultaneously measured using a modified electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-trapping method. The superoxide (O 2 •−)–scavenging ability was estimated by an EPR redox probing method. Water suspensions of powdered HST and of its seven constitutive crude drugs were tested. In addition, some of the main water-soluble ingredients of the crude drugs were also tested. HST was found to scavenge both •OH and O 2 •−. Furthermore, HST was observed to reduce relatively stable nitroxyl radicals. Glycyrrhizae Radix (kanzo), Ginseng Radix (ninjin), Zizyphi Fructus (taiso) and glycyrrhizin (an ingredient of kanzo) were all found to be relatively good •OH scavengers. Scutellariae Radix (ogon) and Coptidis Rhizoma (oren) demonstrated reducing ability. In addition, acteoside and berberine chloride, which are water-soluble ingredients of ogon and oren, respectively, also demonstrated reducing ability. Oren exhibited oxidative ability at higher concentrations, which may have a function in maintaining catalytic redox action. The antioxidative function of HST probably worked via a balance of scavenging ROS, reducing stable free radicals, and some minor oxidizing activities.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155205","hangeshashinto (HST);oral mucositis (OM);electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR);radiation; reactive oxygen species","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The ∼497 Ma Leka Ophiolite Complex (Norway) comprises a section of early Palaeozoic (Iapetus) oceanic lithosphere with well-exposed mantle and lower crustal sections and generally low degrees of serpentinization. The Leka upper mantle section is heterogeneous at the centimetre to metre scale, manifested by abundant dunite lenses and sheets in harzburgitic host-rock, especially within ∼500 m of the palaeo Moho. Abundant chromitite (≥60 vol. % Cr-spinel) and pyroxenite lenses and layers also occur in the uppermost 200–300 m of the mantle section. These diverse mantle lithologies probably developed in a suprasubduction-zone (SSZ) setting, as a result of fluid-assisted melt extraction, offering an opportunity to interrogate the nature of chemical heterogeneities developed in such rocks. At ∼497 Ma, the Os isotopic compositions of Leka harzburgites averaged ∼2% more radiogenic than the projected average for abyssal peridotites at that time, yet they exhibit nearly chondritic relative abundances of the highly siderophile elements (HSE). Several of the harzburgites are characterized by low initial 187Os/188Os (<0·121), reflecting Proterozoic melt depletion. Preservation of Os isotopic compositions consistent with ancient (<0·5 to 2 Ga) melt depletion episodes is a common characteristic of melt-depleted oceanic peridotites. There is no clear evidence that SSZ melt extraction had a discernible impact on the bulk Os isotopic composition of the Iapetus oceanic mantle, as represented by the Leka harzburgites. By contrast, non-harzburgitic lithologies are generally characterized by more radiogenic initial 187Os/188Os and more variable HSE abundances. The dunites, chromitites and pyroxenites of the LOC can be separated into two groups on the basis of their trace element geochemistry and the Re-Os isotope errorchrons that they define, yielding ages of 485 ± 32 Ma and 589 ± 15 Ma, respectively. The former age corresponds, within error, to the accepted age of the ophiolite (497 ± 2 Ma). The meaning of the latter age is uncertain, but possibly corresponds to the early stages of Iapetus opening. The Leka ophiolite reveals the importance of oceanic lithosphere formation processes for mantle heterogeneity at metre to kilometre scales, but also emphasizes the robustness of Os isotopes in recording older melt-depletion events.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egv055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8184809","Iapetus Ocean;Leka Ophiolite Complex;highly siderophile elements;Re–Os isotopes;mantle heterogeneity","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The 3-year cumulative incidences of late Grade 2 or higher rectal toxicity and urinary toxicity were 13% and 4.8% in the aged group and 7.0% and 1.2% in the younger group, respectively. There was no significant difference between the aged group and the younger group in the cumulative incidence rates of rectal toxicity or urinary toxicity. No patients exhibited Grade 4 or higher toxicity, and all patients improved with conservative therapy. Helical tomotherapy in super-elderly patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer had good biochemical control rates without severe late toxicity. Definitive helical tomotherapy may be the treatment of choice for patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer, even in those older than 80 years of age.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155354","prostate cancer;helical tomotherapy (TOMO);intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT);super-elderly patients","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For this type of fault the sequence networks are connected in series and solved to obtain the sequence currents and voltages at the fault point. These are then used to determine the symmetrical component voltages at the other bus bars and the symmetrical component currents in the lines. The phase quantities are obtained by transformation. In this approach, the connection of the sequence networks must be known for the fault. In contrast, the solution by the general method of fault admittance matrix does not require prior knowledge of how the sequence networks are connected. It is therefore more versatile than the classical methods. It does however require the fault admittance matrix at the fault point. For a line-to-ground fault, of zero impedance, the fault admittance matrix is infinite and has to be simulated. The paper presents a procedure for simulating the short circuit, a requirement for using the general fault admittance method. The results obtained are as accurate as those obtained using the classical approaches.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2015.8531484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531484","Unbalanced faults analysis;Line-to-ground fault;Fault admittance matrix;short circuit simulation;delta earthed-star transformer","Circuit faults;Admittance;Bars;Symmetric matrices;Fault currents;Impedance;Power systems","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

A novel method for joint estimation of Doppler frequency, two-dimensional (2D) direction of departure and 2D direction of arrival based on the propagator method (PM) for arbitrary arrays is discussed. A special matrix is constructed to eliminate the influence of spatial colored noise. The four-dimensional (4D) angle and Doppler frequency are extracted from the matrix and the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of the targets are then calculated on the basis of these angles. The proposed algorithm provides a lower computational complexity and has a parameter estimation very close to that of the ESPRIT algorithm and the DOA-matrix algorithm in the high signal to noise ratio and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is given. Furthermore, multi-dimensional parameters can be automatically paired by this algorithm to avoid performance degradation resulting from wrong pairing.

Clinical data on S-RT were gathered in questionnaires completed by facilities participating in the Japanese Radiation Oncology Study Group. S-RT was defined as external-beam radiotherapy delivered to the prostate beds of patients with prostate cancer who had eventually developed PSA failure, although their PSA values had at one stage attained levels <0.2 ng/ml following RP. Hormonal therapy was combined with S-RT in ∼40% of cases. Outcomes were evaluated in 186 cases treated via S-RT alone. The nadir PSA level after RP, and the level upon initiation of S-RT, were 0.0135 ng/ml and 0.292 ng/ml, respectively. The median period between RP and S-RT was 18.6 months. The median follow-up period was 58 months. The 5-year PSA recurrence–free survival (PRFS) and clinical failure–free survival (CFFS) rates were 50.1% (95% CI: 42.8–57.9%) and 90.1% (95% CI: 86.4–95.7%), respectively.

In IVFM, the membership values of rows and columns are crisp, i.e., rows and columns are certain. But, in many real life situations they are also uncertain. So to model these types of uncertain problems, a new type of interval-valued fuzzy matrices (IVFMs) are called interval-valued fuzzy matrices with interval-valued fuzzy rows and columns (IVFMFRCs). For these matrices, null, identity, equality, etc. are defined along with some binary operators. Complement and density of IVFMFRC are defined and several important properties are investigated.

To overcome this problem, a joint user selection and rate adaptation scheme is developed based on the water-filling rate adaptation with the given user set and the power saving criterion with the allocated rates. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with the norm-based and semi-orthogonal user selection algorithms, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the total power consumption.

Inverse planned arc-therapy (VMAT) was compared with a forward-planned multi-segment technique with a mono-isocenter (MONOISO). Ten files were planned per technique, delivering a 50-Gy dose to the breast and 46.95 Gy to nodes, within 25 fractions. Comparative endpoints were planning target volume (PTV) coverage, dose to surrounding structures, and treatment delivery time. PTV coverage, homogeneity and conformality were better for two arc VMAT plans; V95%PTV-Twas 96% for VMAT vs 89.2% for MONOISO. Homogeneity index (HI)PTV-Twas 0.1 and HIPTV-Nwas 0.1 for VMAT vs 0.6 and 0.5 for MONOISO. Treatment delivery time was reduced by a factor of two using VMAT relative to MONOISO (84 s vs 180 s). High doses to organs at risk were reduced (V30left lung= 14% using VMAT vs 24.4% with MONOISO; dose to 2% of the volume (D2%)heart= 26.1 Gy vs 32 Gy), especially to the left coronary artery (LCA) (D2%LCA= 34.4 Gy vs 40.3 Gy). However, VMAT delivered low doses to a larger volume, including contralateral organs (mean dose [Dmean]right lung= 4 Gy and Dmeanright breast= 3.2 Gy). These were better protected using MONOISO plans (Dmeanright lung= 0.8 Gy and Dmeanright breast= 0.4 Gy). VMAT improved PTV coverage and dose homogeneity, but clinical benefits remain unclear. Decreased dose exposure to the LCA may be clinically relevant. VMAT could be used for complex treatments that are difficult with conventional techniques. Patient age should be considered because of uncertainties concerning secondary malignancies.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155360","breast cancer;VMAT;field-in-field;left coronary artery","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Between September 2010 and June 2014, patients who were diagnosed as Stage I lung cancer and treated with SBRT at our institution were included in this study. A total of 78 patients (47 males with a median age of 80 years) were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 23 months. Five patients (6.4%) developed OP at 6–18 months after SBRT. The cumulative incidence of OP was 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1–11.0) and 8.2% (95% CI, 2.9–17.0) at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Tumor location (superior and middle lobe vs inferior lobe) was shown to be a borderline significant factor for the occurrence of OP (P= 0.069). In the subgroup analysis of patients with a radiographic follow-up period at least 6 months, or who died within 6 months after SBRT, 7 of 72 patients (9.7%) developed Grade 2 or 3 radiation pneumonitis (G2/3 RP) at 2–4 months after SBRT. A statistically significant association between G2/3 RP in the subacute phase and OP was shown (P= 0.040). In two of the five patients who developed OP, the symptoms and radiographic change were improved rapidly by corticosteroid administration. One patient had relapsed OP after suspending the treatment and re-administration was required. Three patients with minor symptoms were managed without corticosteroid administration and OP resolved without any relapse. The radiation-induced OP should be considered as one of the late lung injuries after SBRT for lung tumors.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155358","organizing pneumonia;BOOP syndrome;radiation pneumonitis;stereotactic body radiotherapy;stereotactic ablative radiotherapy;lung cancer;lung tumor","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The study of temporal decorrelation is challenging, especially for the bistatic configuration, since temporal decorrelation is related to the data acquisition geometry. To develop an appropriate theoretical model for BSAR interferometry, the existing models for monostatic SAR cases are extended, and the general BSAR geometry configuration is involved in the derivation. Therefore, the developed temporal decorrelation model can be seen as a general model. The validity of the theoretical model is supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the impacts of the system parameters and BSAR geometry configurations on the temporal decorrelation model are discussed briefly.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2015.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064095","temporal decorrelation;bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BSAR);interferometry;geometry configuration","Decorrelation;Bistatic radar;Interferometry;Synthetic aperture radar;Temporal decorrelation model","","","","","","20 Mar 2015","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Computed tomography (CT) images were registered, and EBRT and ICBT dose distributions were determined. Cumulative D 2cm 3, D 1cm 3 and D 0.1cm 3 were calculated by simple addition of fractional values or by DIR. The accuracy of DIR was evaluated by means of a virtual phantom mimicking the rectum. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was calculated to evaluate rectal contour concordance between CT images before and after DIR. Virtual phantom analysis revealed that the average difference between the DIR-based phantom D mean and the simple phantom D mean was 1.9 ± 2.5 Gy (EQD 2 ), and the DIR method included an uncertainty of ∼8.0%. The mean DSC between reference CT and CT was significantly improved after DIR (EBRT: 0.43 vs 0.85, P < 0.005; ICBT: 0.60 vs 0.87, P < 0.005).

Simulations were performed using the Monte Carlo code Geant4 to determine enhancement in absorption of low- versus high-energy X-rays by Pt and to determine dose enhancement factors (DEFs) for a Pt-sensitized tumor phantom. In vitrostudies were carried out using Typ-Pt and again with carboplatin due to the unexpected in vivotoxicity of Typ-Pt. Cell survival was determined using clonogenic assays. In agreement with computations and simulations, in vitrodata showed up to one log unit reduction in surviving fractions (SFs) of cells treated with 1–4 µg/ml of Typ-Pt and irradiated with 160-kV versus 6-MV X-rays. DEFs showed radiosensitization in the 50–200 keV range, which fell to approximate unity at higher energies, suggesting marginal interactions at MeV energies. Cells sensitized with 1–5 or 7 µg/ml of carboplatin and then irradiated also showed a significant decrease (P< 0.05) in SFs. However, it was unlikely this was due to increased interactions. Theoretical and in vitrostudies presented here demonstrated that the tumoricidal activity of low-energy X-rays was greater than that of high-energy X-rays against Pt-sensitized tumor cells. Determining whether radiosensitization is a function of increased interactions will require additional studies.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8172531","comparison of 160-kV vs 6-MV X-rays;platinum radiosensitization;F98 rat glioma;B16 murine melanoma;dose enhancement factor","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These serve to improve the awareness of the situation, and to lead the necessary assessment to ensure the collection of quality data, especially under difficult circumstances such as natural disasters. These approaches rely massively on automated gathering of qualified information. To reach this objective, two challenges must be addressed. The first challenge consists of achieving sufficient autonomy, both in terms of navigation and interpretation of the data, which will be turned into technical and scientific advances. The second challenge concerns the reliability of systems (for example, unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) being implemented from the point of view of the danger they may pose to the environment in which they operate. The design and development of new embedded architectures enable UAVs to be more autonomous, while mitigating the harm they can potentially cause. In this context, modeling, simulation, and various techniques of formal verification are used in order to validate the critical aspects of a platform, to increase its reliability and resilience. However, it is also necessary to take care of non-technical issues. Another consequence of the development of these new approaches is thus their impact on the preservation of privacy, and more generally, legal and administrative concerns. Taking into account aspects that are not normally our scientific and technological areas, such as, for example, the respect for the rights of the victim (privacy), must therefore be carried out jointly with the work of security (safety).","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2015.7909469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7909469","","Drones;Disaster management;Law;Context;Safety;Privacy","","","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

Since our appointment, we have participated in the organization ofthe General Lectures at the AT-RASC in Gran Canaria, and some of us participated as organizers of special sessions at that conference. We also provided advice on ways to improve the visibility of URSI, and on the future ofthe Radio Science Bulletin (RSB). It was great to see that our conclusions on the latter aligned well with the steps that Ross Stone was already taking to bring the RSB to a higher level. One ofthe initiatives he introduced in that context was to start a series of columns. We are very happy to see that one of these columns is specifically dedicated to the ECR Committee.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2015.7909475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7909475","","Engineering profession;Electronic mail;Conferences;Radio astronomy;Physics;Voting","","","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","URSI","URSI Journals"
"Subjective voice quality, communicative ability and swallowing after definitive radio(chemo)therapy, laryngectomy plus radio(chemo)therapy, or organ conservation surgery plus radio(chemo)therapy for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer","M.

A validated questionnaire including items and components for the assessment of communicative ability, quality of voice and swallowing was sent to 129 patients. All patients were treated between 1998 and 2007. A total of 76 patients (58.9%) with carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx replied to the questionnaire. Data was evaluated retrospectively. Therapy delivered was definitive radio(chemo)therapy (defchRT/RT) (21/76, 28%), laryngectomy + radio(chemo)therapy (LE + chRT/RT) (28/76, 37%), or larynx conservation surgery + radio(chemo)therapy (LCS + chRT/RT) (27/76, 36%). Radiotherapy was administered using 2D- or 3D-conformal planning. The most common concomitant chemotherapy delivered was cisplatin + 5FU. For statistical analyses of the components, averages were calculated and tested using the Kruskal–Wallis test and the U-test of Mann and Whitney. Differences were assessed by the Monte Carlo method or Fisher's exact test. The single item rates were compared with Fisher's exact test. Mean follow-up was 56.7 months (range, 8–130 months). After defchRT/RT, patients trended towards more substantial–strong hoarseness compared with LCS + chRT/RT (P= 0.2). After LE, patients were dissatisfied with their artificial larynx/electrolarynx and the tone of their voice (P= 0.3, P= 0.07) and communicative ability (P= 0.005, P= 0.008) compared with those treated with defchRT/RT and LCS + chRT/RT, respectively. Dysphagia and additional percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding were more frequent after defchRT/RT in comparison with the other two groups (P< 0.05). Voice quality and communicative ability were slightly worse after defchRT/RT and LE + chRT/RT, but satisfying with all treatment modalities. Further development of the therapy approach is necessary to reduce long-term side effects, with measures of post-treatment function as important endpoints.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8172537","radiation;surgery;quality of voice;dysphagia","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Beheshti",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2015","56","5","792","803","Age plays a crucial role in the interplay between tumor and host, with additional impact due to irradiation. Proton irradiation of tumors induces biological modulations including inhibition of angiogenic and immune factors critical to ‘hallmark’ processes impacting tumor development. Proton irradiation has also provided promising results for proton therapy in cancer due to targeting advantages. Additionally, protons may contribute to the carcinogenesis risk from space travel (due to the high proportion of high-energy protons in space radiation). Through a systems biology approach, we investigated how host tissue (i.e. splenic tissue) of tumor-bearing mice was altered with age, with or without whole-body proton exposure. Transcriptome analysis was performed on splenic tissue from adolescent (68-day) versus old (736-day) C57BL/6 male mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells with or without three fractionations of 0.5 Gy (1-GeV) proton irradiation. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that proton irradiation of adolescent hosts caused significant signaling changes within splenic tissues that support carcinogenesis within the mice, as compared with older subjects. Increases in cell cycling and immunosuppression in irradiated adolescent hosts with CDK2, MCM7, CD74and RUVBL2indicated these were the key genes involved in the regulatory changes in the host environment response (i.e. the spleen). Collectively, these results suggest that a significant biological component of proton irradiation is modulated by host age through promotion of carcinogenesis in adolescence and resistance to immunosuppression, carcinogenesis and genetic perturbation associated with advancing age.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150247","aging and cancer;protons;spleen;tumor progression;tumor microenvironment;bioinformatics;immunosuppression;transcriptome analysis","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of n= 238 patients with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus treated with definitive radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy at our institution between 2000 and 2012. Patients of all stages were included to represent actual clinical routine. We performed univariate and multivariate analysis to identify prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Moreover, treatment-related toxicity and patterns of recurrence were assessed. Patients recieved either chemo-radiation (64%), radiotherapy plus cetuximab (10%) or radiotherapy alone (26%). In 69%, a boost was applied, resulting in a median cumulative dose of 55.8 Gy; the remaining 31% received a median total dose of 50 Gy. For the entire cohort, the median OS and PFS were 15.0 and 11.0 months, respectively. In multivariate analysis, important prognostic factors for OS and PFS were T stage (OS: P= 0.005; PFS: P= 0.006), M stage (OS: P= 0.015; PFS: P= 0.003), concomitant chemotherapy (P< 0.001) and radiation doses of >55 Gy (OS: P= 0.019; PFS: P= 0.022). Recurrences occurred predominantly as local in-field relapse or distant metastases. Toxicity was dominated by nutritional impairment (12.6% with G3/4 dysphagia) and chemo-associated side effects. Definitive chemo-radiation in patients with esophageal cancer results in survival rates comparable with surgical treatment approaches. However, local and distant recurrence considerably restrict prognosis. Further advances in radio-oncological treatment strategies are necessary for improving outcome.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155204","esophageal cancer;radiotherapy;definitive chemo-radiation;prognostic factors;toxicity","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Timbre components are employed as the model’s main feature. To compute timbre similarity, extracting the spectrum features for each frame is necessary; the large set of frames is clustered using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and expectation maximization. The typical spectra frame from GMM is drawn as data points, and MR assigns each data point a relative ranking score, which is treated as a distance instead of as traditional similarity metrics based on pair-wise distance. Furthermore, the MR algorithm can be easily generalized by adding positive and negative examples from the RF algorithm and improves the final result. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively improves the ranking capabilities of existing distance functions.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2015.7350013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350013","audio information retrieval; manifold ranking; relevance feedback","Radio frequency;Manifolds;Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Semantics;Information retrieval","","","","","","17 Dec 2015","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Histologically, 36 cases had squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and 55 cases had adenocarcinoma (AC), including 13 with adenosquamous cell carcinoma. The number of cases with Stage IIB, IIIB and IVA disease was 21, 59 and 11, respectively. Of the 91 cases, 42 had positive pelvic lymph nodes (PLNs). The median tumor size was 6.0 cm (range, 3.0–12.0 cm). The median follow-up duration for all cases was 40 months (range, 7–181 months). A total of 40 cases developed distant failure as the first site of failure: 13 of 36 (36.1%) SqCC cases had distant failure, with 9 of them with para-aortic lymph node (PALN) failure; 27 of 55 (44.0%) AC cases had distant failure, and 23 of them had distant failure excluding PALN metastasis. Distant failure rates of SqCC cases who had positive and negative PLNs before C-ion RT were 61.1% and 11.1%, respectively (P = 0.0045). Those of AC cases were 54.2% and 45.2%, respectively (P = 0.507). In conclusion, there were high rates of distant failure after C-ion RT in AC cases regardless of PLN status, and there were high rates of distant failure after C-ion RT, especially PALN failure, in SqCC cases with positive PLNs.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150149","carbon-ion radiotherapy;uterine cervical cancer;distant failure;adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix;para-aortic lymph node metastasis","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

CuMn alloy (0~10 atomic % Mn) deposited on SiO2 and Ta were used in this paper. A diffusion barrier layer self-formed at the interface during annealing, and the growth behavior was found to follow a logarithmic rate law. The microstructures of the CuMn films were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and could be correlated with the electrical properties of the CuMn films. After thermal treatment, only Cu-5 at.% Mn/ SiO2 successfully avoided the diffusion of Cu atoms. Thermal stability of the films grown on Ta/SiO2 was found to be better than that on SiO2. When a Ta layer was added, the Mn atoms diffused not only to the interface, but also to the grain boundaries in the Ta layer and the interface between Ta and SiO2. This phenomenon could be explained by the surface energy. As the thickness of CuMn shrunk from 150 to 50 nm and the sample was covered with a 100-nm-thick Cu layer, the amount of Mn atoms increased at the interface of CuMn/Ta. This is because the Cu layer had higher chemical potential which induced the Mn atoms to move toward the Ta layer and reduced the amount of Mn atoms in Cu after heat treatment.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2014.2358588","National Science Council of Taiwan(grant numbers:NSC 100-2221-E-006-146); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912929","barrier;self-formed;annealing;CuMn alloy;Ta;Barrier;self-formed;annealing;CuMn alloy;Ta","Manganese;Annealing;Films;Thermal stability;Atomic layer deposition;Silicon","","","","23","OAPA","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Microcirculatory breakdown and prolonged inflammation in particular are major features of late side effects. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable animal model that will allow a long-term in vivo analysis of microcirculation and inflammation following irradiation. A single dose of 90 Gy was delivered to the ears of hairless mice (n = 15). Intravital fluorescent microscopy was used to assess microcirculatory parameters and leukocyte behaviour. Values for the identical (control) areas were obtained before as well as during the following days, weeks and months following irradiation. The arteriolar and venular diameter increased up to Day 14, decreased during the following months, and increased again after one year. The red blood cell velocity increased up to 145% on Day 3, decreased on Day 7 to 115%, and stayed above baseline value the whole year. The integrity loss of the endothelium increased up to Day 7 and continued up to Day 75 after radiation. After one year, the oedema was at the baseline level. Leukocytes showed their maximal activity at one year after trauma. An increase was measured up to Day 25; the lowest values were measured at Day 40 post-irradiation, followed by a repeated increase. The present model allows a certain visualization of microcirculatory disturbances and inflammation over a period of months. This permits the possibility of long-term investigations of the underlying pathophysiology following irradiation, including possible drug interactions.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150155","ionizing radiation;intravital fluorescent microscopy;microcirculation;leukocyte–endothelium interaction;radiotherapy;irradiation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicate that Ce 3+ ions were successfully doped into BiOCl lattices. However, in PA photoluminescence behaviors, the doped Ce 3+ ions did not present efficient resonant energy transfer (ET) processes between the Er 3+ ions as generally reported. As a result, the intensity of visible PA upconversion emission and 1.54 $\mu\text{m}$ downshifting near-infrared (NIR) emission of Er 3+ ions shows the same concentration dependence of cerium dopants. This phenomenon can be understood by the influence of cerium dopant content on the magnitude of internal electric field in layered BiOCl crystals, which may play a more important role on the upconversion (UC) and NIR luminescence of Er 3+ than the traditional ET between rare-earth (RE) ions.

Radiation therapy was performed between April 2007 and December 2010. There were 108 males and 8 females included in the study. The median follow-up term was 24 months (range, 1–62 months). The thyroid function was evaluated by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels. The mean thyroid dose, and the volume of thyroid gland spared from doses ≥10, 20, 30 and 40 Gy (VS10, VS20, VS30 and VS40) were calculated for all patients. The thyroid dose and volume were calculated by the radiotherapy planning system (RTPS). The cumulative incidences of hypothyroidism were 21.1% and 36.4% at one year and two years, respectively, after the end of radiation therapy. In the DVH analyses, the patients who received a mean thyroid dose <30 Gy had a significantly lower incidence of hypothyroidism. The univariate analyses showed that the VS10, VS20, VS30 and VS40 were associated with the risk of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism was a relatively common type of late radiation-induced toxicity. A mean thyroid dose of 30 Gy may be a useful threshold for predicting the development of hypothyroidism after radiation therapy for head and neck cancers.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150167","hypothyroidism;head and neck cancer;radiation therapy;late radiation toxicity","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The Japanese Radiation Oncology Study Group (JROSG) performed a questionnaire-based survey of their cervical cancer patients who were treated with definitive RT between January 2000 and December 2005. A total of 667 patients were entered in this study. Although half of the patients were considered suitable for definitive RT based on the clinical features of the tumor, about one-third of the patients were prescribed RT instead of surgery because of poor medical status. The RT schedule most frequently utilized was whole-pelvic field irradiation (WP) of 30 Gy/15 fractions followed by WP with midline block of 20 Gy/10 fractions, and high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDR-ICBT) of 24 Gy/4 fractions prescribed at point A. Chemotherapy was administered to 306 patients (46%). The most frequent regimen contained cisplatin (CDDP). The median follow-up time for all patients was 65 months (range, 2–135 months). The 5-year overall survival (OS), pelvic control (PC) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates for all patients were 78%, 90% and 69%, respectively. Tumor diameter and nodal status were significant prognostic indicators for OS, PC and DFS. Chemotherapy has potential for improving the OS and DFS of patients with bulky tumors, but not for non-bulky tumors.

In this paper the development, design and implementation of an underwater electric field recorder that can be towed by a scuba diver is presented. The measurement system uses carbon fibre probes to measure three channels in the frequency range of 0.1 - 10 Hz at 64 samples/sec with a resolution of 24 bits. The input range is ±18 mV/m with a noise floor of less than ±30 μV/m.

Because the decay of a 64Cu atom is emitting not only positrons but also Auger electrons, this radionuclide has great potential as a theranostic agent. However, the success of 64Cu-ATSM internal radiation therapy would depend on the contribution of Auger electrons to tumor cell killing. Therefore, we designed a cell culture system to define the contributions to cell death from Auger electrons to support or refute our hypothesis that the majority of cell death from 64Cu-ATSM is a result of high-LET Auger electrons and not positrons or other low-LET radiation. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) wild type and DNA repair–deficient xrs5 cells were exposed to 64Cu-ATSM during hypoxic conditions. Surviving fractions were compared with those surviving gamma-radiation, low-LET hadron radiation, and high-LET heavy ion exposure. The ratio of the D 10 values (doses required to achieve 10% cell survival) between CHO wild type and xrs5 cells suggested that 64Cu-ATSM toxicity is similar to that of high-LET Carbon ion radiation (70 keV/μm). γH2AX foci assays confirmed DNA double-strand breaks and cluster damage by high-LET Auger electrons from 64Cu decay, and complex types of chromosomal aberrations typical of high-LET radiation were observed after 64Cu-ATSM exposure. The majority of cell death was caused by high-LET radiation. This work provides strong evidence that 64Cu-ATSM damages DNA via high-LET Auger electrons, supporting further study and consideration of 64Cu-ATSM as a cancer treatment modality for hypoxic tumors.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150246","auger electron;high LET;64Cu-ATSM;DNA double strand break;CHO","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The equivalence can be attributed to the MUI-free characteristic performance of CRCCCs. It is demonstrated that when employed in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna configuration along with orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs), the maximum theoretical diversity order of NTxNRx is achieved. Most significantly, simulations show that CDMA-OFDM using CRCCCs is capable of rendering additional multipath diversity gain at no additional processing cost.

Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%–85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously.

With the depth map of the hazy image, we can easily estimate the transmission and restore the scene radiance via the atmospheric scattering model, and thus effectively remove the haze from a single image.

More than 15,000 power delay profiles were measured across the mmWave bands to yield directional and omnidirectional path loss models, temporal and spatial channel models, and outage probabilities. Models presented here offer side-by-side comparisons of propagation characteristics over a wide range of mmWave bands, and the results and models are useful for the research and standardization process of future mmWave systems. Directional and omnidirectional path loss models with respect to a 1 m close-in free space reference distance over a wide range of mmWave frequencies and scenarios using directional antennas in real-world environments are provided herein, and are shown to simplify mmWave path loss models, while allowing researchers to globally compare and standardize path loss parameters for emerging mmWave wireless networks. A new channel impulse response modeling framework, shown to agree with extensive mmWave measurements over several bands, is presented for use in link-layer simulations, using the observed fact that spatial lobes contain multipath energy that arrives at many different propagation time intervals.

Sparse representation also has a good reputation in both theoretical research and practical applications. Many different algorithms have been proposed for sparse representation. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive study and an updated review on sparse representation and to supply guidance for researchers. The taxonomy of sparse representation methods can be studied from various viewpoints. For example, in terms of different norm minimizations used in sparsity constraints, the methods can be roughly categorized into five groups: 1) sparse representation with l0-norm minimization; 2) sparse representation with lp-norm (0 <; p <; 1) minimization; 3) sparse representation with l1-norm minimization; 4) sparse representation with l2,1-norm minimization; and 5) sparse representation with l2-norm minimization. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of sparse representation is provided. The available sparse representation algorithms can also be empirically categorized into four groups: 1) greedy strategy approximation; 2) constrained optimization; 3) proximity algorithm-based optimization; and 4) homotopy algorithm-based sparse representation. The rationales of different algorithms in each category are analyzed and a wide range of sparse representation applications are summarized, which could sufficiently reveal the potential nature of the sparse representation theory. In particular, an experimentally comparative study of these sparse representation algorithms was presented.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2430359","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61370163,61233011,61332011); Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Innovation Council(grant numbers:JCYJ20130329151843309,JCYJ20130329151843309,JCYJ20140417172417174,CXZZ20140904154910774); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation Funded Project(grant numbers:2014M560264); Shaanxi Key Innovation Team of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2012KCT-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7102696","Sparse representation;compressive sensing;greedy algorithm;constrained optimization;proximal algorithm;homotopy algorithm;dictionary learning;Sparse representation;compressive sensing;greedy algorithm;constrained optimization;proximal algorithm;homotopy algorithm;dictionary learning","Sparse matrices;Algorithm design and analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Signal processing","","855","5","68","OAPA","6 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traditional approaches based on manual configuration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efficient configuration, better performance, and higher flexibility to accommodate innovative network designs. This paper surveys latest developments in this active research area of SDN. We first present a generally accepted definition for SDN with the aforementioned two characteristic features and potential benefits of SDN. We then dwell on its three-layer architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a control layer, and an application layer, and substantiate each layer with existing research efforts and its related research areas. We follow that with an overview of the de facto SDN implementation (i.e., OpenFlow).

Bigger synchronous ultrasound imaging datasets can be exploited in order to strongly improve the discrimination between tissue and blood motion in the field of Doppler imaging. Here we propose a spatiotemporal singular value decomposition clutter rejection of ultrasonic data acquired at ultrafast frame rate. The singular value decomposition (SVD) takes benefits of the different features of tissue and blood motion in terms of spatiotemporal coherence and strongly outperforms conventional clutter rejection filters based on high pass temporal filtering. Whereas classical clutter filters operate on the temporal dimension only, SVD clutter filtering provides up to a four-dimensional approach (3D in space and 1D in time). We demonstrate the performance of SVD clutter filtering with a flow phantom study that showed an increased performance compared to other classical filters (better contrast to noise ratio with tissue motion between 1 and 10mm/s and axial blood flow as low as 2.6 mm/s). SVD clutter filtering revealed previously undetected blood flows such as microvascular networks or blood flows corrupted by significant tissue or probe motion artifacts.

Given an input for a system, the challenge of distinguishing the corresponding desired, correct behaviour from potentially incorrect behavior is called the “test oracle problem”. Test oracle automation is important to remove a current bottleneck that inhibits greater overall test automation. Without test oracle automation, the human has to determine whether observed behaviour is correct. The literature on test oracles has introduced techniques for oracle automation, including modelling, specifications, contract-driven development and metamorphic testing. When none of these is completely adequate, the final source of test oracle information remains the human, who may be aware of informal specifications, expectations, norms and domain specific information that provide informal oracle guidance. All forms of test oracles, even the humble human, involve challenges of reducing cost and increasing benefit. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of current approaches to the test oracle problem and an analysis of trends in this important area of software testing research and practice.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2014.2372785","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/I010165/1,EP/I010386/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6963470","Test oracle;Automatic testing;Testing formalism;Test oracle;automatic testing;testing formalism","Probabilistic logic;Licenses;Automation;Software testing;Market research;Reliability","","661","","86","CCBY","20 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The measurements provide large-scale path loss and temporal statistics that will be useful for ultra-dense indoor wireless networks for future mmWave bands. This paper presents the details of measurements that employed a 400 Megachips-per-second broadband sliding correlator channel sounder, using rotatable highly directional horn antennas for both co-polarized and cross-polarized antenna configurations. The measurement environment was a closed-plan in-building scenario that included a line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight corridor, a hallway, a cubicle farm, and adjacent-room communication links. Well-known and new single-frequency and multi-frequency directional and omnidirectional large-scale path loss models are presented and evaluated based on more than 14 000 directional power delay profiles acquired from unique transmitter and receiver antenna pointing angle combinations. Omnidirectional path loss models, synthesized from the directional measurements, are provided for the case of arbitrary polarization coupling, as well as for the specific cases of co-polarized and cross-polarized antenna orientations. The results show that novel large-scale path loss models provided here are simpler and more physically based compared to previous 3GPP and ITU indoor propagation models that require more model parameters and offer very little additional accuracy and lack a physical basis. Multipath time dispersion statistics for mmWave systems using directional antennas are presented for co-polarization, crosspolarization, and combined-polarization scenarios, and show that the multipath root mean square delay spread can be reduced when using transmitter and receiver antenna pointing angles that result in the strongest received power. Raw omnidirectional path loss data and closed-form optimization formulas for all path loss models are given in the Appendices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2486778","NYU WIRELESS Industrial Affiliates: AT&T, CableLabs, Cablevision, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel Corporation, InterDigital Inc., Keysight Technologies, L3 Communications, Nokia, National Instruments, Qualcomm Technologies, Samsung Corporation, SiBeam, Straight Path Communications, and UMC; GAANN Fellowship Program; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1320472,1237821,1302336); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7289335","Millimeter-wave;mmWave;path loss;5G;indoor hotspot;RMS delay spread;small cell;channel sounder;propagation;28 GHz;73 GHz;multipath;polarization;Millimeter-wave;mmWave;path loss;5G;indoor hotspot;RMS delay spread;small cell;channel sounder;propagation;28 GHz;73 GHz;multipath;polarization","Millimeter wave communication;Wideband;Propagation measurements;Ultra wideband communication;5G mobile communication;Loss measurement;Path planning;Polarization;Multipath channels","","494","2","146","OAPA","5 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

WPT technology is in its infancy; standardization is lacking, especially on interoperability, center frequency selection, magnetic fringe field suppression, and the methods employed for power flow regulation. This paper proposes a new analysis concept for power flow in WPT in which the primary provides frequency selection and the tuned secondary, with its resemblance to a power transmission network having a reactive power voltage control, is analyzed as a transmission network. Analysis is supported with experimental data taken from Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s WPT apparatus. This paper also provides an experimental evidence for frequency selection, fringe field assessment, and the need for low-latency communications in the feedback path.","2168-6785","","10.1109/JESTPE.2014.2382569","Oak Ridge National Laboratory, operated by UT-Battelle, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC05-00OR22725); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994754","EV charging;inductive power transfer;wireless power transfer","Coils;Power electronics;Wireless communication;Electric vehicles;Government;Load flow control","","418","6","54","USGov","22 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically require many interactions with the system to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-specific knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or specific knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared to state-of-the art RL our model-based policy search method achieves an unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to autonomous learning in real robot and control tasks.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2013.218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654139","Policy search;robotics;control;Gaussian processes;Bayesian inference;reinforcement learning","Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Approximation methods;Robots;Uncertainty;Data models;Predictive models","","394","","58","OAPA","4 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the existing lifetime estimation methods for the power electronic converter are not yet suitable in the wind power application, because the comprehensive mission profiles are not well specified and included. Consequently, a relative more advanced approach is proposed in this paper, which is based on the loading and strength analysis of devices and takes into account different time constants of the thermal behaviors in power converter.

While energy saving can be achieved by adopting renewable energy resources or improving design of certain hardware (e.g., power amplifier) to make it more energy-efficient, the cost of purchasing, replacing, and installing new equipment (including manpower, transportation, disruption to normal operation, as well as associated energy and direct cost) is often prohibitive. By comparison, approaches that work on the operating protocols of the system do not require changes to current network architecture, making them far less costly and easier for testing and implementation. In this survey, we first present facts and figures that highlight the importance of green mobile networking and then review existing green cellular networking research with particular focus on techniques that incorporate the concept of the “sleep mode” in base stations. It takes advantage of changing traffic patterns on daily or weekly basis and selectively switches some lightly loaded base stations to low energy consumption modes. As base stations are responsible for the large amount of energy consumed in cellular networks, these approaches have the potential to save a significant amount of energy, as shown in various studies. However, it is noticed that certain simplifying assumptions made in the published papers introduce inaccuracies. This review will discuss these assumptions, particularly, an assumption that ignores the effect of traffic-load-dependent factors on energy consumption. We show here that considering this effect may lead to noticeably lower benefit than in models that ignore this effect. Finally, potential future research directions are discussed.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2015.2403395","City University of Hong Kong(grant numbers:9380044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7041163","Cellular network;base station;energy consumption;energy efficiency;green networking;sleep mode;Cellular network;base station;energy consumption;energy efficiency;green networking;sleep mode","Energy consumption;Mobile communication;Green products;Mobile computing;Hardware;Air pollution;Climate change","","370","","161","OAPA","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For HSI, there is much global and local redundancy and correlation (RAC) in spatial/spectral dimensions. In addition, denoising performance can be improved greatly if RAC is utilized efficiently in the denoising process. In this paper, an HSI denoising method is proposed by jointly utilizing the global and local RAC in spatial/spectral domains. First, sparse coding is exploited to model the global RAC in the spatial domain and local RAC in the spectral domain. Noise can be removed by sparse approximated data with learned dictionary. At this stage, only local RAC in the spectral domain is employed. It will cause spectral distortion. To compensate the shortcoming of local spectral RAC, low-rank constraint is used to deal with the global RAC in the spectral domain. Different hyperspectral data sets are used to test the performance of the proposed method. The denoising results by the proposed method are superior to results obtained by other state-of-the-art hyperspectral denoising methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2014.2321557","National Natural Science Found of China(grant numbers:61371152,61071172,61301196); New Century Excellent Talents Award Program from Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:NCET-12-0464); Ministry of Education Scientific Research Foundation; Sciences Foundation of Northwestern Polytechnical University(grant numbers:C200941,JC201251); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819824","Global redundancy and correlation (RAC);hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising;local RAC;low rank;sparse representation;Global redundancy and correlation (RAC);hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising;local RAC;low rank;sparse representation","Noise reduction;Noise;Dictionaries;Spectral analysis;Noise measurement;Encoding;Indexes","","330","","52","IEEE","22 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new infinite active contour model that uses hybrid region information of the image to approach this problem. More specifically, an infinite perimeter regularizer, provided by using ${\cal L}^{2}$ Lebesgue measure of the $\gamma$ -neighborhood of boundaries, allows for better detection of small oscillatory (branching) structures than the traditional models based on the length of a feature's boundaries (i.e., ${\cal H}^{1}$ Hausdorff measure). Moreover, for better general segmentation performance, the proposed model takes the advantage of using different types of region information, such as the combination of intensity information and local phase based enhancement map. The local phase based enhancement map is used for its superiority in preserving vessel edges while the given image intensity information will guarantee a correct feature's segmentation.

Second, it was demonstrated that with a single data representation, improved accuracy can be achieved through simple ensemble schemes. We combine these two principles to test the hypothesis that forming a collective of ensembles of classifiers on different data transformations improves the accuracy of time-series classification. The collective contains classifiers constructed in the time, frequency, change, and shapelet transformation domains. For the time domain, we use a set of elastic distance measures. For the other domains, we use a range of standard classifiers. Through extensive experimentation on 72 datasets, including all of the 46 UCR datasets, we demonstrate that the simple collective formed by including all classifiers in one ensemble is significantly more accurate than any of its components and any other previously published TSC algorithm.

It deals with data streams having very skewed class distributions. This type of problems commonly exists in real-world applications, such as fault diagnosis of real-time control monitoring systems and intrusion detection in computer networks. In our earlier work, we defined class imbalance online, and proposed two learning algorithms OOB and UOB that build an ensemble model overcoming class imbalance in real time through resampling and time-decayed metrics. In this paper, we further improve the resampling strategy inside OOB and UOB, and look into their performance in both static and dynamic data streams. We give the first comprehensive analysis of class imbalance in data streams, in terms of data distributions, imbalance rates and changes in class imbalance status. We find that UOB is better at recognizing minority-class examples in static data streams, and OOB is more robust against dynamic changes in class imbalance status. The data distribution is a major factor affecting their performance. Based on the insight gained, we then propose two new ensemble methods that maintain both OOB and UOB with adaptive weights for final predictions, called WEOB1 and WEOB2.

While conventional beamforming schemes aim at the minimization of the transmit power subject to suppressing interference to guarantee quality of service (QoS) constraints, here we use the knowledge of both data and channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter to exploit, rather than suppress, constructive interference. More specifically, we design a new precoding scheme for the MISO downlink that minimizes the transmit power for generic phase shift keying (PSK) modulated signals. The proposed precoder reduces the transmit power compared to conventional schemes, by adapting the QoS constraints to accommodate constructive interference as a source of useful signal power. By exploiting the power of constructively interfering symbols, the proposed scheme achieves the required QoS at lower transmit power. We extend this concept to the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) balancing problem, where higher SINR values compared to the conventional SINR balancing optimization are achieved for given transmit power budgets. In addition, we derive equivalent virtual multicast formulations for both optimizations, both of which provide insights of the optimal solution and facilitate the design of a more efficient solver. Finally, we propose a robust beamforming technique to deal with imperfect CSI, that also reduces the transmit power over conventional techniques, while guaranteeing the required QoS. Our simulation and analysis show significant power savings for small scale MISO downlink channels with the proposed data-aided optimization compared to conventional beamforming optimization.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2015.2430839","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/M014150/1); Royal Academy of Engineering; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103338","Constructive interference;convex optimization;downlink beamforming;power minimization;SINR balancing","Interference;Optimization;Signal to noise ratio;Array signal processing;Phase shift keying;Downlink;Minimization","","280","1","48","CCBY","7 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To deal with the nonconvexity, an equivalent convex feasibility problem is reformulated, and closed-form expressions for the energy-efficient resource allocation solution to jointly allocate the resource block and transmit power are derived by the Lagrange dual decomposition method.

In this paper, we challenge this practice and show that the concept of a channel-independent FEC limit is invalid for soft-decision bit-wise decoding. It is shown that for low code rates and high-order modulation formats, the use of the soft-decision FEC limit paradigm can underestimate the spectral efficiencies by up to 20%. A better predictor for the BER after decoding is the generalized mutual information, which is shown to give consistent post-FEC BER predictions across different channel conditions and modulation formats.

First, with an aim toward the biodiversity of resources and tasks in cloud computing, we propose a resource cost model that defines the demand of tasks on resources with more details. This model reflects the relationship between the user's resource costs and the budget costs. A multi-objective optimization scheduling method has been proposed based on this resource cost model. This method considers the makespan and the user's budget costs as constraints of the optimization problem, achieving multi-objective optimization of both performance and cost. An improved ant colony algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem. Two constraint functions were used to evaluate and provide feedback regarding the performance and budget cost. These two constraint functions made the algorithm adjust the quality of the solution in a timely manner based on feedback in order to achieve the optimal solution. Some simulation experiments were designed to evaluate this method's performance using four metrics: 1) the makespan; 2) cost; 3) deadline violation rate; and 4) resource utilization. Experimental results show that based on these four metrics, a multi-objective optimization method is better than other similar methods, especially as it increased 56.6% in the best case scenario.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2508940","Educational Commission of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2013KJCX0131); Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology’s Internal Project(grant numbers:2012RC0106); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2014A030313729); 2013 Top Level Talents Project Sailing Plan of Guangdong Province; 2014 Guangdong Province Outstanding Young Professor Project; Science and Technology Key Project of Guangdong(grant numbers:2014B010112006); Natural Science Fund of Guangdong(grant numbers:2015A030308017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7355287","Cloud computing;Ant colony;Task scheduling;Cloud computing;ant colony;task scheduling;deadline;cost constraint","Scheduling;Optimization;Processor scheduling;Cloud computing;Ant colony optimization;Memory management;Resource management","","269","","44","OAPA","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we introduce a new mm-wave frequency transmission scheme that exploits a combination of the concepts of beamspace multi-input multi-output (B-MIMO) communications and beam selection to provide near-optimal performances with a low hardware-complexity transceiver. While large-scale MIMO approaches in mm-wave are affected by high dimensional signal space that increases considerably both complexity and costs of the system, the proposed scheme is able to achieve near-optimal performances with a reduced radio-frequency (RF) complexity thanks to beam selection. We evaluate the advantages of the proposed scheme via capacity computations, comparisons of numbers of RF chains required and by studying the trade-off between spectral and power efficiency. Our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is capable of offering a significant reduction in RF complexity with a realistic low-cost approach, for a given performance. In particular, we show that the proposed beam selection algorithms achieve higher power efficiencies than a full system where all beams are utilized.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2431266","Royal Academy of Engineering; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/M014150/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7104120","High dimensional MIMO;Multiuser MIMO;beam selection;Capacity maximization;SINR maximization;beamforming;High dimensional MIMO;multiuser MIMO;beam selection;capacity maximization;SINR maximization;beamforming","Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Complexity theory;Radio frequency;MIMO;Channel models;Array signal processing","","266","3","49","CCBY","8 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two very different 3-D printing technologies have been considered: low-cost lower-resolution fused deposition modeling for microwave applications and higher-cost high-resolution stereolithography for millimeter-wave applications. Measurements against traceable standards in MPRWGs were performed by the U.K.’s National Physical Laboratory. It was found that the performance of the 3-D printed MPRWGs were comparable with those of standard waveguides. For example, across X-band (8–12 GHz), the dissipative attenuation ranges between 0.2 and 0.6 dB/m, with a worst case return loss of 32 dB; at W-band (75–110 GHz), the dissipative attenuation was 11 dB/m at the band edges, with a worst case return loss of 19 dB. Finally, a high-performance W-band sixth-order inductive iris bandpass filter, having a center frequency of 107.2 GHz and a 6.8-GHz bandwidth, was demonstrated. The measured insertion loss of the complete structure (filter, feed sections, and flanges) was only 0.95 dB at center frequency, giving an unloaded quality factor of 152—clearly demonstrating the potential of this low-cost manufacturing technology, offering the advantages of lightweight rapid prototyping/manufacturing and relatively very low cost when compared with traditional (micro)machining.","2156-3985","","10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2462130","Innovative Electronics Manufacturing Research Centre through the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Project entitled 3-D Microwave and Millimeter- Wave System-on-Substrate Using Sacrificial Layers for Printed RF MEMS Component(grant numbers:SP/02/03/10); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7217811","3-D printing;additive manufacturing;fused deposition modeling (FDM);metal-pipe rectangular waveguide (MPRWG);rapid manufacturing;rectangular waveguide;stereolithography apparatus (SLA).;3-D printing;additive manufacturing;fused deposition modeling (FDM);metal-pipe rectangular waveguide (MPRWG);rapid manufacturing;rectangular waveguide;stereolithography apparatus (SLA)","Printing;Manufacturing;Electromagnetic waveguides;Frequency division multiplexing;Attenuation;Standards;Surface waves","","265","7","78","OAPA","21 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work explores a novel framework to propagate voxel-wise annotations between morphologically dissimilar images by diffusing and mapping the available examples through intermediate steps. A spatially-variant graph structure connecting morphologically similar subjects is introduced over a database of images, enabling the gradual diffusion of information to all the subjects, even in the presence of large-scale morphological variability. We illustrate the utility of the proposed framework on two example applications: brain parcellation using categorical labels and tissue segmentation using probabilistic features. The application of the proposed method to categorical label fusion showed highly statistically significant improvements when compared to state-of-the-art methodologies.

This issue can be eased through the installation of bulky electrolytic capacitors in the dc link. Unfortunately, such passive filtering approach may inevitably lead to low power density and limited system lifetime. An alternative approach is to use active power decoupling so that the ripple power can be diverted into other energy storage devices to gain an improved system performance. Nevertheless, all existing active methods have to introduce extra energy storage elements, either inductors or film capacitors in the system to store the ripple power, and this again leads to increased component costs. In view of this, this paper presents a symmetrical half-bridge circuit which utilizes the dc-link capacitors to absorb the ripple power, and the only additional components are a pair of switches and a small filtering inductor. A design example is presented and the proposed circuit concept is also verified with simulation and experimental results. It shows that at least ten times capacitance reduction can be achieved with the proposed active power decoupling method, and both the input current and output voltage of the converter can be well regulated even when very small dc-link capacitors are employed.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2014.2327134","European Research Council (ERC); European Union's Seventh Framework Program(grant numbers:(FP/2007-2013)/ERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823715","Active power decoupling;capacitance reduction;harmonic compensation;single-phase systems","Capacitors;Inductors;Voltage control;Capacitance;Films;Energy storage;Switches","","261","","26","IEEE","30 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the direct input current controllability and extra control freedom of the CF-DAB converter make it possible to buffer the double-line-frequency energy in grid-interactive PV systems without using electrolytic capacitors in the dc link. Therefore, a PV system achieves high reliability and highly efficient maximum power point tracking. This paper studies the optimized operation of a CF-DAB converter for a PV application in order to improve the system efficiency. The operating principle and soft-switching conditions over the wide operating range are thoroughly analyzed with phase-shift control and duty-cycle control, and an optimized operating mode is proposed to achieve the minimum root-mean-square transformer current. The proposed operating mode can extend the soft-switching region and reduce the power loss, particularly under a heavy load and a high input voltage. Moreover, the efficiency can be further improved with a higher dc-link voltage. A 5-kW hardware prototype was built in the laboratory, and experimental results are provided for verification.

Contrary to existing works, which are mainly limited to ideal Lambertian sources and purely diffuse reflections, our approach is capable of obtaining channel impulse responses (CIRs) for any nonideal sources, as well as specular and mixed specular-diffuse reflections. Furthermore, we can precisely reflect the presence of objects (e.g., furniture) and wavelength-dependent reflection characteristics of surface materials (e.g., ceilings, floor, walls, and furniture) in a channel study. As case studies, we consider a number of indoor environments with various dimensions and different surface materials, i.e., plaster, gloss paint, wood, aluminum metal, and glass. We further consider various scenarios with different transmitter specifications (i.e., single versus multiple transmitters and array type) and receiver specifications (i.e., location and rotation). For each environment, we obtain CIRs and present a channel characterization study where channel parameters, such as channel DC gain, root mean square (RMS) delay spread, coherence bandwidth, and mean excess delay, are obtained.

To manage them holistically, this paper begins by proposing a virtual RC damper in parallel with the passive filter capacitor. The virtual damper is actively inserted by feeding back the passive capacitor current through a high-pass filter, which indirectly, furnishes two superior features. They are the mitigation of phase lag experienced by a conventional damper and the avoidance of instability caused by the negative resistance inserted unintentionally. Moreover, with the virtual RC damper, the frequency region, within which the harmonic compensation is effective, can be extended beyond the gain crossover frequency. This is of interest to some high-performance applications, but has presently not been achieved by existing schemes.

Furthermore, it has efficient performance for large point set sizes as well as for large grid size; performs equally for sparse and dense point sets; and finally it is general without restrictions on the characteristics of the point set.

To provide an objective decision-making basis for gait analysis, simple applicable tests analyzing a high number of strides are required. A mobile gait analysis system, which is mounted on shoes, can fulfill these requirements. This paper presents a method for computing clinically relevant temporal and spatial gait parameters. Therefore, an accelerometer and a gyroscope were positioned laterally below each ankle joint. Temporal gait events were detected by searching for characteristic features in the signals. To calculate stride length, the gravity compensated accelerometer signal was double integrated, and sensor drift was modeled using a piece-wise defined linear function. The presented method was validated using GAITRite-based gait parameters from 101 patients (average age 82.1 years). Subjects performed a normal walking test with and without a wheeled walker. The parameters  stride length and stride time showed a correlation of 0.93 and 0.95 between both systems. The absolute error of stride length was 6.26 cm on normal walking test. The developed system as well as the GAITRite showed an increased stride length, when using a four-wheeled walker as walking aid. However, the walking aid interfered with the automated analysis of the GAITRite system, but not with the inertial sensor-based approach. In summary, an algorithm for the calculation of clinically relevant gait parameters derived from inertial sensors is applicable in the diagnostic workup and also during long-term monitoring approaches in the elderly population.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2368211","Bayerische Forschungsstiftung(grant numbers:AZ 974-11); EFIMoves; Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg Emerging Fields Initiative(grant numbers:ASTRUM IT GmbH); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949634","Accelerometers;gait alterations;gait analysis;gyroscopes;stride length;stride parameters;Accelerometers;gait alterations;gait analysis;gyroscopes;stride length;stride parameters","Standards;Gyroscopes;Legged locomotion;Accelerometers;Gold;Gravity;Correlation","Accelerometry;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Female;Gait;Humans;Male;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Walkers;Walking","234","","39","OAPA","7 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They are Pareto dominance-based, scalarizing function-based, and hypervolume-based algorithms. NSGA-II, MOEA/D, SMS-EMOA, and HypE are examined using knapsack problems with 2–10 objectives. Our test problems are generated by randomly specifying coefficients (i.e., profits) in objectives. We also generate other test problems by combining two objectives to create a dependent or correlated objective. Experimental results on randomly generated many-objective knapsack problems are consistent with well-known performance deterioration of Pareto dominance-based algorithms. That is, NSGA-II is outperformed by the other algorithms. However, it is also shown that NSGA-II outperforms the other algorithms when objectives are highly correlated. MOEA/D shows totally different search behavior depending on the choice of a scalarizing function and its parameter value. Some MOEA/D variants work very well only on two-objective problems while others work well on many-objective problems with 4–10 objectives. We also obtain other interesting observations such as the performance improvement by similar parent recombination and the necessity of diversity improvement for many-objective knapsack problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2014.2315442","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research B 24300090; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6782742","Evolutionary many-objective optimization;evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);many-objective problems","Sociology;Vectors;Pareto optimization;Search problems;Approximation algorithms","","225","","59","OAPA","3 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The novelty of the proposed sensor is that it comprises two spatially separated split-ring resonators, where one interacts with the change in glucose level of a sample under test while the other ring is used as a reference. The reference ring has a slightly different resonant frequency and is desensitized to the sample owing to its location, thus allowing changes in temperature to be calibrated out. From an oral glucose tolerance test with two additional commercially available sensors (blood strip and continuous glucose monitor) in parallel, we obtained encouraging performance for our sensor comparable with those of the commercial sensors. The effects of endogenous interferents common to all subjects, i.e., common sugars, vitamins (ascorbic acid), and metabolites (uric acid) have also been investigated by using a large Franz cell assembly. From the interference test, it is shown that the change in sensor response is dominated by changes in glucose level for concentrations relevant to blood, and the effects of interferents are negligible in comparison.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2015.2472019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7239650","Biomedical sensors;dielectric measurements;emerging application for RF/microwaves;material characterization;microwave sensors","Sugar;Temperature measurement;Blood;Temperature sensors;Microwave theory and techniques;Monitoring;Microwave measurement","","224","6","33","CCBY","3 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The study of both of these topologies is presented in the context of designing a 3-kW primary-side controlled stationary wireless EV charger with nominal operating parameters of 30-kHz center frequency, a range of coupling in the neighborhood of 0.18-0.26, and a parallel secondary pick-up with partial series coil compensation. A comparison of both architectures is made in terms of their design methodology, physical size, cost, complexity, and efficiency. It is found that the SLC architecture is 2.45% less costly than the LCL topology. On the other hand, it is observed that the LCL architecture achieves almost 10% higher peak efficiency at rated load and minimum coupling. The study also showed that the SLC topology suffers from poor light load efficiency, while the LCL topology maintains very high efficiency over its full range of coupling and loading. The study also revealed that the capacitor voltage stress is significantly higher in the SLC topology. Finally, it is also shown that the control complexity of the SLC architecture is higher than that of the LCL architecture because of its sensitivity to changes in the reflected secondary impedance, which result in loss of constant current source and ZVS operation unless a suitable combination of parameters are modulated by the closed-loop controller.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2015.2440256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7119591","Inductive Power Transfer;Wireless EV charging;LCL Power Supply;SLC Power Supply;Resonant Inverter;Inductive power transfer (IPT);LCL power supply;resonant inverter;SLC power supply;wireless EV charging","Wireless communication;Topology;Q-factor;Capacitors;Power supplies;Couplings;Inductance","","216","2","67","IEEE","8 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following the principle of opportunistic routing theory, multihop relay decision to optimize the network energy efficiency is made based on the differences among sensor nodes, in terms of both their distance to sink and the residual energy of each other. Specifically, an Energy Saving via Opportunistic Routing (ENS_OR) algorithm is designed to ensure minimum power cost during data relay and protect the nodes with relatively low residual energy.

This needs to be taken into consideration for the design, implementation, and parametrization of the signal processing and control algorithm for such a system, which is the topic of this paper. For improved data fusion, inertial and optical flow sensors are used as a distance derivative for reference. As a result, a UAV is capable of distance controlled collision avoidance, which is more complex and powerful than comparable simple solutions.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a new joint sparse representation model for robust feature-level fusion. The proposed method dynamically removes unreliable features to be fused for tracking by using the advantages of sparse representation. In order to capture the non-linear similarity of features, we extend the proposed method into a general kernelized framework, which is able to perform feature fusion on various kernel spaces.

Among them, magnetic materials for spintronic devices have been surveyed as the first exercise. In this roadmap exercise, we have targeted magnetic tunnel and spin-valve junctions as spintronic devices. These can be used, for example, as a cell for a magnetic random access memory and a spin-torque oscillator in their vertical form as well as a spin transistor and a spin Hall device in their lateral form. In these devices, the critical role of magnetic materials is to inject spin-polarized electrons efficiently into a nonmagnet. We have accordingly identified two key properties to be achieved by developing new magnetic materials for future spintronic devices: 1) half-metallicity at room temperature (RT) and 2) perpendicular anisotropy in nanoscale devices at RT. For the first property, five major magnetic materials are selected for their evaluation for future magnetic/spintronic device applications: 1) Heusler alloys; 2) ferrites; 3) rutiles; 4) perovskites; and 5) dilute magnetic semiconductors. These alloys have been reported or predicted to be half-metallic ferromagnets at RT. They possess a bandgap at the Fermi level EF only for its minority spins, achieving 100% spin polarization at EF. We have also evaluated L10 alloys and D022-Mn alloys for the development of a perpendicularly anisotropic ferromagnet with large spin polarization.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing visualization methods used in evolutionary multiobjective optimization, showing their outcomes on two novel 4-D benchmark approximation sets. In addition, a visualization method that uses prosection (projection of a section) to visualize 4-D approximation sets is proposed. The method reproduces the shape, range, and distribution of vectors in the observed approximation sets well and can handle multiple large approximation sets while being robust and computationally inexpensive. Even more importantly, for some vectors, the visualization with prosections preserves the Pareto dominance relation and relative closeness to reference points.

It is already demonstrated that stealth attacks can always exist if the number of compromised measurements exceeds a certain value. In this paper, it is found that random undetectable attacks can be accomplished by modifying only a much smaller number of measurements than this value. It is well known that protecting the system from malicious attacks can be achieved by making a certain subset of measurements immune to attacks. An efficient greedy search algorithm is then proposed to quickly find this subset of measurements to be protected to defend against stealth attacks. It is shown that this greedy algorithm has almost the same performance as the brute-force method, but without the combinatorial complexity. Third, a robust attack detection method is discussed. The detection method is designed based on the robust principal component analysis problem by introducing element-wise constraints. This method is shown to be able to identify the real measurements, as well as attacks even when only partial observations are collected. The simulations are conducted based on IEEE test systems.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2015.2475695","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Dorothy Hodgkin Postgraduate Award Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7234893","Malicious data attack;bad data detection;smart grid security;robust principle component analysis;Bad data detection (BDD);malicious data attack;robust principle component analysis (PCA);smart grid security","Pollution measurement;Transmission line measurements;Noise;Power grids;State estimation;Power measurement","","186","","34","CCBY","1 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The emergence of high-resolution satellites with new spectral channels, such as the WorldView-2, increases the amount of data available, thereby improving the determination of coastal management parameters. Water-leaving radiance is very difficult to determine accurately, since it is often small compared to the reflected radiance from other sources such as atmospheric and water surface scattering. Hence, the atmospheric correction has proven to be a very important step in the processing of high-resolution images for coastal applications. On the other hand, specular reflection of solar radiation on nonflat water surfaces is a serious confounding factor for bathymetry and for obtaining the seafloor albedo with high precision in shallow-water environments. This paper describes, at first, an optimal atmospheric correction model, as well as an improved algorithm for sunglint removal based on combined physical and image processing techniques. Then, using the corrected multispectral data, an efficient multichannel physics-based algorithm has been implemented, which is capable of solving through optimization the radiative transfer model of seawater for bathymetry retrieval, unmixing the water intrinsic optical properties, depth, and seafloor albedo contributions. Finally, for the mapping of benthic features, a supervised classification methodology has been implemented, combining seafloor-type normalized indexes and support vector machine techniques. Results of atmospheric correction, remote bathymetry, and benthic habitat mapping of shallow-water environments have been validated with in situ data and available bionomic profiles providing excellent accuracy.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2014.2377300","Observatorio Ambiental Granadilla (OAG) Contract ULPGC-OAG-FULP(grant numbers:240/142/3); ARTEMISAT (CGL2013-46674-R) project; Spanish.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7031909","Atmospheric model;bathymetry mapping;benthic habitat mapping;high-resolution multispectral imagery;physical and image processing techniques;sunglint;WorldView-2 (WV2);Atmospheric model;bathymetry mapping;benthic habitat mapping;high-resolution multispectral imagery;physical and image processing techniques;sunglint;WorldView-2 (WV2)","Atmospheric modeling;Sea measurements;Satellites;Sea surface;Satellite broadcasting;Sensors;Atmospheric measurements","","184","","40","OAPA","5 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventionally, even with detectors sensitive to individual photons, hundreds of photon detections are needed at each pixel to mitigate Poisson noise. We develop a robust method for estimating depth and reflectivity using fixed dwell time per pixel and on the order of one detected photon per pixel averaged over the scene. Our computational image formation method combines physically accurate single-photon counting statistics with exploitation of the spatial correlations present in real-world reflectivity and 3-D structure. Experiments conducted in the presence of strong background light demonstrate that our method is able to accurately recover scene depth and reflectivity, while traditional imaging methods based on maximum likelihood (ML) estimation or approximations thereof lead to noisier images. For depth, performance compares favorably to signal-independent noise removal algorithms such as median filtering or block-matching and 3-D filtering (BM3D) applied to the pixelwise ML estimate; for reflectivity, performance is similar to signal-dependent noise removal algorithms such as Poisson nonlocal sparse PCA and BM3D with variance-stabilizing transformation. Our framework increases photon efficiency 100-fold over traditional processing and also improves, somewhat, upon first-photon imaging under a total acquisition time constraint in raster-scanned operation. Thus, our new imager will be useful for rapid, low-power, and noise-tolerant active optical imaging, and its fixed dwell time will facilitate parallelization through use of a detector array.","2333-9403","","10.1109/TCI.2015.2453093","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1161413,1422034); Samsung Scholarship; Microsoft Ph.D. Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150537","3D imaging;computational imaging;convex optimization;first-photon imaging;LIDAR;low-light imaging;Poisson noise;single-photon detection;time-of-flight imaging;3-D imaging;computational imaging;convex optimization;first-photon imaging;LIDAR;low-light imaging;Poisson noise;single-photon detection;time-of-flight imaging","Photonics;Detectors;Three-dimensional displays;Noise;Optical imaging;Lighting","","175","1","41","OAPA","6 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typical hierarchical routing is called clustering routing, in which the network is divided into multiple clusters. Recently, some types of atypical hierarchical routing arise, including chain-based, tree-based, grid-based routing, and area-based routing. There are several survey papers that present and compare the hierarchical routing protocols from various perspectives, but a survey on atypical hierarchical routing is still missing. This paper makes a first attempt to provide a comprehensive review on atypical hierarchical routing. We offer a classification of atypical hierarchical routing of WSNs, and give detailed analysis of different logical topologies. The most representative atypical hierarchical routing protocols are described, discussed, and qualitatively compared. In particular, the advantages and disadvantages of different atypical hierarchical routing protocols are analyzed with respect to their significant performances and application scenarios. Finally, we put forward some open issues concerning the design of hierarchical WSNs.

The electrical loading and device rating are both important factors that determine the loss and thermal behaviors of power semiconductor devices. In the existing loss and thermal models, only the electrical loadings are focused and treated as design variables, while the device rating is normally predefined by experience with limited design flexibility. Consequently, a more complete loss and thermal model is proposed in this paper, which takes into account not only the electrical loading but also the device rating as input variables. The quantified correlation between the power loss, thermal impedance, and silicon area of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is mathematically established. By this new modeling approach, all factors that have impacts to the loss and thermal profiles of the power devices can accurately be mapped, enabling more design freedom to optimize the efficiency and thermal loading of the power converter.

Our simulations reveal that high-performance TMD TFETs not only require good gate control, but also rely on the choice of the right channel material with optimum bandgap, effective mass, and source/drain doping level. Unlike previous works, a full-band atomistic tight-binding method is used self-consistently with 3-D Poisson equation to simulate ballistic quantum transport in these devices. The effect of the choice of the TMD material on the performance of the device and its transfer characteristics are discussed.

It is critical to track the optimum electrical operating point through the use of power electronic converters controlled by a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The MPPT method based on the open-circuit voltage is arguably the most suitable for the linear electrical characteristic of TEGs. This paper presents an innovative way to perform the open-circuit voltage measure during the pseudonormal operation of the interfacing power electronic converter. The proposed MPPT technique is supported by theoretical analysis and used to control a synchronous Buck–Boost converter. The prototype MPPT converter is controlled by an inexpensive microcontroller, and a lead-acid battery is used to accumulate the harvested energy. Experimental results using commercial TEG devices prove that the converter accurately tracks the maximum power point during thermal transients. Precise measurements in the steady state show that the converter finds the maximum power point with a tracking efficiency of 99.85%.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2014.2313294","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/K022156/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6777279","Buck-Boost;converter;dc¿dc;maximum power point tracking (MPPT);synchronous;thermoelectric (TE);thermoelectric generator (TEG)","Maximum power point trackers;Voltage measurement;Time measurement;Performance evaluation;Power measurement;Steady-state;Thermoelectricity","","161","","52","CCBY","21 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We extend these nanogrids with a bidirectional dc-dc converter and a network controller so that power can be exchanged between houses over an external dc power bus. In this way, demand-response fluctuations are absorbed not only by the local battery, but can be spread over all batteries in the system. By using a combination of voltage and current controlled units, we implemented a higher-level control software independent from the physical process. A further software layer for autonomous control handles power exchange based on a distributed multiagent system, using a peer-to-peer like architecture. In parallel to the software, we made a physical model of a four-node OES on which different power exchange strategies can be simulated and compared.

For metal films, mobility fluctuations associated with carrier-defect scattering lead to 1/f noise. In contrast, for most semiconductor devices, the noise usually results from fluctuations in the number of carriers due to charge exchange between the channel and defects, usually at or near a critical semiconductor/insulator interface. The Dutta-Horn model describes the noise with high precision in most cases. Insight into the physical mechanisms that lead to noise in microelectronic materials and devices has been obtained via total-ionizing-dose irradiation and/or thermal annealing, as illustrated with several examples. With the assistance of the Dutta-Horn model, measurements of the noise magnitude and temperature and/or voltage dependence of the noise enable estimates of the energy distributions of defects that lead to 1/f noise. The microstructure of several defects and/or impurities that cause noise in MOS devices (primarily O vacancies) and GaN/AlGaN HEMTs (e.g., hydrogenated impurity centers, N vacancies, and/or Fe centers) have been identified via experiments and density functional theory calculations.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2015.2405852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7094326","Border traps;gallium nitride;HEMTs;interface traps;low-frequency noise;MOS devices;noise;oxide traps;radiation response;silicon carbide","Noise;Temperature measurement;Metals;Noise measurement;Frequency measurement;Thermal noise;Scattering","","156","","187","OAPA","24 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, scaling the two-level dual-active bridge to higher dc voltage levels is impeded by several challenges among which the high dv/dt stress on the coupling transformer insulation. Gating and thermal characteristics of series switch arrays add to the limitations. To avoid the use of standard bulky modular multilevel bridges, this paper analyzes an alternative modulation technique, where staircase approximated trapezoidal voltage waveforms are produced; thus, alleviating developed dv/dt stresses. Modular design is realized by the utilization of half-bridge chopper cells. This way the analyzed dc-dc transformer employs modular multilevel converters operated in a new mode with minimal common-mode arm currents, as well as reduced capacitor size, hence reduced cell footprint. Suitable switching patterns are developed and various design and operation aspects are studied. Soft-switching characteristics will be shown to be comparable to those of the two-level dual-active bridge.

In particular, the substitution of rare earths onto the Bi3+ site of the perovskite lattice have been shown to lead to improved functional properties, including lower leakage currents and the suppression of the magnetic spin cycloid. There is particular interest in materials with compositions close to structural morphotropic phase boundaries, because these may lead to materials with enhanced electronic and magnetic properties analogous to the highly relevant PbZrO3-PbTiO3 solid solution. However, many contradictory crystal structures and physical behaviors are reported within the literature. To understand the structure-property relationships in these materials, it is vital that we first unravel the complex structural phase diagrams. We report here a comprehensive review of structural phase transitions in rare-earth-doped bismuth ferrite ceramics across the entire lanthanide series. We attempt to rationalize the literature in terms of the perovskite tool kit and propose an updated phase diagram based on an interpretation of the literature.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7002926","","Ceramics;Ions;Lattices;Diffraction;X-ray diffraction","","150","","61","IEEE","12 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Motion between slice acquisitions results in spatial inconsistencies that can be resolved by slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods to provide high quality 3D image data. Existing algorithms are, however, typically very slow, specialised to specific applications and rely on approximations, which impedes their potential clinical use. In this paper, we present a fast multi-GPU accelerated framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. It is based on optimised 2D/3D registration, super-resolution with automatic outlier rejection and an additional (optional) intensity bias correction. We introduce a novel and fully automatic procedure for selecting the image stack with least motion to serve as an initial registration target. We evaluate the proposed method using artificial motion corrupted phantom data as well as clinical data, including tracked freehand ultrasound of the liver and fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We achieve speed-up factors greater than 30 compared to a single CPU system and greater than 10 compared to currently available state-of-the-art multi-core CPU methods. We ensure high reconstruction accuracy by exact computation of the point-spread function for every input data point, which has not previously been possible due to computational limitations. Our framework and its implementation is scalable for available computational infrastructures and tests show a speed-up factor of 1.70 for each additional GPU. This paves the way for the online application of image based reconstruction methods during clinical examinations.

The control at the high level allows the dc motor angular velocity to track a desired trajectory and also provides the desired voltage profile that must be tracked by the output voltage of the dc/dc Buck power converter. In order to assure the latter, a cascade control at the low level is designed, considering a sliding mode control for the inner current loop and a proportional-integral control for the outer voltage loop. The hierarchical controller is tested through experiments using MATLAB-Simulink and the DS1104 board from dSPACE.

In this paper, we propose an energy efficient virtual network embedding (EEVNE) approach for cloud computing networks, where power savings are introduced by consolidating resources in the network and data centers. We model our approach in an IP over WDM network using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The performance of the EEVNE approach is compared with two approaches from the literature: the bandwidth cost approach (CostVNE) and the energy aware approach (VNE-EA). The CostVNE approach optimizes the use of available bandwidth, while the VNE-EA approach minimizes the power consumption by reducing the number of activated nodes and links without taking into account the granular power consumption of the data centers and the different network devices. The results show that the EEVNE model achieves a maximum power saving of 60% (average 20%) compared to the CostVNE model under an energy inefficient data center power profile. We develop a heuristic, real-time energy optimized VNE (REOViNE), with power savings approaching those of the EEVNE model. We also compare the different approaches adopting an energy efficient data center power profile. Furthermore, we study the impact of delay and node location constraints on the energy efficiency of virtual network embedding. We also show how VNE can impact the design of optimally located data centers for minimal power consumption in cloud networks. Finally, we examine the power savings and spectral efficiency benefits that VNE offers in optical orthogonal division multiplexing networks.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2014.2380777","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); INTERNET(grant numbers:EP/H040536/1); STAR(grant numbers:EP/K016873/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985595","Network Virtualization;Virtual Network Embedding;Energy Efficient Networks;IP over WDM Networks;Cloud Networks;MILP;Optical OFDM;Cloud networks;energy efficient networks;IP over WDM networks;MILP;network virtualization;optical OFDM;virtual network embedding","Power demand;Substrates;Servers;IP networks;Energy efficiency;Optical fibers","","142","","45","OAPA","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No new elements are introduced. Moreover, the charging is achieved without any hardware reconfiguration since the existing elements and their connections are not altered during the transfer from propulsion to the charging mode. Instead, the operating principle is based on additional degrees of freedom that exist in nine-phase machines. These degrees of freedom are employed to avoid electromagnetic torque production in the machine during the charging process, although currents flow through its stator windings. The configuration operates with a unity power factor and is capable of vehicle to grid (V2G) operation as well.

In our approach, the analysis of the entire response of the structure at hand (e.g., S-parameters as a function of frequency) is replaced by response surface modeling of suitably selected feature points. On the one hand, this is sufficient to determine whether a design satisfies given performance specifications. On the other, by exploiting the almost linear dependence of the feature points on the designable parameters of the structure, reliable yield estimates can be realized at low computational cost. Our methodology is verified using two examples of waveguide filters and one microstrip hairpin filter and compared with conventional Monte Carlo analysis based on repetitive electromagnetic simulations, as well as with statistical analysis exploiting linear response expansions around the nominal design. Finally, we perform yield-driven design optimizations on these filters.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2014.2373365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6971248","Design centering;electromagnetic (EM) modeling;microwave component modeling.;statistical analysis;tolerance-aware design;yield estimation;yield-driven design","Yield estimation;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Statistical analysis;Approximation methods;Vectors;Microwave theory and techniques","","137","","33","OAPA","2 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Statistical evidence has revealed that the majority of deaths resulting from skin cancer are as a result of melanoma. Further investigations have shown that the survival rates in patients depend on the stage of the cancer; early detection and intervention of melanoma implicate higher chances of cure. Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma are challenging, since the processes are prone to misdiagnosis and inaccuracies due to doctors' subjectivity. Malignant melanomas are asymmetrical, have irregular borders, notched edges, and color variations, so analyzing the shape, color, and texture of the skin lesion is important for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. This paper proposes the two major components of a noninvasive real-time automated skin lesion analysis system for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. The first component is a real-time alert to help users prevent skinburn caused by sunlight; a novel equation to compute the time for skin to burn is thereby introduced. The second component is an automated image analysis module, which contains image acquisition, hair detection and exclusion, lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed system uses PH2 Dermoscopy image database from Pedro Hispano Hospital for the development and testing purposes. The image database contains a total of 200 dermoscopy images of lesions, including benign, atypical, and melanoma cases. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient, achieving classification of the benign, atypical, and melanoma images with accuracy of 96.3%, 95.7%, and 97.5%, respectively.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2015.2419612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079463","image segmentation;skin cancer;melanoma;Image segmentation;skin cancer;melanoma","Skin;Malignant tumors;Lesions;Hair;Skin cancer;Image segmentation;Real-time systems","","136","","61","OAPA","3 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All such algorithms, including asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM), pulse-amplitude-modulated discrete multitone modulation (PAM-DMT) and unipolar orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (U-OFDM), experience an inherent loss in spectral efficiency caused by the restrictions imposed on the OFDM frame structure required for the generation of a unipolar signal. The current paper presents a modified modulation approach, termed enhanced U-OFDM (eU-OFDM), which compensates the spectral efficiency loss in U-OFDM. At the same time, it still allows for the generation of an inherently unipolar modulation signal that achieves better performance in terms of both electrical power and optical power dissipation compared to the conventional state-of-the-art technique direct current (DC)-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM). To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current work also presents the first experimental proof-of-concept demonstration of both U-OFDM and eU-OFDM, and clearly demonstrates the significant energy advantages that these two schemes can introduce in an optical wireless communications (OWC) system.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2015.2432530","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/K008757/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106494","Optical wireless communication (OWC);orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);optical modulation;intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD);Optical wireless communication (OWC);orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);optical modulation;intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD)","OFDM;Time-domain analysis;Demodulation;Signal to noise ratio;Light emitting diodes;Interference","","135","","26","CCBY","13 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite its numerous advantages, the data dissemination to the mobile sink is a challenging task for the resource constrained sensor nodes due to the dynamic network topology caused by the sink mobility. For efficient data delivery, nodes need to reconstruct their routes toward the latest location of the mobile sink, which undermines the energy conservation goal. In this paper, we present a virtual grid-based dynamic routes adjustment (VGDRA) scheme that aims to minimize the routes reconstruction cost of the sensor nodes while maintaining nearly optimal routes to the latest location of the mobile sink. We propose a set of communication rules that governs the routes reconstruction process thereby requiring only a limited number of nodes to readjust their data delivery routes toward the mobile sink.

This paper adopts a key feature in the CM of a covariance matrix adaptation ES, the cumulatively learned evolution path (EP), to formulate a new evolutionary algorithm (EA) framework, termed DEEP, standing for DE with an EP. Without mechanistically combining two CM and DM based algorithms together, the DEEP framework offers advantages of both a DM and a CM and hence substantially enhances performance. Under this architecture, a self-adaptation mechanism can be built inherently in a DEEP algorithm, easing the task of predetermining algorithm control parameters. Two DEEP variants are developed and illustrated in the paper.

Meanwhile, the rumor publishers’ behavior may diverge from normal users’, and a rumor post may have different responses from a normal post. However, mass behavior on rumor posts has not been explored adequately. Hence, we investigate rumor identification schemes by applying five new features based on users’ behaviors, and combine the new features with the existing well-proved effective user behavior-based features, such as followers’ comments and reposting, to predict whether a microblog post is a rumor.

In this paper, an effective wall clutter mitigation approach is proposed for TWRI that does not require knowledge of the background scene nor does it rely on accurate modeling and estimation of wall parameters. The proposed approach is based on the relative strength of the exterior wall returns compared to behind-wall targets. It applies singular value decomposition to the data matrix constructed from the space-frequency measurements to identify the wall subspace. Orthogonal subspace projection is performed to remove the wall electromagnetic signature from the radar signals. Furthermore, this paper provides an analysis of the wall and target subspace characteristics, demonstrating that both wall and target subspaces can be multidimensional. While the wall subspace depends on the wall type and building material, the target subspace depends on the location of the target, the number of targets in the scene, and the size of the target. Experimental results using simulated and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the subspace projection method in mitigating wall clutter while preserving the target image. It is shown that the performance of the proposed approach, in terms of the improvement factor of the target-to-clutter ratio, is better than existing approaches and is comparable to that of background subtraction, which requires knowledge of a reference background scene.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2014.2355211","Australian Research Council; Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-11-0576); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906269","Singular value decomposition (SVD);subspace projection;target subspace;through-the-wall radar imaging (TWRI);wall clutter removal;wall subspace;Singular value decomposition (SVD);subspace projection;target subspace;through-the-wall radar imaging (TWRI);wall clutter removal;wall subspace","Antenna arrays;Clutter;Radar imaging;Radar antennas;Indexes","","132","","30","OAPA","22 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a graph signal in the low-frequency subspace, the missing data associated with unsampled vertices can be reconstructed through the sampled data by exploiting the smoothness of the graph signal. In this paper, the concept of local set is introduced and two local-set-based iterative methods are proposed to reconstruct bandlimited graph signal from sampled data. In each iteration, one of the proposed methods reweights the sampled residuals for different vertices, while the other propagates the sampled residuals in their respective local sets. These algorithms are built on frame theory and the concept of local sets, based on which several frames and contraction operators are proposed. We then prove that the reconstruction methods converge to the original signal under certain conditions and demonstrate the new methods lead to a significantly faster convergence compared with the baseline method. Furthermore, the correspondence between graph signal sampling and time-domain irregular sampling is analyzed comprehensively, which may be helpful to future works on graph signals. Computer simulations are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the reconstruction methods in various sampling geometries, imprecise priori knowledge of cutoff frequency, and noisy scenarios.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2015.2411217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7055883","Graph signal processing;irregular domain;graph signal sampling and reconstruction;frame theory;local set;bandlimited subspace","Laplace equations;Signal sampling;Reconstruction algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Signal reconstruction;Convergence","","131","","41","OAPA","6 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, HetNets have attracted great interest from academia and industry in deploying more effective solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, e.g., machine learning, bio-inspired algorithms, fuzzy neural network, and so on, because AI techniques can naturally handle the problems of large-scale complex systems, such as HetNets towards more intelligent and automatic-evolving ones.

This paper presents a new spatial-temporal forecasting method based on the vector autoregression framework, which combines observations of solar generation collected by smart meters and distribution transformer controllers. The scope is 6-h-ahead forecasts at the residential solar photovoltaic and medium-voltage (MV)/LV substation levels. This framework has been tested in the smart grid pilot of Évora, Portugal, and using data from 44 microgeneration units and 10 MV/LV substations.

This paper proposes a cognition-driven formulation of space mapping that does not require explicit surrogates. The proposed method is applied to EM-based filter optimization. The new technique utilizes two sets of intermediate feature space parameters, including feature frequency parameters and ripple height parameters. The design variables are mapped to the feature frequency parameters, which are further mapped to the ripple height parameters. By formulating the cognition-driven optimization directly in the feature space, our method increases optimization efficiency and the ability to avoid being trapped in local minima. The technique is suitable for design of filters with equal-ripple responses. It is illustrated by two microwave filter examples.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2015.2431675","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN 122049-09,RGPIN7239-11,STPGP447367-13); Tianjin University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116620","Cognition-driven design;computer-aided design (CAD);electromagnetic (EM) optimization;microwave filters;modeling;space mapping (SM)","Optimization;Computational modeling;Passband;Integrated circuit modeling;Microwave filters;Filtering theory","","129","","29","OAPA","2 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Partly due to the advent of compressive sensing, methods that can optimally exploit sparsity in signals have received tremendous attention in recent years. In this paper, we will describe a variety of scenarios in which signal sparsity arises naturally in 5G wireless systems. Signal sparsity and the associated rich collection of tools and algorithms will thus be a viable source for innovation in 5G wireless system design. We will also describe applications of this sparse signal processing paradigm in Multiple Input Multiple Output random access, cloud radio access networks, compressive channel-source network coding, and embedded security. We will also emphasize an important open problem that may arise in 5G system design, for which sparsity will potentially play a key role in their solution.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2407194","European Commission through the 5GNOW Project ()(grant numbers:318555); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the PROPHYLAXE project ()(grant numbers:16KIS0005K); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(grant numbers:WU 598/4-1); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DTRA-DMS 1042939); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:N66001-11-1-4090); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:JU 2795/2-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7047686","Compressed Sensing;Cloud Radio Acess Networks;Massive Random Access;Compressed sensing;cloud radio acess networks;massive random access;embedded security;source coding","Network security;Signal processing;4G mobile communication;Sparse matrices;Compressed sensing;Wireless communication;Mobile communication;5G mobile communication","","128","","46","OAPA","24 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the mathematical modeling analysis, the zero-sequence equivalent circuit based on the PMSG system is proposed. Meanwhile, a zero-sequence current suppression controller is designed. In this paper, a zero vector redistribution PWM technique is proposed. With this technique, the dwell times of zero vectors (000) and (111) for both converters are determined.

This paper will assess and compare the reliability metrics for the machine-side converter (MSC) for those two configurations. First, a translation from the mission profile of the turbine to the current and voltage loading of each power semiconductor is achieved based on synchronous generator modeling. Afterward, a simplified approach to calculate the loss profile and the thermal profile is used to determine the most stressed power semiconductors in the converter. Finally, according to the lifetime power cycles, the lifespan can be calculated when operating in various wind classes. It is concluded that, although the LS PMSG is able to eliminate the gearbox, the lifespan of its MSC is lower than the one-stage MS generator.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2015.2447502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7151832","Power electronics converter;permanentmagnet synchronous generator;loss profile;thermal profile;lifetime prediction;Lifetime prediction;loss profile;permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG);power electronic converter;thermal profile","Stators;Wind speed;Wind turbines;Synchronous generators;Insulated gate bipolar transistors","","127","","39","OAPA","7 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hotspot problem affects the network connectivity and decreases the network lifetime. Hence, we propose a tree-cluster-based data-gathering algorithm (TCBDGA) for WSNs with a mobile sink. A novel weight-based tree-construction method is introduced. The root nodes of the constructed trees are defined as rendezvous points (RPs). Additionally, some special nodes called subrendezvous points (SRPs) are selected according to their traffic load and hops to root nodes. RPs and SRPs are viewed as stop points of the mobile sink for data collection, and can be reselected after a certain period. The simulation and comparison with other algorithms show that our TCBDGA can significantly balance the load of the whole network, reduce the energy consumption, alleviate the hotspot problem, and prolong the network lifetime.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2424452","Qing Lan Project; 2013 Special Fund of Guangdong Higher School Talent Recruitment; Educational Commission of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2013KJCX0131); Guangdong High-Tech Development Fund(grant numbers:2013B010401035); 2013 Top Level Talents Project in Sailing Plan of Guangdong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401107); 2014 Guangdong Province Outstanding Young Professor Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091856","data gathering scheme;cluster;mobile sink;wireless sensor networks;Data-gathering scheme;cluster;mobile sink;wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks;Industrial plants;Information analysis;Data collection;Clustering algorithms;Mobile communication;Load modeling;Energy consumption;Tree data structures","","126","1","35","OAPA","22 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together. Our experiment was performed at a large local institute network for two months, and all the features were studied with big data, which includes ~400 million DNS queries.

Four combinations of capacitive IMNs are considered, i.e., SP in a transmitting side and SP in a receiving (Rx) side (SP-SP), SP-PS, PS-SP, and PS-PS. The optimum capacitance values for each IMN are also derived by circuit analysis. For verification, three cases based on the number of Rx coils are considered, and the calculated results are compared with the simulated and measured results for each case. A WPT system for only a single device has identical power transfer efficiency for four combinations of the IMNs. Multidevice WPT systems with the PS IMN in Rx sides are found to transfer more power toward the Rx coil with lower load impedance according to the load variation. On the other hand, using the SP IMN in Rx sides is less sensitive to load variation than using the PS IMN.

Ankle mechanical impedance plays a pivotal role at the interface between the neuro-mechanical system and the physical world. This paper reports, for the first time, a characterization of human ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom simultaneously as it varies with time during walking. Ensemble-based linear time-varying system identification methods implemented with a wearable ankle robot, Anklebot, enabled reliable estimation of ankle mechanical impedance from the pre-swing phase through the entire swing phase to the early-stance phase. This included heel-strike and toe-off, key events in the transition from the swing to stance phase or vice versa. Time-varying ankle mechanical impedance was accurately approximated by a second order model consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both inversion-eversion and dorsiflexion-plantarflexion directions, as observed in our previous steady-state dynamic studies. We found that viscosity and stiffness of the ankle significantly decreased at the end of the stance phase before toe-off, remained relatively constant across the swing phase, and increased around heel-strike. Closer investigation around heel-strike revealed that viscosity and stiffness in both planes increased before heel-strike occurred. This finding is important evidence of “pretuning” by the central nervous system. In addition, viscosity and stiffness were greater in the sagittal plane than in the frontal plane across all subgait phases, except the early stance phase. Comparison with previous studies and implications for clinical study of neurologically impaired patients are provided.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2346927","Samsung; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6879304","Ankle impedance;ankle joint;ankle joint stiffness;ankle stiffness;human ankle;time-varying impedance","Legged locomotion;Impedance;Joints;Mathematical model;Time-varying systems","Adult;Ankle Joint;Computer Simulation;Elastic Modulus;Electric Impedance;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Gait;Humans;Locomotion;Male;Models, Biological;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Robotics;Stress, Mechanical;Viscosity;Young Adult","122","1","54","OAPA","15 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Question of how to understand a situation of physical system by estimating process parameters is largely unexplored. This paper is concerned with the distributed estimation problem for industrial automation over relay-assisted WSNs. Different from most existing works on WSN with homogeneous sensor nodes, the network considered in this paper consists of two types of nodes, i.e., sensing nodes (SNs), which is capable of sensing and computing, and relay nodes (RNs), which is only capable of simple data aggregation. We first adopt a Kalman filtering (KF) approach to estimate the unknown physical parameters. In order to facilitate the decentralized implementation of the KF algorithm in relay-assisted WSNs, a tree-based broadcasting strategy is provided for distributed sensor fusion. With the fused information, the consensus-based estimation algorithms are proposed for SNs and RNs, respectively. The proposed method is applied to estimate the slab temperature distribution in a hot rolling process monitoring system, which is a typical industrial CPS. It is demonstrated that the introduction of RNs improves temperature estimation efficiency and accuracy compared with the homogeneous WSN with SNs only.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2386615","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1405251,61273181,61221003,61290322,61174127); Ministry of Education, China(grant numbers:NCET-13-0358,20110073120025); Science and Technology Commission through Shanghai Municipality, China(grant numbers:13QA1401900); Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China(grant numbers:B832,14LGA010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004846","Cyber-Physical System;Ubiquitous monitoring;Wireless sensor network;Relay;Consensus;Estimation;Cyber-physical system;ubiquitous monitoring;wireless sensor network;relay;consensus;estimation","Estimation;Wireless sensor networks;Relays;Tin;Monitoring;Kalman filters;Sensors","","122","1","32","OAPA","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fully taking into account the uncertainty and dynamics in wind energy supply and EV charging demand, this stochastic and multistage matching is formulated as a Markov decision process. In order to enhance the computational efficiency, the effort is made in two aspects. Firstly, the problem size is reduced by aggregating EVs according to their remaining parking time. The charging scheduling is carried out on the level of aggregators and the optimality of the original problem is proved to be preserved.

While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in “tighter” relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2372478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980142","Global solution;moment relaxations;optimal power flow;semidefinite optimization","Relaxation methods;Load flow;Optimization;Mathematical model;Reactive power","","120","","43","OAPA","9 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a vector sparse representation model for color images using quaternion matrix analysis. As a new tool for color image representation, its potential applications in several image-processing tasks are presented, including color image reconstruction, denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution. The proposed model represents the color image as a quaternion matrix, where a quaternion-based dictionary learning algorithm is presented using the K-quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) (generalized K-means clustering for QSVD) method. It conducts the sparse basis selection in quaternion space, which uniformly transforms the channel images to an orthogonal color space. In this new color space, it is significant that the inherent color structures can be completely preserved during vector reconstruction. Moreover, the proposed sparse model is more efficient comparing with the current sparse models for image restoration tasks due to lower redundancy between the atoms of different color channels. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sparse image model avoids the hue bias issue successfully and shows its potential as a general and powerful tool in color image analysis and processing domain.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2015.2397314","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61201384,61221001,61025005); 111 Project B07022; National Basic Research Program(grant numbers:2010CB731401); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:12DZ2272600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7024169","Vector sparse representation;quaternion matrix analysis;color image;dictionary learning;K-QSVD;image restoration","Quaternions;Color;Vectors;Dictionaries;Image color analysis;Image reconstruction","","119","","62","OAPA","27 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The unique geometry of device-to-device links, where user equipment is often held or carried at low elevation and in close proximity to the human body, will mean that they are particularly susceptible to shadowing events caused not only by the local environment but also by the user's body. In this paper, the shadowed κ - μ fading model is proposed, which is capable of characterizing shadowed fading in wireless communication channels. In this model, the statistics of the received signal are manifested by the clustering of multipath components. Within each of these clusters, a dominant signal component with arbitrary power may exist. The resultant dominant signal component, which is formed by the phasor addition of these leading contributions, is assumed to follow a Nakagami- m distribution. The probability density function, moments, and the moment-generating function are also derived. The new model is then applied to device-to-device links operating at 868 MHz in an outdoor urban environment. It was found that shadowing of the resultant dominant component can vary significantly depending upon the position of the user equipment relative to the body and the link geometry. Overall, the shadowed κ - μ fading model is shown to provide a good fit to the field data as well as providing a useful insight into the characteristics of the received signal.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2369613","Royal Academy of Engineering; Engineering and Physical Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/H044191/1,EP/L026074/1); Leverhulme Trust; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6953146","Device-to-device communications;shadowing;channel measurements;channel modeling;$\kappa-\mu$ distribution;Device-to-device communications;shadowing;channel measurements;channel modeling;$\kappa-\mu$ distribution","Fading;Shadow mapping;Mathematical model;Buildings;Wireless communication;Equations;Biological system modeling","","117","","31","CCBY","11 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through the orthogonal transformation returned by PCA decomposition, we reduce the dimensionality of the TS to a lower number k of distinct variables; this allows us to cast the original prediction problem in k different one-step ahead predictions. The overall forecast can be effectively managed by k distinct prediction models, whose outputs are combined together to obtain the final result.

FPGAs also support programmability by allowing the circuit to be changed at a later time through reconfiguration. There is great interest in exploiting these benefits in space and other radiation environments. FPGAs, however, are very sensitive to radiation and great care must be taken to properly address the effects of radiation in FPGA-based systems.

Therefore, optical camera communications (OCC) using RGB LEDs and color cameras is a promising candidate for cost-effective parallel visible light communications (VLC). In this paper, a single RGB LED-based OCC system utilizing a combination of undersampled phase-shift on-off keying (UPSOOK), wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques is designed, which offers higher space efficiency (3 bits/Hz/LED), long-distance, and nonflickering VLC data transmission. A proof-of-concept test bed is developed to assess the bit-error-rate performance of the proposed OCC system. The experimental results show that the proposed system using a single commercially available RGB LED and a standard 50-frame/s camera is able to achieve a data rate of 150 bits/s over a range of up to 60 m.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2486680","EU cLINK project(grant numbers:GN. 372242-1-2012-1-UK-ERA); EU Cost Action IC 1101; NSFC(grant numbers:61471052); Doctoral Scientific Fund of MOE of China(grant numbers:20120005110010); Fund of State Key Laboratory of Information Photon. & Opt.

The interplay among structural properties of the arterial wall, morphometry, anatomy, wave propagation phenomena, and ultimately, cardiovascular diseases continues to be poorly understood. Accurate models are powerful tools to shed light on these open problems. We developed an anatomically detailed computational model of the arterial vasculature to conduct 1-D blood flow simulations to serve as simulation infrastructure to aid cardiovascular research. An average arterial vasculature of a man was outlined in 3-D space to serve as geometrical substrate for the mathematical model. The architecture of this model comprises almost every arterial vessel acknowledged in the medical/anatomical literature, with a resolution down to the luminal area of perforator arteries. Over 2000 arterial vessels compose the model. Anatomical, physiological, and mechanical considerations were employed for the set up of model parameters and to determine criteria for blood flow distribution. Computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate blood flow and wave propagation phenomena in such arterial network. A sensitivity analysis was developed to unveil the contributions of model parameters to the conformation of the pressure waveforms. In addition, parameters were modified to target model to a patient-specific scenario. On the light of the knowledge domain, we conclude that the present model features excellent descriptive and predictive capabilities in both patient-generic and patient-specific cases, presenting a new step toward integrating an unprecedented anatomical description, morphometric, and simulations data to help in understanding complex arterial blood flow phenomena and related cardiovascular diseases.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2364522","Brazilian agencies CNPq and FAPERJ; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933913","Blood flow;vascular anatomy;1D model;patient-specific;Blood flow;1-D model;patient specific;vascular anatomy;waveforms","Arteries;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Blood;Numerical models;Data models;Materials","Adult;Arteries;Blood Flow Velocity;Blood Pressure;Computer Simulation;Humans;Male;Models, Anatomic;Models, Cardiovascular;Regional Blood Flow;Vascular Resistance","113","","77","OAPA","22 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We apply the patch-monopole hybrid antenna to two GPS receivers and compute the difference between the standard deviation of each receiver's C/No. The priori probability of spoofing is calculated from the distributions of the difference. A counter is embedded in the physical layer to identify the most suspicious PMU. In the upper layer, the spoofing attack is considered similarly to the bad data injection toward the power system. A trustworthiness evaluation, which is based on both the physical layer information and power grid measurements, is applied to identify the PMU being attacked.

Deep learning approaches pose a unique challenge: while such architectures dominate the field of face recognition with regard to accuracy, they require elaborate, multi-stage computations. Recently, there has been some work on compressing networks for the purpose of reducing run time and network size. However, it is not clear that these compression methods would work in deep face nets, which are, generally speaking, less redundant than the object recognition networks, i.e., they are already relatively lean. We propose two novel methods for compression: one based on eliminating lowly active channels and the other on coupling pruning with repeated use of already computed elements. Pruning of entire channels is an appealing idea, since it leads to direct saving in run time in almost every reasonable architecture.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2494536","Broadcom Foundation and Tel Aviv University Authentication Initiative; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7303876","Face recognition;neural network compression","Biometrics;Resource management;Face recognition;Image compression","","109","4","38","OAPA","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SS is ultimately limited by the density of states broadening at the band edges and the on-current density is estimated based on the interlayer charge transfer time measured in recent experimental studies. To minimize supply voltage VDD while simultaneously maximizing on currents, Thin-TFETs are best realized in heterostructures with near broken gap energy band alignment. Using the WSe2/SnSe2 stacked-monolayer heterostructure, a model material system with desired properties for Thin-TFETs, the performance of both n-type and p-type Thin-TFETs is theoretically evaluated. Nonideal effects such as a nonuniform van der Waals gap thickness between the two 2-D semiconductors and finite total access resistance are also studied.

This paper presents a markerless human-robot interface that incorporates Kalman filters (KFs) and particle filters (PFs) to track the posture of human hands. This method allows one operator to control dual robot manipulators by using his/her double hands without any contact devices or markers. The algorithm employs Leap Motion to determine the orientation and the position of the human hands. Although the position and the orientation of the hands can be obtained from the sensor, the measurement errors increase over time due to the noise of the devices and the tracking error. The PFs and KFs are used to estimate the position and the orientation of the human hand. Due to the limitations of the perception and the motor, a human operator cannot accomplish high-precision manipulation without any assistance. An adaptive multispace transformation is employed to assist the operator to improve the accuracy and reliability in determining the posture of the manipulator. The greatest advantage of this method is that the posture of the human hands can be estimated accurately and steadily without any assistant markers. The human-manipulator interface system was experimentally verified in a laboratory, and the results indicate that such an interface can successfully control dual robot manipulators even if the operator is not an expert.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2014.2362095","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61403145); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2014M550436); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2014ZM0039); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918516","Human-robot interface;particle filter (PF);Kalman filter (KF);markerless;Human–robot interface;Kalman filter (KF);markerless;particle filter (PF)","Tracking;Estimation;Vectors;Quaternions;Manipulators;Robot kinematics","","106","","29","OAPA","8 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently available IP protection solutions are usually limited to protect single FPGA configurations and require permanent secret key storage in the FPGA. In addition, they cannot provide a commercially popular pay-per-device licensing solution. In this paper, we propose a novel IP protection mechanism to restrict IP's execution only on specific FPGA devices in order to efficiently protect IPs from being cloned, copied, or used with unauthorized integration. This mechanism can also enforce the pay-per-device licensing, which enables the system developers to purchase IPs from the core vendors at the low price based on usage instead of paying the expensive unlimited IP license fees. In our proposed binding-based mechanism, FPGA vendors embed into each enrolled FPGA device with a physical unclonable function (PUF) customized for FPGAs; IP vendors embed augmented finite-state machines (FSM) into the original IPs such that the FSM can be activated by the PUF responses from the FPGA device. We propose protocols to lock and unlock FPGA IPs, demonstrate how PUF can be embedded onto FPGA devices, and analyze the security vulnerabilities of our PUF-FSM binding method. We implement a 128-bit delay-based PUF on 28-nm FPGAs with only 258 RAM-lookup tables and 256 flipflops. The PUF responses are unique and reliable against environment changes.

Classical security solutions use algorithmic mechanisms that address a small subset of emerging security requirements, often at high-energy and performance overhead. Further, emerging side-channel and physical attacks can compromise classical security solutions. Hardware security solutions overcome many of these limitations with less energy and performance overhead. Nanoelectronics-based hardware security preserves these advantages while enabling conceptually new security primitives and applications. This tutorial paper shows how one can develop hardware security primitives by exploiting the unique characteristics such as complex device and system models, bidirectional operation, and nonvolatility of emerging nanoelectronic devices. This paper then explains the security capabilities of several emerging nanoelectronic devices: memristors, resistive random-access memory, contact-resistive random-access memory, phase change memories, spin torque-transfer random-access memory, orthogonal spin transfer random access memory, graphene, carbon nanotubes, silicon nanowire field-effect transistors, and nanoelectronic mechanical switches.

This interpretation creates new opportunities for building neuromorphic systems driven by probabilistic learning algorithms. However, such systems must have two crucial features: 1) the neurons should follow a specific behavioral model, and 2) stochastic spiking should be implemented efficiently for it to be scalable. This paper proposes a memristor-based stochastically spiking neuron that fulfills these requirements. First, the analytical model of the memristor is enhanced so it can capture the behavioral stochasticity consistent with experimentally observed phenomena. The switching behavior of the memristor model is demonstrated to be akin to the firing of the stochastic spike response neuron model, the primary building block for probabilistic algorithms in spiking neural networks. Furthermore, the paper proposes a neural soma circuit that utilizes the intrinsic nondeterminism of memristive switching for efficient spike generation. The simulations and analysis of the behavior of a single stochastic neuron and a winner-take-all network built of such neurons and trained on handwritten digits confirm that the circuit can be used for building probabilistic sampling and pattern adaptation machinery in spiking networks. The findings constitute an important step towards scalable and efficient probabilistic neuromorphic platforms.","2156-3365","","10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2435512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7117477","Neuromorphic systems;probabilistic inference;probabilistic learning;spiking neurons;stochastic computing;stochastic memristors;winner-take-all","Switches;Memristors;Stochastic processes;Neurons;Biological system modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Probabilistic logic","","105","1","75","OAPA","3 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the locations of corruptions may differ for different query gaits, relevant features may become irrelevant when walking condition changes. In this case, it is difficult to train one fixed classifier that is robust to a large number of different covariates. To tackle this problem, we propose a classifier ensemble method based on the random subspace nethod (RSM) and majority voting (MV). Its theoretical basis suggests it is insensitive to locations of corrupted features, and thus can generalize well to a large number of covariates. We also extend this method by proposing two strategies, i.e., local enhancing (LE) and hybrid decision-level fusion (HDF) to suppress the ratio of false votes to true votes (before MV). The performance of our approach is competitive against the most challenging covariates like clothing, walking surface, and elapsed time. We evaluate our method on the USF dataset and OU-ISIR-B dataset, and it has much higher performance than other state-of-the-art algorithms.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2366766","Royal Society’s International Exchange Programme(grant numbers:IE120092); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945828","Classifier ensemble;random subspace method;local enhancing;hybrid decision-level fusion;gait recognition;covariate factors;biometrics;Classifier ensemble;random subspace method;local enhancing;hybrid decision-level fusion;gait recognition;covariate factors;biometrics","Feature extraction;Legged locomotion;Gait recognition;Training;Analytical models","Algorithms;Databases, Factual;Gait;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","105","","31","CCBY","4 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a novel design method to consider die-attachment solder failures induced by short power cycling and baseplate solder fatigue induced by the thermal cycling which are among major failure mechanisms of IGBTs. Thermal resistance is calculated analytically and the plastic work design is obtained with a high-fidelity finite-element model, which has been validated experimentally. The objective of minimizing the plastic work and constrain functions is formulated by the surrogate model.

This work uses both raw data from household consumption data and synthetic profiles. The motivation for this work is to improve the clustering of electricity load profiles to help distinguish user types for tariff design and switching, fault and fraud detection, demand-side management, and energy efficiency measures.

The concept of local and central controller enables our architecture to work in case of infrastructure damage and hotspot traffic situation. The architecture helps to maintain the communication between disaster victims and first responders by installing multi-hop routing path with the support of the SDN controller.

This paper describes additional contribution to primary frequency control based on voltage-dependent noncritical (NC) loads that can tolerate a wide variation of supply voltage. By using a series of reactive compensators to decouple the NC load from the mains to form a smart load (SL), the voltage, and hence the active power of the NC load, can be controlled to regulate the mains frequency. The scope of this paper focuses primarily on reactive compensators for which only the magnitude of the injected voltage could be controlled while maintaining the quadrature relationship between the current and voltage. New control guidelines are suggested. The effectiveness of the SLs in improving mains frequency regulation without considering frequency-dependent loads and with little relaxation in mains voltage tolerance is demonstrated in a case study on the IEEE 37 bus test distribution network. Sensitivity analysis is included to show the effectiveness and limitations of SLs for varying load power factors, proportion of SLs, and system strengths.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2015.2402637","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission; Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, U.K.(grant numbers:EP/K036327/1); University of Hong Kong Seed Funds(grant numbers:201111159239,201203159010); Hong Kong Research Grant Council(grant numbers:T23-701/14-N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051270","Demand response (DR);demand-side management (DSM);electric spring (ES);primary frequency control;reactive compensator;smart load (SL);voltage control;Demand response (DR);demand-side management (DSM);electric spring (ES);primary frequency control;reactive compensator;smart load (SL);voltage control","Frequency control;Reactive power;Power demand;Impedance;Inverters;Automatic voltage control","","101","","29","CCBY","27 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Characterizing the fundamental energy efficiency (EE) performance of HetNets is therefore important for the design of green wireless systems. In this paper, we address the EE optimization problem for downlink two-tier HetNets comprised of a single macro-cell and multiple pico-cells. Considering a heterogeneous real-time and non-real-time traffic, transmit beamforming design and power allocation policies are jointly considered in order to optimize the system energy efficiency. The EE resource allocation problem under consideration is a mixed combinatorial and non-convex optimization problem, which is extremely difficult to solve. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we decompose the original problem with multiple inequality constraints into multiple optimization problems with single inequality constraint. For the latter problem, a two-layer resource allocation algorithm is proposed based on the quasiconcavity property of EE. Simulation results confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation algorithm can efficiently approach the optimal EE.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2015.2435351","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/J021768/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110517","Green radio (GR);energy efficiency (EE);heterogeneous network (HetNet);resource allocation;Green radio (GR);energy efficiency (EE);heterogeneous network (HetNet);resource allocation","Resource management;Interference;Real-time systems;Licenses;Optimized production technology;Array signal processing","","99","","34","CCBY","20 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During nearly four decades of experimental and theoretical efforts, those challenges have been successfully met to a great extent. This success is a result of the efforts of a large number of researchers. Today, the gas-puff  $Z$ -pinch has evolved into a powerful source of X-rays and neutrons, and is fielded on multi-Mega-Ampere generators. The basic force imploding a pinch is straightforward, but the operation of a gas puff requires specialized hardware and a thorough understanding of the radiation physics involves magnetohydrodynamics coupled with nonequilibrium ionization kinetics. The goal of this review is to document the experiments and theory that have led to the success of the gas puff as a K-shell X-ray and neutron source.

In this paper, a multiuser VLC system utilizing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is investigated. Since the distances of the multiple transmitter-receiver links are different, their temporal delays are also different, resulting in complex channel gain and phase differences when transformed to the frequency domain. For each subcarrier in OFDM, the corresponding precoding matrix is calculated in the frequency domain to eliminate multiuser interference. Phase information in the frequency domain is first considered, where complex, instead of real, channel matrices are used for precoding, which reduces the channel correlation and achieves better performance. Moreover, minimum dc bias, unified dc bias, and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM-based schemes are proposed to generate real-valued nonnegative signals for intensity modulation, and their performances are validated via simulations with zero forcing and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) precoding techniques.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2497224","National Key Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2013CB329203); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271266); Shenzhen Visible Light Communication System Key Laboratory(grant numbers:ZDSYS20140512114229398); Shenzhen Wireless over Visible Light Communication Technology Engineering Laboratory(grant numbers:SDRC[2012]No.1440); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:1108170036003286); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314864","Visible light communication;multiple-input multiple-output;multiple-input multiple-output;orthogonal frequency-division;multiplexing;multiuser;precoding;Visible light communication (VLC);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM);multiuser;precoding","Light emitting diodes;OFDM;Interference;Receivers;Frequency-domain analysis;Visible light communication;Optical transmitters","","98","","27","OAPA","2 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper is exclusively focused on how the computational demand of such a computation can be reduced. The main idea is to use a local approximation of the gridded cost-to-go and derive an analytic solution for the optimal torque split decision at each point in the time and state grid. Thereby, it is not necessary to quantize the torque split and identify the optimal decision by interpolating in the cost-to-go. Two different approximations of the cost-to-go are considered in this paper: 1) a local linear approximation and 2) a quadratic spline approximation. The results indicate that computation time can be reduced by orders of magnitude with only a slight degradation in simulated fuel economy. Furthermore, with a spline approximated cost-to-go, it is also possible to significantly reduce the memory storage requirements. A parallel plug-in HEV is considered in this paper, but the method is also applicable to an HEV.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2014.2329864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6828783","Dynamic programming;closed-form solutions;computational efficiency;energy management;hybrid electric vehicles","Linear approximation;Torque;Engines;Splines (mathematics);Vehicles;Energy management","","98","","24","IEEE","10 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new feedforward term is included in the guidance command considering variable standoff distance, and the convergence of the vector field to the standoff orbit is analyzed and enhanced by adjusting radial velocity using two active measures associated with vector field generation. Moreover, for multiple group tracking by multiple UAVs, a two-phase approach is proposed as a suboptimal solution for a Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem, consisting of target clustering/assignment and cooperative standoff group tracking with online local replanning. Lastly, localization sensitivity to the group of targets is investigated for different angular separations between UAVs and sensing configurations.

As long-term ECG recordings continue to increase in prevalence, driven partly by the ease of remote monitoring technology usage, the need to automate ECG analysis continues to grow. In previous studies, a model-based ECG filtering approach to ECG data from healthy subjects has been applied to facilitate accurate online filtering and analysis of physiological signals. We propose an extension of this approach, which models not only normal and ventricular heartbeats, but also morphologies not previously encountered. A switching Kalman filter approach is introduced to enable the automatic selection of the most likely mode (beat type), while simultaneously filtering the signal using appropriate prior knowledge. Novelty detection is also made possible by incorporating a third mode for the detection of unknown (not previously observed) morphologies, and denoted as X-factor. This new approach is compared to state-of-the-art techniques for the ventricular heartbeat classification in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Incart databases. F1 scores of 98.3% and 99.5% were found on each database, respectively, which are superior to other published algorithms' results reported on the same databases. Only 3% of all the beats were discarded as X-factor, and the majority of these beats contained high levels of noise. The proposed technique demonstrates accurate beat classification in the presence of previously unseen (and unlearned) morphologies and noise, and provides an automated method for morphological analysis of arbitrary (unknown) ECG leads.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2402236","Royal Academy of Engineering(grant numbers:793/914/N/K/EST/DD PF/tkg/4004642); Wellcome Trust(grant numbers:098461/Z/12/Z); University of Oxford Sleep; Circadian Neuroscience Institute; U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Balliol French Anderson Scholarship Fund; MindChild Medical Inc.; RCUK Digital Economy Programme(grant numbers:EP/G036861/1); Oxford Centre for Doctoral Training in Healthcare Innovation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038137","Electrocardiogram;heartbeat classification;switching Kalman filter;Electrocardiogram;heartbeat classification;switching Kalman filter","Electrocardiography;Heart beat;Morphology;Databases;Noise;Heart rate variability;Covariance matrices","Algorithms;Databases, Factual;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Supervised Machine Learning","96","","27","OAPA","10 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, the diverse evaluation methods that have been applied to evaluate TEL recommender systems are investigated. A total of 235 articles are selected from major conferences, workshops, journals, and books where relevant work have been published between 2000 and 2014. These articles are quantitatively analysed and classified according to the following criteria: type of evaluation methodology, subject of evaluation, and effects measured by the evaluation. Results from the survey suggest that there is a growing awareness in the research community of the necessity for more elaborate evaluations. At the same time, there is still substantial potential for further improvements. This survey highlights trends and discusses strengths and shortcomings of the evaluation of TEL recommender systems thus far, thereby aiming to stimulate researchers to contemplate novel evaluation approaches.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2015.2438867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7115158","Recommender Systems;Evaluation;Survey;Technology Enhanced Learning;K Computing Milieux;K.3 Computers and Education;K.3.1 Computer Uses in Education;K.3.1.d Distance learning;Recommender systems;evaluation;survey;technology enhanced learning","Recommender systems;Market research;Life testing;Prediction algorithms","","96","","271","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In indoor environments, multiple LEDs routinely used as lighting sources may also be concomitantly invoked to support wireless services for multiple users, thus forming a multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Since the user terminals detect all the light rays impinging from multiple LEDs, inter-user interference may severely degrade the attainable system performance. Hence, we conceive a transceiver design for indoor VLC MU-MISO systems to suppress the multiuser interference (MUI). In contrast to classic radio-frequency (RF) communication, in VLC, the signals transmitted from the LEDs are restricted by optical constraints, such as the real-valued nonnegativity of the optical signal, the maximum permissible optical intensity, and the constant brightness requirements of the LEDs. Given these practical constraints, we design the optimal transceiver relying on the objective function of minimizing the maximum mean square error (MMSE) between the legitimate transmitted and received signals of the users and show that it can be readily found by solving a convex second-order cone program. Then, we also propose a simplified transceiver design by incorporating zero-forcing (ZF) transmit precoding (TPC) and show that the TPC coefficients can be efficiently found by solving a linear program. The performance of both the optimal and the simplified transceiver is characterized by comprehensive numerical results under diverse practical VLC system setups.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2446203","National Basic Research Program of China (973)(grant numbers:2013CB329203,2013CB336600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61201174); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK2012325); Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61223001); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Jiangsu Talent Introduction Project; Jiangsu Innovation Team Program; Research Fund of NCRL, Southeast University(grant numbers:2015A02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7124415","Light-emitting diode;Visible light communication;transceiver design;Light-emitting diode (LED);visible light communication;transceiver design;multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO);mean square error (MSE)","Light emitting diodes;Transceivers;Optical transmitters;Adaptive optics;Lighting;Radio frequency;Nonlinear optics","","95","","30","OAPA","16 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, higher data rates, beyond 10 Gb/s, are challenging due to the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and inter symbol interference (ISI). In this paper, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we propose, design, and evaluate a VLC system that employs beam steering (of part of the VLC beam) using adaptive finite vocabulary of holograms in conjunction with an imaging receiver and a DAT to enhance SNR and to mitigate the impact of ISI at high data rates (20 Gb/s). An algorithm was used to estimate the receiver location, so that part of the white light can be directed towards a desired target (receiver) using beam steering to improve SNR. Simulation results of our location estimation algorithm (LEA) indicated that the required time to estimate the position of the VLC receiver is typically within 224 ms in our system and environment. A finite vocabulary of stored holograms is introduced to reduce the computation time required by LEA to identify the best location to steer the beam to the receiver location. The beam steering approach improved the SNR of the fully adaptive VLC system by 15 dB at high data rates (20 Gb/s) over the DAT imaging LDs-VLC system in the worst-case scenario. In addition, we examined our new proposed system in a very harsh environment with mobility. The results showed that our proposed VLC system has strong robustness against shadowing, signal blockage, and mobility.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2015.2495165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307090","beam steering;location estimation;finite vocabulary of holograms;delay adaptation;imaging receiver;ISI;laser diodes;SNR;Beam steering;delay adaptation;finite vocabulary of holograms;imaging receiver;ISI;laser diodes;location estimation;SNR","Receivers;Signal to noise ratio;Imaging;Optical transmitters;Beam steering;Delays;Lighting","","94","1","59","OAPA","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to fulfill modern grid codes, over-excited reactive power injection will further reduce the lifetime of the RSC. In this paper, the additional stress of a power semiconductor due to the reactive power injection is first evaluated in terms of a modulation index and the current loading. Then, an optimized reactive power flow is proposed in the case where an over-excited reactive power support is applied with the joint compensation from both the RSC and the GSC.

We classify mobile users into different groups to study the resource consumption in mobile Internet. We observe that traffic heavy users and high mobility users tend to consume massive data and radio resources simultaneously. Both the data usage and the mobility pattern are closely related to the application access behavior of the users. Users can be clustered through their application usage behavior, and application categories can be identified by the ways to attract the users.

In this paper, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we propose, design, and evaluate the use of laser diodes (LDs) for communication as well as illumination. In addition, we propose an imaging receiver for a mobile VLC system to mitigate ISI. A novel delay adaptation technique is proposed to mitigate CCI, maximize the signal to noise ratio, and reduce the impact of multipath dispersion under user mobility. The proposed imaging system is able to provide data rates of 5 Gb/s in the worst-case scenario. The combination of a delay adaptation approach with an imaging receiver (DAT imaging LD-VLC system) adds a degree of freedom to the link design, which results in a VLC system that has the ability to provide higher data rates (i.e., 10 Gb/s) in the considered harsh indoor environment. The proposed technique (delay adaptation) achieves significant improvements in the VLC channel bandwidth (more than 16 GHz) over an imaging system in the worst-case scenario. The VLC channel characteristics and links were evaluated under diverse situations including an empty room and a room with very strong shadowing effects resulting from minicubicle offices.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2015.2439051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114202","Laser diodes;imaging receiver;multi-gigabit VLC system;real environment;Delay adaptation;imaging receiver;laser diodes;multi-gigabit VLC system;real environment","Receivers;Imaging;Lighting;Light emitting diodes;Delays;Bandwidth;Reflection","","91","","51","OAPA","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such tasks require extensive project experience of long term contributors (LTCs). Aim:  We measure, understand, and predict how the newcomers’ involvement and environment in the issue tracking system (ITS) affect their odds of becoming an LTC. Method: ITS data of Mozilla and Gnome, literature, interviews, and online documents were used to design measures of involvement and environment. A logistic regression model was used to explain and predict contributor’s odds of becoming an LTC. We also reproduced the results on new data provided by Mozilla. Results: We constructed nine measures of involvement and environment based on events recorded in an ITS. Macro-climate is the overall project environment while micro-climate is person-specific and varies among the participants. Newcomers who are able to get at least one issue reported in the first month to be fixed, doubled their odds of becoming an LTC. The macro-climate with high project popularity and the micro-climate with low attention from peers reduced the odds. The precision of LTC prediction was 38 times higher than for a random predictor. We were able to reproduce the results with new Mozilla data without losing the significance or predictive power of the previously published model. We encountered unexpected changes in some attributes and suggest ways to make analysis of ITS data more reproducible. Conclusions: The findings suggest the importance of initial behaviors and experiences of new participants and outline empirically-based approaches to help the communities with the recruitment of contributors for long-term participation and to help the participants contribute more effectively.

Time-frequency distributions facilitate the representation of such modulations in a micro-Doppler signature that is useful in the characterization and classification of targets. Reliable micro-Doppler signature classification requires the use of robust features that are capable of uniquely describing the micromotion. Moreover, future applications of micro-Doppler classification will require meaningful representation of the observed target by using a limited set of values. In this paper, the application of the pseudo-Zernike moments for micro-Doppler classification is introduced. Specifically, the proposed algorithm consists of the extraction of the pseudo-Zernike moments from the cadence velocity diagram (CVD). The use of pseudo-Zernike moments allows invariant features to be obtained that are able to discriminate the content of two-dimensional matrices with a small number of coefficients. The analysis has been conducted both on simulated and on real radar data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for classification purposes.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2014.130762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073502","","Polynomials;Feature extraction;Spectrogram;Blades;Vectors;Doppler radar","","90","","32","CCBY","7 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, we explore an efficient keyframe-based relocalization method based on frame encoding using randomized ferns. The method enables automatic discovery of keyframes through online harvesting in tracking mode, and fast retrieval of pose candidates in the case when tracking is lost. Frame encoding is achieved by applying simple binary feature tests which are stored in the nodes of an ensemble of randomized ferns. The concatenation of small block codes generated by each fern yields a global compact representation of camera frames. Based on those representations we define the frame dissimilarity as the block-wise hamming distance (BlockHD). Dissimilarities between an incoming query frame and a large set of keyframes can be efficiently evaluated by simply traversing the nodes of the ferns and counting image co-occurrences in corresponding code tables. In tracking mode, those dissimilarities decide whether a frame/pose pair is considered as a novel keyframe. For tracking recovery, poses of the most similar keyframes are retrieved and used for reinitialization of the tracking algorithm. The integration of our relocalization method into a hand-held KinectFusion system allows seamless continuation of mapping even when tracking is frequently lost.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2360403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912003","camera relocalization;tracking recovery;dense tracking and mapping;marker-free augmented reality;Camera relocalization;tracking recovery;dense tracking and mapping;marker-free augmented reality","Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Real-time systems;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Pipelines;Encoding","","89","","50","IEEE","26 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The TV-regularization-based image restoration model has a good performance in preserving image sharpness and edges while removing noises, and it is therefore effective for edge preserve SAR image despeckling. Experiments have been carried out using optical images contaminated with artificial speckles first and then SAR images. A despeckling evaluation index (DEI) is designed to assess the effectiveness of edge preserve despeckling on SAR images, which is based on the ratio of the standard deviations of two neighborhood areas of different sizes of a pixel.

As a result, the noise contribution of the tail current transistor on the total phase noise can be significantly decreased without sacrificing the oscillator's voltage and current efficiencies. Furthermore, its special impulse sensitivity function (ISF) reduces the phase sensitivity to thermal circuit noise.

By intercepting the reflection of a projected laser pattern twice, the proposed system gives a closed-form solution for each reflected ray and a closed-form solution for the corresponding point on the weld pool surface. The weld pool surface can be thus reconstructed by one-shot structured light projection. To increase the robustness of the measurement system, the least deformation principle is proposed to rectify the coefficient errors of the computed plane equation. Finally, a sequence of 3-D weld pools is reconstructed and compared with state-of-art literature. The comparison verifies that our method is significantly better than all the other methods in measuring the 3-D weld pool shapes.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2015.2405494","University of Kentucky(grant numbers:CMMI-0927707); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045536","Measurement;dynamic;one shot reconstruction;Closed-form solution;dynamic;measurement;one-shot reconstruction;weld pool","Welding;Equations;Cameras;Mathematical model;Image reconstruction;Measurement by laser beam","","86","","62","OAPA","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This feature allows pico-satellites to provide high temporal resolution of observational data and redundancy. In particular, it reduces the need for satellite-to-ground communications and, hence, helps save energy and allows the execution of distributed processing algorithms on the satellites themselves. Consequently, satellite-to-satellite or cross-link communication is critical. To realize these advantages, the cross-link antenna employed on pico-satellites must meet many criteria, namely, small size, lightweight, low-power consumption, high gain, wide bandwidth, circular polarization, and beam steerability. To date, no works have examined the suitability of existing planar antenna designs for the use on pico-satellites. To this end, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on microstrip patch and slot antennas that have the ability to achieve high gain, beam steering, and wide bandwidth. This paper reviews 66 planar antenna designs, which includes 38-patch and 28-slot antennas. In addition, we provide an extensive qualitative comparison of these antennas in terms of their mass, size, gain, beam steerability, type of polarization, operating frequency band, and return loss. In addition, we have evaluated three antenna designs that best address the pico-satellite challenges on a common platform. We find that the asymmetric E-shaped patch antenna design is the most suitable for the use on 2U CubeSats. This is because of its small size (34 × 13 mm2) and high gain (7.3 dB). In addition, the E-shaped patch antenna yields a wide -10-dB bandwidth of 2300 MHz and a small return loss of -15.2 dB.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2506577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358040","circular polarization;reconfigurable antennas;antenna arrays;beam steering;CubeSat;pico-satellites;pico-satellites;microstrip patch antennas;sequential phase-rotation;Photonic Band- Gap (PBG);Circular polarization;reconfigurable antennas;antenna arrays;beam steering;CubeSat;pico-satellites;planar antennas;microstrip patch antennas;sequential phase-rotation;photonic band-gap (PBG)","Gain;Satellites;Microstrip antennas;Planar arrays;Microstrip;Patch antennas","","85","","94","OAPA","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to simultaneous two-way exchange between two nodes, full-duplex access points can potentially support simultaneous uplink and downlink flows.

In this paper, we propose a random-access medium access control protocol using distributed power control to manage inter-client interference in wireless networks with full-duplex-capable access points that serve half-duplex clients. Our key contributions are two-fold. First, we identify the regimes in which power control provides sum throughput gains for the three-node atomic topology, with one uplink flow and one downlink flow. Second, we develop and benchmark PoCMAC, a full 802.11-based protocol that allows distributed selection of a three-node topology. The proposed MAC protocol is shown to achieve higher capacity as compared to an equivalent half-duplex counterpart, while maintaining similar fairness characteristics in single contention domain networks. We carried out extensive simulations and software-defined radio-based experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed MAC protocol, which is shown to achieve a significant improvement over its half-duplex counterpart in terms of throughput performance.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2015.2408338","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2014R1A2A2A01006002); NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1161596,CNS-1314822); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7053947","Full-duplex;power control;MAC protocol;wireless network;Full-duplex;power control;MAC protocol;wireless network","Interference;Media Access Protocol;Downlink;Uplink;Wireless networks;Signal to noise ratio;Receivers","","85","1","18","OAPA","3 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As an alternative, this paper takes the initial step of investigating the efficiency of rotor speed monitoring for BFD. The bearing failure modes are reviewed and their effects on the rotor speed signal are described. Based on this analysis, a novel BFD technique, the rotor speed-based BFD (RSB-BFD) method under variable speed and constant load conditions, is proposed to provide a benefit in terms of cost and simplicity. The proposed RSB-BFD method exploits the absolute value-based principal component analysis (PCA), which improves the performance of classical PCA by using the absolute value of weights and the sum square error.

Nevertheless, over recent years, it has been facing new challenges due to the introduction of mobility of nodes over static networks mainly caused by the opportunistic presence of nodes in such a scenario. The focus of discovery has, therefore, shifted toward more challenging environments, where connectivity opportunities need to be exploited for achieving communication. In fact, discovery has traditionally been focused on tradeoffs between energy and latency in order to reach an overlapping of communication times between neighboring nodes. With the introduction of opportunistic networking, neighbor discovery has instead aimed toward the more challenging problem of acquiring knowledge about the patterns of encounters between nodes. Many Internet of Things applications (e.g., smart cities) can, in fact, benefit from such discovery, since end-to-end paths may not directly exist between sources and sinks of data, thus requiring the discovery and exploitation of rare and short connectivity opportunities to relay data. While many of the older discovery approaches are still valid, they are not entirely designed to exploit the properties of these new challenging scenarios. A recent direction in research is, therefore, to learn and exploit knowledge about mobility patterns to improve the efficiency in the discovery process. In this paper, a new classification and taxonomy is presented with an emphasis on recent protocols and advances in this area, summarizing issues and ways for potential improvements. As we will show, knowledge integration in the process of neighbor discovery leads to a more efficient scheduling of the resources when contacts are expected, thus allowing for faster discovery, while, at the same time allowing for energy savings when such contacts are not expected.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2457031","EU FP7 SOCIOTAL Project(grant numbers:CNECT-ICT-609112); EU FP7 iCore Project(grant numbers:ICT-2011-287708); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7159017","Neighbour Discovery;Opportunistic Networking;Internet of Things;Mobility;Knowledge;Neighbour discovery;opportunistic networking;Internet of Things;mobility;knowledge","Internet of things;Knowledge transfer;Nearest neighbor searches;Search methods;Network topology;Knowledge engineering;Taxonomy","","82","","154","OAPA","15 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes an adaptive mulsemedia framework (ADAMS) for delivering scalable video and sensorial data to users. Unlike existing two-dimensional joint source-channel adaptation solutions for video streaming, the ADAMS framework includes three joint adaptation dimensions: video source, sensorial source, and network optimization. Using an MPEG-7 description scheme, ADAMS recommends the integration of multiple sensorial effects (i.e., haptic, olfaction, air motion, etc.) as metadata into multimedia streams. ADAMS design includes both coarse- and fine-grained adaptation modules on the server side: mulsemedia flow adaptation and packet priority scheduling. Feedback from subjective quality evaluation and network conditions is used to develop the two modules. Subjective evaluation investigated users' enjoyment levels when exposed to mulsemedia and multimedia sequences, respectively and to study users' preference levels of some sensorial effects in the context of mulsemedia sequences with video components at different quality levels. Results of the subjective study inform guidelines for an adaptive strategy that selects the optimal combination for video segments and sensorial data for a given bandwidth constraint and user requirement. User perceptual tests show how ADAMS outperforms existing multimedia delivery solutions in terms of both user perceived quality and user enjoyment during adaptive streaming of various mulsemedia content. In doing so, it highlights the case for tailored, adaptive mulsemedia delivery over traditional multimedia adaptive transport mechanisms.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2014.2371240","Enhancing Performance Initiative at Dublin City University Ireland; Enterprise Ireland Innovation Partnership project with Ericsson(grant numbers:IP/2011/0135); China Scholarship Council and Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:SFI/13/ISCA/2845); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957558","Mulsemedia;quality of experience;subjective testing","Haptic interfaces;Streaming media;Multimedia communication;Media;Olfactory;Motion pictures;Transform coding","","82","","38","CCBY","14 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes a DVS with improved TC sensitivity and event encoding. To enhance the TC sensitivity, each pixel employs a common-gate photoreceptor for low output noise and a capacitively-coupled programmable gain amplifier for continuous-time signal amplification without sacrificing the intra-scene dynamic range. A proposed in-pixel asynchronous delta modulator (ADM) better preserves signal integrity in event encoding compared with self-timed reset (STR) used in previous DVSs. A 60 × 30 prototype sensor array with a 31.2 μm pixel pitch was fabricated in a 1P6M 0.18 μm CMOS technology. It consumes 720 μW at a 100k event/s output rate. Measurements show that a 1% TC sensitivity with a 35% relative standard deviation is achieved and that the in-pixel ADM is up to 3.5 times less susceptible to signal loss than STR in terms of event number. These improvements can facilitate the application of DVSs in areas like optical neuroimaging which is demonstrated in a simulated experiment.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2015.2425886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7128412","Address event representation (AER);asynchronous delta modulator (ADM);capacitively coupled programmable gain amplifier (CC-PGA);communication delay;dynamic vision sensor (DVS);event encoding;noise;optical neuroimaging;photoreceptor;refractory period;self-timed reset (STR);temporal contrast sensitivity","Noise;Sensitivity;Encoding;Voltage control;Gain;Switches;Bandwidth","","80","","43","OAPA","18 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design is to keep the message secret to the ERs while maximizing the information rate at the IR and meeting the energy harvesting constraints at the ERs. Technically, our objective is to optimize the information-bearing beam and artificial noise energy beam for maximizing the secrecy rate of the IR subject to individual harvested energy constraints of the ERs for the case where the ERs can collude to perform joint decoding in an attempt to illicitly decode the secret message to the IR. As a by-product, we also solve the total power minimization problem subject to secrecy rate and energy harvesting constraints. Both scenarios of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter are addressed. For the imperfect CSI case, we study both eavesdroppers' channel covariance-based and worst case-based designs. Using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques, we show that there always exists a rank-one optimal transmit covariance solution for the IR. Furthermore, if the SDR results in a higher rank solution, we propose an efficient algorithm to always construct an equivalent rank-one optimal solution.

One of the biggest challenges faced by pneumonia endemic countries is the absence of a field deployable diagnostic tool that is rapid, low-cost and accurate. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a method to screen pneumonia based on the mathematical analysis of cough sounds. In particular, we propose a novel cough feature inspired by wavelet-based crackle detection work in lung sound analysis. These features are then combined with other mathematical features to develop an automated machine classifier, which can separate pneumonia from a range of other respiratory diseases. Both cough and crackles are symptoms of pneumonia, but their existence alone is not a specific enough marker of the disease. In this paper, we hypothesize that the mathematical analysis of cough sounds allows us to diagnose pneumonia with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Using a bedside microphone, we collected 815 cough sounds from 91 patients with respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, asthma, and bronchitis. We extracted wavelet features from cough sounds and combined them with other features such as Mel Cepstral coefficients and non-Gaussianity index. We then trained a logistic regression classifier to separate pneumonia from other diseases. As the reference standard, we used the diagnosis by physicians aided with laboratory and radiological results as deemed necessary for a clinical decision. The methods proposed in this paper achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 63%, respectively, in separating pneumonia patients from non-pneumonia patients based on wavelet features alone. Combining the wavelets with features from our previous work improves the performance further to 94% and 88% sensitivity and specificity. The performance far surpasses that of the WHO criteria currently in common use in resource-limited settings.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2381214","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USA; Challenges in Global Health Exploration(grant numbers:#OPP1008199 GCE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987276","Pneumonia;childhood cough;automated cough analysis;wavelet transform;Automated cough analysis;childhood cough;pneumonia;wavelet transform (WT)","Lungs;Diseases;Wavelet transforms;Training;Feature extraction;Wavelet analysis;Pediatrics","Child, Preschool;Cough;Female;Humans;Male;Pneumonia;Reproducibility of Results;Respiratory Sounds;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sound Spectrography;Wavelet Analysis","78","","28","OAPA","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulated Annealing (SA) and Greedy Algorithms have been widely used to find CIT test suites. From the literature, there is a widely-held belief that SA is slower, but produces more effective tests suites than Greedy and that SA cannot scale to higher strength coverage. We evaluated both algorithms on seven real-world subjects for the well-studied two-way up to the rarely-studied six-way interaction strengths. Our findings present evidence to challenge this current orthodoxy: real-world constraints allow SA to achieve higher strengths. Furthermore, there was no evidence that Greedy was less effective (in terms of time to fault revelation) compared to SA; the results for the greedy algorithm are actually slightly superior. However, the results are critically dependent on the approach adopted to constraint handling. Moreover, we have also evaluated a genetic algorithm for constrained CIT test suite generation. This is the first time strengths higher than 3 and constraint handling have been used to evaluate GA.

For emerging high-sensitivity direct pathogen counting, two technical challenges must be addressed. One is the formation of a bacteria-sized microelectrode, and the other is the development of a high-sensitivity and high-speed amperometry circuit. The requirement for microelectrode formation is that the gold microelectrodes are required to be as small as the target cell. By improving a self-aligned electroless plating technique, the dimensions of the microelectrodes on a CMOS sensor chip in this work were successfully reduced to 1.2 μm × 2.05 μm. This is 1/20th of the smallest size reported in the literature. Since a bacteria-sized microelectrode has a severe limitation on the current flow, the amperometry circuit has to have a high sensitivity and high speed with low noise. In this work, a current buffer was inserted to mitigate the potential fluctuation. Three test chips were fabricated using a 0.6- μm CMOS process: two with 1.2 μm × 2.05 μm (1024 × 1024 and 4 × 4) sensor arrays and one with 6- μm square (16 × 16) sensor arrays; and the microelectrodes were formed on them using electroless plating. The uniformity among the 1024 × 1024 electrodes arranged with a pitch of 3.6 μm × 4.45 μm was optically verified. For improving sensitivity, the trenches on each microelectrode were developed and verified optically and electrochemically for the first time. Higher sensitivity can be achieved by introducing a trench structure than by using a conventional microelectrode formed by contact photolithography. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements obtained using the 1.2 μm × 2.05 μm 4 × 4 and 6- μm square 16 × 16 sensor array with electroless-plated microelectrodes successfully demonstrated direct counting of the bacteria-sized microbeads and HeLa cells.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2479656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321836","Bacteria counting;CMOS;electroless plating;HeLa cells;microelectrode array;point-of-care testing","Microelectrodes;Gold;Plating;Sensitivity;Current measurement;Switches","Bacteria;Biomedical Engineering;Cell Count;Equipment Design;HeLa Cells;Humans;Microarray Analysis;Microelectrodes;Point-of-Care Systems;Semiconductors","77","1","30","OAPA","6 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we: 1) review the perspectives of such devices for low-power high-frequency analog integrated circuit applications (e.g., GHz operation with sub-0.1 mW power consumption); 2) discuss and employ a compact TFET device model in the context of the  $g_{m}/I_{d}$  integrated analog circuit design methodology; and 3) compare several proposed TFET technologies for such applications. The advantages of TFETs arise since these devices can operate in the sub-threshold region with larger transconductance-to-current ratio than traditional FETs, which is due to the current turn-on mechanism being interband tunneling rather than thermionic emission. Starting from technology computer-aided design and/or analytical models for Si-FinFETs, graphene nano-ribbon (GNR) TFETs and InAs/GaSb TFETs at the 15-nm gate-length node, as well as InAs double-gate TFETs at the 20-nm gate-length node, we conclude that GNR TFETs might promise larger bandwidths at low-voltage drives due to their high current densities in the sub-threshold region.

Under this situation, power flows become increasingly uncertain, especially when significant distributed generations (DGs), such as wind and solar, are integrated into power systems. In this paper, a Complex Affine arithmetic based unbalanced Three-phase Forward-Backward Sweep power flow model (CATFBS) is proposed to study the impacts of uncertainties in unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. An index of Relative Influence of Uncertain Variables on Outcomes (RIUVO) is proposed for quantifying the impacts of individual uncertain factors on power flows and bus voltages. The CATFBS method is tested on the modified IEEE 13-bus system and a modified 292-bus system. Numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms the Monte Carlo method for exploring the impacts of uncertainties on the operation of distribution systems. The proposed CATFBS method can be used by power system operators and planners to effectively monitor and control unbalanced distribution systems under various uncertainties.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2377042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987366","Affine arithmetic;forward-backward sweep;unbalance power flow;uncertainty","Uncertainty;Wind speed;Solar radiation;Load flow analysis","","76","","34","OAPA","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Along this line, improvements achieved by the implementation of uniaxial strain in nanowires (NW), the benefits of high-k/metal gates, and newly engineered tunneling junctions as well as the effect of scaling the NW to diameters of 10 nm are demonstrated. Specifically, self-aligned ion implantation into the source/drain silicide and dopant segregation has been exploited to achieve steep tunneling junctions with less defects. The obtained devices deliver high on-currents, e.g., gate-all-around (GAA) NW p-TFETs with 10 nm diameter show  ${I} _{\rm D} = 64~\mu $ A/ $\mu $ m at  ${V} _{\rm DS} = {V} _{\rm GS} - {V} _{\rm off} = -1.0$  V, and good inverse subthreshold slopes (SS). Tri-gate TFETs reach minimum SS of 30 mV/dec. Dopant segregation helps to minimize the defect density in the junction and thus trap assisted tunneling (TAT) is reduced. Pulsed current-voltage (I-V) measurements have been used to investigate TAT. We could show that scaled NW devices with multigates are less vulnerable to TAT compared to planar devices due to a shorter tunneling path enabled by the inherently good electrostatics. Furthermore, SiGe NW homo- and heterojunction TFETs have been investigated. The advantages of a SiGe/Si heterostructure as compared to a homojunction device are revealed and the effect of line tunneling which results in an increased BTBT generation is demonstrated. It is also shown that complementary strained Si TFET inverters and p-TFET NAND gates can be operated at  ${V} _{\rm DD}$  as low as 0.2 V. This suggests a great potential of TFETs for ultralow power applications. The analysis of GAA NW TFETs for analog applications provided a high transconductance efficiency and large intrinsic gain, even higher than for state-of-the-art 20 nm FinFETs at low voltages.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2015.2400371","European Project E2SWITCH; German Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung Project ULTRA LOW POW; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7031858","strained Si Nanowire;SiGe;Tunnel-FET;Strained Si nanowire;SiGe;tunnel-FET;subthreshold slope (SS);inverter;NAND;analog","Tunneling;Junctions;Silicon;Logic gates;Silicon germanium;Annealing;Ion implantation","","76","","41","OAPA","5 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees. The evaluation results show that our method can support accurate detection with very small number of false alarms under various data-leak scenarios.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398363","Security and Software Engineering Research Center, an NSF sponsored multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038200","Data leak;network security;privacy;collection intersection;Data leak;network security;privacy;collection intersection","Data privacy;Security;Organizations;Protocols;Privacy;Data models;Electronic mail","","75","","56","OAPA","10 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dual inverter driven open-end machine system consists of two inverters which are connected to the both ends of the machine winding. By disconnecting one inverter from the power source, the dc-link voltage of flying capacitor can be boosted through the machine. Because one inverter is connected to the only power source, output power of the machine is regulated by the source connected inverter. In this paper, modulation method for maximizing output power of inverter and motor with reduced harmonic and loss is proposed. It is a hybrid modulation combining six-step and pulse width modulations. With proposed method, efficiency and operation area are improved and cost of entire driving system is also decreased due to the removing of dc–dc converter.

Smart grid research is highly interdisciplinary. As such, the establishment of testbeds to conduct DRM requires various skill sets that might not always be possible to arrange. However, the implementation of a DRM scheme is critical not only to verify the correctness of the design in a practical environment but also to address many important assumptions that are necessary for the actual deployment of the scheme. Thus, the theoretical aspect of DRM solutions should be discussed and verified in a practical environment to ensure that the scheme is suitable for deployment. In this paper, we propose a DRM scheme and construct a residential smart grid testbed to implement the proposed scheme. In the proposed DRM scheme, we suggest two different types of customer engagement plans, namely, green savvy plan and green aware plan, and design algorithms based on two user inconvenience indices to evaluate DRM for peak load reduction.

In the second intervention, we used heatmap visualizations that show a prediction of the student's success if he or she continues to behave in the same way, based on data from earlier courses. The results from a controlled experiment show that the heatmap visualizations had an impact on how early the students submitted their exercises and how many points they earned from them. We also observed that performance approach goal orientation correlated with an interest towards the achievement badges whereas performance avoidance correlated with an interest towards the visualizations.

Measurements were performed by fixing a transmit pyramidal horn antenna, and rotating another one in the receiver site at 10° steps in azimuth. The antenna outputs are viewed as array signals, and a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is applied to estimate delay and angular parameters of multipath components. Benefiting from high resolution achieved by using the SAGE and deembedding of antenna radiation pattern and system responses, more multipath clusters with less spreads in delay and azimuth are found per channel compared with existing works on 28-GHz propagation.

An essential requirement for such services is that they are offered with quality of service (QoS) guarantees in terms of service reliability and availability. Searching for feasible routes subject to multiple QoS constraints is, in general, an NP-hard problem. Moreover, routing reliability needs to be paid special attention as communication links frequently break in VANETs. In this paper, we propose employing the situational awareness (SA) concept and an ant colony system (ACS)-based algorithm to develop a situation-aware multiconstrained QoS (SAMQ) routing algorithm for VANETs. SAMQ aims to compute feasible routes between the communicating vehicles subject to multiple QoS constraints and pick the best computed route, if such a route exists. To mitigate the risks inherited from selecting the best computed route that may turn out to fail at any moment, SAMQ utilizes the SA levels and ACS mechanisms to prepare certain countermeasures with the aim of assuring a reliable data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate that SAMQ is capable of achieving a reliable data transmission, as compared with the existing QoS routing algorithms, even when the network topology is highly dynamic.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2485305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7286854","Ant Colony System (ACS);QoS Routing;Situational Awareness;Vehicular Networks;VANETs;Ant colony system (ACS);quality of service (QoS) routing;situational awareness (SA);vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);vehicular networks","Routing;Quality of service;Vehicle ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Ant colony optimization;Connected vehicles","","74","","52","CCBY","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome the problems introduced due to the absence of matched (positive) image pairs in the target domain, we relax the discriminative constraint to a necessary condition only relying on the positive mean in the target domain. To estimate the target positive mean, we make use of all the available data from source and target domains as well as constraints in person reidentification. Inspired by adaptive learning methods, a new discriminative model with high confidence in target positive mean and low confidence in target negative image pairs is developed by refining the distance model learnt from the source domain. Experimental results show that the proposed AdaRSVM outperforms existing supervised or unsupervised, learning or non-learning reidentification methods without using label information in target cameras.

The previous research mainly focuses on exploring wireless signal fingerprints for this purpose, and several shortcomings need to be addressed first before real-world usage, e.g., demanding a large number of access points or labor-intensive site survey. In this paper, through a systematic empirical study, we first gain in-depth understandings of Bluetooth characteristics, i.e., the impact of various factors, such as distance, orientation, and obstacles on the Bluetooth received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Then, by mining from historical data, a novel localization model is built to describe the relationship between the RSSI and the device location. On this basis, we present an energy-efficient indoor localization scheme that leverages user motions to iteratively shrink the search space to locate the target device.

A planetary distribution of permanent receivers including challenging conditions at equatorial latitudes, is navigated in pure kinematic mode, located from 100 to 1300 km away from the nearest reference station used to derive the ionospheric model. It is shown that satellite orbits and clocks accurate to few centimeters and few tenths of nanoseconds, used in conjunction with an ionosphere with an accuracy better than 1 Total Electron Content Unit (16 cm in L1) reduce the convergence time of dual-frequency Precise Point Positioning, to decimeter-level (3-D) solutions. Horizontal convergence times are shortened 40% to 90%, whereas the vertical components are reduced by 20% to 60%.

The proposed prosthesis, which mainly consists of a low-power motor, weighs only 1.3 kg, excluding the battery. It focuses on terrain adaptation instead of providing positive work at the stance phase. A damping control strategy is proposed to enable the prosthesis to manipulate the ankle impedance during stance with little power consumption. Experiments with three amputee subjects using the robotic prosthesis on different terrains show similar angle trajectories to the intact limb during the controlled flexion (CF) period as well as improved gait symmetry and walking stability compared with the robotic prosthesis in the maximal damping mode.

Accurate prediction of the quality factor is essential for designing high-performance microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices. Several energy dissipation mechanisms contribute to the quality factor. Due to computational complexity, highly simplified models for the dominant dissipation mechanism, such as Zener's model for thermoelastic dissipation (TED), are often employed. However, the intuition provided by these models is inadequate to predict the quality factor of more complex designs and can be highly misleading. In this paper, we construct complete, quantitative, and predictive models with finite-element methods for the intrinsic energy dissipation mechanisms in MEMS resonators using full anisotropic representation of crystalline silicon and the temperature dependence of all parameters. We find that TED is often a more significant source of damping than has been assumed, because of the previously neglected role of crystalline anisotropy and small geometric features, such as etch release holes-all of which can now be included in practical models. We show that these models, along with simpler scaling models for extrinsic dissipation mechanisms, explain measurements of quality factor in diverse sets of MEMS resonators with unprecedented accuracy.

In particular the threshold voltage (  $V_{\rm th} $) variation in printed TFTs is a serious impediment to the successful launch of fully printed TFT-based devices in the market. The underlying causes of the  $V_{\rm th} $ variation in fully printed TFTs were analyzed by considering the misalignment of printed drain-source to gate electrodes, the rheology of electronic inks and effects from external sources of charge. By alleviating the influences of external sources of charge using a printed passivation layer,  $V_{\rm th} $ variation is maintained below 30% using a fully printed process. Based on the attainable variation range, the required number of integrated TFTs was estimated to fabricate a fully printed TFT-based radio frequency (RF) sensor device. A practical compromise enables fully printed RF sensors to be realized via  the scalability of printing processes that mitigate  $V_{\rm th} $ variation by minimizing the level of TFT integration. Prototypes of fully printed RF sensors with human interactive capability—an RF sensor label, and an RF  $e$-sensor (cyclic voltammetry) tag—are enabled with as few as 26 printed TFTs, demonstrating that low-cost and high throughput manufacturing of printed electronics is feasible.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2015.2410303","Sunchon National University; National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2014R1A6A1030419); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110426","Printed electronics;printed radio frequency (RF) $e$-sensors;printed radio frequency sensors;printed thin film transistor","Thin film transistors;Printed circuits;Radio frequency;Flexible electronics;Electrodes;Sensors;Logic gates;Radio frequency sensors","","72","","64","OAPA","19 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, SAT has received much attention from the EDA community, who developed algorithms that have had a significant impact on the performance of SAT solvers. EDA researchers introduced techniques such as conflict-driven clause learning, novel branching heuristics, and efficient unit propagation. These techniques form the basis of all modern SAT solvers. Using these ideas, contemporary SAT solvers can often handle practical instances with millions of variables and constraints. The continuing advances of SAT solvers are the driving force of modern model checking tools, which are used to check the correctness of hardware designs. Contemporary automated verification techniques such as bounded model checking, proof-based abstraction, interpolation-based model checking, and IC3 have in common that they are all based on SAT solvers and their extensions.

In this paper, a new method based on iterative line extraction and Voronoi integrated spectral point matching is developed. The core idea consists of three aspects: 1) An iterative procedure that combines line segment extraction and line intersections matching is proposed to avoid registration failure caused by poor feature extraction. 2) A multilevel strategy of coarse-to-fine registration is presented. The coarse registration aims to preserve main linear structures while reducing data redundancy, thus providing robust feature matching results for fine registration. 3) Voronoi diagram is introduced into spectral point matching to further enhance the matching accuracy between two sets of line intersection. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the matching performance.

In such an industrial environment with noise and interference, an efficient cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) scheme can achieve spectrum sharing between primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs), and effectively solve the spectrum scarcity and reduce energy consumption to make the IoT smarter. As a vital part of CSS, decision transmission (DT) between SUs and fusion center (FC) plays a crucial role. In traditional DT, each SU will transmit its local decision to FC with orthogonal channel in each sensing, which does not consider the packet error and packet loss due to noise during transmission, and aggravates spectrum scarcity and energy consumption. An energy-efficient reliable DT (ERDT) scheme is proposed to enhance CSS in industrial IoT, which considers both packet error and packet loss. First, the CSS mathematical model based on DT is formulated. Second, with rigorous mathematical deduction, the correct decision probability and the energy consumption are analyzed for both ERDT and DT based on logic OR-rule and AND-rule under three cases, respectively: 1) bit error only; 2) packet loss only; and 3) both bit error and packet loss. Detailed simulation results show that, compared with DT, the proposed ERDT can increase correct decision probability and reduce energy consumption for CSS under three different cases. When the existence probability of PU is 50%, the energy consumption of ERDT is only half of that of DT in CSS. Furthermore, when there are 30 SUs in CSS, the existence probability of PU is 50%, both pocket loss rate and bit error rate are 0.05, and the correct decision probability of ERDT is approaching to 1 for CSS in industrial IoT.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2501644","Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2013CFB444); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61103019,61272497); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7331232","Intelligent cooperative spectrum sensing;decision transmission;energy-efficient;industrial IoT;Intelligent cooperative spectrum sensing;decision transmission;energy-efficient;industrial IoT","Sensors;Cascading style sheets;Energy consumption;Packet loss;Interference;Energy efficiency","","70","1","35","OAPA","18 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In many tracking scenarios, traditional LS-based methods may not perform well owing to the presence of heavy-tailed noise. In this paper, we present a tracking approach using an approximate least absolute deviation (LAD)-based multitask multiview sparse learning method to enjoy robustness of LAD and take advantage of multiple types of visual features, such as intensity, color, and texture. The proposed method is integrated in a particle filter framework, where learning the sparse representation for each view of the single particle is regarded as an individual task. The underlying relationship between tasks across different views and different particles is jointly exploited in a unified robust multitask formulation based on LAD. In addition, to capture the frequently emerging outlier tasks, we decompose the representation matrix to two collaborative components that enable a more robust and accurate approximation. We show that the proposed formulation can be effectively approximated by Nesterov's smoothing method and efficiently solved using the accelerated proximal gradient method. The presented tracker is implemented using four types of features and is tested on numerous synthetic sequences and real-world video sequences, including the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark and ALOV++ data set.

Because the use of CPPM strategy in the inverter can ensure that the output CMV will be only two levels in any condition, the simple active CM filter (composed of a half-bridge circuit) in the hybrid filter can effectively suppress the output CMV and CM current. The passive filter in the hybrid filter consists of an added single tuned filter and the original DM low-pass filter. The single tuned filter is designed to lower the DM harmonics, which are aggravated by the CPPM strategy in the carrier frequency band.

This paper presents the evaluation of the orchestration support provided by GLUEPS-AR, a system aimed to help teachers in the coordination of across-spaces learning situations carried out in ULEs. The evaluation, following an interpretive research perspective, relied on a study where a pre-service teacher designed and enacted an authentic across-spaces learning situation in a primary school. The situation, which illustrates the orchestration challenges of ULEs, was aimed at fostering orienteering skills. It spanned five sessions taking place in the classroom, in the school's playground and at a nearby park, using multiple technologies and devices. The evaluation showed that GLUEPS-AR helped the teacher in the multiple aspects of orchestration, including implementation of his pedagogical ideas, adaptation in runtime, and sharing of orchestration load with students.

From a modeling standpoint, the semiconductor transport equations must account for this to predict accurate open-circuit voltages, even for cells on substrate. Using Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) lifetimes based on internal quantum efficiency measurements, the current-voltage characteristics of cells on substrate and thin-film cells (where the substrate is removed) are predicted to good accuracy. Using this calibrated photon recycling model, the influences of base thickness and SRH lifetimes on device performance are studied in order to determine an optimal cell design using a conventional silver back reflector and a near-perfect back reflector. The result is efficiencies of >28% under AM1.5g standard testing conditions for thin-film cells with electron and hole SRH lifetimes of 1 μs and 100 ns, respectively. Finally, the doping concentration in the emitter is found to be unimportant in dictating the cell's open-circuit voltage as the cell approaches the radiative limit, whereas for nonradiatively dominated cells, the open-circuit voltage is found to depend on the cell's built-in voltage via emitter doping.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2479463","European Space Agency (ESA); “Optimization of Photon Density in Ultra-Thin GaAs Solar Cells”(grant numbers:4000104852); German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296577","Device modeling;GaAs;photon recycling;photovoltaics;thin-film III–V semiconductors;Device modeling;GaAs;photon recycling;photovoltaics;thin-film III–V semiconductors","Gallium arsenide;Recycling;Photovoltaic cells;Thin films;Mirrors;III-V semiconductor materials","","68","1","52","OAPA","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, as human activities tend to complicate the construction of land wind farms, offshore locations, which can be found more easily near densely populated areas, can be seen as an attractive choice. However, the cost of an offshore wind farm is relatively high, and therefore, their reliability is crucial if they ever need to be fully integrated into the energy arena. This paper presents an analysis of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) extracts from the Lillgrund offshore wind farm for the purposes of monitoring. An advanced and robust machine-learning approach is applied, in order to produce individual and population-based power curves and then predict measurements of the power produced from each wind turbine (WT) from the measurements of the other WTs in the farm.

In this paper, we investigate the influence of ambient humidity versus feed gas humidity on the production of reactive components by atmospheric pressure plasma jets. By the use of a shielding gas curtain, we control the surrounding atmosphere around the active effluent region of the investigated argon RF-plasma jet (kinpen) and control the gas humidity of the ambient gas. By quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy and by Fourier transformed infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy, the effect of diffusing surrounding molecular species on the chemistry of the long-living reactive oxygen species is investigated. Mechanisms of H2O2 and O3 production are studied. In this paper, we have quantified the influence that ambient species, namely, water molecules, have on the reactive species' generation in the gas phase. It is shown that the effect of ambient humidity is important for the long-living species production, feed gas humidity, however, has the much stronger effect.

The classical energy management strategies employ the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms and rely on batteries in case of possible excess or deficit of energy. However, in order to realize constant current-constant voltage (IU) charging regime and increase the life span of batteries, energy management strategies require being more flexible with the power curtailment feature. In this paper, a coordinated and multivariable energy management strategy is proposed that employs a wind turbine and a photovoltaic array of a standalone DC microgrid as controllable generators by adjusting the pitch angle and the switching duty cycles. The proposed strategy is developed as an online nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm. Applying to a sample standalone dc microgrid, the developed controller realizes the IU regime for charging the battery bank. The variable load demands are also shared accurately between generators in proportion to their ratings.

The closed-loop stability of the power system controlled by the SPSSs and the CPSSs is analyzed. To verify the control performance of the SPSS, simulation studies are carried out in a 4-generator 11-bus power system and the IEEE 16-generator 68-bus power system.

To cope with stricter grid codes(e.g. reactive power compensation, low voltage ride-through operation, as well as steady and safe operation during long-term distorted grid), control strategies are continuously evolving. This paper starts with a control strategy using the combined reactive power compensation from both the back-to-back power converters for their optimized lifetime distribution under normal grid conditions. Afterwards, an advanced demagnetizing control is proposed to keep the minimum thermal stress of the rotor-side converter in the case of the short-term grid fault. A modularized control strategy of the DFIG system under unbalanced and distorted grid voltage is discussed, with the control targets of the smooth active and reactive power or the balanced and sinusoidal current of the rotor-side converter and the grid-side converter. Finally, a bandwidth based repetitive controller is evaluated to improve the DFIG system's robustness against grid frequency deviation.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2016.7933112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933112","Doubly-fed induction generator;reactive power;low voltage ride-through;unbalanced and distorted grid","","","13","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

In this paper, we investigate frequent subgraph mining on single large graphs using Pregel. We present the first distributed algorithm based on Pregel for single massive graphs.

The automated discovery of these underlying themes from corpora of text is of interest to numerous academic fields as well as to law enforcement organizations and commercial users. One useful class of tools to deal with such problems are topic models, which attempt to recover latent groups of word associations from the text. However, it is clear that these topics may also exhibit patterns in both time and space. The recovery of such patterns complements the analysis of the text itself and in many cases provides additional context. In this work we describe two methods for mining interesting spatio-temporal dynamics and relations among topics, one that compares the topic distributions as histograms in space and time and another that models topics over time as temporal or spatio-temporal Hawkes process with exponential trigger functions. Both methods may be used to discover topics with abnormal distributions in space and time. The second method also allows for self-exciting topics and can recover intertopic relationships (excitation or inhibition) in both time and space.

"The impact of hypoxia and its modification of the outcome of radiotherapy","M. R. Horsman; J. Overgaard",NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","S1","i90","i98","Since the initial observations made at the beginning of the last century, it has been established that solid tumors contain regions of low oxygenation (hypoxia). Tumor cells can survive in these hypoxic conditions and are a major factor in tumor radioresistance. This significance has resulted in hypoxia becoming the most cited biological topic in translational radiation oncology. Identifying hypoxic cells in human tumors has become paramount, and the ability to do this has been improved by the help of new imaging techniques and the use of predictive gene profiles. Substantial data confirm the presence of hypoxia in many types of human tumors, although with considerable heterogeneity among individual tumors. Various approaches have been investigated for eliminating the hypoxic population. These include increasing oxygen availability, directly radiosensitizing or killing the hypoxic cells, indirectly affecting them by targeting the tumor vascular supply, increasing the radiation dose to this resistant population, or by using radiation with a high linear energy transfer, for which hypoxia is believed to be less of an issue. Many of these approaches have undergone controlled clinical trials during the last 50 years, and the results have shown that hypoxic radiation resistance can indeed be overcome. Thus, ample data exists to support a high level of evidence for the benefit of hypoxic modification. However, such hypoxic modification still has no impact on general clinical practice. In this review we summarize the biological rationale, and the current activities and trials, related to identifying and overcoming hypoxia in modern radiotherapy.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148830","hypoxia;radiation;oxygen modifiers;radiosensitizers;hypoxic cell cytotoxins;vascular targeting agents","","","2","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Solving probabilistic inverse problems rapidly with prior samples","P. Käufl; A. P. Valentine; R. W. de Wit; J. Trampert",NA; NA; NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2016","205","3","1710","1728","Owing to the increasing availability of computational resources, in recent years the probabilistic solution of non-linear, geophysical inverse problems by means of sampling methods has become increasingly feasible. Nevertheless, we still face situations in which a Monte Carlo approach is not practical. This is particularly true in cases where the evaluation of the forward problem is computationally intensive or where inversions have to be carried out repeatedly or in a timely manner, as in natural hazards monitoring tasks such as earthquake early warning. Here, we present an alternative to Monte Carlo sampling, in which inferences are entirely based on a set of prior samples—that is, samples that have been obtained independent of a particular observed datum. This has the advantage that the computationally expensive sampling stage becomes separated from the inversion stage, and the set of prior samples—once obtained—can be reused for repeated evaluations of the inverse mapping without additional computational effort. This property is useful if the problem is such that repeated inversions of independent data have to be carried out. We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and present a practical way to make posterior inferences based on a set of prior samples. We compare the prior sampling based approach to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach that samples from the posterior probability distribution. We show results for both a toy example, and a realistic seismological source parameter estimation problem. We find that the posterior uncertainty estimates obtained based on prior sampling can be considered conservative estimates of the uncertainties obtained by directly sampling from the posterior distribution.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146931","Neural networks, fuzzy logic;Inverse theory;Probability distributions;Earthquake source observations;Early warning","","","2","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Formulation of geopotential difference determination using optical-atomic clocks onboard satellites and on ground based on Doppler cancellation system","Z. Shen; W. Shen; S. Zhang",NA; NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2016","206","2","1162","1168","In this study, we propose an approach for determining the geopotential difference using high-frequency-stability microwave links between satellite and ground station based on Doppler cancellation system. Suppose a satellite and a ground station are equipped with precise optical-atomic clocks (OACs) and oscillators. The ground oscillator emits a signal with frequency fa towards the satellite and the satellite receiver (connected with the satellite oscillator) receives this signal with frequency fb which contains the gravitational frequency shift effect and other signals and noises. After receiving this signal, the satellite oscillator transmits and emits, respectively, two signals with frequencies fb and fc towards the ground station. Via Doppler cancellation technique, the geopotential difference between the satellite and the ground station can be determined based on gravitational frequency shift equation by a combination of these three frequencies. For arbitrary two stations on ground, based on similar procedures as described above, we may determine the geopotential difference between these two stations via a satellite. Our analysis shows that the accuracy can reach 1 m2 s− 2 based on the clocks’ inaccuracy of about 10−17 (s s−1) level. Since OACs with instability around 10−18 in several hours and inaccuracy around 10−18 level have been generated in laboratory, the proposed approach may have prospective applications in geoscience, and especially, based on this approach a unified world height system could be realized with one-centimetre level accuracy in the near future.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8189075","Satellite gravity;Geopotential theory;Ionosphere/atmosphere interactions","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The quality of view synthesis depends on how one fills the occlusion area as well as how the pixels are created. Consequently, luminance adjustment and hole filling are two key issues in view synthesis. In this paper, two views are used to produce an arbitrary virtual synthesized view. One view is merged into another view using a local luminance adjustment method, based on local neighborhood region for the calculation of adjustment coefficient. Moreover, a maximum neighborhood spreading strength hole filling method is presented to deal with the micro texture structure when the hole is being filled. For each pixel at the hole boundary, its neighborhood pixels with the maximum spreading strength direction are selected as candidates; and among them, the pixel with the maximum spreading strength is used to fill the hole from boundary to center. If there still exist disocclusion pixels after once scan, the filling process is repeated until all hole pixels are filled.

In the Japanese ‘Kibo’ facility in the International Space Station (ISS), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has performed five life science experiments since 2009, and two additional experiments are currently in progress. The first life science experiment in space was the ‘Rad Gene’ project, which utilized two human cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines containing a mutated p53 gene (mp53) and a parental wild-type p53 gene (wtp53) respectively. Four parameters were examined: (i) detecting space radiation–induced DSBs by observing γH2AX foci; (ii) observing p53-dependent gene expression during space flight; (iii) observing p53-dependent gene expression after space flight; and (iv) observing the adaptive response in the two cell lines containing the mutated and wild type p53 genes after exposure to space radiation. These observations were completed and have been reported, and this paper is a review of these experiments. In addition, recent new information from space-based experiments involving radiation biology is presented here. These experiments involve human cultured cells, silkworm eggs, mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse eggs in various experiments designed by other principal investigators in the ISS/Kibo. The progress of Japanese science groups involved in these space experiments together with JAXA are also discussed here. The Japanese Society for Biological Sciences in Space (JSBSS), the Utilization Committee of Space Environment Science (UCSES) and the Science Council of Japan (ACJ) have supported these new projects and new experimental facilities in ISS/Kibo.

"Relationship between Cole–Cole model parameters and spectral decomposition parameters derived from SIP data","M. Weigand; A. Kemna",NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2016","205","3","1414","1419","Spectral induced polarization (SIP) data are commonly analysed using phenomenological models. Among these models the Cole–Cole (CC) model is the most popular choice to describe the strength and frequency dependence of distinct polarization peaks in the data. More flexibility regarding the shape of the spectrum is provided by decomposition schemes. Here the spectral response is decomposed into individual responses of a chosen elementary relaxation model, mathematically acting as kernel in the involved integral, based on a broad range of relaxation times. A frequently used kernel function is the Debye model, but also the CC model with some other a priorly specified frequency dispersion (e.g. Warburg model) has been proposed as kernel in the decomposition. The different decomposition approaches in use, also including conductivity and resistivity formulations, pose the question to which degree the integral spectral parameters typically derived from the obtained relaxation time distribution are biased by the approach itself. Based on synthetic SIP data sampled from an ideal CC response, we here investigate how the two most important integral output parameters deviate from the corresponding CC input parameters. We find that the total chargeability may be underestimated by up to 80percent and the mean relaxation time may be off by up to three orders of magnitude relative to the original values, depending on the frequency dispersion of the analysed spectrum and the proximity of its peak to the frequency range limits considered in the decomposition. We conclude that a quantitative comparison of SIP parameters across different studies, or the adoption of parameter relationships from other studies, for example when transferring laboratory results to the field, is only possible on the basis of a consistent spectral analysis procedure. This is particularly important when comparing effective CC parameters with spectral parameters derived from decomposition results.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146922","Electrical properties;Electromagnetic theory;Hydrogeophysics","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Investigating hydrological contributions to volcano monitoring signals: a time-lapse gravity example","B. Hemmings; J. Gottsmann; F. Whitaker; A. Coco",NA; NA; NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2016","207","1","259","273","Geophysical techniques are widely used to monitor volcanic unrest. A number of studies have also demonstrated that hydrological processes can produce or trigger geophysical signals. Hydrologically induced gravity signals have previously been recorded by specifically designed gravity surveys as well as, inadvertently, by volcano monitoring studies. Water table corrections of microgravity surveys are commonplace. However, the fluctuations of the water table beneath survey locations are often poorly known, and such a correction fails to account for changes in water-mass storage in the unsaturated zone. Here, we combine 2-D axis-symmetrical numerical fluid-flow models with an axis-symmetric, distributed-mass, gravity calculation to model gravity changes in response to fluctuating hydrological recharge. Flow simulations are based on tropical volcanic settings where high surface permeabilities promote thick unsaturated zones. Our study highlights that mass storage (saturation) changes within the unsaturated zone beneath a survey point can generate recordable gravity changes. We show that for a tropical climate, recharge variations can generate gravity variations of over 150μGal; although, we demonstrate that for the scenarios investigated here, the probability of recording such large signals is low. Our modelling results indicate that microgravity survey corrections based on water table elevation may result in errors of up to 100μGal. The effect of inter-annual recharge fluctuations dominate over seasonal cycles which makes prediction and correction of the hydrological contribution more difficult. Spatial hydrogeological heterogeneity can also impact on the accuracy of relative gravity surveys, and can even result in the introduction of additional survey errors. The loading fluctuations associated with saturation variations in the unsaturated zone may also have implications for other geophysical monitoring techniques, such as geodetic monitoring of ground deformation.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146794","Time variable gravity;Hydrogeophysics;Permeability and porosity;Volcano monitoring","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Previously, we demonstrated that the numbers of apoptotic cells in medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos decreased in the absence of p53 at 12–24 h after irradiation with 10-Gy gamma rays. Here, we used histology to examine the later morphological development of the irradiated medaka brain. In p53-deficient larvae, the embryonic brain possessed similar vacuoles in the brain and retina, although the vacuoles were much smaller and fewer than those found in wild-type embryos. At the time of hatching (6 days after irradiation), no brain abnormality was observed. In contrast, severe disorganized neuronal arrangements were still present in the brain of irradiated wild-type embryos. Our present results demonstrated that self-renewal of the brain tissue completed faster in the absence of p53 than wild type at the time of hatching because p53 reduces the acute severe neural apoptosis induced by irradiation, suggesting that p53 is not essential for tissue self-renewal in developing brain.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150090","p53;medaka;self-renewal;developing brain;radiation;histology","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

An estimation by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences for 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 was thus performed using a combination of the following three sources: thyroid measurement data (131I) for 1080 children examined in the screening campaign, whole-body counter measurement data (134Cs, 137Cs) for 3000 adults, and atmospheric transport dispersion model simulations. In this study, the residents of Futaba town, Iitate village and Iwaki city were shown to have the highest thyroid equivalent dose, and their doses were estimated to be mostly below 30 mSv.

We give a prescription for selecting the Katz parameter based on the objective of matching the centralities of the exponential counterpart. For our new choice of parameter, the resolvent can be very ill conditioned, but we argue that the centralities computed in floating point arithmetic can nevertheless reliably be used for ranking.

We acquired two CSEM lines in the west Svalbard continental slope, extending from the edge of the continental shelf (250m water depth) to water depths of around 800m. High resistivities (5–12Ωm) observed above the BSR support the presence of gas hydrate in water depths greater than 600m. High resistivities (3–4Ωm) at 390–600m water depth also suggest possible hydrate occurrence within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) of the continental slope. In addition, high resistivities (4–8Ωm) landward of the GHSZ are coincident with high-amplitude reflectors and low velocities reported in seismic data that indicate the likely presence of free gas. Pore space saturation estimates using a connectivity equation suggest 20–50percent hydrate within the lower slope sediments and less than 12percent within the upper slope sediments. A free gas zone beneath the GHSZ (10–20percent gas saturation) is connected to the high free gas saturated (10–45percent) area at the edge of the continental shelf, where most of the seeps are observed. This evidence supports the presence of lateral free gas migration beneath the GHSZ towards the continental shelf.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8189356","Electrical properties;Marine electromagnetics;Gas and hydrate systems;Arctic region","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It generally consists of three verification processes: the absolute point dose difference, the planar dose differences at each gantry angle, and the planar dose differences by 3D composite irradiation. However, this imposes a substantial workload on medical physicists. The objective of this study was to determine whether our novel method that predicts the 3D delivered dose allows certain patient-specific IMRT QAs to be curtailed. The object was IMRT QA for the pelvic region with regard to point dose and composite planar dose differences. We compared measured doses, doses calculated in the treatment planning system, and doses predicted by in-house software. The 3D predicted dose was reconstructed from the per-field measurement by incorporating the relative dose error distribution into the original dose grid of each beam. All point dose differences between the measured and the calculated dose were within ±3%, whereas 93.3% of them between the predicted and the calculated dose were within ±3%. As for planar dose differences, the gamma passing rates between the calculated and the predicted dose were higher than those between the calculated and the measured dose. Comparison and statistical analysis revealed a correlation between the predicted and the measured dose with regard to both point dose and planar dose differences. We concluded that the prediction-based approach is an accurate substitute for the conventional measurement-based approach in IMRT QA for the pelvic region. Our novel approach will help medical physicists save time on IMRT QA.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148934","QA;IMRT;gamma index;prediction;MapCHECK","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The Neutron exposure Accelerator System for Biological Effect Experiments (NASBEE) facility at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), Japan, was employed to provide 2-MeV neutrons. Neutron doses of 0.6, 1, 25, 50 and 100 mGy were chosen as priming doses. An X-ray dose of 2 Gy was chosen as the challenging dose. Zebrafish embryos were dechorionated at 4 h post fertilization (hpf), irradiated with a chosen neutron dose at 5 hpf and the X-ray dose at 10 hpf. The responses of embryos were assessed at 25 hpf through the number of apoptotic signals. None of the neutron doses studied could induce RAR. Non-induction of RAR in embryos having received 0.6- and 1-mGy neutron doses was attributed to neutron-induced hormesis, which maintained the number of damaged cells at below the threshold for RAR induction. On the other hand, non-induction of RAR in embryos having received 25-, 50- and 100-mGy neutron doses was explained by gamma-ray hormesis, which mitigated neutron-induced damages through triggering high-fidelity DNA repair and removal of aberrant cells through apoptosis. Separate experimental results were obtained to verify that high-energy photons could disable RAR. Specifically, 5- or 10-mGy X-rays disabled the RAR induced by a priming dose of 0.88 mGy of alpha particles delivered to 5-hpf zebrafish embryos against a challenging dose of 2 Gy of X-rays delivered to the embryos at 10 hpf.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148936","radioadaptive response;neutrons;zebrafish embryos;hormesis;NASBEE","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Thus, to investigate the RBE of spot-scanning beams, Chinese hamster fibroblast V79 cells were irradiated using the beam line at the Hokkaido University Hospital Proton Therapy Center. Cells were placed at six different depths, including the entrance of the proton beam and the proximal and distal part of the SOBP. Surviving cell fractions were analyzed using colony formation assay, and cell survival curves were obtained by the curve fitted using a linear–quadratic model. RBE 10 and RBE 37 were 1.15 and 1.21 at the center of the SOBP, respectively. In contrast, the distal region showed higher RBE values (1.50 for RBE 10 and 1.85 for RBE 37 ). These results are in line with those of previous studies conducted using passive scattering proton beams. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that variations in RBE should be considered during treatment planning for spot-scanning beams as well as for passive scattering proton beams.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148940","relative biological effectiveness;spot scanning;radiotherapy;proton therapy","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The risk of leukemia among the survivors increased remarkably in the early period after the bombings, especially among children. Increased risks of solid cancers have been evident since around 10 years after the bombings and are still present today. The LSS has clarified the dose–response relationships of radiation exposure and risk of various cancers, taking into account important risk modifiers such as sex, age at exposure, and attained age. Confounding by conventional risk factors including lifestyle differences is not considered substantial because people were non-selectively exposed to the atomic bomb radiation. Uncertainty in risk estimates at low-dose levels is thought to be derived from various sources, including different estimates of risk at background levels, uncertainty in dose estimates, residual confounding and interaction, strong risk factors, and exposure to residual radiation and/or medical radiation. The risk of cancer in subjects exposed in utero is similar to that in LSS subjects who were exposed in childhood. Regarding hereditary effects of radiation exposure, no increased risk of cancers associated with parental exposure to radiation have been observed in the F 1 cohort to date. In addition to biological and pathogenetic interpretations of the present results, epidemiological investigations using advanced technology should be used to further analyze these cohorts.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148828","atomic bomb survivors;epidemiology;cancer","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This unfavorable influence has, at least partly, been attributed to cancer cells acquiring a radioresistant phenotype through the activation of the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). On the other hand, accumulating evidence has recently revealed that, even though HIF-1 is recognized as an important regulator of cellular adaptive responses to hypoxia, it may not become active and induce tumor radioresistance under hypoxic conditions only. The mechanisms by which HIF-1 is activated in cancer cells not only under hypoxic conditions, but also under normoxic conditions, through cancer-specific genetic alterations and the resultant imbalance in intermediate metabolites have been summarized herein. The relevance of the HIF-1–mediated characteristic features of cancer cells, such as the production of antioxidants through reprogramming of the glucose metabolic pathway and cell cycle regulation, for tumor radioresistance has also been reviewed.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148832","hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1);radioresistance;cancer;metabolic reprogramming;tumor blood vessels;cell cycle;Warburg effect","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our results showed that [I L U L ] and [I H U L ] led to antagonistic effects, whereas [I H U H ] led to an additive effect. The effect found for the previously studied case of [I L U H ] was difficult to define because it was synergistic with reference to the 100 µg/l DU exposure, but it was antagonistic with reference to the 0.44 mGy alpha-particle dose. All the findings regarding the four different schemes showed that the combined effects critically depended on the dose response to each individual stressor.

For mice cotreated with genistein and X-rays, the excised tumor tissues had reduced blood vessels and decreased size and volume compared with the control and irradiation-only groups. Moreover, a significant increase in apoptosis was accompanied by upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 in the mitochondria, and lots of cytochrome c being transferred to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, X-rays combined with genistein inhibited the activity of DNA-PKcs, so DNA-injured sites were dominated by Ku70/80, leading to incompleteness of homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repairs and the eventual occurrence of cell apoptosis. Our study, for the first time, demonstrated that genistein sensitized sarcoma cells to X-rays and that this radiosensitizing effect depended on induction of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and inhibition of the double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148938","sarcoma;radiosensitivity;genistein;DNA damage repair;apoptosis","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Nagayama",NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","3","312","317","The biological effect of ionizing radiation (IR) on genomic DNA is thought to be either direct or indirect; the latter is mediated by IR induction of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study was designed to evaluate the effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a well-known ROS-scavenging antioxidant, on IR induction of genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and ROS production in mammalian cells, and aimed to clarify the conflicting data in previous publications. Although we clearly demonstrate the beneficial effect of NAC on IR-induced genotoxicity and cytotoxicity (determined using the micronucleus assay and cell viability/clonogenic assays), the data on NAC's effect on DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation were inconsistent in different assays. Specifically, mitigation of IR-induced DSBs by NAC was readily detected by the neutral comet assay, but not by the γH2AX or 53BP1 focus assays. NAC is a glutathione precursor and exerts its effect after conversion to glutathione, and presumably it has its own biological activity. Assuming that the focus assay reflects the biological responses to DSBs (detection and repair), while the comet assay reflects the physical status of genomic DNA, our results indicate that the comet assay could readily detect the antioxidant effect of NAC on DSB formation. However, NAC's biological effect might affect the detection of DSB repair by the focus assays. Our data illustrate that multiple parameters should be carefully used to analyze DNA damage when studying potential candidates for radioprotective compounds.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148942","DNA double-strand breaks;γH2AX;53BP1;comet assay;radiation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Radiobiology of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy: what are the optimal fractionation schedules?","Y. Shibamoto; A. Miyakawa; S. Otsuka; H. Iwata",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","S1","i76","i82","In hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), high doses per fraction are usually used and the dose delivery pattern is different from that of conventional radiation. The daily dose is usually given intermittently over a longer time compared with conventional radiotherapy. During prolonged radiation delivery, sublethal damage repair takes place, leading to the decreased effect of radiation. In in vivo tumors, however, this decrease in effect may be counterbalanced by rapid reoxygenation. Another issue related to hypofractionated SRT is the mathematical model for dose evaluation and conversion. The linear–quadratic (LQ) model and biologically effective dose (BED) have been suggested to be incorrect when used for hypofractionation. The LQ model overestimates the effect of high fractional doses of radiation. BED is particularly incorrect when used for tumor responses in vivo, since it does not take reoxygenation into account. Correction of the errors, estimated at 5–20%, associated with the use of BED is necessary when it is used for SRT. High fractional doses have been reported to exhibit effects against tumor vasculature and enhance host immunity, leading to increased antitumor effects. This may be an interesting topic that should be further investigated. Radioresistance of hypoxic tumor cells is more problematic in hypofractionated SRT, so trials of hypoxia-targeted agents are encouraged in the future. In this review, the radiobiological characteristics of hypofractionated SRT are summarized, and based on the considerations, we would like to recommend 60 Gy in eight fractions delivered three times a week for lung tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148834","stereotactic radiotherapy;SBRT;LQ model;SLDR;reoxygenation, fractionation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Two-phase IMRT delivered 50 Gy in 25 fractions to PTVelective in the First Plan, and 20 Gy in 10 fractions to PTVboost in the Second Plan. Sequential SIB (SEQ-SIB) delivered 55 Gy and 50 Gy in 25 fractions, respectively, to PTVboost and PTVelective using SIB in the First Plan and 11 Gy in 5 fractions to PTVboost in the Second Plan.

Whereas sequential administration can theoretically reduce the risk of SAEs while maintaining the anticancer effects, this hypothesis remains unconfirmed, leading to variations in practice. To elucidate current practices, the patterns of care received by patients in Japan with regard to these two therapies were assessed in a large database of a hospital-based cancer registry linked with insurance claims. This database contained information on 106 057 patients diagnosed with seven major cancers in 2011 and the care they received up to the end of 2012. In total, 335 patients from 101 hospitals in the database were treated with both radiotherapy and bevacizumab. Of these patients, 50.8% had lung cancer, and 51.3% had Stage IV cancer. Of the 335 patients, 75 (22.4%) received these therapies concurrently. In patients treated sequentially, the time from the last dose of bevacizumab to the start of radiotherapy was most frequently 4–5 weeks (12.4%), whereas the time from the end of radiotherapy to the start of bevacizumab was most frequently 1–2 weeks (10.6%). The cumulative proportions of patients in these two groups receiving sequential therapies within 3 weeks were 19.0% and 26.1%, respectively. Many practices appeared to avoid the concurrent use of bevacizumab and radiation, but some provided concurrent therapy. Additional data are required to determine whether the avoidance of concurrent use should become a standard of care.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8149998","adverse effects;bevacizumab;radiation-sensitizing agents;radiotherapy;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This assumption would be acceptable except in specific situations, such as bathing in a radon hot spring where the radon concentration in thermal water is far higher than that in air. The present study focused on such a situation in order to better understand the biokinetics of radon. To mathematically express the entry of radon through the skin into the body, we first modified the latest sophisticated biokinetic model for noble gases. Values of an important parameter for the model—the skin permeability coefficient K (m s−1)—were derived using data from previous human studies. The analysis of such empirical data, which corresponded to radon concentrations in the air exhaled by subjects during and following bathing in radon-rich thermal water, revealed that the estimated K values had a log-normal distribution. The validity of the K values and the characteristics of the present model are then discussed. Furthermore, the impact of the intake of radon or its progeny via inhalation or skin absorption on radiation dose was also assessed for possible exposure scenarios in a radon hot spring. It was concluded that, depending on the radon concentration in thermal water, there might be situations in which the dose contribution resulting from skin absorption of radon is comparable to that resulting from inhalation of radon and its progeny. This conclusion can also apply to other therapeutic situations (e.g. staying in the pool for a longer period).","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148911","Radon;Biokinetic model;Skin absorption;Radon hot spring;Thermal water","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A total of 64 patients who underwent SBRT for liver tumors, including 54 cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 10 non-cirrhotic patients with liver metastases, were analyzed. MRI was performed 3−6 months after SBRT, using gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. All MRI datasets were merged with 3D dosimetry data. All dose distributions were corrected to the biologically effective dose using the linear–quadratic model with an assumed α/β ratio of 2 Gy. The development of liver dysfunction was validly correlated with isodose distribution. The median biologically effective dose (BED 2 ) that provoked liver dysfunction was 57.3 (30.0−227.9) and 114.0 (70.4−244.9) Gy in cirrhotic and normal livers, respectively (P = 0.0002). The BED 2 associated with a >5% risk of liver dysfunction was 38.5 in cirrhotic livers and 70.4 Gy in normal livers. The threshold BED 2 for liver dysfunction was not significantly different between Child−Pugh A and B patients (P = 0.0719). Moreover, the fractionation schedule was not significantly correlated with threshold BED 2 for liver dysfunction in the cirrhotic liver (P = 0.1019). In the cirrhotic liver, fractionation regimen and Child−Pugh classification did not significantly influence the threshold BED 2 for focal liver damage after SBRT. We suggest that the threshold BED 2 for liver dysfunction after SBRT is 40 and 70 Gy in the cirrhotic and normal liver, respectively.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148946","radiotherapy;hepatocellular carcinoma;metastatic liver tumor;radiation-induced liver disease;stereotactic body radiation therapy;radiation-associated liver injury","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To generate a 4D dose distribution, the static dose for each phase was recalculated and the doses were accumulated by using the phantom position known for each phase. For 10 patients with lung tumors, a deformable registration was used to generate 4D dose distributions. Doses to the target volume obtained from the AIP plan and the 4D plan were compared, as were the doses obtained from each plan to the organs at risk (OARs). In both phantom and clinical study, dose discrepancies for all parameters of the dose volume (D min , D 99 , D max , D 1 and D mean ) to the target were <3%. The discrepancies of D max for spinal cord, esophagus and heart were <1 Gy, and the discrepancy of V20 for lung tissue was <1%. However, for OARs with large respiratory motion, the discrepancy of the D max was as much as 9.6 Gy for liver and 5.7 Gy for stomach. Thus, AIP is clinically acceptable as a planning CT image for predicting 4D dose, but doses to the OARs with large respiratory motion were underestimated with the AIP approach.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150091","AIP;VMAT;SBRT;lung;diaphragm","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The first results concern the study population characteristics, including the most important confounding factors for cataract, as well as a detailed description of the work practices in interventional cardiology needed in order to reconstruct the cumulative eye lens dose. The data from 69 ICs and 23 controls collected based on the general medical questionnaire and the occupational questionnaire (for ICs only) were analyzed. The mean age of ICs and of the control group was 41 and 44, respectively, while the mean duration of work for exposed physicians was 9 years. The analysis of the data from the occupational questionnaire concerning the procedures performed, the use of various access routes, as well as radiation protection tools (eye lens glasses, ceiling suspended transparent shield, etc.) are also presented. On the basis of this information and additional assumptions about the doses per procedure (as well as reduction factors for various types of radiation measures), the cumulative doses to the eye lens of ICs were evaluated.

Among patients referred for SBRT from August 2011 to January 2015, those patients were extracted who had liver or pulmonary metastases from CRC, and they were treated with a total dose of 50–60 Gy in five fractions prescribed to the 60% isodose line of the maximum dose covering the surface of the planning target volume. Concurrent administration of chemotherapy was not admitted during SBRT, while neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed. A total of 21 patients (12 liver, 9 lung) with 28 oligometastases were evaluated. The median follow-up duration was 27.5 months (range: 6.5–43.3 months). Four patients were treated with SBRT as a series of initial treatments, and 17 patients were treated after recurrent oligometastases.

"Revisiting the health effects of psychological stress—its influence on susceptibility to ionizing radiation: a mini-review","B. Wang; T. Katsube; N. Begum; M. Nenoi",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","4","325","335","Both psychological stress (PS) and ionizing radiation (IR) cause varied detrimental effects on humans. There has been no direct evidence so far showing PS alone could cause cancer; however, long-lasting PS may affect our overall health and ability to cope with cancer. Due to their living conditions and occupations, some people may encounter concurrent exposure to both PS and IR to a high extent. In addition to possible health effects resulting directly from exposure to IR on these people, fear of IR exposure is also a cause of PS. The question of whether PS would influence susceptibility to IR, radiocarcinogenesis in particular, is of great concern by both the academic world and the public. Recently, investigations using animal PS models demonstrated that PS could modulate susceptibility to IR, causing increased susceptibility to radiocarcinogenesis in Trp53-heterozygous mice, hematological toxicity in peripheral blood and elevated chromosome aberration (dicentrics) frequency in splenocytes of Trp53–wild-type mice. To actively reduce health risk from exposure to IR, further studies are needed to cumulate more evidence and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the alterations in susceptibility due to PS modulation. This mini-review gives a general overview of the significance of PS effects on humans and experimental animals, with a special focus on summarizing the latest weight-of-evidence approaches to radiobiological studies on PS-induced alterations in susceptibility in experimental animal models. The susceptibility being investigated is mainly in the context of the impact of the modulatory effect of PS on radiocarcinogenesis; we seek to improve understanding of the combined effects of exposure to both PS and IR in order to facilitate, via active intervention, strategies for radiation risk reduction","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148915","psychological stress;ionizing radiation;radiosusceptibility;radiocarcinogenesis;mouse psychological stress model","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Peyrat",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2016","207","2","1080","1105","We use seismic tomography to investigate the state of the supraslab mantle beneath northern Chile, a part of the Nazca-South America Plate boundary known for frequent megathrust earthquakes and active volcanism. We performed a joint inversion of arrival times from earthquake generated body waves and phase delay times from ambient noise generated surface waves recorded by a combined 360 seismic stations deployed in northern Chile at various times over several decades. Our preferred model shows an increase in Vp /Vs by as much as 3 per cent from the subducting slab into the supraslab mantle throughout northern Chile. Combined with low values of both Vp and Vs at depths between 40 and 80km, we attribute this increase in Vp /Vs to the serpentinization of the supraslab mantle in this depth range. The region of high Vp /Vs extends to 80–120km depth within the supraslab mantle, but Vp and Vs both increase to normal to high values. This combination, along with the greater abundance of ambient seismicity and higher temperatures at these depths, suggest that conversion from basalt to eclogite in the slab accelerates and that the fluids expelled into the supraslab mantle contribute to partial melt. The corresponding maximum melt fraction is estimated to be about 1 per cent. Both the volume of the region affected by hydration and size of the wave speed contrasts are significantly larger north of ∼21°S. This latitude also delimits large coastal scarps and the eruption of ignimbrites in the north. Ambient seismicity is more abundant north of 21°S, and the seismic zone south of this latitude is offset to the east. The high Vp /Vs region in the north may extend along the slab interface to depths as shallow as 20km, where it corresponds to a region of reduced seismic coupling and overlaps the rupture zone of the recent 2014 M8.2 Pisagua earthquake. A potential cause of these contrasts is enhanced hydration of the subducting oceanic lithosphere related to a string of seamounts located on the Iquique Ridge of the Nazca Plate.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8189345","Interferometry;Seismic tomography;Subduction zone processes;Continental margins: convergent;South America","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The problem of determining the maximum surface measure of a {0}-avoiding set was first stated in a 1974 note by Witsenhausen; there the upper bound of $1/n$ times the surface measure of the sphere is derived from a simple averaging argument. A consequence of the Frankl–Wilson theorem is that this fraction decreases exponentially, but until now the 1/3 upper bound for the case n= 3 has not moved. We improve this bound to 0.313 using an approach inspired by Delsarte's linear programming bounds for codes, combined with some combinatorial reasoning. In the second part of the paper, we use harmonic analysis to show that, for $n\geq3$, there always exists an X-avoiding set of maximum measure.

Skiagite is more stable by 12 kJ mol–1than in a previous calibration of the equilibrium 2 skiagite = 4 fayalite + ferrosilite + O2, and this leads to calculated oxygen fugacities that are higher (more oxidized) by around 1–1·5 ${\rm F}_{\rm O_2}$units. A new calculation method and computer program incorporates four independent oxybarometers (including 2 pyrope + 2 andradite + 2 ferrosilite = 2 grossular + 4 fayalite + 3 enstatite + O2) for use on natural peridotite samples to yield optimum ${\rm F}_{\rm O_2}$estimates by the method of least squares. These estimates should be more robust than those based on any single barometer and allow assessment of possible disequilibrium in assemblages. A new set of independent oxybarometers for spinel-bearing peridotites is also presented here, including a new reaction 2 magnetite + 3 enstatite = 3 fayalite + 3 forsterite + O2. These recalibrations combined with internally consistent PTdeterminations for published analyses of mantle peridotites with analysed Fe2O3data for garnets, from both cratonic (Kaapvaal, Siberia and Slave) and circumcratonic (Baikal Rift) regions, provide revised estimates of oxidation state in the lithospheric mantle. Estimates of ${\rm F}_{\rm O_2}$for spinel assemblages are more reduced than those based on earlier calibrations, whereas garnet-bearing assemblages are more oxidized. Importantly, this lessens considerably the difference between garnet and spinel oxybarometry that was observed with previous published calibrations.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egw037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8210747","peridotite;oxybarometry;igneous petrology;mantle","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

RTA 408 lotion is currently being tested in patients at risk for radiation dermatitis. This prompted us to study the profiles of RS9 in the skin. All the above triterpenoids increased the level of an Nrf2-targeted gene, NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase-1, in normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Among them, the activity of RS9 was prominent; furthermore, the cellular toxicity was less compared with RTA compounds. BALB/c mice were irradiated with 30 Gy/day on Day 0, and compounds were topically applied on the back once daily from Day 1 to Day 30. Dermatitis scores peaked on Day 18, with a score of 2.6 in vehicle-treated mice, and topical applications of 0.1% RTA 402, RTA 408 and RS9 reduced the scores to 1.8, 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. Moreover, the percentage of animals with scores ≥2 was analyzed, and 0.1% RS9 suppressed the percentage from 100% to 47%.

Acute pneumonitis was observed during the first 3 months after radiation, and chronic lung fibrosis was found during the next 4–12 months in all the dogs exposed to radiation. CT-guided core needle lung lesion biopsies were extracted from each dog five times over the course of 1 year. The dogs remained healthy after each biopsy, and 50–100 mg fresh lung lesion tissues were collected in each operation. The incidence of pneumothorax and hemoptysis was 20% and 2.8%, respectively, in the 35 tissue biopsies. A successful and stable radiation-induced lung injury dog model was established. Lung lesion tissue samples from dogs in acute stage, recovery stage and fibrosis stage were found to be sufficient to support cytology, genomics and proteomics research. This model safely supplied fresh tissue samples that would allow future researchers to more easily explore and develop treatments for radiation-induced lung injury.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157375","radiation-induced lung injury;biopsy;animal model;normal tissue","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The map showed a protruding density from near the extracellular pore entrance, which most likely represents the bound AZA. Molecular docking simulations supported the location of the protrusion as the likely AZA-binding site. These findings suggest that AZA reduces water conduction by obstructing the pathway at the extracellular entrance without inducing a large conformational change in the protein.","1477-9986","","10.1093/jmicro/dfv368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8164683","water channel;inhibitor bound structure;2D crystal;electron microscopy;electron crystallography","","","","6","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Muography is expected to resolve highly heterogeneous density profiles near the surface of volcanoes. However, several prior works have failed to make clear observations due to contamination by background noise. The background contamination leads to an overestimation of the muon flux and consequently a significant underestimation of the density in the target mountains. To investigate the origin of the background noise, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation. The main components of the background noise in muography are found to be low-energy protons, electrons and muons in case of detectors without particle identification and with energy thresholds below 1 GeV. This result was confirmed by comparisons with actual observations of nuclear emulsions. This result will be useful for detector design in future works, and in addition some previous works of muography should be reviewed from the view point of background contamination.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8189068","Numerical solutions;Tomography;Volcano monitoring;Asia","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is responsible for cancer sensitivity to radiation. In this study, we aimed to identify the miRNAs that are associated with radioresistance in ESCC. We used a miRNA microarray to perform a comparison of miRNA expression in both ESCC parental and acquired radioresistance cell lines. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the alterations. Cell radiosensitivity was determined with a survival fraction assay. Functional analyses of the identified miRNA in ESCC cells with regard to metastasis and apoptosis were performed by transwell assays and flow cytometry. The miRNA targets were identified with pathway analysis and confirmed with a luciferase assay. miR-98 was recognized as the most downregulated miRNA in established radioresistant cell line. AmiR-98 mimic enforced the expression of miRNA-98 and made ESCC cells sensitive to radiotherapy, while anti-miR-98 reversed this process. Optimal results were achieved by decreasing cellular proliferation, decreasing cell migration and inducing apoptosis. The luciferase target gene analysis results showed that the overexpression of miRNA-98 inhibited tumor growth and resistance tolerance by directly binding to the BCL-2 gene. Our study indicated that increasing miRNA-98 expression can be used as a potential radiosensitive therapeutic strategy for treating esophageal cancer cells.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157381","esophageal squamous cell carcinoma;microRNA;radiation;cell line;resistance","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The continuum approach produces yield-stress materials based on Lattice–Boltzmann simulations. We show that if the material is stimulated below yield stress, plastic events occur, which have strong similarities to seismic events. Based on a suitable definition of displacement in the continuum, we show that the plastic events obey a Gutenberg–Richter law with exponents similar to those for real earthquakes. We also find that the average acceleration, energy release, stress drop and interoccurrence times scale with the same exponent. Furthermore, choosing a suitable definition for aftershocks, we show that they follow Omori's law. Finally, the far field power spectra of elastic waves generated by these plastic events decay as ω−2 similar to those observed for seismic waves. Our approach is fully self-consistent and all quantities can be calculated at all scales without the need of ad hoc friction or statistical assumptions. We therefore suggest that our approach may lead to new insights into the physics connecting the micro- and macroscales of earthquakes.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146639","Probability distributions;Earthquake dynamics;Statistical seismology","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have employed partial-brain radiotherapy (PBRT) with wide margins for PCNSL patients with a single lesion or a few lesions. In this study, we evaluated the treatment outcome in PCNSL patients undergoing PBRT. Between 2003 and 2014, 24 patients were treated with PBRT; 16 received high-dose-methotrexate (MTX) –containing chemotherapy before PBRT. Conventional fractionation with a median dose of 54 Gy was used. For reference, 15 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT were also analyzed. The 3-year overall survival rate was 60% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 68% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy plus PBRT. The 3-year progression-free survival rate was 41% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 36% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. The in-field recurrence rate was 26% and the out-of-field recurrence rate was 15% at 3 years for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT. The rates for in-field recurrence and the out-of-field recurrence were 27% and 21%, respectively, for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. CNS-recurrence rates were similar in patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and PBRT to the rates in those undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT. Neurocognitive dysfunction developed in 3 of the 16 patients undergoing MTX + PBRT and in 4 of 15 patients undergoing MTX + WBRT (P= 0.68). PBRT seems to be a feasible treatment option for solitary PCNSL. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the advantages of PBRT over WBRT.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150000","primary central nervous system lymphoma;PCNSL;radiation therapy;partial-brain radiotherapy;neurocognitive function","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Absorbed doses are difficult to measure, and are commonly surrogated with doses measured using separate detectors. The present work describes the determination of doses absorbed in the cell layer underneath a medium column (D A ) and the doses absorbed in an ionization chamber (D E ) from neutrons through computer simulations using the MCNP-5 code, and the subsequent determination of the conversion coefficients R (= D A /D E ). It was found that R in general decreased with increase in the medium thickness, which was due to elastic and inelastic scattering. For 2-MeV neutrons, conspicuous bulges in R values were observed at medium thicknesses of about 500, 1500, 2500 and 4000 μm, and these were attributed to carbon, oxygen and nitrogen nuclei, and were reflections of spikes in neutron interaction cross sections with these nuclei. For 0.1-MeV neutrons, no conspicuous bulges in R were observed (except one at ~2000 μm that was due to photon interactions), which was explained by the absence of prominent spikes in the interaction cross-sections with these nuclei for neutron energies <0.1 MeV. The ratio R could be increased by ~50% for small medium thickness if the incident neutron energy was reduced from 2 MeV to 0.1 MeV. As such, the absorbed doses in cells (D A ) would vary with the incident neutron energies, even when the absorbed doses shown on the detector were the same.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157379","neutrons;Monte Carlo;MCNP;radiation dosimetry","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Victims’ rights advocates correctly argue that a lower burden of proof makes it easier to ensure that the guilty are punished. But there is also a mathematically inevitable corollary: a lower burden of proof increases the probability of concluding that the innocent are guilty. This article provides a framework for using information regarding false conviction probabilities in criminal trials to model the probability of false guilty verdicts in Title IX proceedings in American colleges and universities.

Human normal lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells were irradiated with high-LET carbon ions, and low-dose biological effects (in terms of various bio-endpoints, including colony formation, DNA damage and micronuclei formation) were detected under conditions with and without gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) inhibition. LDHRS was observed when the radiation dose was <0.2 Gy for all bio-endpoints under investigation, but vanished when the GJIC was suppressed. Based on the probability of cells being hit and micro-dose per cell calculation, we deduced that the LDHRS phenomenon came from the combined action of direct hits and NTEs.

"A Reactive Porous Flow Control on Mid-ocean Ridge Magmatic Evolution","C. J. Lissenberg; C. J. MacLeod",NA; NA,Journal of Petrology,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","11-12","2195","2220","Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) provide fundamental information about the composition and melting processes in the Earth’s upper mantle. To use MORB to further our understanding of the mantle, is imperative that their crustal evolution is well understood and can thus be accounted for when estimating primary melt compositions. Here, we present the evidence for the occurrence of reactive porous flow, whereby migrating melts react with a crystal mush in mid-ocean ridge magma chambers. This evidence comprises both the textures and mineral major and trace element geochemistry of rocks recovered from the lower oceanic crust, and occurs on a range of scales. Reaction textures include dissolution fronts in minerals, ragged grain boundaries between different phases and clinopyroxene–brown amphibole symplectites. However, an important finding is that reaction, even when pervasive, can equally leave no textural evidence. Geochemically, reactive porous flow leads to shifts in mineral modes (e.g. the net replacement of olivine by clinopyroxene) and compositions (e.g. clinopyroxene Mg–Ti–Cr relationships) away from those predicted by fractional crystallization. Furthermore, clinopyroxene trace elements record a progressive core–rim over-enrichment (relative to fractional crystallization) of more-to-less incompatible elements as a result of reactive porous flow. The fact that this over-enrichment occurs over a distance of up to 8 mm, and that clinopyroxenes showing this signature preserve zoning in Fe–Mg, rules out a diffusion control on trace element distributions. Instead, it can be explained by crystal–melt reactions in a crystal mush. The data indicate that reactive flow occurs not only on a grain scale, but also on a sample scale, where it can transform one rock type into another [e.g. troctolite to olivine gabbro, olivine gabbro to (oxide) gabbro], and extends to the scale of the entire lower oceanic crust. Melts undergoing these reactive processes change in composition, which can explain both the major element and trace element arrays of MORB compositions. In particular, reactive porous flow can account for the MORB MgO–CaO–Al2O3 relationships that have previously been interpreted as a result of high-pressure (up to ∼8 kbar) crystal fractionation, and for over-enrichment in incompatible elements when compared with the effects of fractional crystallization. The finding of a significant role for reactive porous flow in mid-ocean ridge magma chambers fits very well with the geophysical evidence that these magma chambers are dominated by crystal mush even at the fastest spreading rates, and with model predictions of the behaviour of crystal mushes. Together, these observations indicate that reactive porous flow is a common, if not ubiquitous, process inherent to mushy magma chambers, and that it has a significant control on mid-ocean ridge magmatic evolution.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egw074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8181929","gabbro;lower oceanic crust;mid-ocean ridge;mid-ocean ridge basalt;reactive porous flow","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Fifteen consecutive patients with centrally located lung tumors treated at our institution were enrolled. For each patient, three VMAT plans were generated using two coplanar partial arcs (CP VMAT), two non-coplanar partial arcs (NCP VMAT), and one coplanar full arc (Full VMAT). All plans were designed to deliver 70 Gy in 10 fractions. Target coverage and sparing of organs at risk (OARs) were compared across techniques. PTV coverage was almost identical for all approaches. The whole lung V 10Gy was significantly lower with CP VMAT plans than with NCP VMAT plans, whereas no significant differences in the mean lung dose, V 5Gy , V 20Gy or V 40Gy were observed. Full VMAT increased mean contralateral lung V 5Gy by 12.57% and 9.15% when compared with NCP VMAT and CP VMAT, respectively. Although NCP VMAT plans best achieved the dose–volume constraints for mediastinal OARs, the absolute differences in dose were small when compared with CP VMAT. These results suggest that partial-arc VMAT may be preferable to minimize unnecessary exposure to the contralateral lung, and use of NCP VMAT should be considered when the dose–volume constraints are not achieved by CP VMAT.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148941","lung tumor;stereotactic body radiation therapy;volumetric-modulated arc therapy;planning study","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It has been suggested that local ablative therapies (including surgery, radiofrequency ablation and radiation therapy) play an important role in this setting, in combination or not with systemic therapies, particularly in delaying disease progression and hopefully in increasing the median survival time. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) rapidly emerged in recent years as one of the most effective and less toxic local treatment modalities for lung, liver, adrenal, brain and bone metastases. The aim of this review was to focus on its clinical role for oligometastatic disease in four major cancer subtypes: lung, breast, colorectal and prostate. On the basis of the available evidence, SBRT is able to provide high rates of local tumor control without significant toxicity. Its global impact on survival is uncertain; however, in specific subpopulations of oligometastatic patients there is a trend towards a significant improvement in progression-free and overall survival rates; these important data might be used as a platform for clinical decision-making and establish the basis for the current and future prospective trials investigating its role with or without systemic treatments.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148829","stereotactic body radiotherapy;stereotactic ablative radiotherapy;oligometastases;radiotherapy;radiosurgery","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"In vivo sensitivity of the embryonic and adult neural stem cell compartments to low-dose radiation","L. Barazzuol; P. A. Jeggo",NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","S1","i2","i10","The embryonic brain is radiation-sensitive, with cognitive deficits being observed after exposure to low radiation doses. Exposure of neonates to radiation can cause intracranial carcinogenesis. To gain insight into the basis underlying these outcomes, we examined the response of the embryonic, neonatal and adult brain to low-dose radiation, focusing on the neural stem cell compartments. This review summarizes our recent findings. At E13.5–14.5 the embryonic neocortex encompasses rapidly proliferating stem and progenitor cells. Exploiting mice with a hypomorphic mutation in DNA ligase IV (Lig4Y288C), we found a high level of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at E14.5, which we attribute to the rapid proliferation. We observed endogenous apoptosis in Lig4Y288C embryos and in WT embryos following exposure to low radiation doses. An examination of DSB levels and apoptosis in adult neural stem cell compartments, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) revealed low DSB levels in Lig4Y288C mice, comparable with the levels in differentiated neuronal tissues. We conclude that the adult SVZ does not incur high levels of DNA breakage, but sensitively activates apoptosis; apoptosis was less sensitively activated in the SGZ, and differentiated neuronal tissues did not activate apoptosis. P5/P15 mice showed intermediate DSB levels, suggesting that DSBs generated in the embryo can be transmitted to neonates and undergo slow repair. Interestingly, this analysis revealed a stage of high endogenous apoptosis in the neonatal SVZ. Collectively, these studies reveal that the adult neural stem cell compartment, like the embryonic counterpart, can sensitively activate apoptosis.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148833","neural stem cells;DNA damage response;low-dose radiation;DNA double-strand break repair;radiation sensitivity","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Such definitions give rise to questions of lazy corecursive derivations and parallelism, as execution of such logic programs can have both recursive and corecursive features at once. Observational and coalgebraic semantics have been used to study them abstractly. The programming developments have often occurred separately and have usually been implementation-led. Here, we give a coherent semantics-led account of the issues, starting with abstract category theoretic semantics, developing coalgebra to characterize naturally arising trees and proceeding towards implementation of a new dialect, CoALP, of logic programming, characterised by guarded lazy corecursion and parallelism.","1465-363X","","10.1093/logcom/exu026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8134650","Logic programming;coalgebra;observational semantics;corecursion;coinduction;parallelism","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Mathematics teachers’ and students’ perceptions of transmissionist teaching and its association with students’ dispositions","M. Pampaka; J. Williams",NA; NA,Teaching Mathematics and Its Applications: International Journal of the IMA,"19 Jan 2018","2016","35","3","118","130","This article builds on previous results of the Transmaths studies concerning transmissionist teaching practices—and especially adds the significance of students’ perceptions of these practices—in their association with students’ declining dispositions for studying mathematics. It addresses a gap in this work, and the literature in general, regarding the relationship between teachers’ and students’ perceptions of pedagogy. Drawing on data analyses from a recent, large survey of teaching and learning mathematics in secondary schools, the article: (a) demonstrates and validates two new measures of perceptions of transmissionist practices, as experienced from students’ and teachers’ perspectives, (b) investigates the comparability of these two measures, and (c) identifies their associations with students’ dispositions to study mathematics. Analysis draws on measures of students in Years 7 to 11 (involving 13,000+ students) and from 132 of their mathematics teachers, and shows low correlation at class level and negligible correlation at student level. Results of regression analysis confirm previous work with older students, i.e. that teachers’ self-reported transmissionism is negatively associated with learners’ dispositions, but adds that students’ perceptions of transmissionism are much more strongly negatively associated with these dispositions, and largely mediate the effect of teachers’ (self-reported) transmissionism. Further, the differences between year groups and gender show how girls and older learners suffer significantly larger negative effects. The article concludes with a brief discussion of these complexities and some implications for students’ trajectories and transitions into (and out of) mathematics.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hrw007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8237122","","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Choi",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","3","238","249","Published gene expression studies for radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis have used various methodologies. In this study, we identified differential gene expression in a human thyroid epithelial cell line after exposure to high-dose γ-radiation. HTori-3 cells were exposed to 5 or 10 Gy of ionizing radiation using two dose rates (high-dose rate: 4.68 Gy/min, and low-dose rate: 40 mGy/h) and then implanted into the backs of BALB/c nude mice after 4 (10 Gy) or 5 weeks (5 Gy). Decreases in cell viability, increases in giant cell frequency, anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo were observed. Particularly, the cells irradiated with 5 Gy at the high-dose rate or 10 Gy at the low-dose rate demonstrated more prominent tumorigenicity. Gene expression profiling was analyzed via microarray. Numerous genes that were significantly altered by a fold-change of >50% following irradiation were identified in each group. Gene expression analysis identified six commonly misregulated genes, including CRYAB, IL-18, ZNF845, CYP24A1, OR4N4 and VN1R4, at all doses. These genes involve apoptosis, the immune response, regulation of transcription, and receptor signaling pathways. Overall, the altered genes in high-dose rate (HDR) 5 Gy and low-dose rate (LDR) 10 Gy were more than those of LDR 5 Gy and HDR 10 Gy. Thus, we investigated genes associated with aggressive tumor development using the two dosage treatments. In this study, the identified gene expression profiles reflect the molecular response following high doses of external radiation exposure and may provide helpful information about radiation-induced thyroid tumors in the high-dose range.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148943","thyroid gland;carcinogenesis;cell line;radiation;gene expression","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Randomized trials evaluating standard doses of chemoradiation have not shown a significant benefit from the use of consolidative radiation. Results from non-randomized studies of 3–5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) have been similar to standard chemoradiation, but with less toxicity and a shorter treatment time. Doses of SBRT have been reduced to subablative levels for the sake of tolerability. The benefit of both options is unclear. In contrast, ablative doses can be delivered using an SBRT technique in 15–28 fractions. The keys to the delivery of ablative doses are computed tomography (CT) image guidance and respiratory gating. Higher doses have resulted in encouraging long-term survival results. In this review, we present a comprehensive solution to achieving ablative doses for selected patients with pancreatic tumors by using a combination of classical, modern and novel concepts of radiotherapy: fractionation, CT image guidance, respiratory gating, intentional dose heterogeneity, and simultaneous integrated protection.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148835","IGRT;ablative;SBRT;pancreatic cancer;locally advanced;respiratory gating","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

While it is a classical special function, introduced by 19th century investigators, its theoretical significance for applications has only been realized in the last decade or so, especially with respect to solving problems defined in multiply connected, or ‘holey’, domains. It is shown here that, in terms of it, many well-known results pertaining only to the simply connected case (no holes) can be generalized, in a natural way, to the multiply connected case, thereby contextualizing those well-known results within a more general framework of much broader applicability. Given the wide-ranging usefulness of the S–K prime function it is important to be able to compute it efficiently. Here we introduce both a new theoretical formulation for its computation, as well as two distinct numerical methods to implement the construction. The combination of these theoretical and computational developments renders the S–K prime function a powerful new tool in applied mathematics.","1464-3634","","10.1093/imamat/hxw028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8132647","Schottky–Klein prime function;multiply connected;potential theory;boundary integral methods.","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We reviewed 21 consecutive patients with early stage duodenal FL treated with radiation therapy between January 2005 and December 2013 at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo. The characteristics of patients were: median age 62 years (range, 46–79 years), gender (male, 6; female, 15), clinical stage (I, 20; II 1, 1), histological grade (I, 17; II, 4). All patients were treated with radiation therapy alone. The median radiation dose was 30.6 Gy (range, 30.6–39.6) in 17 fractions. The involved-site radiation therapy was delivered to the whole duodenum. The median follow-up time was 43.2 months (range 21.4–109.3). The 3-year overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and local control (LC) rates were 94.7%, 79.3% and 100%, respectively. There were four relapses documented outside the treated volumes: two in the gastrointestinal tract (jejunum, terminal ileum), one in an abdominal lymph node (mesenteric lymph node) and one in the bone marrow. None died of the disease; one death was due to acute myeloid leukemia. No toxicities greater than Grade 1 were observed during treatment and over the follow-up time. The 30.6 Gy of involved-site radiation therapy provided excellent local control with very low toxicities. Radiation therapy could be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with localized low grade FL arising from the duodenum.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148906","duodenal follicular lymphoma;radiotherapy;indolent lymphoma","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is a potent antioxidant that functions by scavenging free radicals. Here, we used a 30-day survival assay to investigate the radioprotective effects of RA. Mice were treated with RA once per day for 10 consecutive days starting at 3 days before gamma irradiation at 7.5 Gy until 7 days post irradiation. Mice treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight (bw) of RA had 30-day survival rates of 89% and 72%, respectively, compared with 32% in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P = 0.0008 and 0.0421, respectively). Spleen colony–forming units (CFU-S), the number of nucleated cells in the bone marrow (BMNC), bone marrow DNA content, and hematological parameters of the peripheral blood were measured to investigate the radioprotective effect of RA on the hematopoietic system. The treatment groups that received RA at 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg bw and whole-body exposure to 5.5 Gy of 137Cs γ- radiation had significantly higher CFU-S, BMNC and DNA content than the irradiation-only group. Assessment of hematological parameters in the peripheral blood showed that the treatment groups receiving RA at doses of 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg bw had higher white blood cell counts, hemoglobin and platelets than the radiation-only group. These results suggested that the administration of RA promoted the recovery of peripheral blood cells in irradiated mice.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148910","rosmarinic acid;radioprotection;hematopoietic system","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The median follow-up time for all patients was 15 months, and the 2-year overall survival rate was 35%. Significant prognostic factors for overall survival were primary site (nasopharynx versus other sites), presence of ulceration, and PTV volume. Detailed analysis of ulceration showed a lower response rate (28%) in the ulceration (+) group than the ulceration (−) group (63%; P = 0.0045). The 2-year overall survival rates were 8% in the ulceration (+) group and 42.7% (P = 0.0001) in the ulceration (−) group, respectively. We recorded 22 severe toxicities, including 11 patients with carotid blow-out syndrome (CBOS), which was fatal in 9 patients. CBOS occurred in 6 patients with ulceration (6/25; 24%), and 5 patients experienced CBOS without ulceration (5/82; 6%; P=0.027).

"Derivation of the magnetic field on a metal cylinder excited by a longitudinal magnetic dipole transmitter: II. Cylinder in a two-layer dissipative dielectric medium","R. Freedman","Schlumberger, Sugar Land, Texas, USA",Radio Science,"12 Apr 2017","2016","51","11","1758","1771","We derive an exact convergent analytical solution for the complex frequency-dependent magnetic field on the surface of an infinitely long and perfectly conducting metal cylinder situated in a cylindrically layered dissipative medium. The inhomogeneous medium consists of two exterior cylindrical layers that are concentric with the cylinder. The magnetic field on the cylinder is excited by a longitudinally oriented oscillating magnetic dipole transmitter on the cylinder surface. An exact analytical solution to this problem has not been previously published and is of theoretical as well as practical importance, e.g., in modeling the responses of electromagnetic wave propagation well logging tools. It is shown that the magnetic field on the cylinder surface can be expressed as a real-axis integral; however, the integrand oscillates rapidly and diverges for large values of the integration variable. The real-axis integral is replaced by the sum of two convergent branch line integrals and a sum over the residues of the complex poles in the integrand of the real-axis integral. The poles correspond physically to waveguide modes that propagate with discrete wave numbers. A pole search algorithm is developed to locate the positions of the poles and compute their residues. Phase shifts and attenuations of the magnetic field between receivers for a 1.1 GHz well logging tool are computed to elucidate the pole spectra and the relative contributions of the waveguide modes and the branch cut integrals for different thicknesses of the innermost dielectric layer and for different layer properties.","1944-799X","","10.1002/2016RS006046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7894417","","Boundary conditions;Metals;Magnetic separation;Mathematical model;Magnetic multilayers;Magnetic analysis;Dielectrics","","","","","","12 Apr 2017","","","AGU","AGU Journals"

The value of the CBE factor previously reported was revalued for the central nervous system, skin and lung. To describe the structure, the following terms are introduced: the vascular CBE (v-CBE), intraluminal CBE (il-CBE), extraluminal CBE (el-CBE) and non-vascular CBE (nv-CBE) factors and the geometric biological factor (GBF), i.e. the contributions that are derived from the total dose to the vasculature, each dose to vasculature from the intraluminal side and the extraluminal side, the dose to the non-vascular tissue and the factor to calculate el-CBE from il-CBE, respectively. The el-CBE factor element was also introduced to relate il-CBE to el-CBE factors. A CBE factor of 0.36 for disodium mercaptoundecahydrododecaborate (BSH) for the CNS was independent of the 10B level in the blood; however, that for p-Boron-L-phenylalanine (BPA) increased with the 10B level ratio of the normal tissue to the blood (N/B). The CBE factor was expressed as follows: factor = 0.32 + N/B × 1.65. The factor of 0.32 at 0 of N/B was close to the CBE factor for BSH. GBFs had similar values, between BSH and BPA, 1.39 and 1.52, respectively. The structure of the CBE factor for BPA to the lung was also elucidated based on this idea. The factor is described as follows: CBE factor = 0.32 + N/B × 1.80. By this elucidation of the structure of the CBE factor, it is expected that basic and clinical research into boron neutron capture therapy will progress.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148837","CBE factor;BPA;BSH;radiation myelopathy;dermal necrosis;radiation pneumonitis","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Sasanuma",NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","S1","i25","i32","Homologous recombination (HR) initiates double-strand break (DSB) repair by digesting 5′-termini at DSBs, the biochemical reaction called DSB resection, during which DSBs are processed by nucleases to generate 3′ single-strand DNA. Rad51 recombinase polymerizes along resected DNA, and the resulting Rad51–DNA complex undergoes homology search. Although DSB resection by the Mre11 nuclease plays a critical role in HR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it remains elusive whether DSB resection by Mre11 significantly contributes to HR-dependent DSB repair in mammalian cells. Depletion of Mre11 decreases the efficiency of DSB resection only by 2- to 3-fold in mammalian cells. We show that although Mre11 is required for efficient HR-dependent repair of ionizing-radiation–induced DSBs, Mre11 is largely dispensable for DSB resection in both chicken DT40 and human TK6 B cell lines. Moreover, a 2- to 3-fold decrease in DSB resection has virtually no impact on the efficiency of HR. Thus, although a large number of researchers have reported the vital role of Mre11-mediated DSB resection in HR, the role may not explain the very severe defect in HR in Mre11-deficient cells, including their lethality. We here show experimental evidence for the additional roles of Mre11 in (i) elimination of chemical adducts from DSB ends for subsequent DSB repair, and (ii) maintaining HR intermediates for their proper resolution.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148841","double-strand break repair;double-strand break resection;etoposide;homologous recombination;ionizing radiation;Mre11;non-homologous end joining;topoisomerase","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our results also suggested that the hormetic zone (or the stimulation zone) was shifted towards lower doses with application of filters. The non-detection of a triphasic dose response in previous experiments could likely be attributed to the use of hard X-rays, which shifted the hormetic zone into an unmonitored ultra-low-dose region.

Therefore, we herein examined the inhibitory effects of radon inhalation and hot spring water drinking on potassium oxonate (PO)–induced hyperuricemia in mice. Mice inhaled radon at a concentration of 2000 Bq/m3 for 24 h or were given hot spring water for 2 weeks. Mice were then administrated PO at a dose of 500 mg/kg. The results obtained showed that serum uric acid levels were significantly increased by the administration of PO. Radon inhalation or hot spring water drinking significantly inhibited elevations in serum uric acid levels through the suppression of xanthine oxidase activity in the liver. Radon inhalation activated anti-oxidative functions in the liver and kidney. These results suggest that radon inhalation inhibits PO-induced hyperuricemia by activating anti-oxidative functions, while hot spring water drinking may suppress PO-induced elevations in serum uric acid levels through the pharmacological effects of the chemical compositions dissolved in it.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148947","hyperuricemia;radon inhalation;hot spring water drinking;anti-oxidative functions","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"NBS1 and multiple regulations of DNA damage response","K.

Genetic diseases characterized by genome instability have provided novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of DNA damage response. NBS1, a protein responsible for the radiation-sensitive autosomal recessive disorder Nijmegen breakage syndrome, is one of the first factors to accumulate at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). NBS1 binds to at least five key proteins, including ATM, RPA, MRE11, RAD18 and RNF20, in the conserved regions within a limited span of the C terminus, functioning in the regulation of chromatin remodeling, cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair in response to DSBs. In this article, we reviewed the functions of these binding proteins and their comprehensive association with NBS1.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148839","Nijmegen breakage syndrome;NBS1;RNF20;MRE11;ATM;RPA;RAD18","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

IMRT uses advanced technology to focus the high radiation doses on the targets and avoid irradiation of non-involved tissues. The decisions about sparing organs and tissues whose damage causes xerostomia and dysphagia depends on the evidence for dose–response relationships for the organs causing these sequellae. This paper discusses the evidence for the contribution of radiotherapy to xerostomia via damage of the major salivary glands (parotid and submandibular) and minor salivary glands within the oral cavity, and the contribution of radiotherapy-related effect on important swallowing structures causing dysphagia. Recommendations for dose limits to these organs, based on measurements of xerostomia and dysphagia following radiotherapy, are provided here.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148843","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process that determines therapy response and tumor progression. However, whether EMT is induced by ionizing radiation and involved in tumor radioresistance has been less studied in ESCC. Using multiple fractionated irradiation, the radioresistant esophageal squamous cancer cell line KYSE-150R had been established from its parental cell line KYSE-150. We found KYSE-150R displayed a significant EMT phenotype with an elongated spindle shape and down-regulated epithelial marker E-cadherin and up-regulated mesenchymal marker N-cadherin in comparison with KYSE-150. Furthermore, KYSE-150R also possessed some stemness-like properties characterized by density-dependent growth promotion and strong capability for sphere formation and tumorigenesis in NOD-SCID mice. Mechanical studies have revealed that WISP1, a secreted matricellular protein, is highly expressed in KYSE-150R and mediates EMT-associated radioresistance both in ESCC cells and in xenograft tumor models. Moreover, WISP1 has been demonstrated to be closely associated with the EMT phenotype observed in ESCC patients and to be an independent prognosis factor of ESCC patients treated with radiotherapy. Our study highlighted WISP1 as an attractive target to reverse EMT-associated radioresistance in ESCC and can be used as an independent prognostic factor of patients treated with radiotherapy.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148914","ESCC;EMT;radioresistance;WISP1;prognosis significance","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We found that NC-FG exhibits radiological properties distinct from those of conventional Fricke gel. The radiation sensitivity of NC-FG is independent of the LET and is nearly constant even at very high LET (3000 eV/nm) values in the Bragg peak region of the argon ion beam. In addition, whereas conventional Fricke gel dosimeters only operate under acidic conditions, NC-FG dosimeters function under both acidic and neutral conditions. The radiation sensitivity decreases with decreasing nano-clay concentration in NC-FG, which indicates that the nano-clay plays a vital role in the radiation-induced oxidation of Fe2+.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148949","Ion beam;LET;Nanocomposite gel;Gel dosimeter","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

From May 2003 to June 2014, records for 66 patients with 76 oligo-recurrences in the lungs treated with SBRT were retrospectively reviewed. Oligo-recurrence primary sites and patient numbers were as follows: lungs, 31; colorectal, 13; head and neck, 10; esophagus, 3; uterus, 3; and others, 6. The median SBRT dose was 50 Gy (range, 45–60 Gy) administered in a median of 5 (range, 5–9) fractions. All patients received SBRT, with no acute toxicity. Surviving patients had a median follow-up time of 36.5 months. The 3-year rates of local control, overall survival and disease-free survival were 90.6%, 76.0% and 53.7%, respectively. Longer disease-free interval from initial treatment to SBRT, and non-colorectal cancer were both associated with favorable outcomes. Disease progression after SBRT occurred in 31 patients, most with distant metastases (n= 24) [among whom, 87.5% (n= 21) had new lung metastases]. Among these 21 patients, 12 were judged as having a second oligo-recurrence. Additional SBRT was performed for these 12 patients, and all 12 tumors were controlled without disease progression. Three patients (4.5%) developed Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis. No other late adverse events of Grade ≥2 were identified. Thus, SBRT for oligo-recurrence achieved acceptable tumor control, with additional SBRT also effective for selected patients with a second oligo-recurrence after primary SBRT.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150094","stereotactic body radiotherapy;oligo-recurrence;oligometastasis;lung tumor","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC (n = 10 patients for each approach) were enrolled. Both radiotherapy plans were calculated with the same targets and organs at risk on the same CT. The treatment plan for the prophylactic lymph node and primary tumor (PTV1) delivered 40 Gy for X-ray radiotherapy and 40 Gy (relative biological effectiveness; RBE) for carbon ion radiotherapy. The total doses for the primary tumor and clinically positive lymph nodes (PTV2) were 60 Gy for X-ray radiotherapy and 60 Gy (RBE) for carbon ion radiotherapy. The homogeneity indexes for PTV1 and PTV2 were superior for carbon ion radiotherapy in comparison with X-ray radiotherapy (PTV1, 0.57 vs 0.65, P = 0.009; PTV2, 0.07 vs 0.16, P = 0.005). The normal lung mean dose, V5, V10 and V20 for carbon ion radiotherapy were 7.7 Gy (RBE), 21.4%, 19.7% and 17.0%, respectively, whereas the corresponding doses for X-ray radiotherapy were 11.9 Gy, 34.9%, 26.6% and 20.8%, respectively. Maximum spinal cord dose, esophageal maximum dose and V50, and bone V10, V30 and V50 were lower with carbon ion radiotherapy than with X-ray radiotherapy.

Therefore, kinetic energy released per unit mass (kerma) can be estimated by measuring the level of free radicals within fingernails, using EPR. However, to date this dosimetry has been deficient and insufficiently accurate. In the sampling processes and measurements, water plays a significant role. This paper discusses many effects of water on fingernail EPR dosimetry, including disturbance to EPR measurements and two different effects on the production of free radicals. Water that is unable to contact free radicals can promote the production of free radicals due to indirect ionizing effects. Therefore, varying water content within fingernails can lead to varying growth rates in the free radical concentration after irradiation—these two variables have a linear relationship, with a slope of 1.8143. Thus, EPR dosimetry needs to be adjusted according to the water content of the fingernails of an individual. When the free radicals are exposed to water, the eliminating effect will appear. Therefore, soaking fingernail pieces in water before irradiation, as many researchers have previously done, can cause estimation errors. In addition, nails need to be dehydrated before making accurately quantitative EPR measurements.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157372","dosimetry;electron paramagnetic resonance;fingernail;ESR","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Coverage of the focal sphere is comprehensive and the source mechanism stable across the full range of uncertainties.

We evaluated the dosimetric feasibility of SBRT with lobe-specific selective elective nodal irradiation (ENI) on dose–volume histograms. A total of 21 patients were treated with SBRT for Stage I primary lung cancer between January 2010 and June 2012 at our institution. The extents of lobe-specific selective ENI fields were determined with reference to prior surgical reports. The ENI fields included lymph node stations (LNS) 3 + 4 + 11 for the right upper lobe tumors, LNS 7 + 11 for the right middle or lower lobe tumors, LNS 5 + 11 for the left upper lobe tumors, and LNS 7 + 11 for the left lower lobe tumors. A composite plan was generated by combining the ENI plan and the SBRT plan and recalculating for biologically equivalent doses of 2 Gy per fraction, using a linear quadratic model. The V 20 of the lung, D 1cm3 of the spinal cord, D 1cm3 and D 10cm3 of the esophagus and D 10cm3 of the tracheobronchial wall were evaluated. Of the 21 patients, nine patients (43%) could not fulfill the dose constraints. In all these patients, the distance between the planning target volume (PTV) of ENI (PTVeni) and the PTV of SBRT (PTVsrt) was ≤2.0 cm. Of the three patients who developed regional metastasis, two patients had isolated lymph node failure, and the lymph node metastasis was included within the ENI field. When the distance between the PTVeni and PTVsrt is >2.0 cm, SBRT with selective ENI may therefore dosimetrically feasible.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150098","stereotactic body radiotherapy;elective nodal irradiation;primary lung cancer;dose–volume histogram","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The dose distributions of 3D-CRT-, IMRT-, and SSPT-based WPRT plans were compared in 10 patients with cervical cancer. All of the patients were treated with a prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy daily fractions, and all of the plans involved the same planning target volume (PTV) constrictions. A 3D-CRT plan involving a four-field box, an IMRT plan involving seven coplanar fields, and an SSPT plan involving four fields were created. The median PTV D95% did not differ between the 3D-CRT, IMRT and SSPT plans. The median conformity index 95% and homogeneity index of the IMRT and SSPT were better than those of the 3D-CRT. The homogeneity index of the SSPT was better than that of the IMRT. SSPT resulted in lower median V20 values for the bladder wall, small intestine, colon, bilateral femoral heads, skin, and pelvic bone than IMRT. Comparing the Dmean values, SSPT spared the small intestine, colon, bilateral femoral heads, skin and pelvic bone to a greater extent than the other modalities. SSPT can reduce the irradiated volume of the organs at risk compared with 3D-CRT and IMRT, while maintaining excellent PTV coverage. Further investigations of SSPT are warranted to assess its role in the treatment of cervical cancer.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157374","spot scanning proton therapy;IMRT;3D-CRT;whole-pelvic radiotherapy;cervical cancer;dosimetry","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The release is consistent with the IERS2010 conventions. Improvements with respect to its predecessor AIUB-RL01 include the use of reprocessed (RL02) GRACE observations, new atmosphere and ocean dealiasing products (RL05), an upgraded ocean tide model (EOT11A), and the interpolation of shallow ocean tides (admittances). The stochastic parametrization of AIUB-RL02 was adapted to include daily accelerometer scale factors, which drastically reduces spurious signal at the 161 d period in C20 and at other low degree and order gravity field coefficients. Moreover, the correlation between the noise in the monthly gravity models and solar activity is considerably reduced in the new release. The signal and the noise content of the new AIUB-RL02 monthly gravity fields are studied and calibrated errors are derived from their non-secular and non-seasonal variability. The short-period time-variable signal over the oceans, mostly representing noise, is reduced by 50percent with respect to AIUB-RL01. Compared to the official GFZ-RL05a and CSR-RL05 monthly models, the AIUB-RL02 stands out by its low noise at high degrees, a fact emerging from the estimation of seasonal variations for selected river basins and of mass trends in polar regions. Two versions of the monthly AIUB-RL02 gravity models, with spherical harmonics resolution of degree and order 60 and 90, respectively, are available for the time period from March 2003 to March 2014 at the International Center for Global Earth Models or from ftp://ftp.unibe.ch/aiub/GRAVITY/GRACE (last accessed 22 March 2016).","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8189140","Satellite geodesy;Time variable gravity;Global change from geodesy","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) has provided successful tumor control; however, there is still room for improvement, particularly in terms of tumor-specific radiosensitization. The Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 has been shown to sensitize tumor cells to X-ray radiation. A murine osteosarcoma cell line (LM8) and a normal human fibroblast cell line (AG01522) were treated with PU-H71 before X-ray, 14- or 50-keV/µm carbon-ion beam (C-ion) irradiation. Cell survival and protein expression were evaluated with colony formation and western blot, respectively. Treatment with PU-H71 alone was shown to be non-toxic to both cell lines; however, PU-H71 was shown to significantly sensitize LM8 cells to not only X-ray, but also to C-ion irradiation, while only a minimal sensitizing effect was observed in AG01522 cells. PU-H71 treatment was found to suppress the protein expression levels of Rad51 and Ku70, which are associated with the homologous recombination pathway and the non-homologous end-joining pathway of double-strand break repair.

This newly developed AFM uses cantilevers of similar size as stage-scan AFMs to improve substantially the spatial and temporal resolution. Such an approach has previously never been possible by a tip-scan system, in which a cantilever moves in the x, y and z directions. We evaluated the performance of this developed tip-scan AFM by observing the molecular structure of actin filaments and the actin–tropomyosin complex. In the image of the actin filament, the molecular interval of the actin subunits (∼5.5 nm) was clearly observed as stripes. From the shape of the stripes, the polarity of the actin filament was directly determined and the results were consistent with the polarity determined by myosin binding. In the image of the actin–tropomyosin complex, each tropomyosin molecule (∼2 nm in diameter) on the actin filament was directly observed without averaging images of different molecules. Each tropomyosin molecule on the actin filament has never been directly observed by AFM or electron microscopy. Thus, our developed tip-scan AFM offers significant potential in observing purified proteins and cellular structures at nanometer resolution. Current results represent an important step in the development of a new correlative microscope to observe nm-order structures at an acceptable frame rate (∼10 s/frame) by AFM at the position indicated by the fluorescent dye observed under a light microscope.","1477-9986","","10.1093/jmicro/dfw017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8162607","atomic force microscopy;tip-scan AFM;correlative microscopy;actin filament;tropomyosin;cytoskeleton","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A literature search was conducted and a total of three studies were analyzed. There was no significant difference in the objective response rate between the EGFR mutation group and the EGFR wild-type group (odds ratios [OR] 1.46, 95% CI, 0.79–2.70, P = 0.228), and there was no significant difference in the incidence of disease recurrence (OR 1.37, 95% CI, 0.68–2.75, P = 0.379) between the two groups. There were significant difference in the incidence of local/locoregional progression (LP) (OR 0.35, 95% CI, 0.18–0.71, P = 0.003) and distant progression (DP) (OR 2.97, 95% CI, 1.59–5.54, P < 0.001). Brain metastasis (BM) was one of the main recurrence patterns of DP, and the incidence was significantly higher in the EGFR mutant group (OR 2.75, 95% CI, 1.43–5.31, P = 0.003). There were no statistically significant heterogeneities in these pooled analyses. The patterns of recurrence after CRT for locally advanced NSCLC were different according to EGFR mutation status. LP after CRT in patients with EGFR mutation was less frequent, but the high incidence of DP, especially BM, continued to be the major problem. On the other hand, LP continued to be the major problem in EGFR wild-type patients. In multimodality treatment for inoperable locally advanced NSCLC, we may need to consider different treatment strategies according to EGFR mutation status.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrw075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157382","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Dynamics and excess temperature of a plume throughout its life cycle","N. Cagney; C. Lithgow-Bertelloni",NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2016","205","3","1574","1588","Measurements of the velocity field associated with plumes rising through a viscous fluid are performed using stereoscopic Particle-Image Velocimetry in the Rayleigh number range 4.4 × 105–6.4 × 105. The experimental model is analogous to a mantle plume rising from the core–mantle boundary to the base of the lithosphere. The behaviour of the plume is studied throughout its life cycle, which is broken up into four stages; the Formation Stage, when the plume forms; the Rising Stage, when the plume rises through the fluid; the Spreading Stage, when the plume reaches the surface and spreads; and finally the Declining Stage, when the heat source has been removed and the plume weakens. The latter three stages are examined in terms of the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent fields and the advection of passive tracers throughout the flow. The temperature at the heater and near the fluid surface are measured using thermocouples to infer how the presence of a mantle plume would produce excess temperature near the lithosphere throughout the various stages of its life cycle. In all experiments, a time lag is observed between the removal of the heat source and the decline in the excess temperature near the surface, which is proportional to the rise time. A simple analytical model is presented, which suggests that under mantle conditions (i.e. negligible thermal diffusion), the relationship between the time lag and the rise time is robust and independent of the Rayleigh number; however, the constant of proportionality is closer to unity in the absence of diffusion. Once the heat source is removed, the excess temperature near the surface declines exponentially at a rate that is inversely proportional to the rise time. The implications of this result are discussed in terms of the decline in volcanism in the Louisville hotspot chain over the past 20 Ma. The rise velocity of material in the plume is examined; the rise velocity is found to vary significantly with the plume height in a manner that is inconsistent with many of the common semi-analytical models of thermal plumes in the literature. It is also argued that this height dependency will cause estimates of the rise velocity based on the decay series of uranium isotopes to significantly underestimate the true value.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146927","Heat flow;Mantle processes;Dynamics: convection currents, and mantle plumes;Heat generation and transport;Hotspots","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

First, we propose a measure to evaluate the reliability of depth map, and use it to reduce the influence of poor depth map on saliency detection. Then, the input image is represented as a graph, and the depth information is introduced into graph construction. After that, a new definition of compactness using color and depth cues is put forward to compute the compactness saliency map. In order to compensate the detection errors of compactness saliency when the salient regions have similar appearances with background, foreground saliency map is calculated based on depth-refined foreground seeds' selection (DRSS) mechanism and multiple cues contrast. Finally, these two saliency maps are integrated into a final saliency map through weighted-sum method according to their importance. Experiments on two publicly available stereo data sets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than other ten state-of-the-art approaches.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2016.2557347","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271324,61520106002,91320201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457641","Depth confidence measure;color and depthbased compactness;multiple cues;saliency detection;Color and depth-based compactness;depth confidence measure;multiple cues;saliency detection","Image color analysis;Computational modeling;Stereo image processing;Reliability;Visualization;Manifolds;Markov processes","","197","","32","OAPA","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The impedance interaction between individually designed converters may make the cascaded system become unstable.

This letter proposes an adaptive-input-impedance-regulation (AIIR) method, which connects an adaptive virtual impedance in parallel with the input impedance of the load converter, to stabilize the cascaded system. This virtual impedance can adaptively regulate its characteristic for different source converters. Therefore, with the AIIR method, all the load converters can be designed to a fixed standard module to stably adapt various source converters. In addition, at any cases, the AIIR approach only changes the load converter's input impedance in a very small frequency range to keep the load converter's original dynamic performance. The requirements on the AIIR method are derived and the control strategies to achieve the AIIR method are proposed. Finally, considering the worst stability problem that often occurs at the system whose source converter is an LC filter, a load converter cascaded with two different LC input filters is fabricated and tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed AIIR control method.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2015.2469720","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/I038586/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208845","Cascaded system;stability;load converter;modularization;virtual impedance;adaptive-input-impedanceregulation;input impedance regulator;Adaptive-input-impedance-regulation;cascaded system;input impedance regulator;load converter;modularization;stability;virtual impedance","Impedance;Voltage control;Frequency conversion;Stability criteria;Resistors;Regulators;Power system stability","","88","","24","CCBY","18 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, we propose a framework to construct a group of ESFs for edge-based active contour models to segment objects with poorly defined boundaries. In our framework, which incorporates gradient information as well as probability scores from a standard classifier, the ESF can be constructed from any classification algorithm and applied to any edge-based model using a level set method.

Development of high-quality compact models for devices is a key to connect device science with applications. One recent approach is to treat compact modeling as a regression problem in machine learning. The most common learning algorithm to develop compact models is the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. However, device compact models derived using the MLP neural networks often exhibit unphysical behavior, which is eliminated in the Pi-NN approach proposed in this paper, since the Pi-NN incorporates fundamental device physics. As a result, smooth, accurate, and computationally efficient device models can be learned from discrete data points by using Pi-NN. This paper sheds new light on the future of the neural network compact modeling.","2329-9231","","10.1109/JXCDC.2016.2636161","Center for Low Energy Systems Technology, one of the six SRC STARnet Centers,; MARCO and DARPA; National Science Foundation; Air Force Office of Scientific Research EFRI 2-DARE(grant numbers:1433490); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778193","Supervised learning;artificial neural networks;semiconductor device modeling;TFETs","Computational modeling;Biological neural networks;Integrated circuit modeling;Neural networks;Physics","","62","","11","OAPA","8 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a new method to realize the reconfigurable ±45° polarizations is proposed. It introduces controllable RF switches on a cross-aperture to excite a square patch for two orthogonal polarizations. The RF switches are controlled by two sets of DC biases, which could select the polarization through the reconfigurable aperture. Second, two patch antennas based on cross-aperture excitation are discussed. The first structure uses a split ground plane with four switches, while the other one employs a united ground plane with eight switches. Both antennas operate well as the single element. However, only the antenna with a united ground is suitable for developing a reconfigurable dual-polarized antenna array, owning to its simple DC biasing lines and the reconfigurable-controlling network. Both simulation and experiment studies were examined to verify the proposed design. The measured 10-dB impedance bandwidth of the array is 9.3%, which can cover the 2.4-GHz WLAN band. The desired radiation patterns were observed with a maximum gain of 13.5 dBi. The proposed antenna array has low cross-polarization and stable gain across the entire operating bandwidth.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2552488","Research Grants Council, Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU 11216915); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7450614","Polarization reconfigurable antenna array;aperture-fed patch antenna;± 45⁰ Polarization;PIN diodes;Polarization reconfigurable antenna array;aperture-fed patch antenna;±45° Polarization;PIN diodes","Polarization;Antenna arrays;PIN diodes;Patch antennas;Control systems;Radio frequency;Bandwidth allocation","","61","1","25","OAPA","11 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is considered a powerful alternative to field oriented control (FOC) and direct torque control (DTC) in high performance AC motor drives. Compared to FOC, MPC eliminates the use of internal current control loops and modulation block, hence featuring very quick dynamic response. Compared to DTC, MPC uses a cost function rather than a heuristic switching table to select the best voltage vector, producing better steady state performance. In spite of the merits above, MPC also presents some drawbacks such as high computational burden, nontrivial weighting factor tuning, high sampling frequency, variable switching frequency, model/parameter dependence and relatively high steady ripples in torque and stator flux. This paper presents the state of the art of MPC in high performance induction motor (IM) drives, and in particular the progress on solving the drawbacks of conventional MPC. Finally, one of the improved MPC is compared to FOC to validate its superiority.

We model cell size using a stochastic hybrid system, where a cell grows exponentially in size (volume) over time and probabilistic division events are triggered at discretetime intervals. Moreover, whenever division occurs, size is randomly partitioned among daughter cells. We first consider a scenario where a timer (cell-cycle clock) that measures the time elapsed since the last division event regulates both the cellular growth and division rates. The analysis reveals that such a timer-controlled system cannot achieve size homeostasis, in the sense that the cell-to-cell size variation grows unboundedly with time. To explore biologically meaningful mechanisms for controlling size, we consider two classes of regulation: a size-dependent growth rate and a size-dependent division rate. Our results show that these strategies can provide bounded intercellular variation in cell size and exact mathematical conditions on the form of regulation needed for size homeostasis are derived. Different known forms of size control strategies, such as the adder and the sizer, are shown to be consistent with these results. Finally, we discuss how organisms ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells have adopted different control approaches for maintaining size homeostasis.","2332-7685","","10.1109/LLS.2016.2646383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7801893","Adder;cell size homeostasis;moment closure;moment dynamics;sizer;stochastic hybrid systems","Stochastic processes;Life sciences;Adders;Microorganisms;Timing;Random variables","","44","","20","OAPA","29 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, recent laboratory fog-chamber tests have shown that a salt/kaolin layer applied to the surface of an 11kV SiR insulator can reduce the specific creepage distance (SCD) at flashover to as low as 16mm/kV. Even for larger values of SCD, potentially damaging partial arcs can arise along the insulator surface. It has been shown that some mitigation of partial-arc activity and an increase of flashover voltage can be achieved by appropriate texturing of the SiR insulator housing. The present paper describes additional infrared (IR) recording which accompanied these previous tests. Although a reduction of the flashover voltage in polluted environments is generally surmised to be the result of the formation of dry bands in a conducting moistened surface layer, no direct observations of dry bands appear to have been previously demonstrated in the laboratory. Such observations are described here, where details of dry-band location and growth are revealed by IR recording. Dry bands are shown by close-up visual photography to be invariably bridged by small streamer/spark discharges which maintain current continuity in the pollution layer. Local surface heating by these discharges are the probable cause of the delayed rewetting of the bands. Partial-arc channels that may result in flashover develop from and across the dry-band streamers. It has become clear that clean-fog testing with infrared recording and leakage current measurements provide new possibilities for the modeling of dry band discharges and improvement of insulator design.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2015.005026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422573","Outdoor insulation;flashover;high voltage;insulation contamination;silicone rubber insulation;pollution;insulator testing;dry-banding","Flashover;Pollution;Discharges (electric);Leakage currents;Surface contamination;Rubber","","38","","16","IEEE","7 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such devices, the bandstructure of the channel material becomes thickness dependent due to quantum confinement effects, and deviates remarkably from that of the bulk material. In this paper, we use first principle density functional theory calculations to evaluate the variation of the effective mass and bandgap with channel thickness.

Before the VO2 phase transition, this phase-change metasurface achieves linear-to-circular polarization conversion at 0.45 and 1.10 THz with an ellipticity of 0.998 and -0.971, respectively. After the VO2 phase transition, linear-to-circular polarization conversion is obtained at both 0.50 and 1.05 THz with an ellipticity of 0.999 and -0.999, respectively.

We develop a parametric distributed algorithm as a function of a linear operator defined on the underlying graph and provide a necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing weighted average consensus in K steps, where K is the number of distinct eigenvalues of the underlying operator. Based on the novel framework of generalized consensus meaning that consensus is reached only by a subset of nodes, we show that the finite-time weighted average consensus can always be reached by a subset corresponding to the non-zero variables of the eigenvector associated with a simple eigenvalue of the operator. It is interesting that the final consensus state is shown to be freely adjustable if a smaller subset of consensus is admitted.

Therefore, in this study, we present a novel Reducing Iteration Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (RIOMP) algorithm that calculates the correlation of the residual value and measurement matrix to reduce the number of iterations. The conditions for successful signal reconstruction are derived on the basis of detailed mathematical analyses.

Therefore, to optimize the power density, the reliability of power devices needs to be investigated first in order to obtain the accurate operational margin of a power device. Although much research on device failure analysis has been reported, there still lacks efficient failure evaluation methods. This paper first summarizes the current failure research. Then, a three-step failure analysis method of power electronic devices is proposed as: failure information collection, failure identification and mechanism, and failure evaluation.

The experimental THz wireless photonic transmission system is enabled by the ultrawideband behavior of an antenna-integrated unitraveling-carrier-photodiode-based transmitter and a Schottky mixer-based THz receiver. In the experiment, a phase-correlated optical frequency comb (OFC) is created for photomixing generation of the desired THz carrier frequencies with low phase noise. The OFC allows for the generation of flexibly tunable THz carrier frequencies. The performance of the generated THz carriers is experimentally characterized in terms of phase noise, spectrum purity, tunability, and long-term stability. In the case of generating 400 GHz carrier, the measured timing jitter, linewidth, and long-term stability in the experiment are 51.5 fs, less than 2 Hz, and less than ±1 Hz with 3 hours, respectively. We also theoretically analyze the phase noise of photonically generated THz beat-notes when phase correlation of two optical comb tones is damaged due to their path-length difference. In addition, we demonstrate THz wireless transmission of various modulation formats, including OOK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 32-QAM at beyond 10 Gb/s in such a system, and the measured bit error rate (BER) performance for all the signals after 0.5 m free-space delivery is below the hard decision forward error correction threshold of 3.8 × 10-3. Furthermore, the influence of THz carrier purity on the system performance is experimentally analyzed with respect to the BER of the THz communication signals.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2600345","China Scholarship Council; ERC-PoC Project TWIST; Research Centre of Excellence SPOC(grant numbers:DNRF123); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61427817,61405142); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7549019","THz wireless communication;THz photonics;unitraveling carrier photodiode (UTC-PD);phase noise;optical frequency comb (OFC);photomixing.","Wireless communication;Phase noise;Photonics;Optical transmitters;Stability analysis;Frequency measurement;Optical modulation","","25","","21","OAPA","24 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed SPR sensor can support two polarized resonance peaks (x-polarized and y-polarized) caused by the silver wire. We theoretically investigate the sensitivities of the two polarized peaks both in the wavelength and amplitude interrogation methods and analyze the influences of the silver wire location on the sensing performances. The results show that the sensitivities of the two polarized peaks are similar and relatively stable for random locations of the silver wire. Moreover, the x-polarized peak provides a higher resolution for wavelength sensitivity and needs a shorter silver wire for the maximum amplitude sensitivity.

Silicon could overcome this deficiency by proposing high harvested power density, simplicity, availability, harmlessness, CMOS compatibility, and cost reduction. However, despite its high Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity, silicon is an inefficient thermoelectric material due to a high thermal conductivity ( $\kappa $ ). Modern nano-fabrication techniques enable reduction of  $\kappa $  in silicon through attenuation of thermal phonons. In this letter, the design and the fabrication of nanostructured material onto  $\kappa $  measurement platforms are presented. The proposed fabrication process is versatile and ensures compatibility with CMOS technologies.

In this paper, we propose an efficient CF algorithm based on a new measure called the M-distance, which is defined as the difference between the average ratings of two items. In the initialization stage, we compute the average ratings of items and store them in two vectors, which requires O(m) space. Scanning the rating dataset then takes O(mn) time. In the online prediction stage, a threshold δ is employed to identify similar items. To predictp ratings, our algorithm requires O(np) time compared with the O(mnp) time of the cosine-based kNN algorithm. Experiments are undertaken on four well-known datasets, and the proposed M-distance is compared with the cosine-based kNN, Pearson-based kNN, and Slope One methods.

Two cross-cone-shaped horns were machined at two ends of the crossbeam, and the tips of the horns served as the driving feet. Ellipse trajectories of the two driving feet were generated by superimposing two orthogonal first bending vibrations with the same resonance frequency but a temporal shift of 90°. A Symmetric structure of the proposed ultrasonic motor solved the problem of mode frequencies degeneracy. A new method to excite these two bending vibrations was proposed. Finite-element method simulation was developed to obtain the vibration characteristics of the crossbeam motor. The new excitation method was compared with the traditional one, and it was found that the vibration amplitudes of the driving feet under the new excitation method were about three times that of the traditional one.

There are still lack of authoritative indicator and method for the cooperating path planning. The calculation of the voyage time is a difficult problem in the time-varying ocean, for the existing methods of the cooperating path planning, the computation time will increase exponentially as the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) counts increase, rendering them unfeasible. A collaborative path planning method is presehted for multi-AUV under the influence of time-varying ocean currents based on the dynamic programming algorithm. Each AUV cooperates with the one who has the longest estimated time of sailing, enabling the arrays of AUV to get their common goal in the shortest time with minimum time-difference. At the same time, they could avoid the obstacles along the way to the target. Simulation results show that the proposed method has a promising applicability.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2016.00065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514688","dynamic programming;time-varying;cooperate;path planning;autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)","Path planning;Oceans;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic programming;Algorithm design and analysis;Time complexity;Underwater vehicles","","20","","","","21 Jul 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

To further bring down the cost and actually implement the dispatchability of wind/PV plants, there is a need to penetrate into the major factors that contribute to the cost of the any HESS. This paper first discusses hybrid energy storage systems, as well as chemical properties in different medium, deeming the ramp rate as one of the determinants that must be observed in the cost calculation. Then, a mathematical tool, Copula, is explained in details for the purpose of unscrambling the dependences between the power of wind and PV plants. To lower the cost, the basic rule for allocation of buffered power is also put forward, with the minimum energy capacities of the battery ESS(BESS) and the supercapacitor ESS(SC-ESS) simultaneously determined by integration. And the paper introduces the probability method to analyze how power and energy is compensated in certain confidence level. After that, two definitions of coefficients are set up, separately describing energy storage status and wind curtailment level. Finally, the paper gives a numerical example stemmed from real data acquired in wind farms and PV stations in Belgium. The conclusion presents that the cost of a hybrid energy storage system is greatly affected by ramp-rate and dependence between the power of wind farms and photovoltaic stations, in which dependence can easily be determined by Copulas.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-016-0021-1","Shanghai Science and Technology Committee(grant numbers:13231204002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10366244","Probability analysis;Copula;Correlation;Capacity optimization;Hybrid ESS","Photovoltaic systems;Costs;Correlation;Wind farms;Supercapacitors;Hybrid power systems;Batteries","","20","","12","","20 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

Using the fluxgates as the core components, the gradiometer has the advantages of wide temperature range, low cost, and high resolution, but has the disadvantage of relatively low accuracy. This is because of the scale factor error, the nonorthogonal error, the misalignment, the zero offset, the dynamic error in a fluxgate, and the inconsistency among the error of fluxgates. In this letter, a correction method for a towed airborne magnetic tensor gradiometer is proposed that is composed of four fluxgates arranged in a cross-shaped structure. The theoretical framework of the proposed method is based on the static error model and the dynamic characteristics of single fluxgate, the feature that the gradient tensor of the geomagnetic field at high altitude is approximately zero, and on the phenomenon that the unchanged tensor rotation as a result of nonuniform magnetic field on the ground can indicate the inconsistency of the scale factors among different tensor components. The actual flight results using a helicopter have demonstrated and validated the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Based on the fault diagnosis theory, this paper proposes a robust fault diagnosis method to study the fault diagnosis problem of MMC-HVDC systems. Methods: By optimizing the gain matrix in the fault observer, fault detection with good sensitivity and robustness to disturbance is achieved. In the MMC-HVDC system, because of the inherently uncertain system and the presence of various random disturbances, the study of robust fault diagnosis method is particularly important. Results: Simulation studies during various AC faults have been carried out based on a 61-level MMC-HVDC mathematical model. The results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method. Conclusions: So this fault diagnosis method can be further applied to the actual project, to quickly achieve system fault diagnosis and accurately complete fault identification.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-016-0022-0","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10366237","Fault diagnosis;MMC-HVDC;Robust;State observer;Residual state equation","Fault diagnosis;Uncertain systems;Sensitivity;Uncertainty;Simulation;HVDC transmission;Observers","","19","","17","","20 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

To enable the effective manipulation of the robot, real-time pose (position and orientation) information of the robot must be obtained as an important sensory feedback. Usually, a magnetic tracking method is used to provide the pose information. Due to the magnetic disturbance, a traditional magnetic tracking method cannot work simultaneously with the magnetic manipulation system. In this paper, a simultaneously tracking and navigation method is proposed to realize a closed-loop control of the magnetically manipulated untethered robot. The main approach is to conduct a multi-object tracking of the involved magnetic objects. With the proposed method, real-time pose information can be estimated during the manipulation, and both the tracking and manipulation are carried out by a magnetic manner. Therefore, the mobile navigation of the magnetically manipulated untethered robot can be achieved by using a pre-defined map. Experimental results verified the proposed method, and a mean position error of 1.2 mm for the passive magnet has been obtained.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2618949","Natural Scientific Research Innovation Foundation, Harbin Institute of Technology(grant numbers:HIT.NSRIF.2017053); Science and Technology Innovation Committee of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20160318094652204); Chinese National High Technology Research (863) Funds(grant numbers:2015AA043201); RGC GRF(grant numbers:CUHK415512,CUHK415613); CRF(grant numbers:CUHK6/CRF/13G); ITC ITF(grant numbers:ITS/236/15); CUHK VC discretional fund #4930765; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7593319","Magnetic manipulation;magnetic tracking;navigation;pose detection","Robot sensing systems;Real-time systems;Navigation;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Endoscopes;Magnetic tracking;Tracking;Pose estimation","","18","","17","OAPA","19 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the impact of increasing correlation between the slope of the shadowed dominant and multipath components similarly acts to reduce crossings at lower signal levels.

Recently, Mahler et al. have introduced a PHD smoother to gain more accurate estimates for both target states and number. However, as highlighted by Psiaki in the context of a backward-smoothing extended Kalman filter, with a nonlinear state evolution model the approximation error in the backward filtering requires careful consideration. Psiaki suggests that to minimize the aggregated least-squares error over a batch of data. We instead use the term retrodiction PHD filter to describe the backward filtering algorithm in recognition of the approximation error proposed in the original PHD smoother, and we propose an adaptive recursion step to improve the approximation accuracy. This step combines forward and backward processing through the measurement set and thereby mitigates the problems with the original PHD smoother when the target number changes significantly and the targets appear and disappear randomly.

This increase is referred to as lunar contamination since the cold count is not matched with the specified brightness temperature of 2.73 K. For ATMS, it is found that the elapse time of lunar intrusion (LI) and the magnitude of the cold count increase are channel dependent. If the lunar-affected calibration counts are rejected in the processing, a data gap can be shown in brightness temperature at all channels. At ATMS channels 1 and 2, which have a large FOV, the LI can result in an increase of 40 counts in cold calibration. At higher frequency channels which have a smaller FOV size, the LI intensity is much stronger and can be as large as a few hundred counts. The LI becomes significant when its radiation appears in the ATMS antenna main beam. In the current ATMS operational calibration algorithm, the cold count anomaly is detected when the intensity of LI exceeds a certain threshold. The lunar radiation can be also corrected in the ATMS calibration. In doing so, a lunar radiation term is derived as a function of antenna gain, the solid angle of the Moon, and the brightness temperature of the Moon disk. This algorithm is applied in an ATMS calibration system developed at NOAA and shows a successful removal of all the lunar contamination on the earth-scene brightness temperature.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2490198","NOAA JPSS Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328730","Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS);calibration;contamination;lunar intrusion (LI);Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS);calibration;contamination;lunar intrusion (LI)","Moon;Contamination;Space vehicles;Calibration;Brightness temperature;Microwave radiometry","","17","","9","OAPA","13 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is well-known that the Kalman filter cannot handle uncertainties in a process model, such as initial state estimation errors, parameter mismatch and abrupt state changes. These uncertainties severely affect filter performance and may even provoke divergence. A strong tracking filter (STF), which utilizes a suboptimal fading factor, is an adaptive approach that is commonly adopted to solve this problem. However, if the strong tracking SCKF (STSCKF) uses the same method as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to introduce the suboptimal fading factor, it greatly increases the computational load. To avoid this problem, a low-cost introductory method is proposed and a hypothesis testing theory is applied to detect uncertainties. The computational load analysis is performed by counting the total number of floating-point operations and it is found that the computational load of LCASCKF is close to that of SCKF. Experimental results prove that the LCASCKF performs as well as STSCKF, while the increase in computational load is much lower than STSCKF.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2016.05.01","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7784176","square-root cubature Kalman filter;strong tracking filter;robustness;computational load","Kalman filters;Fading channels;Uncertainty;Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Computational modeling","","16","","","","15 Dec 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

More specifically, the same microring can be used to support simultaneous bidirectional transmissions of two signals to be coupled in the NoC topology, leading to two different configurations, called shared source-microring and shared destination-microring. Spectral characterization shows good agreement between simulations and measurements taken on silicon-based integrated NoC. Bit-error-rate (BER) measurements indicate that the shared sourcemicroring configuration performs better, achieving a penalty as low as 1.5 dB for a BER of 10-9 at 10 Gb/s in the bus NoC. A higher penalty in the ring NoC for both configurations is due to higher crosstalk in the interconnecting ring.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2526607","MIUR through FIRB project MINOS; Ministero degli Affari Esteri - Unità per la cooperazione Scientifica e Tecnologica (Italian Ministry of Foreign Affair - Unit for Scientific and Technological Cooperation) through bilateral project NANO-RODIN; EC through FP7 project IRIS(grant numbers:619194); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7400922","Silicon nanophotonics;integrated photonic systems;optical interconnect.;Silicon nanophotonics;integrated photonic systems;optical interconnect","Integrated optics;Ports (Computers);Topology;Optical attenuators;Optical crosstalk;Optical coupling;Optical device fabrication","","16","","10","OAPA","8 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, the effect of Si doping on InAs/GaAs QD solar cells with AlAs cap layers is studied. The AlAs cap layers prevent the formation of the wetting layer during QD growth and reduce the Si doping density needed to achieve QD state filling.

With the steady implementation of smart grid technologies throughout the existing distribution networks, the online voltage control can be achieved ensuring the power quality and voltage levels within the statutory limits. This study presents a methodology for the estimation of voltage profile in a smart distribution network with DG for the online voltage control, taking into account different line $X/R$ ratios and laterals. This method is based on maximum and minimum voltage estimation by remote terminal units (RTUs) placed only at DG connected bus and at capacitor connected bus. Voltage regulation is carried out based on RTUs estimated values. This work is tested on two radial distribution networks with/without DGs and laterals.

Grayscale images rather than color images are generally used to get SIFT descriptors in order to reduce the complexity. The regions which have a similar grayscale level but different hues tend to produce wrong matching results in this case. Therefore, the loss of color information may result in decreasing of matching ratio. An image matching algorithm based on SIFT is proposed, which adds a color offset and an exposure offset when converting color images to grayscale images in order to enhance the matching ratio. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively differentiate the regions with different colors but the similar grayscale level, and increase the matching ratio of image matching based on SIFT. Furthermore, it does not introduce much complexity than the traditional SIFT.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2016.00072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514695","scale invariant feature transform (SIFT);image matching;color;exposure","Image color analysis;Gray-scale;Color;Feature extraction;Image matching;Robustness;Transforms","","15","","","","21 Jul 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

To enable the generated optical mm-wave signal to resist the fiber chromatic dispersion degradation, the unmodulated -fourth-order and the QPSK-modulated +fifth-order sidebands are abstracted from the generated sidebands, considering the phase periodicity of a QPSK signal. The opto-electrical conversion efficiency is maximized by optimizing the modulation index of PM.

In this paper, a negative-sequence compensation based three-phase voltage unified correction strategy is proposed. While MG operates in islanded mode, a positive virtual impedance control is used to eliminate the negative voltage resulted from the negative-sequence current, and then a positive-sequence voltage control loop and negative-sequence control loop are used to improve the inverter control performance. While MG operates in grid-tied mode, the inverter operates as a negative-sequence current source to compensate the negative-sequence currents of loads to guarantee the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage balance. By using the proposed strategy, the voltage control performance of inverter can be improved; the MG power quality can be enhanced significantly.

By comparing KRX to two other anomaly detectors, we can trace the problem to a projection in feature space, which arises when a pseudoinverse is used on the covariance matrix in that feature space.

Since vacuum interrupter contacts are designed as flat contacts facing each other, the resistance is mainly determined by contact force, hardness and resistivity of the contact material. It is known that the contact material changes consistency and structure during short-circuit interruptions within melting depth. Indeed, the overall resistance of a vacuum interrupter has been observed to increase by up to 60% after short-circuit making and breaking tests. Since the resistance increase across the switching device is considered by IEC and IEEE standards as one of the acceptance criteria for the integrity of the interrupter after tests, it is essential to understand the origin of this increase. Different causes are discussed, among them the change of grain structure, resistivity and hardness of the molten top layer of the contact, and flatness of the contact surface. An increase of hardness and a different position of contact points seem to be the main factors responsible for the increased resistance.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2015.005245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422538","Vacuum interrupter;contacts;current interruption;contact resistance","Resistance;Interrupters;Force;Electrical resistance measurement;Contacts;Current measurement;Mathematical model","","14","","9","IEEE","7 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key challenge for such applications, however, is to meet soft real-time constraints. Due to the deadline-agnostic congestion control in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), many deadline-sensitive flows cannot finish transmission before their deadlines. In this paper, we propose an SDN-based Explicit-Deadline-aware TCP (SED) for cloud Data Center Networks (DCN). SED assigns a base rate for non-deadline flows first and gives spare bandwidth to the deadline flows as much as possible. Subsequently, a Retransmission-enhanced SED (RSED) is introduced to solve the packet-loss timeout problem. Through our experiments, we show that SED can make flows meet deadlines effectively, and that it significantly outperforms previous protocols in the cloud data center environment.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2016.7590318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590318","data center networks;SDN;TCP;congestion;deadline-aware","Control systems;Bandwidth;Resource management;Cloud computing;Protocols;Receivers;Web search","","14","","","","18 Oct 2016","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In a conventional reconfiguration system, the processing time is increased in proportion to the number of the reconfigured wavelength channels because each wavelength channel is sequentially established or removed. On the other hand, in the proposed system, the multiwavelength channels would be simultaneously established or removed. Therefore, in principle, the processing time for reconfiguration of multiwavelength channels can be 1/(the number of the reconfigured channels) compared to the conventional system with sequential processing. In addition, the system can provide a further reduction effect of the processing time since the adjustment of variable optical attenuators of the WSS is unnecessary after establishing or removing multiwavelength channels. We had demonstrated a proof of concept using a reconfiguration system for the first time. The system employing flexible-grid WSSs and a BM-EDFA showed that the total processing time could be more than 100 s shorter in the case of removing four-wavelength channels with the high-quality data transmission.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2523263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397865","wavelength resource reconfiguration system;elastic optical network;burst-mode erbium-doped fiber amplifier;Wavelength resource reconfiguration system;elastic optical network;flexible-grid wavelength selective switch (WSS);burst-mode erbium-doped fiber amplifier (BM-EDFA)","Optical attenuators;High-speed optical techniques;Optical fiber networks;Optical amplifiers;Optical packet switching;Optical transmitters","","14","","4","OAPA","3 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gonzalez-Longatt","Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK",Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy,"31 Dec 2019","2016","4","2","211","218","Future power systems face several challenges. One of them is the use of high power converters that decouple new energy sources from the AC power grid. This situation decreases the total system inertia affecting its ability to overcome system frequency disturbances. The wind power industry has created several controllers to enable inertial response on wind turbines generators: artificial, emulated, simulated, or synthetic inertial. This paper deals with the issues related to the emulated inertia of wind turbines based on full-converters and their effect on the under-frequency protection schemes during the recovery period after system frequency disturbances happen. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the recovery period of under-frequency transients in future power systems which integrate wind turbines with emulated inertia capability does not completely avoid the worse scenarios in terms of under-frequency load shedding. The extra power delivered from a wind turbine during frequency disturbances can substantially reduce the rate of frequency change. Thus it provides time for the active governors to respond.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0143-x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946800","Frequency controller;Frequency stability;Power system;Protection scheme;Wind turbine generator","Frequency control;Power system stability;Generators;Wind turbines;Kinetic energy;Frequency response;Frequency measurement","","13","","25","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

The cladding-etched FBG (thinned) acted as the RI sensing elements, while the normal one as temperature reference. As the RI increases, the laser wavelength corresponding to the thinned FBG moves toward longer wavelength, while that corresponding to the normal FBG is unchanged. Then, RI changes can be determined by measuring the separation of the two lasing wavelengths. Moreover, compared with the conventional thinned FBG-based sensors, the fiber laser sensor has a narrow bandwidth, which is beneficial to high precision sensing.

Each cell is represented as a central node connecting to the adjacent cells. The resistance network formed by connecting all the adjacent cells together can be solved to calculate the current field. Under the same conditions, the results calculated by the RNM are consistent with the result by CDEGS, a widely used software package for current distribution and electromagnetic field calculation.

The basic reason for such a design is that rather than including higher than second degree nonlinearities in the designed system, we use the fractional delay degrees of freedom to approximate the given system. The advantage is in terms of obtaining a better approximation of the given nonlinear system than is possible by using only integer delays (since we are giving more degrees of freedom via the fractional delays) and simultaneously it does not require to incorporate higher degree nonlinearities than two. This work hinges around the fact that if the input signal is a decimated version of another signal by a factor of M, then fractional delays can be regarded as delays by integers less than M. Using the well known formula for calculating the discrete time Fourier transform (DTFT) of a decimated signal, we then arrive at an expression for the DTFT of the output of a fractional delay system in terms of the unknown first and second order Volterra system coefficients and the fractional delays. The final energy function to be minimized is the norm square of the difference between the DTFT of the given output and the DTFT of the output of the fractional delay system. Minimization over the filter coefficients is a linear problem and thus the final problem is to minimize a highly nonlinear function of the fractional delays which is accomplished using search techniques like the gradient-search and nature inspired optimization algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using two nonlinear benchmark systems tested with five different input signals. The accuracy of the stated models using the globally convergent metaheuristic, cuckoo-search algorithm (CSA) are observed to be superior when compared with other techniques such as real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gradient-search (GS) methods. Finally, statistical analysis affirms the potential of the proposed designs for its successful implementation.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2016.7510184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783953","","Delays;Nonlinear systems;Mathematical model;Signal processing algorithms;Adaptation models;Kernel;Optimization","","12","","","","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The pulsating power is decoupled from the desired constant DC power, through an auxiliary circuit using energy storage components. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of single-phase converter topologies underlining power decoupling techniques. Passive power decoupling techniques were commonly used in single-phase power converters before active power decoupling techniques were developed. Since then, active power decoupling topologies have generally evolved based on three streams of concepts: 1) current-reference active power decoupling; 2) DC voltage-reference active power decoupling; and 3) AC voltage-reference active power decoupling. The benefits and drawbacks of each topology have been presented and compared with its predecessor, revealing underlying logic in the evolution of the topologies. In addition, a general comparison has also been made in terms of decoupling capacitance/inductance, additional cost, efficiency and complexity of control, providing a benchmark for future power decoupling topologies.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2016.7933113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933113","Power decoupling;second-order ripple power;single-phase power converter;single-phase inverter","","","11","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Here, we demonstrate a noise cancelation method based on a pair of πFBGs, which is capable of improving the SNR of system beyond the limitation set by the laser frequency noise. In this method, one of the gratings is used as the sensor to detect the acoustic signal, and the other grating, isolated from the signal, is used as a reference that gives the noise information. Employing a data postprocessing method, the noise is subtracted from the original detected signal.

Because of the natural and wideband pi phase difference between the up and low optical sidebands after the phase modulation, third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) can be counteracted by subtly designing the optical power and modulation depth relationships between the two wavelengths.

The lack of volumetric modeling of muscle makes a representation of interaction between muscles and natural muscle pathway difficult. This difficulty results in a physiologically inappropriate estimation of a muscle momentum arm that is critical for a muscle activity estimation. In this letter, we develop a volumetric skin-musculoskeletal model based on an anatomographic human shape database to improve an estimation of a muscle momentum arm. A volumetric deformation of surface skin and muscle is realized by an extended skeleton subspace deformation (SSD, the linear blend skinning algorithm) that considers a surface profile of bone with low computational cost. This extended SSD considers a sub-bone that is projected to the bone surface polygon so that the skin and muscle deformation is significantly affected by the bone surface profile. The surface-based SSD realized the natural skin deformation avoiding a penetration between skin and bones during trunk rotation that results in a physiologically appropriate estimation of a muscle momentum arm. The volumetric skin-musculoskeletal model and the surface-based SSD estimates the momentum arm of vastus lateralis with 14.1% maximum error from a literature values, though there is 44.8% maximum error with the wire musculoskeletal model. This model would accurize a muscle activity estimation that leads to a more correct understanding of human motion control/generation mechanisms.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2016.2524069","Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists(grant numbers:#25730156); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396939","Simulation and Animation;Biomimetics;Simulation and Animation;biomimetics","Muscles;Bones;Skin;Joints;Computational modeling;Estimation","","11","","17","OAPA","2 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method can jointly dispatch the energy resources and demand side resources to mitigate the fluctuation of load and wind power output. It is noticed in practical operation that, without customer's satisfaction being considered, customers might reject the too frequent or violent demand response all together. In this case, two indices that measure the customer satisfaction are then introduced as constraints to reduce the impact to end-users and avoid extreme demand adjustment. To make the model solvable, a proximate decoupling technique is used to dispose the concave constraint introduced by the customer satisfaction constraints. Results from the case studies show that the proposed model can significantly reduce the operation cost of power system while the demand response meets customer satisfaction. Especially, the total start-up costs of conventional thermal units decreases dramatically due to less startup times. Moreover, compared to the consumption way satisfaction constraint, the payment satisfaction constraint has a heavier influence on the cost.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-015-0136-9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946806","Optimal scheduling;Wind power;Real-time pricing;Customer satisfaction","Load management;Wind power generation;Optimal scheduling;Customer satisfaction;Elasticity;Power systems","","10","","22","","31 Dec 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

With voltage distortion often exceeding 20%, equipment associated with the drilling operation can experience erratic operation and equipment damage. Repeated damage to one or several ac drives is common. One land rig in Northern Alberta was experiencing failures with its centrifuge equipment on a weekly basis. During one visit to the site, a drive in the centrifuge was found to have tripped off causing the centrifuge to plug up. After cleaning out the centrifuge and restoring the drive, it tripped off again shortly after drilling operations resumed. A power quality analyzer was connected, which revealed extremely high levels of voltage distortion during drilling operations. Deep notches, which are visible in the voltage waveform, were found to be the result of silicon-controlled rectifiers in the mud pump dc drives. Total harmonic voltage distortion (VTHD) reached 25%. A series-connected passive filter was installed ahead of the centrifuge equipment to reduce the voltage notching and lower voltage distortion. The filter reduced the notch depth by more than half and lowered overall voltage distortion at the centrifuge panel to <; 9% during the most severe drilling operations. With line-side voltage distortion levels remaining in the 20% range, the filter proved to be extremely effective in eliminating all centrifuge operational and premature failure issues.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2015.2461620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7169596","Commutation notches;AC Drive;DC Drive;silicon controlled rectifier;centrifuge;voltage ringing;harmonic filter;notch filter;wide spectrum harmonic filter;adjustable speed drives;harmonics;harmonic distortion;harmonic mitigation;AC drive;adjustable-speed drives (ASDs);centrifuge;commutation notches;dc drive;harmonic distortion;harmonic filter;harmonic mitigation;harmonics;notch filter;silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR);voltage ringing;wide-spectrum harmonic filter","Power harmonic filters;Harmonic analysis;Passive filters;Thyristors;Distortion;Harmonic filters","","10","","8","OAPA","28 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, historical meteorological data are utilized to investigate the probability distribution of key equivalent parameters, such as capacity, wind speed and electrical impedance to the point of common coupling. Each type of equivalent DFIG is further clustered into several groups according to their active power output. Combinations are created to generate representative scenarios.

The appearance of nonlinear window of period-tripling suggests that the ultrashort pulses generated from the DM fiber laser with zero GVD have rich nonlinear dynamics.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2623904","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11674133,61275109,61405079); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu higher education institutions; Jiangsu Province Science Foundation(grant numbers:BK20140231); Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, China; Graduate Students in Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:2015YZD014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727956","Numerical simulation;nonlinear dynamics;period bifurcation;chaos;dispersion management","Optical fiber dispersion;Bifurcation;Fiber lasers;Optical fiber polarization;Chaos;Cavity resonators","","9","","22","OAPA","1 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There clearly is a need to estimate at least some of the parameter values from experimental data; however, the small amount of available data and the large number of parameters commonly found in these types of models require the use of regularization techniques to avoid overfitting. A tutorial of regularization techniques, including parameter set selection, precedes a case study of estimating parameters in a signal transduction network.

When the reverse bias V is below 12 V, the leakage current is dominated by the variable-range hopping conduction (T<;250K) and Poole-Frenkel emission (T>250K), respectively. As the reverse bias increases (|V|>12V), the space-charge-limited conduction mechanism is responsible for the leakage current. It is found that the leakage current is highly associated with the defects density, as well as the trapping capacity of deep level centers; therefore, the lower leakage current of blue LED is mainly attributed to higher thermal activation energy Ea due to less deep level centers within GaN/InGaN MQWs structures.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2600022","National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2016YFB0400100,2016YFB0400602); Hi-tech Research Project(grant numbers:2014AA032605,2015AA033305); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61274003,61422401,51461135002,61334009); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BY2013077,BK20141320,BE2015111); Solid State Lighting and Energy-Saving Electronics Collaborative Innovation Center; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution; Research Funds from NJU-Yangzhou Institute of Opto-electronics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7543527","GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs);multiple quantum wells (MQWs);(I–V) current-voltage characteristics;reverse leakage current","Light emitting diodes;Leakage currents;Green products;Gallium nitride;Temperature distribution;Temperature measurement","","9","","16","OAPA","15 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The structure is based on a multimode optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) and two cascaded Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs). A drive source signal is modulated by the MZM1, which is biased at the minimum transmission point (MITP); the generated first-order sidebands are injected into the multimode OEO, which is contributed by the MZM2, the single-mode fiber, the photodetector, and the amplifier. The third-order sidebands are generated by the MZM2, which is also biased at the MITP. The modulated signal is then divided into reflection components and transmission components by a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The reflection components, including the first-order sidebands, are sent to the photodetector and fed back to the MZM2 to form an optoelectronic hybrid loop. The transmission components, including the third-order sidebands, are heterodyned by another photodetector to generate a frequency-sextupled signal. Compared with the drive signal, the generated signal has a lower PN due to the selection of the oscillation mode. In the experiment, a frequency-sextupled signal from 15 to 24 GHz is generated by a drive signal, which is tuned from 2.5 to 4 GHz. The PN of the generated signal at 24 GHz is -103.6 dBc/Hz@10 kHz; 14.6 dB PN reduction is realized.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2592358","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61174199,61371121); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2012M521848,2014M552574); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(grant numbers:BK20120509,BK20150715); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7526299","Microwave photonics;optoelectronic oscillator (OEO);frequency sextupled;phase noise (PN);microwave generation","Amplitude modulation;Microwave oscillators;Optical variables measurement;Microwave photonics;Optical fibers","","9","","45","OAPA","29 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Designing good micromanagement is a challenging task for AI bot developers. In this paper, we address the micromanagement subtask of positioning units effectively in combat situations. Two different approaches are evaluated, one based on potential fields and the other based on flocking algorithms. The results show that both the potential fields version and the flocking version clearly increases the win percentage of the bot, but the difference in wins between the two is minimal.

It is found that the light absorption at 400-650 nm in the active layer is strongly improved, compared with the standard structure without metallic grating. The underlying physical mechanism is due to the surface plasmon resonance and the interaction between two neighbor gratings, which undoubtedly enhances the electrical properties such as short-circuit current (JSC), fill factor, and power conversion efficiency.

Recently, 1700 nm has been demonstrated as a promising excitation window for deeper penetration. Signal depletion is currently the limiting factor for imaging depth at the 1700-nm window in MPM. As a result, efficient signal detection is an effective means to further boost imaging depth. GaAsP and GaAs photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are commonly used for signal detection in MPM. Here, we demonstrate a comparison investigation of signal detection of a GaAsP and a GaAs PMT for several modalities of MPM at 1700 nm. The two PMTs are identical in structure, connected to the same electronics, and mounted at exactly the same place in the microscope, facilitating a fair comparison. Our results show that with a 1667-nm excitation, GaAsP PMT is more efficient for signal detection of a 3-photon fluorescence of quantum dot Qtracker 655, third-harmonic generation signal, and a 4-photon fluorescence of fluorescein, whereas GaAs PMT is far superior in detecting a second-harmonic generation signal. The measured results are in good agreement with theoretical calculations based on wavelength-dependent cathode radiant sensitivities.

The proposed SFBT-UOA employs a 2 × 2 optical switch to enable the time-division-multiplexed time signals for both directions to pass through the same UOA in different time slots. The bidirectional delay symmetry is guaranteed to the maximum extent by allowing the time signals to be transmitted back and forth using the same wavelength over a single fiber. Meanwhile, the noises suffered in the systems employing single fiber bidirectional optical amplifiers (SF-BOAs), such as double Rayleigh backscattering, are effectively suppressed. Consequently, high-precision fiber-optic time transfer can be implemented over ultralong distance by adopting the proposed SFBT-UOAs. Moreover, the SFBT-UOA can support the conventional network services via wavelength division multiplexings (WDMs) and, therefore, offers the potential to perform high-precision time transfer over long-haul commercial fiber links. Over 6000 km, the measured time deviations of fiber-optic time transfer in the laboratory are less than 190 ps/s and 61 ps/105 s, respectively.

RTN/WDF causes jitters in switch timing and is a major challenge to low power circuits. In addition to RTN/WDF, devices also age. The interaction between RTN/WDF and aging is of importance and not fully understood. Some researchers reported aging increasing RTN/WDF, while others showed RTN/WDF being hardly affected by aging. The objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of hot carrier aging (HCA) on the RTN/WDF of nMOSFETs. For devices of average RTN/WDF, it is found that the effect of HCA is generally modest. For devices of abnormally high RTN/WDF, however, for the first time, we report HCA reducing RTN/WDF substantially (>50%).

Lumen maintenance data acquired with this test do not always follow exponential decay, particularly data collected in the first 1000 h or under low-stress (e.g., low temperature) conditions. This deviation from true exponential behavior makes it difficult to use the full data set in models for the estimation of lumen maintenance decay coefficient. As a result, critical information that is relevant to the early life or low-stress operation of LED light sources may be missed. We present an efficiency-decay model approach, where all lumen maintenance data can be used to provide an alternative estimate of the decay rate constant. The approach considers a combined model wherein one part describes an initial “break-in” period and another part describes the decay in lumen maintenance. During the break-in period, several mechanisms within the LED can act to produce a small (typically <; 10%) increase in luminous flux. The effect of the break-in period and its longevity is more likely to be present at low-ambient temperatures and currents, where the discrepancy between a standard TM-21 approach and our proposed model is the largest. For high temperatures and currents, the difference between the estimates becomes nonsubstantial. Our approach makes use of all the collected data and avoids producing unrealistic estimates of the decay coefficient.","1558-2574","","10.1109/TDMR.2016.2584926","United States Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-EE0005124); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552479","Light-emitting diodes (LEDs);lumen maintenance;efficiency-decay model","Mathematical model;Light emitting diodes;Maintenance engineering;Data models;Light sources;Fitting;Protocols","","8","","8","OAPA","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main focus was on the peak spatial average SAR (psSAR) in the head, which is the relevant quantity for assessing compliance with national and international exposure limits for mobile phones. Morris et al. criticized this paper for not accurately presenting the conclusions of the studies that it reviewed, despite the fact that these conclusions were summarized in this paper by quoting the original authors. However, their critique reflects a simple misreading of our paper and confusion about different metrics of exposure. A second critique, by Gandhi, noted age- and gender-related differences in the absorption of RF energy in the head. We agree with his comments, if they are interpreted as referring to the psSAR in the brain (which is different from the psSAR for the head as a whole and is not used for compliance assessment).

Inspired by the idea of spatial data mining, the classification method applies nuclear field to depicting the distribution information of pulse samples in feature space, and digs out the hidden cluster information by analyzing distribution characteristics. In addition, a membership-degree criterion to quantify the correlation among all classes is established, which ensures classification accuracy of signal samples.

Generally, conventional PID methods are used to achieve the basic control requirement in wide industrial applications, however its inherent operating principle limits its use on suspending control of BLSRM. In this paper, the suspending force system, which is separately controlled from torque system, is built based on an adaptive fuzzy PID controller to limit the rotor eccentric displacement with proper generation of radial force. When compared with a system adopted using conventional PID method for suspending force control, the proposed adaptive fuzzy PID method has superior performance in shortening the response time, reducing the maximum eccentric displacement error and higher speed range of operation due to its online self-turning of controller parameters. Both in simulation and experimental cases, comparison of results of the above two methods validates the effectiveness of the adaptive fuzzy PID controller for BLSRM drive system.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2016.7933127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933127","BLSRM;suspending force control;conventional PID controller;adaptive fuzzy PID","","","7","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

The 1-D PC-NBF consists of a simple 1-D PC nanobeam waveguide, in which the bulk air-hole grating radii are kept the same. The 1-D PC-NCS consists of a common 1-D PC nanobeam cavity, in which the air-hole grating radius is parabolically tapered from center to end. By using the 3-D finite-difference time-domain (3-D-FDTD) method, the proposed 1-D PC-NBF with an effective low-pass bandgap ranging from 1533 to 1785 nm (with width > 250 nm) is demonstrated, where the resonant wavelengths lying in the bandgap are not guided. Then, by connecting an additional 1-D PC-NBF to a 1-D PC-NCS in series, a transmission spectrum only containing the specific fundamental mode of the 1-D PC nanobeam cavity for sensing purposes is created, while the other high-order modes are filtered out. Moreover, the additional 1-D PC-NBF has no influence on the properties (e.g., Q-factor, resonance position, and sensitivity) of the fundamental resonant mode of 1-D PC-NCS. In particular, the footprint of the proposed 1-D PC nanobeam integrated sensor is ultracompact around 0.7 μm × 10 μm, which is improved more than three orders of magnitude compared with the integrated sensor devices based on 2-D PC. Thus, the method presented here is promising to build highly parallel integrated sensor arrays for lab-on-a-chip applications and accurate detections.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2536942","NSFC(grant numbers:61501053,61471050); National 973 Program(grant numbers:2012CB315705); Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications(grant numbers:IPOC2015ZC03); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (BUPT), China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422659","Integrated nanophotonic;Optical interconnect;Photonic crystals;Integrated nanophotonic;optical interconnect;photonic crystals;sensors;bandgap filters;3-D-finite-difference time-domain (3-D-FDTD)","Cavity resonators;Photonic band gap;Gratings;Sensors;Silicon;Nanoscale devices;Band-pass filters","","7","","34","OAPA","1 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To meet the commercial requirements, the brightness of QD-LEDs needs to be further improved. In this work, we propose multilayer heterostructures on a SiO2 substrate, which provides multiple reflective bands with the very high reflective efficiency of nearly up to 100%. Electric field distributes mostly in the superficial layer. The proposed structure provides highly multiband reflection covering the emission peaks of QDs in LEDs; hence, it can eventually enhance QDs' fluorescence and enhance the brightness of QD-LEDs. We investigate four typical emission wavelengths, mainly aiming for red QD-LEDs and infrared QD-LEDs, which correspond to the applications of displays, infrared illumination, optical communication, and so on. The total reflection bands can be adjusted according to practical requirements by tuning the thickness of every layer. One fabrication procedure can be used for different kinds of QDs or the same kind of QD with different sizes without changing their processing properties. The proposed structure has fewer flat layers compared with 1-D photonic crystals, which leads to lower cost and easier fabrications.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2530561","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61307069,61401035,11304219,51402261,61575138); Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province, China(grant numbers:2013021017-3); Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(grant numbers:20131402120018); Program for the Outstanding Innovative Teams of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi; Excellent Young Scientist Foundation; Qualified Personnel Foundation of Taiyuan University of Technology(grant numbers:2014YQ012,tyut-rc201203b); Open Fund of IPOC (BUPT)(grant numbers:IPOC2013A001); Open Fund of Top priority disciplines in colleges and universities in Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2015KF20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7407289","hetero-structure;multilayer;enhance;QD-LEDs;emission;Hetero-structure;multilayer;enhance;quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs);emission","Reflection;Electric fields;Silicon;Brightness;Fabrication;Quantum dots;Substrates","","7","","19","OAPA","15 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the offline processing, the virtual ULA of the MIMO sonar is thinned to a virtual SLA by the simulated annealing algorithm, and matched filters corresponding to inactive virtual elements are removed. In the online processing, outputs of matched filters corresponding to active elements are collected for further multibeam processing and hence, the number of matched filters in the echo processing procedure is effectively reduced.

The proposed RRECT CA algorithm minimizes the dispersion of constant with respect to a rectangular-shaped zero error contour. The algorithm exploits the geometry of the RQAM to correct phase error within 180°, thus enhancing the convergence rate while minimizing the equalizer mis-adjustments. On the other hand, the proposed IRCA algorithm employs the estimated output from the decision device into the cost function, thus guiding the equalizer output to reside on multiple zero error rectangular shaped moduli. This method of feeding back the slicer output further reduces the mis-adjustment between the transmitted constellation and the new cost function in an efficient manner, which leads to faster convergence and better intersymbol interference suppression. The proposed algorithms can also work for the square QAM by mere change of only two constellation dependent constants, thus facilitating the implementation in hardware to enable transmission of both even and odd number of bits per symbol based constellations. Steady-state error analysis, MSE, and residual ISI comparison through the simulation results confirm the good performance of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, the convergence characteristics of the proposed IRCA scheme establish the supremacy of IRCA over RRECTCA, which is its parent algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2639538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7790854","Blind equalization;quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM);rectangular QAM;cross QAM;mean square error (MSE);inter symbol interference (ISI)","Quadrature amplitude modulation;Blind equalizers;Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Steady-state;Constellation diagram","","6","","19","OAPA","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper modifies the traditional acquisition algorithms and proposes a new weak GNSS signal acquisition method using re-scaling and adaptive stochastic resonance (SR). The adoption of classical SR is limited to low-frequency and periodic signals. Given that GNSS signal frequency is high and that the periodic feature of the GNSS signal is affected by the Doppler frequency shift, classical SR methods cannot be directly used to acquire GNSS signals. Therefore, the re-scaling technique is used in our study to expand its usage to high-frequency signals and adaptive control technique is used to gradually determine the Doppler shift effect in GNSS signal buried in strong noises. The effectiveness of our proposed method was verified by the simulations on GPS L1 signals. The simulation results indicate that the new algorithm based on SR can reach – 181 dBW sensitivity with a very short data length of 1 ms.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2016.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514416","weak signal detection;global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal acquisition;stochastic resonance","Global Positioning System;Doppler effect;Stochastic resonance;Signal to noise ratio;Sensitivity;Resonant frequency","","6","","","","21 Jul 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs) can dramatically improve the dynamic and static performance of the motion system. However, as one of the most critical sources of error, the thrust ripple of linear motors can deteriorate performance and even excite the mechanical resonance. Thrust ripple suppression technology had received broad interest and has been researched extensively. Therefore, this paper summarizes different types of thrust ripple suppression methods and their principles are analyzed in detail. Firstly, structural optimization methods are introduced to suppress the thrust ripple and increase the precision of the thrust. Secondly, control methods are described to decrease the velocity fluctuation caused by the thrust ripple. Thirdly, a combination of structural design and control method is presented to compensate the ripple, meaning high order harmonic components are eliminated by permanent magnets (PM) skewing technology and low order harmonic are compensated by a linearization observer. Finally, conclusions are made regarding thrust ripple suppression technology and the future trend is proposed.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2016.7933117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933117","Linear motor;thrust ripple;structural optimization;control method","","","6","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Hybrid cybernetic models (HCMs) in combination with elementary modes (EMs) are a tool to model cellular metabolism. However, HCM is limited to reduced metabolic networks because of the computational burden of calculating EMs. In this letter, we develop the hybrid cybernetic modeling with flux balance analysis (HCM-FBA) technique, which uses flux balance solutions instead of EMs to dynamically model metabolism. We show that HCM-FBA has comparable performance to HCM for a proof of concept metabolic network and for a reduced anaerobic E. coli network. Next, HCM-FBA is applied to a larger metabolic network of aerobic E. coli metabolism, which was infeasible for HCM (29 FBA modes versus more than 153 000 EMs). The global sensitivity analysis further reduces the number of FBA modes required to describe the aerobic E. coli data, while maintaining model fit. Thus, HCM-FBA is a promising alternative to HCM for large networks, where the generation of EMs is infeasible.","2332-7685","","10.1109/LLS.2016.2644649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797204","Cybernetic models;flux balance analysis (FBA);metabolic models","Biochemistry;Biological system modeling;Analytical models;Sugar;Cybernetics;Computational modeling;Extracellular","","6","","21","OAPA","23 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then Hough transform is employed to estimate the parameter of the targets. The proposed algorithm has the following advantages: Compared with the Wigner-Hough transform method, the computational complexity of the sparse optimization is low due to the application of fast Fourier transform (FFT). And the computational cost of Hough transform is also greatly reduced because of the sparsity of the time-frequency distribution. Compared with the high order ambiguity function (HAF) method, the proposed method improves in terms of precision and robustness to noise. Simulation results show that compared with the HAF method, the required SNR and relative mean square error are 8 dB lower and 50 dB lower respectively in the proposed method. While processing the field experiment data, the execution time of Hough transform in the proposed method is only 4% of the Wigner-Hough transform method.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2016.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514684","over-the-horizon radar (OTHR);maneuvering target;parameter estimation;sparse time-frequency transform;Hough transform","Time-frequency analysis;Transforms;Radar;Frequency estimation;Optimization;Signal to noise ratio","","6","","","","21 Jul 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

This paper presents Cyclic Power-Gating (CPG), a novel power management strategy where the power consumption of a core can be finely controlled without scaling the supply voltage. CPG builds on state-retentive power-gating which allows the power supply to a core to be switched off and on again at high speed (tens of clock cycles) with minimal disruption to running programs. The power-gating is cyclic, by altering the ratio of time spent powered-on and off in each power-gating period the effective operating frequency and power consumption of a core can be controlled. The overheads in delay and power consumption of CPG for an out-of-order core in a 14 nm technology are accurately modelled and compared to the performance and power consumption of Voltage/Frequency pairs in the same technology. The proposed power gating method reduces average power consumption by 4 percent over voltage and frequency scaling with only a 2 percent degradation in performance.","1556-6064","","10.1109/LCA.2015.2478784","EPSRC(grant numbers:DOME EP/J016330/1,PAMELA EP/K008730/1); Royal Society University Research Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7265016","Power efficient design;leakage reduction;power management;state-retentive power-gating","Power demand;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Voltage measurement;Capacitance;Energy efficiency","","5","","13","CCBY","14 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing research has worked on this, but has primarily focused on maximizing the revenue of the Internet service provider. In this paper, we consider energy-aware virtual network embedding, which aims at minimizing the energy consumption for embedding virtual networks in a substrate network. In our optimization model, we consider energy consumption of both links and nodes. We propose an efficient heuristic to assign virtual nodes to appropriate substrate nodes based on priority, where existing activated nodes have higher priority for hosting newly arrived virtual nodes. In addition, our proposed algorithm can take advantage of activated links for embedding virtual links so as to minimize total energy consumption.

In EEMD, the correlation coefficient of each intrinsic mode function (IMF) is calculated, and a characteristic parameter (CP) is introduced to recognize and remove the IMFs of noisy components. The remaining IMFs are used to reconstruct a new signal followed by EMD to extract the interference term. An experiment based on distributed polarization coupling detection in polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) was conducted; the PMFs having different lengths and coupling intensities were investigated. It was shown that by setting an appropriate CP, the interference term could be automatically extracted. The relative errors of the extracted coupling intensity were less than 2%.

And Luby transform (LT) codes are the first codes fully realizing the digital fountain concept. However, in conventional LT encoding/decoding algorithms, due to the imperfect coverage (IC) of input symbols and short cycles in the generator matrix, stopping sets would occur and terminate the decoding. Thus, the recovery probability is reduced, high coding overhead is required and decoding delay is increased. These issues would be disadvantages while applying LT codes in underwater acoustic communication. Aimed at solving those issues, novel encoding/decoding algorithms are proposed. First, a doping and non-uniform selecting (DNS) encoding algorithm is proposed to solve the IC and the generation of short cycles problems. And this can reduce the probability of stopping sets occur during decoding. Second, a hybrid on the fly Gaussian elimination and belief propagation (OFG-BP) decoding algorithm is designed to reduce the decoding delay and efficiently utilize the information of stopping sets.

By assuming that the scattering potential of the medium suffices the multi-Gaussian profile, it is shown that the degree of red-shifted spectrum of scattered field can be modulated by changing the summation index and effective radius of the scatterer. Moreover, the spectral switch, which transforms from the red shifts to the blue shifts of the spectrum, can emerge when the effective radius is sufficiently small compared with the incident wavelength. In addition, the summation index is another factor influencing the degree of spectral switches of near-zone scattered fields.

Their junction temperature ranks as one of the most important factors in the reliability of power semiconductor devices. Thermo-sensitive electrical parameter (TSEP) is regarded as the promising solution to extract the junction temperature due to its non-invasion measurement, fast response and high accuracy. However, accurate collector current measurement is required if only the individual TSEP is adopted, which increases the complexity and cost. In this paper, the combined TSEP method is proposed to eliminate the influence of collector current (IC), where the turn-off delay time (tdoff) and maximum decrease rate of IC(max dIC/dt) are adopted and combined. The two TSEPs both have linear relationships with junction temperature and IC. When they are combined mathematically, the influence of IC is eliminated. Experiments have been implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The comparison between combined TSEP and two individual TSEP methods are illustrated and analyzed.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2016.7933118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933118","Junction temperature;thermo-sensitive electrical parameter;non-invasiveness;online application","","","5","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

To gather such information, testing and accurate loss quantification is needed. Previous methods for measuring magnetic core loss are either only suitable for sinusoidal wave excitations or cannot separate winding loss from inductor loss. In addition, existing loss measurement approaches on the newly introduced GaN transistors are not satisfactory. In this paper, we present a new method to distinguish winding loss from inductor loss under practical excitations. This method utilizes a converter to generate the actual excitation waveforms and uses a calorimetric setup to quantify the losses. By splitting up the inductor in a converter into an air-core inductor and a magnetic-core inductor, both equipped with exactly the same winding structure, the air-core inductor loss can be used as the reference of the magnetic-core inductor winding loss. In this way, losses in the magnetic core can be determined in the actual operating condition of a converter in which the inductor is to be used. Moreover, a simple calorimetric approach for obtaining loss information of GaN transistors are is also presented. Both methods require simple setup and are easy and convenient to execute. The methods work well in assessing different high frequency magnetic core materials and measuring losses in GaN transistors at 1MHz.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2016.7933128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933128","Core loss measurement;practical excitation;high frequency magnetic material;practical excitation;transistor loss measurement;calorimetric method","Erbium","","5","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

To analyze such waveguides, a uniform-accumulation layer model is usually used. In this model, the ITO layer is treated as a stack of a layer with untuned permittivity and a layer with permittivity tuned by driving voltage, which is called an accumulation layer. However, rigorous analysis requires a gradient-index layer model in which the ITO layer is treated as a layer with a continuously varying permittivity distribution. It is necessary to check whether the uniform-accumulation layer model results in correct analysis in comparison with the gradient-index layer model. This paper analyzes an ITO-based MIM-type slot waveguide using the two models. Compared with the analysis based on the gradient-index layer model, the analysis based on the uniform-accumulation layer model becomes incorrect if the driving voltage is large, particularly when it is around the value for which the real part of the accumulation layer permittivity is equal to zero. Therefore, this paper shows that the uniform-accumulation layer model should be used just for small driving voltage with the accumulation layer thickness determined appropriately. This paper may correct misunderstanding of the properties of ITO-based slot waveguides.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2508421","Basic Science Research Program; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2013R1A1A2A10062227); 2015 Research Fund(grant numbers:1.150123); UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology).; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7355276","Waveguides;waveguide devices;optical properties of photonic materials;Waveguides;waveguide devices;optical properties of photonic materials","Indium tin oxide;Optical waveguides;Analytical models;Mathematical model;Hafnium compounds;Refractive index;Dielectric constant","","5","","17","OAPA","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A fiber-pigtailed acousto-optic modulator was used to carve the pulse train into pulse bursts so that the peak power of the final linearly polarized fiber laser output could be optimized by adjusting the duty cycle of the pulse bursts correspondingly. The output of the fiber laser was directed to pump a periodically poled magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate-based optical parametric oscillator through the quasi-synchronized pump scheme. Efficient parametric conversion was realized with a maximum average power output of 7.3 W at 3.8 μm under pump power of 45 W at 1.064 μm with pump-to-idler conversion efficiency exceeding 16%.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2564445","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11304277,61405174,61505236); Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:2015C33160); Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:Y200907362); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2015FZA5005,2016QNA5002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7468517","Optical fiber lasers;optical parametric oscillators (OPOs);periodically poled magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate (PPMgLN);quasi-synchronously pumping;Optical fiber lasers;optical parametric oscillators (OPOs);periodically poled magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate (PPMgLN);quasi-synchronously pumping","Optical fiber amplifiers;Optical fiber polarization;Optical fiber couplers;Laser excitation;Power amplifiers;Power generation","","4","","21","OAPA","11 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One promising therapeutic use is the permanent destruction of nerves non-invasively in patients with severe spasticity or certain types of pain (e.g., phantom limb pain). To this end, HIFU requires ultrasound guidance, which allows the non-invasive, target-specific deposition of thermal energy to the targeted nerve, thereby blocking axonal conduction. In this paper, a composite system comprising both ultrasound-imaging and HIFU therapy was developed and used to induce localized non-invasive nerve blockage in an in vivo large animal study. Five pigs were used with the femoral nerve as the target. Calibrated needle thermocouples inserted at the target site were employed to monitor the target tissue temperature. The degree of nerve blockage was assessed by measuring compound action potential (CAP) signal with a clinical nerve electrophysiology system before and after HIFU exposures. An average CAP signal amplitude reduction of 49% of baseline with a standard deviation of 9% was observed after 20-30 min post exposure. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed ultrasound-guided HIFU modality as a potential non-invasive nerve ablation method.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2016.2581811","Ontario Research Fund–Research Excellence Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7562404","CAP measurement;non-invasive nerve ablation;porcine femoral nerve;ultrasound-guided HIFU","Ultrasonic imaging;Transducers;Temperature measurement;Lesions;Imaging;Medical treatment;Animals","","4","","16","OAPA","7 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is difficult to satisfy various of compensation quality and time of the voltage sag by using single compensation method. Furthermore, high-power consumption of the phase jump compensation increases the size and cost of a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR). Methods & Results: In order to improve the compensating efficiency of DVR, an optimized compensation strategy is proposed for voltage sag of micro-grid caused by interconnection and sensitive loads. The proposed compensation strategy increases the supporting time for long voltage sags. Discussion: Firstly, the power flow and the maximum compensation time of DVR are analyzed using three basic compensation strategies. Then, the phase jump is corrected by pre-sag compensation. And a quadratic transition curve, which involves the injected voltage phases of pre-sag strategy and minimum energy strategy, is used to transform pre-sag compensation to minimum energy compensation of DVR. Conclusions: The transition utilizes the storage system to reduce the rate of discharge. As a result, the proposed strategy increases the supporting time for long voltage sags. The analytical study shows that the presented method significantly increases compensation time of DVR. The simulation results performed by MATLAB/SIMULINK also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-016-0018-9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10366242","Micro-grid;Voltage sag;Dynamic voltage restorer;Compensation time;Optimized compensation strategy","Voltage fluctuations;Simulation;Power quality;Transforms;Power system stability;Mathematical models;Discharges (electric)","","4","","16","","20 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

Sources of error are introduced in each step of the provision of land surface albedo products, whereby this letter intends to investigate sources of error introduced by the narrow-band-to-broad-band conversion formula step. The radiative transfer modeling of vegetation is used to simulate spectral albedo over complex 3-D vegetation canopies; then narrow-band-to-broad-band conversion formulas for numerous sensors are applied on the spectral albedo to compute the broad-band albedo (BBA), and the accuracy of formulas is investigated.

Such systems require the use of a “subtractor” to generate an error signal that captures the difference between the current and desired values of the process output. Unfortunately, standard implementations of the subtraction operator using chemical reaction networks are one sided, i.e., they cannot produce negative error signals. Previous attempts to deal with this problem by representing signals as the difference in concentrations of two different biomolecular species lead to a doubling of the number of chemical reactions required to generate the circuit, hence sharply increasing the difficulty of experimental implementations and limiting the complexity of potential designs. Here, we propose an alternative approach that introduces a degradation term into the classical proportion–integral (PI) control scheme.

The power network is further divided into a high-voltage main network and several subnets according to voltage levels of 220 kV. The subnets are connected by means of boundary nodes, and the partition model is solved using the improved approximate Newton direction method, which achieves complete dynamic decoupling simply by exchanging boundary variables between the main network and the subnets. A largescale power grid thus is decomposed into many subnets, making the solution of the problem simpler and faster while helping to protect the information of individual subnets.

The divided power corresponds to a height difference, i.e., to provide uniformity, the power to the corresponding height difference ratio is constant. The ray passing through the boundary of each part is regarded as the incident ray that would be refracted to run parallel to the optical axis through a piece of surface designed for implementing collimation.

By normalizing the membership matrix elements based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model, all the values of the matrix elements are restrained in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, hence the complexity of the calculations is reduced. Vector similarity is used to determine the expert weights which reflect the knowledge and experience of the experts.

When the faults in the system appear, it is difficult to observe the fault isolation between the actuator and the component. In order to diagnose the component fault in the nonlinear systems, a novel strategy is proposed. The nonlinear state equation with only the component system is built on mathematical equations. The nonlinearity of the component equation is expanded and estimated with Taylor series. If the actuator is perfect, the anomaly of the state equations reflects the component fault. The fault feature index is defined to detect the component fault and the initial fault. The numerical examples of the component faults are simulated for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. The results show that the component faults, as well as the incipient faults, can be detected. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified.

The superchannel is composed by eight subchannels with low-level modulation format, i.e., polarization multiplexed (PM)-quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). The use of low-order modulation format guarantees better robustness in terms of optical-signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) and reduced complexity with respect to higher order formats.

The results show that spectral broadening can be attributed to interpulse soliton collisions. By selecting an appropriate time interval for the two pulses, the spectral bandwidth can be effectively extended. Using two closely spaced pumping pulses, each having a peak power of 100 W, the width of the supercontinuum (SC) spectrum is increased by a maximum of 232.2 nm (measured at  $-$30 dB) compared with the spectral width obtained with a single pump pulse of the same peak power.

Distinguishing features of the variance of the number of injected electrons ( $\sigma _{n}^{2} $ ) into the floating gate are observed.

In this scheme, a DFB laser without an isolator is the key component, which costs less than the nonlinear devices required in other schemes. The spectrum output from the DFB laser can be broadened after the pulses injected to the laser cavity, which is induced by the XGM effect. Only the correct codes that have enough peak power will be able to broaden the spectrum of the DFB laser, while the low-power noise cannot. By offset filtering the broadened parts of the optical spectrum, the correct optical pulse is acquired, while the undesired noise is diminished. In this scheme, an injection power of 7 dBm is enough to generate the XGM effect, which is much lower than most of the existing schemes. In addition, as the DFB laser is used as the pump laser as well as the nonlinear medium, this scheme is more compact and low cost compared with the schemes proposed before.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2522082","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2012CB315603); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61032005,61177065,61174199,61504170); Jiangsu Province Science Foundation Council(grant numbers:BK20140069); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393448","microwave photonics;semiconductor lasers;nonlinear;pulse propagation;Microwave photonics;semiconductor lasers;nonlinear;pulse propagation","Optical pulses;Optical filters;Nonlinear optics;Adaptive optics;Optical amplifiers;Optical pumping;Optical attenuators","","3","","14","OAPA","26 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The received signal strength levels between legitimate users are used to exchange the secret key that produces the random rotations at the receiver. This is possible due to the availability of short-term reciprocity of the radio channel. Both signal and space rotation angles are chosen such that the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the transmit signal is not increased. Firstly, we show that the rotation of the codeword alone compromises system security under receive diversity, especially when the eavesdropper is close to the legitimate user. Then, through the analysis of mutual information rate and bit error rate, we show that by the addition of signal rotation, it is possible to reduce the capacity of the eavesdropper to zero, even when receive diversity is enhanced.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8532259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532259","Alamouti scheme;secure signal and space;secret key;wireless communications","Constellation diagram;Security;Transmitting antennas;Slot antennas;Receiving antennas;Fading channels","","3","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

For the same reason, the effects of unintended shape deviations are usually excluded from the optimization processes, even though they may be of particular importance for the final design. Perturbative methods offer an efficient approach to tackle this issue. They allow the computation of the eigenmodes and the derived cavity performance parameters for a vast number of cavity designs based on one initial design. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of perturbative methods for performance optimization and simultaneous consideration of the shape variations of a multicell structure.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2015.2487542","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung(grant numbers:05K13HR1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293219","Electromagnetic Fields;Perturbative Methods;Numerical Simulation;Cavity Resonators;Design Optimization;Cavity resonators;design optimization;electromagnetic fields;numerical simulation;perturbative methods","Shape;Cavity resonators;Iris;Optimization;Acceleration;Licenses;Particle beams","","3","","10","CCBY","6 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By far, the most famous and popular frequency conversion approach is cascaded third-harmonic-generation (THG), which is composed of two steps: a phase-matching (PM) second-harmonic-generation, followed by a PM sum-frequency-generation. Correspondingly, two nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are required. Theoretically, THG could be realized by utilizing only one crystal, as long as the frequency conversion processes occur at similar PM orientations and the polarization matching problem is solved. In this paper, we realized this approach by using one GdxY1-xCOB crystal; an ultrawide angular acceptance was observed because the SHG process was noncritical phase matching, thereby providing the advantages of large angular acceptance and freedom from beam walk-off as the optimum PM approach in the NLO domain. Compared to the traditional cascaded THG configuration that requires two crystals, this configuration possesses the advantages of small volume, compactness, and low cost, all of which are favorable for practical applications.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2619069","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61178060,51202129,91022034); Independent Innovation Foundation of Shandong University(grant numbers:2011GN056); Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholar of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2012JQ18); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7600362","Third-harmonic-generation;nonlinear optics;GdxY1-xCOB crystal;ultraviolet laser.","Crystals;Frequency conversion;Optical harmonic generation;Optical polarization;Laser beams;Nonlinear optics;Optical reflection","","2","","28","OAPA","19 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The device consists of a Cartesian to log-polar coordinate converter and an inverse converter. The rotated angle can be freely tuned by adjusting the first coordinate converter. In particular, the image rotator is dynamically programmable and continuously tunable if spatial light modulators or digital micromirror devices are employed.

The results of recent studies on the energy demand in CO2 capture process and the costs of CO2 transport and CO2 storage in air capture are analyzed in this paper. Considering renewable energy will not produce additional CO2 in the process of utilization, the electric energy in CO2 capture process of air capture driven by wind energy is different from that of carbon capture and storage. Taking externalities of renewable energy into account, the trading price of CO2 emission is taken to assess the cost of electric energy in CO2 capture of air capture driven by wind energy.

Thus, lots of promising applications realized in metallic films can now be migrated onto integrated waveguides in an ultracompact way. Comparing the characteristics of the proposed integrated device and the conventional periodic structure, we reveal the nature of the unexpected transmission spectrum. Based on this principle, a collinear broadband (~500 nm) polarizer with extinction ratio of >17.8 dB is proposed, with an ultrashort length of 450 nm.

This paper aims to address the problem by developing a management model for establishing a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). A design science-based approach has been selected for the overall project. However, the current paper reports on the first three activities in design science research: identifying the problem, listing solution objectives, and designing and developing a model. A comprehensive literature review serves two purposes: to confirm the problem and to provide a structured way of revealing the requirement areas. Following the uncovering of the requirement areas, CSIRT business requirements and services are introduced, before exploring the relationships between the areas using argumentation. This culminates in the development of the management model in two parts: a strategic view and a tactical view. The strategic view comprises the business requirements and “higher” level decisions – the environment, constituency and funding considerations – that need to be made when establishing a CSIRT. The tactical view follows by presenting the “how” considerations. Together, these two views provide an holistic model for establishing a CSIRT by parties interested in doing so.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8531544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531544","CSIRT;CERT;establishing requirements;building;incident response team;cyber security team;security operations centre;information security capability;management model","Computational modeling;Computer security;Buildings;Internet","","2","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

This is inspiring researchers and developers to propose new solutions capable to address a number of challenges, particularly those related to power system operation. A massive penetration of asynchronously connected renewable energy generation, the generation connected over inverters, is significantly changing the dynamics of modern power systems. From one hand, the power system response time is becoming shorter and at the same time the fault level is becoming smaller. This is significantly affecting requirements of control loops, as well as power system protection. Utilization of modern sensor and communication technology looks to be the critical technological enabler for addressing the mentioned challenges. In this context, development of Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control (WAMPAC) systems, based on Synchronized Measurement Technology represented by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), looks to be a part of the solution.

The Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model (J-A model), which is widely used in digital simulations, can accurately describe the hysteresis and saturation process of the core characteristics; however, to acquire the parameters of the J-A model of current transformers in practical use is still a challenging problem. In this paper, physical tests based on a practical CT and parameter identification are presented to solve the problem. The basic hysteresis loops of P, PR, and TPY class of practical current transformers are obtained through physical tests. Thus, the J-A model parameters are identified using a hybrid genetic/simulated annealing algorithm, based on which transient simulation models of different class CTs are constructed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via dynamic physical simulation tests.

In addition, the grating groove depth can be roughly evaluated, in which the zeroth order is well restrained for transverse electric (TE) polarization. By using numerical optimization for rigorous coupled-wave analysis, some of exact parameters of grating are obtained. On the basis of the precise numerical results, the diffraction efficiencies in the first order and in the zeroth order for TE polarization and TM polarization are enhanced, respectively.

In particular, ordinary differential equations are frequently used to model the dynamics of the interacting states, e.g., molecular species in cell signaling pathways. The equations typically contain many unknown parameters, such as reaction rates and initial conditions, but also time-dependent parameters, i.e., input functions driving the system. Both are a priori unknown and need to be estimated from experimental, time-resolved data. Here, we discuss an application of indirect optimal control methods for input estimation and parameter estimation in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Whereas the direct identification and quantification of different active mTOR complexes, e.g., mTOR complex  $\textit {2}$  (mTORC2), is only possible by highly challenging experiments, the mathematical framework allows to reconstruct its dynamics by solving an appropriate Euler–Lagrange equation based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle. The inherently large search space underlying this approach allows to test specific biological hypotheses about the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) by mTORC2 and to reject an alternative model with high statistical power. Hereby, we identify a minimal model that has AKT threonine phosphorylation as a prerequisite for serine phosphorylation by mTORC2. Based on this model, the activation of mTORC2 is predicted to be inhibited by drugs, targeting the receptors of the ERBB receptor family.","2332-7685","","10.1109/LLS.2016.2615081","MIP-DILI Project(grant numbers:115336); BreastSys Project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:0315396B); German Research Foundation; Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in the funding program Open Access Publishing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7740930","Cancer;optimal control;parameter estimation","Mathematical model;Parameter estimation;Life sciences;Drugs;Estimation;Optimal control;Uncertainty","","2","","14","CCBY","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we propose a novel partitioning strategy for mining link patterns in large-scale linked data, in which linked data is partitioned according to edge-labeling rules: Edges are grouped into a primary multi-partition according to edge labels. A feedback mechanism is proposed to produce a secondary bi-partition according to a quick mining process. Local discovered link patterns in partitions are then merged into global patterns.

The application of either radio frequency (RF) or cryothermal ablations will alter the biomechanical properties of various cardiac tissues in a differential manner; in some cases, this may be attributable to increased incidences of cardiac tamponade, pulmonary vein stenosis, and/or atrial-esophageal fistula. Thus, a greater understanding of the underlying changes in tissue properties induced by ablative therapies will ultimately promote safer and more efficacious procedures. The effects of applied RF or cryothermal energies on the biomechanical properties of the pulmonary vein, left atrial, or right atrial samples (n=369 ) were examined from fresh excised porcine (n=35) and donated human tissue (n=11). RF ablations were found to reduce the tensile strength of the porcine cardiac specimens (p<;0.05), and a similar trend was noted for human samples. Cryoablations did not have a significant impact on the tissue properties compared with the untreated tissue specimens. Locational and species differences were also observed in this experimental paradigm (p<;0.001). Incorporating these findings into cardiac device design and computational modeling should aid to reduce the risks of complications associated with tissue property changes resulting from cardiac ablative procedures.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2015.2506160","Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7348656","Atrial fibrillation;Biomechanical properties;Cryoablation;Radiofrequency ablation;Atrial fibrillation;biomechanical properties;cryoablation;radiofrequency ablation","Radio frequency;Biomechanics;Veins;Young's modulus;Strain;Medical treatment;Heart","","1","","21","CCBY","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A polarization controller (PC) continuously tunes phase of the recovered microwave signals and ensure its magnitude is constant. Through joint adjusting of the wavelength plates inside the PC before a polarizer, phase of the recovered microwave signal in a frequency range of 1-18 GHz can be fully tuned over 360°. Phase deviation is less than 1.5°. The corresponding magnitude almost remains unchanged. Magnitude deviation is less than 2 dB. Phase drift is less than 4° within 120 s. The motivation of this work lies in the fact that the previously reported MPSs using EOMs are hard to be realized with single modulator without special devices or an optical bandpass filter.

In reality, the diversity of DTs on different viewpoints and scales are very common, which also bring great difficulty to recognize DTs. In the previous studies, due to no considering of the deformable and transient nature of elements in DT, the motion estimation method is based on brightness constancy assumption, which seem inappropriate for aggregate and complex motions. A novel motion model based on relative motion in the neighborhood of two-dimensional motion fields is proposed. The estimation of non-rigid motion of DTs is based on the continuity equation, and then the local vector difference (LVD) is proposed to characterize DT local relative motion. Spatiotemporal statistics of the LVDs is used as the representation of DT sequences.

When there are nonradiative recombination centers on the exposed MQW side walls of the TLs, doping in the MQWs is found to be able to enhance the performance of the TLs by reducing the threshold current and increasing the current gain greatly. With doping in the MQWs, the carrier diffusivity is decreased, making the defects less effective in consuming the carriers. The results show that doping in the MQWs helps to obtain high-quality TLs.

However, the faults occur during a power swing should be detected and cleared promptly. This paper proposes an adaptive concentric power swing blocker (PSB) to overcome incapability of traditional concentric PSB in detecting symmetrical fault during power swing. Based on proposed method, two pairs of concentric characteristics are anticipated which the first one is placed in a stationary position (outer of zone3) but the position of the second pair is adjustable. In order to find the position of the second pair of characteristic, Static Phasor Estimation Error (SPEE) of current signal is utilized in this paper. The proposed method detects the abrupt change in SPEE and puts the second pair of characteristic in location of impedance trajectory correspondingly. Second concentric characteristic records travelling time of impedance trajectory between outer and inner zones and compares to threshold value to detect symmetrical fault during power swing. If recorded time is lower than threshold, three-phase fault is detected during power swing. Intensive studies have been performed and the merit of the method is demonstrated by some test signals simulations.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-016-0026-9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10366391","Concentric PSB;Phasor estimation error;Power swing;Symmetrical fault during power swing","Estimation error;Adaptation models;Power measurement;Impedance measurement;Adaptive systems;Protective relaying;Trajectory","","1","","18","","20 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

In this letter, we developed the first genome-scale modeling approach to systematically investigate the influence of ribosome-targeting antibiotics on the metabolism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An approach for integrating gene expression data with metabolic networks was first developed to identify the metabolic reactions whose fluxes were positively correlated with gene activation levels. The fluxes of these reactions were further constrained via a flux balance analysis to mimic the inhibition of antibiotics on microbial metabolism. It was found that some of metabolic reactions with large flux change, including metabolic reactions for homoserine metabolism, the production of 2-heptyl-4-quinolone, and isocitrate lyase, were confirmed by existing experimental data for their important role in promoting persister cell formation. Metabolites with large exchange-rate change, such as acetate, agmatine, and oxoglutarate, were found important for persister cell formation in previous experiments. The predicted results on the flux change triggered by ribosome-targeting antibiotics can be used to generate hypotheses for future experimental design to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens.","2332-7685","","10.1109/LLS.2017.2652473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7859353","Computational modeling and simulations in biology;flux balance analysis (FBA);persister cells;systems biology","Antibiotics;Gene expression;Correlation;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Proteins","","1","","27","OAPA","20 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The state condition probability is introduced into the HMM modeling process to reduce the effect of uncertain factors. MAGA is used to estimate parameters of LS-SVM. Moreover, pruning algorithms are used to estimate parameters to get the sparse approximation of LS-SVM so as to increase the ranging performance.

However, the unavoidable array errors, consisting of channel gain-phase mismatch and position uncertainty, significantly degrade the performance of such systems. An iteration-free method is proposed to simultaneously estimate position and gain-phase errors. In our research, the steering vectors corresponding to a pair of Doppler bins within the same range bin are studied in terms of their rotational relationships. The method is based on the fact that the rotational matrix only depends on the position errors and the frequency spacing between the paired Doppler bins but is independent of gain-phase error. Upon combining the projection matrices corresponding to the paired Doppler bins, the position errors are directly obtained in terms of extracting the rotational matrix in a least squares framework. The proposed method, when used in conjunction with the self-calibration algorithm, performs stably as well as has less computational load, compared with the conventional methods. Simulations reveal that the proposed method behaves better than the conventional methods even when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2016.04.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7669700","error estimation;multi-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system;array signal processing","Doppler effect;Synthetic aperture radar;Error analysis;Azimuth;Signal to noise ratio;Matrices;Array signal processing","","1","","","","27 Oct 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

India with one million active fishermen population still lacks a reliable boat-to-shore communication network. Fishermen with smaller boat are more vulnerable to the wilder nature of the ocean, due to dynamic sea current, wind speed, direction and wave heights, etc. They form 80% of the entire fishing community. There being no physical boundary, the risk of fishermen accidently getting in other country's terrestrial water, is very high. Hence, the fishermen and their families are always concerned about the safety of the human lives, boat and gears. Due to deep sea communication network we can continuously get oceanic condition information. Such real-time information about wind speed, direction and wave height can help to estimate the risks and avoid the ocean region which seems dangerous. As part of this initiative, we looked at various available communication technologies like VHF transceivers, satellite communication and cellular mobile communication. Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Tata Consultancy Service and Tata Tele Services formed a consortium and piloted a project to extend the mobile signal deep into the sea up to 30 kms. This extended network enabled continuous accessibility of life saving ocean state forecast information provided by INCOIS.

"The Composition of Melts from a Heterogeneous Mantle and the Origin of Ferropicrite: Application of a Thermodynamic Model","E. S. Jennings; T. J. B. Holland; O. Shorttle; J. Maclennan; S. A. Gibson",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Petrology,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","11-12","2289","2310","Evidence for chemical and lithological heterogeneity in the Earth’s convecting mantle is widely acknowledged, yet the major element signature imparted on mantle melts by this heterogeneity is still poorly resolved. In this study, a recent thermodynamic melting model is tested on a range of compositions that correspond to potential mantle lithologies (harzburgitic to pyroxenitic), to demonstrate its applicability over this compositional range, in particular for pyroxenite melting. Our results show that, despite the model’s calibration in peridotitic systems, it effectively reproduces experimental partial melt compositions for both Si-deficient and Si-excess pyroxenites. Importantly, the model accurately predicts the presence of a free silica phase at high pressures in Si-excess pyroxenites, indicating the activation of the pyroxene–garnet thermal divide. This thermal divide has a dominant control on solidus temperature, melt productivity and partial melt composition. The model is used to make new inferences on the link between mantle composition and melting behaviour. In silica-deficient and low-pressure (olivine-bearing) lithologies, melt composition is not very sensitive to source composition. Linearly varying the source composition between peridotite and basaltic pyroxenite, we find that the concentration of oxides in the melt tends to be buffered by the increased stability of more fusible phases, causing partial melts of even highly fertile lithologies to be similar to those of peridotite. An exception to this behaviour is FeO, which is elevated in partial melts of silica-deficient pyroxenite even if the bulk composition does not have a high FeO content relative to peridotite. Melt Al2O3 and MgO vary predominantly as a function of melting depth rather than bulk composition. We have applied the thermodynamic model to test the hypothesis that Fe-rich mantle melts such as ferropicrites are derived by partial melting of Si-deficient pyroxenite at elevated mantle potential temperatures. We show that the conspicuously high FeO in ferropicrites at a given MgO content does not require a high-Fe mantle source and is indeed best matched by model results involving around 0–20% melting of silica-deficient pyroxenite. A pyroxenite source lithology also accounts for the low CaO content of ferropicrites, whereas their characteristic low Al2O3 is a function of their high pressure of formation. Phanerozoic ferropicrites are exclusively located in continental flood basalt (CFB) provinces and this model of formation confirms that lithological heterogeneity (perhaps recycled oceanic crust) is present in CFB mantle sources.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egw065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8181926","pyroxenite;eclogite;ferropicrite;mantle melting;mantle heterogeneity","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

From March 2011 to August 2014, 93 medically inoperable patients with 74 primary lung cancers and 19 lung metastases underwent DE-CT prior to SBRT of a total dose of 45–60 Gy in 5–10 fractions. Of these 93 patients, nine patients had two lung tumors. Thus, 102 lung tumors were included in this study. DE-CT was performed for pretreatment evaluation. Regions of interest were set for the entire tumor, and average iodine density was obtained using a dedicated imaging software and evaluated with regard to local control. The median follow-up period was 23.4 months (range, 1.5–54.5 months). The median value of the average iodine density was 1.86 mg/cm3 (range, 0.40–9.27 mg/cm3). Two-year local control rates for the high and low average iodine density groups divided by the median value of the average iodine density were 96.9% and 75.7% (P = 0.006), respectively. Tumors with lower average iodine density showed a worse prognosis, possibly reflecting a hypoxic cell population in the tumor. The average iodine density exhibited a significant impact on local control. Our preliminary results indicate that iodine density evaluated using dual-energy spectral CT may be a useful, noninvasive and quantitative assessment of radio-resistance caused by presumably hypoxic cell populations in tumors.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148901","dual-energy CT;iodine density;lung cancer;oligometastases;stereotactic body radiotherapy","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"The Meaning of Global Ocean Ridge Basalt Major Element Compositions","Y. Niu",NA,Journal of Petrology,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","11-12","2081","2103","Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) are arguably the most abundant and also the simplest igneous rocks on the Earth. A correct understanding of their petrogenesis thus sets the cornerstone of igneous petrogenesis in general and also forms the foundation for studying mantle dynamics. Because major element compositions determine the mineralogy, phase equilibria and physical properties of rocks and magmas, understanding global MORB major element systematics is of prime importance. The correlated large MORB major element compositional variations are well understood as the result of cooling-dominated crustal-level processes (e.g. fractional crystallization, magma mixing, melt–rock assimilation or reaction, and other aspects of complex open-magma chamber processes), but it remains under debate what messages MORB major elements may carry about mantle sources and processes. To reveal mantle messages, it is logical to correct MORB melts for the effects of crustal-level processes to Mg# ≥ 0·72 to be in equilibrium with mantle olivine of ≥Fo90. Such corrected MORB major element (e.g. Si72, Ti72, Al72, Fe72, Mg72, Ca72 and Na72) compositional variations thus reflect fertile mantle compositional variation, composition-controlled mantle physical property variation (e.g. density and solidus), variation in the extent and pressure of melting, and uncertainties associated with the correction. The correction-related uncertainties can be removed through justified heavy averaging. Because ridge axial depth variation (∼0 to ∼6000 m below sea level) and plate spreading rate variation (<10 to >150 mm a–1) are the two largest known physical variables along the global ocean ridge system, possible correlations of MORB major element compositions at Mg# ≥ 0·72 with these two physical variables are expected to reveal intrinsic controls on global MORB petrogenesis and ocean ridge dynamics. Indeed, global MORB major element data averaged with respect to both ridge axial depth intervals and ridge spreading rate intervals show significant first-order correlations. These correlations lead to the conclusion that the ridge axial depth variation and MORB chemistry variation are two different effects of a common cause, induced by fertile mantle compositional variation. The latter determines (1) variation in both composition and mode of mantle mineralogy, (2) variation of mantle density, (3) variation of ridge axial depth, (4) source-inherited MORB compositional variation, (5) density-controlled variation in the maximum extent of mantle upwelling, (6) apparent variation in the extent of melting, and (7) the correlated variation of MORB chemistry with ridge axial depth. These correlations also confirm the recognition that the extent of mantle melting increases with, and is caused by, increasing plate spreading rate. Mantle temperature variation could play a part, but its overstated role in the literature results from a basic error (1) in treating ridge axial depth variation as solely caused by mantle temperature variation by ignoring the intrinsic control of mantle composition, (2) in treating mantle plume-influenced ridges (e.g. Iceland) as normal ridges of plate spreading origin, and (3) in treating seismic low velocity at great depths (>300 km) beneath these mantle plume-influenced ridges as evidence for hot ridge mantle. There is no evidence for large mantle temperature variation beneath ridges away from mantle plumes. The suggested conclusions of this study may continue to be debated, but they are most objective, and are most consistent with petrological, geochemical, geological and geophysical principles and observations.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egw073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8181928","mid-ocean ridges;MORB chemistry variation;MORB petrogenesis;mantle melting;fertile mantle compositional control;spreading rate control","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Determination of the fast shear wave orientation (φ) and the delay time between the fast and slow split shear waves (δt) via SKS splitting can help place spatial and temporal constraints on lithospheric deformation. The Canadian Appalachians experienced multiple episodes of deformation during the Phanerozoic: accretionary collisions during the Palaeozoic prior to the collision between Laurentia and Gondwana, and rifting related to the Mesozoic opening of the North Atlantic. However, the extent to which extensional events have overprinted older orogenic trends is uncertain. We address this issue through measurements of seismic anisotropy beneath the Canadian Appalachians, computing shear wave splitting parameters (φ, δt) for new and existing seismic stations in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Average δt values of 1.2s, relatively short length scale (≥100km) splitting parameter variations, and a lack of correlation with absolute plate motion direction and mantle flow models, demonstrate that fossil lithospheric anisotropic fabrics dominate our results. Most fast directions parallel Appalachian orogenic trends observed at the surface, while δt values point towards coherent deformation of the crust and mantle lithosphere. Mesozoic rifting had minimal impact on our study area, except locally within the Bay of Fundy and in southern Nova Scotia, where fast directions are subparallel to the opening direction of Mesozoic rifting; associated δt values of >1s require an anisotropic layer that spans both the crust and mantle, meaning the formation of the Bay of Fundy was not merely a thin-skinned tectonic event.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8189081","Body waves;Seismic anisotropy;Continental tectonics: compressional;Continental tectonics: extensional;North America","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is difficult for the receiver to utilize the part instead of global knowledge. Under the extended Kalman filtering, the utilization of the locating message is maximized by two aspects: the locating message generating and multi-locating messages fusing. For the former, the covariance upper-bound technique, by introducing amplification coefficients, is employed to remove the dependency of locating messages on the global knowledge. For the latter, an optimization model is setup; the covariance matrix determinant of the receiver's state estimate, expressed as a function of the amplification coefficients, is selected as the optimization criterion, under linear constraints on the amplification coefficient characteristics and the communication connectivity. Using the optimization solution, the local optimal state of the receiver agent is obtained by the weighting fusion.

While many studies tested the reliability of this recorder for palaeointensity only a few studies did this for direction. The study presents an archaeomagnetic and rock magnetic investigation applied to an experimental pottery kiln, which was operated in 2003 to produce stone ware. This kind of high-quality pottery needs a temperature of at least 1160 °C. Shortly before heating of the kiln direct absolute measurements of the absolute geomagnetic field vector have been carried out close to it. After cooling of the kiln 24 oriented palaeomagnetic samples have been taken. Although Curie temperatures are about 580 °C, that is the typical temperature for magnetite, thermal as well as alternating field demagnetisations reveal also a considerable amount of hematite as magnetic carrier. This mixture of magnetite and hematite is dominated by pseudo-single domain grains. Demagnetisation removed in some cases weak secondary components, but in most cases the specimens carried a single component thermoremanent magnetisation. The mean characteristic remanent magnetisation direction agrees on 95per cent confidence level with the directly measured field direction. Archaeointensity was obtained from five specimens with the Thellier–Coe method and with the multiple-specimen palaeointensity domain-state corrected method. Six of these specimens also provided a result of the Dekkers–Böhnel method, which overestimated the archaeointensity by about 9per cent compared to the direct value, while after correction for fraction the value agrees very well. For the multiple-specimen palaeointensity domain-state corrected method only fractions between 25 and 75per cent have been used and specimens showing alteration have been excluded. Above 450 °C many specimens showed alteration of the magnetic grains. Because median destructive temperatures were often above this value in most cases the fraction was less than 50per cent. Nevertheless the obtained intensity (48.48± 0.24 μ) is on 95per cent confidence level in agreement with the direct observation. Behaviour of the specimens during the Thellier-experiments was not ideal because of narrow unblocking temperature spectra and alteration. Nevertheless, the obtained mean archaeointensity is also in agreement with the direct field observation. Here the relative palaeointensity error is about 6per cent and very high compared the multiple-specimen palaeointensity domain-state corrected method. The investigation demonstrates that a pottery kiln can provide a very precise estimate of the ancient geomagnetic field vector.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8179504","Archaeomagnetism;Palaeointensity;Palaeomagnetic secular variation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For this problem, a new method for two-dimensional wideband signals based on block sparse reconstruction is proposed. First, a prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) is used to fit the wideband signals, then the block sparse reconstruction technology is employed for DOA estimation. The proposed method uses orthogonalization to choose the matching atoms, ensuring that the residual components correspond to the minimum absolute value. Meanwhile, the vectors obtained by iteration are back-disposed according to the corresponding atomic matching rules, so the extra atoms are abandoned in the course of iteration, and the residual components of current iteration are reduced. Thus the original sparse signals are reconstructed. The proposed method reduces iteration times comparing with the traditional reconstruction methods, and the estimation precision is better than the classical two-sided correlation transformation (TCT) algorithm when the snapshot is small or the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low.","1004-4132","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424919","direction of arrival (DOA) estimation;wideband signal;prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF);block sparse reconstruction","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Wideband;Estimation;Matching pursuit algorithms;Sensor arrays;Signal to noise ratio","","","","","","3 Mar 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

A parametric message passing algorithm based on factor graph is proposed to perform relative navigation in JTIDS. First of all, the joint posterior distribution of all the terminals' positions is represented by factor graph. Because of the nonlinearity between the positions and time-of-arrival (TOA) measurement, messages cannot be obtained in closed forms by directly using the sum-product algorithm on factor graph. To this end, the Euclidean norm is approximated by Taylor expansion. Then, all the messages on the factor graph can be derived in Gaussian forms, which enables the terminals to transmit means and covariances. Finally, the impact of major error sources on the navigation performance are evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations, e.g., range measurement noise, priors of position uncertainty and velocity noise. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the extended Kalman filter and cooperative extended Kalman filter in both static and mobile scenarios of the JTIDS.","1004-4132","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424925","joint tactical information distribution system (JTIDS);relative navigation;parametric message passing;factor graph","Navigation;Message passing;Position measurement;Covariance matrices;Sum product algorithm;Uncertainty","","","","","","3 Mar 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Between 2005 and 2010, 70 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (T3–4 N0–1 M0, World Health Organization Type 2–3) from Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand were registered. Patients were treated with 2D radiotherapy concurrent with weekly cisplatin (30 mg/m2). Neither adjuvant nor induction chemotherapy was given. Ninety-three percent of the patients completed at least four cycles of weekly cisplatin during radiotherapy. The median total doses for the primary tumor and positive lymph nodes were 70 and 66 Gy, respectively. The median overall treatment time of concurrent chemoradiotherapy was 52 days. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Grade 3–4 acute toxicities of mucositis, nausea/vomiting and leukopenia were observed in 34%, 4% and 4% of patients, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 52 months for the 40 surviving patients, the 3-year local control, locoregional tumor control, distant metastasis–free survival and overall survival rates were 80%, 75%, 74% and 80%, respectively. In conclusion, the current results illustrate that our concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen was feasible, but disease control remained insufficient. Further research is encouraged in order to improve clinical outcomes.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150087","nasopharyngeal cancer;chemoradiotherapy;cisplatin;2-dimensional radiotherapy;developing country","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The constant only indicates the leader's expectation coefficient for the follower's action, not the follower's own willingness. To solve this situation, a new model is proposed by using the follower's satisfactory degree as the cooperation degree. Then, because this new cooperation degree is a function which is dependent on the leader's choice and decided by the follower's satisfactory degree, this paper proves such proposed model not only leads an optimal value between the optimistic value and pessimistic's, but also leads a more satisfactory solution than Aboussoror's.

All patients had inoperable tumors. The major reasons for tumors being unresectable were insufficient respiratory function for curative resection, advanced age (>80 years old) or technically inoperable due to invasion into critical organs. The median patient age was 79 years (range; 60–86). The median follow-up duration was 25 months (range: 5–100 months). The 2-year overall survival rates for T3 and T4 were 57% and 69%, respectively. The 2-year local control rates for T3 and T4 were 91% and 68%, respectively. As for toxicities, Grade 0–1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 radiation pneumonitis occurred in 23, 1 and 1 patient, respectively. No other acute or symptomatic late toxicities were reported. Thirteen patients who had no local, mediastinal or intrapulmonary progression at one year after SBRT underwent pulmonary function testing. The median variation in pre-SBRT and post-SBRT forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) values was –0.1 (–0.8–0.8). This variation was not statistically significant (P = 0.56). Forced vital capacity (FVC), vital capacity (VC), %VC and %FEV1 also showed no significant differences. SBRT for cT3 and cT4N0M0 NSCLC was both effective and feasible.

Using signals recorded by permanent and temporary networks in Djibouti and Yemen, we located 1122 earthquakes, with a magnitude ranging from 2.1 to 5.6 from 2010 November 1 to 2011 March 31. By looking in detail at the space–time distribution of the overall seismicity, and both the frequency and the moment tensor of large earthquakes, we re-examine the chronology of this episode. In addition, we also interpret the origin of the activity using high-resolution bathymetric data, as well as from observations of seafloor cable damage caused by high temperatures and lava flows. The analysis allows us to identify distinct active areas. First, we interpret that this episode is mainly related to a diking event along a specific ridge segment, located at E044°. In light of previous diking episodes in nearby subaerial rift segments, for which field constraints and both seismic and geodetic data exist, we interpret the space–time evolution of the seismicity of the first few days. Migration of earthquakes suggests initial magma ascent below the segment centre. This is followed by a southeastward dike propagation below the rift immediately followed by a northwestward dike propagation below the rift ending below the northern ridge wall. The cumulative seismic moment associated with this sequence reaches 9.1 × 1017 Nm, and taking into account a very low seismic versus geodetic moment, we estimate a horizontal opening of ∼0.58–2.9m. The seismic activity that followed occurred through several bursts of earthquakes aligned along the segment axis, which are interpreted as short dike intrusions implying fast replenishment of the crustal magma reservoir feeding the dikes. Over the whole period, the opening is estimated to be ∼1.76–8.8m across the segment. A striking feature of this episode is that the seismicity remained confined within one individual segment, whereas the adjacent en-echelon segments were totally quiescent, suggesting that the magma supply system of one segment is disconnected from those of the neighbouring segments. Second, we identify activity induced by the first intrusion with epicentres aligned along an N035°E-trending, ∼30km long at the northwestern end of the active opening segment. This group encompasses more than seven earthquakes with magnitude larger than 5.0, and with strike-slip focal mechanisms consistent with the faults identified in the bathymetry and the structural pattern of the area. We propose that a transform fault is currently in formation which indicates an early stage of the ridge segmentation, at the locus of the trend change of the spreading ridge, which also corresponds to the boundary between a clear oceanic lithosphere and the zone of transform between continental and oceanic crust.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8189129","Earthquake source observations;Seismicity and tectonics;Mid-ocean ridge processes;Transform faults;Submarine tectonics and volcanism;Dynamics: seismotectonics","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Seventy-four patients with medically inoperable NSCLC who underwent both DE-CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT before SBRT (50‒60 Gy in 5‒6 fractions) were followed up after a median interval of 24.5 months. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to determine associations between local control (LC) and variables, including AID, SUV max , tumor size, histology, and prescribed dose. The median AID and SUV max were 18.64 (range, 1.18–45.31) (100 µg/cm3) and 3.2 (range, 0.7–17.6), respectively. No correlation was observed between AID and SUV max . Two-year LC rates were 96.2% vs 75.0% (P = 0.039) and 72.0% vs 96.2% (P = 0.002) for patients classified according to high vs low AID or SUV max , respectively.

In some cases, especially over the longer term, implant degradation can develop due to the deterioration of the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) tibial insert. Unfortunately, there are no satisfactory techniques currently available for assessing implant integrity and predicting failure. This paper describes a possible solution to this problem by using a non-invasive, electromagnetic method for monitoring implant integrity. This approach utilizes the magnetoelastic property of amorphous ribbon, which when stressed causes an inductance change in a nearby magnetizing winding. Amorphous ribbons encased in UHMWPE disks, to simulate a knee insert, were subjected to varying tensile stresses under an applied ac magnetic field. A correlation between total circuit impedance and applied stress was observed. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed sensor has sufficient sensitivity for measuring typical stress levels associated with the axial forces in tibial inserts.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2016.2521421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393854","amorphous materials;knee implants;magnetic sensor;biomedical applications;Amorphous materials;biomedical applications;knee implants;magnetic sensor","Stress;Resonant frequency;Implants;Polyethylene;Frequency measurement;Amorphous magnetic materials;Impedance","","","","17","CCBY","27 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although established chromosome analyses are suitable for estimating the absorbed dose after high-dose irradiation, biodosimetric methodology to measure damage following low-dose exposure is underdeveloped. RNA analysis of circulating blood containing radiation-sensitive cells is a candidate biodosimetry method. Here we quantified RNA from a small amount of blood isolated from mice following low-dose body irradiation (<0.5 Gy) aimed at developing biodosimetric tools for situations that are difficult to study in humans. By focusing on radiation-sensitive undifferentiated cells in the blood based on MycRNA expression, we quantified the relative levels of RNA for DNA damage-induced (DDI) genes, such as Bax, Bbc3and Cdkn1a. The RNA ratios of DDI genes/Mycin the blood increased in a dose-dependent manner 4 h after whole-body irradiation at doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 Gy (air-kerma) of X-rays, regardless of whether the mice were in an active or resting state. The RNA ratios were significantly increased after 0.014 Gy (air-kerma) of single X-ray irradiation. The RNA ratios were directly proportional to the absorbed doses in water ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 Gy, based on gamma-irradiation from 137Cs. Four hours after continuous irradiation with gamma-rays or by internal contamination with a beta-emitter, the increased RNA ratios resembled those following single irradiation. These findings indicate that the RNA status can be utilized as a biodosimetric tool to estimate low-dose radiation when focusing on undifferentiated cells in blood.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150097","circadian rhythm;Cdkn1a;Bbc3;Bax;Myc;cysteamine","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Thus, in seismic hazard and seismic site response studies, it is of the utmost importance to determine the geometry of the bedrock depth. The main objectives of this study were to determine the bedrock depth and map the depth-to-bedrock ratio for use in land use planning in regard to the mitigation of earthquake hazards in the Eskişehir Basin. The fundamental resonance frequencies (fr ) of 318 investigation sites in the Eskişehir Basin were determined through case studies, and the 2-D S-wave velocity structure down to the bedrock depth was explored. Single-station microtremor data were collected from the 318 sites, as well as microtremor array data from nine sites, seismic reflection data from six sites, deep-drilling log data from three sites and shallow drilling log data from ten sites in the Eskişehir Graben. The fundamental resonance frequencies of the Eskişehir Basin sites were obtained from the microtremor data using the horizontal-to vertical (H/V) spectral ratio (HVSR) method. The phase velocities of the Rayleigh waves were estimated from the microtremor data using the spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method. The fundamental resonance frequency range at the deepest point of the Eskişehir Basin was found to be 0.23–0.35Hz. Based on the microtremor array measurements and the 2-D S-wave velocity profiles obtained using the SPAC method, a bedrock level with an average velocity of 1300 ms−1 was accepted as the bedrock depth limit in the region. The log data from a deep borehole and a seismic reflection cross-section of the basement rocks of the Eskişehir Basin were obtained and permitted a comparison of bedrock levels. Tests carried out using a multichannel walk-away technique permitted a seismic reflection cross-section to be obtained up to a depth of 1500–2000m using an explosive energy source. The relationship between the fundamental resonance frequency in the Eskişehir Basin and the results of deep drilling, shallow drilling, shear wave velocity measurement and sedimentary cover depth measurement obtained from the seismic reflection section was expressed in the form of a nonlinear regression equation. An empirical relationship between fr, the thickness of sediments and the bedrock depth is suggested for use in future microzonation studies of sites in the region. The results revealed a maximum basin depth of 1000m, located in the northeast of the Eskişehir Basin, and the SPAC and HVSR results indicated that within the study area the basin is characterized by a thin local sedimentary cover with low shear wave velocity overlying stiff materials, resulting in a sharp velocity contrast. The thicknesses of the old Quaternary and Tertiary fluvial sediments within the basin serve as the primary data sources in seismic hazard and seismic site response studies, and these results add to the body of available seismic hazard data contributing to a seismic microzonation of the Eskişehir Graben in advance of the severe earthquakes expected in the Anatolian Region.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146816","Surface waves and free oscillations;Site effects","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In the mission of on-orbit servicing, as fuel is expended, or the payloads are added or removed, the center of mass will be changed in certain axe; consequently, some thrusters' directions are deviated from the center of mass (CM) in certain plane. The CM of assembled spacecraft estimation and thruster direction control are studied. Firstly, the attitude dynamics of the assembled spacecraft is established based on the Newton-Euler method. Secondly, the estimation can be identified by the least recursive squares algorithm. Then, a scheme to control the thrusters' directions is proposed. By using the gimbal installed at the end of the boom, the angle of the thruster is controlled by driving the gimbal; therefore, thrusters can be directed to the CM again. Finally, numerical simulations are used to verify this scheme. Results of the numerical simulations clearly show that this control scheme is rational and feasible.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2016.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514432","on-orbit servicing;thruster's direction control;assembled spacecraft;center of mass (CM) identification","Space vehicles;Orbits;Force;Extraterrestrial measurements;Attitude control;Suspensions;Estimation","","","","","","21 Jul 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"
"Glacial isostatic adjustment in response to changing Late Holocene behaviour of ice streams on the Siple Coast, West Antarctica","G. A. Nield; P. L. Whitehouse; M. A. King; P. J. Clarke",NA; NA; NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2016","205","1","1","21","The Siple Coast region of Antarctica contains a number of fast-flowing ice streams, which control the dynamics and mass balance of the region. These ice streams are known to undergo stagnation and reactivation cycles, which lead to ice thickness changes that may be sufficient to excite a viscous solid Earth response (glacial isostatic adjustment; GIA). This study aims to quantify Siple Coast ice thickness changes during the last 2000 yr in order to determine the degree to which they might contribute to GIA and associated present-day bedrock uplift rates. This is important because accurate modelling of GIA is necessary to determine the rate of present-day ice-mass change from satellite gravimetry. Recently-published reconstructions of ice-stream variability were used to create a suite of kinematic models for the stagnation-related thickening of Kamb Ice Stream since ∼1850 AD, and a GIA model was used to predict present-day deformation rates in response to this thickening. A number of longer-term loading scenarios, which include the stagnation and reactivation of ice streams across the Siple Coast over the past 2000 yr, were also constructed, and used to investigate the longer term GIA signal in the region. Uplift rates for each of the ice loading histories, based on a range of earth models, were compared with regional GPS-observed uplift rates and an empirical GIA estimate. We estimate Kamb Ice Stream to have thickened by 70–130m since stagnation ∼165 years ago. Modelled present-day vertical motion in response to this load increase peaks at −17mmyr–1 (i.e. 17mmyr–1 subsidence) for the weakest earth models tested here. Comparison of the solid Earth response to ice load changes throughout the last glacial cycle, including ice stream stagnation and reactivation across the Siple Coast during the last 2000 yr, with an empirical GIA estimate suggests that the upper mantle viscosity of the region is greater than 1 × 1020 Pa s. When upper mantle viscosity values of 1 × 1020Pa s or smaller are combined with our suite of ice-load scenarios we predict uplift rates across Siple Coast that are at least 4mmyr–1 smaller than those predicted by the empirical GIA estimate. GPS data are unable to further constrain model parameters due to the distance of the GPS sites from the study area. Our results demonstrate that Late Holocene ice load changes related to the stagnation and reactivation of ice streams on the Siple Coast may play a dominant role in defining the present-day uplift signal. However, both the detailed Earth structure and deglacial history of the region need to be better constrained in order to reduce uncertainties associated with the GIA signal of this region.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggv532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8179461","Satellite geodesy;Transient deformation;Glaciology;Dynamics of lithosphere and mantle;Rheology: mantle;Antarctica","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We removed the aliasing components from the sparsely acquired common-midpoint dataset so that the artifacts can be prevented while automatically picking the velocity. The velocity profile can hence be generated. We tested our approach with the data obtained on the pavement of an airport-runway model. Beside the manmade voids that could easily be detected, we also found that the area with a velocity of about 0.03 m/ns lower than the surrounding areas indicated the location where manmade grooves existed.

The spectrum is well reproduced by a single-temperature plasma model in ionization equilibrium, with a temperature of 0.78 (0.70–0.87) keV.

In addition, it is required to compute the near-zone electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the wires, which might be difficult to accurately achieve (e.g., with 1% maximum error). The arrays are modeled as finite (50 × 50 wires with finite lengths), while the wires are periodically arranged. On the other hand, the sample solutions that are also included in this issue do not directly use the periodicity.

The goal of this study was to establish an appropriate and efficient minipig model and introduce a thoracic computed tomography (CT)-based method to measure the progression of RILI. Göttingen minipigs were allocated to control and irradiation groups. The most obvious changes in the CT images after irradiation were peribronchial opacification, interlobular septal thickening, and lung volume loss. Hounsfield units (HU) in the irradiation group reached a maximum level at 6 weeks and decreased thereafter, but remained higher than those of the control group. Both lung area and cardiac right lateral shift showed significant changes at 22 weeks post irradiation. The white blood cell (WBC) count, a marker of pneumonitis, increased and reached a maximum at 6 weeks in both peripheral blood and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. Microscopic findings at 22 weeks post irradiation were characterized by widening of the interlobular septum, with dense fibrosis and an increase in the radiation dose–dependent fibrotic score. Our results also showed that WBC counts and microscopic findings were positively correlated with the three CT parameters. In conclusion, the minipig model can provide useful clinical data regarding RILI caused by the adverse effects of high-dose radiotherapy. Peribronchial opacification, interlobular septal thickening, and lung volume loss are three quantifiable CT parameters that can be used as a simple method for monitoring the progression of RILI.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148935","Göttingen minipigs;radiation;lung injury;computed tomography","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In the present study, we analyzed the frequency of chromosome translocations using stored Carnoy's-fixed lymphocyte specimens from the previous study; these specimens were from 12 patients who were subject to chromosome painting of Chromosomes 1, 2 and 4. Chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were analyzed in ∼5000 cells, which is equivalent to the whole-genome analysis of almost 2000 cells. The frequency of chromosome translocation was higher than the number of DICs formed, both before and after CT scanning. The frequency of chromosome translocations tended to be higher, but not significantly higher, in patients with a treatment history compared with patients without such a history. However, in contrast to the results for DIC formation, the frequency of translocations detected before and after the CT scan did not differ significantly. Therefore, analysis of chromosome translocation may not be a suitable assay for detecting chromosome aberrations in cases of low-dose radiation exposure from a CT scan. A significant increase in the frequency of chromosome translocations was not likely to be detected due to the high baseline before the CT scan; the high and variable frequency of translocations was probably due to multiple confounding factors in adults.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148937","dicentric chromosome;translocated chromosome;chromosome painting;low-dose radiation exposure;confounding factors","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Any changes in voltage are facilitated by trans-membrane flow of electrically charged ions, which are mostly potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium. Firings of excitable neurons are modulated by repetitive discharges.

In order to solve the problems of conventional protection caused by HWACT, a novel integrated protection based on multi-frequency domain information is proposed in this paper, which uses both the power frequency information and transient information.

Visual biofeedback systems associated with a patient-specific guiding waveform are known to reduce respiratory irregularities. In Japan, abdomen and chest motion self-control devices (Abches) (representing simpler visual coaching techniques without a guiding waveform) are used instead; however, no studies have compared these two systems to date. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of respiratory coaching in reducing respiratory irregularities by comparing two respiratory management systems. We collected data from 11 healthy volunteers. Bar and wave models were used as visual biofeedback systems. Abches consisted of a respiratory indicator indicating the end of each expiration and inspiration motion. Respiratory variations were quantified as root mean squared error (RMSE) of displacement and period of breathing cycles. All coaching techniques improved respiratory variation, compared with free-breathing. Displacement RMSEs were 1.43 ± 0.84, 1.22 ± 1.13, 1.21 ± 0.86 and 0.98 ± 0.47 mm for free-breathing, Abches, bar model and wave model, respectively. Period RMSEs were 0.48 ± 0.42, 0.33 ± 0.31, 0.23 ± 0.18 and 0.17 ± 0.05 s for free-breathing, Abches, bar model and wave model, respectively. The average reduction in displacement and period RMSE compared with the wave model were 27% and 47%, respectively. For variation in both displacement and period, wave model was superior to the other techniques. Our results showed that visual biofeedback combined with a wave model could potentially provide clinical benefits in respiratory management, although all techniques were able to reduce respiratory irregularities.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148904","radiotherapy;four-dimensional CT;respiratory motion management;visual biofeedback;breathing guidance","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Now, the antenna range supports three measurement types using a commercial integrated measurement control system that provides support for high gain and low gain antennas over a wide frequency range. These are spherical near-field, planar near-field and conventional far-field measurements, with the potential to implement cylindrical near-field. The antenna range potentially supports operations from 1 GHz up to 26.5 GHz, though the currently available probes do not cover the full band. The main physical upgrade was performed during October 2014, though investigations had already begun in 2011, and some supplementary tasks were still ongoing at the time of writing. Several innovative commissioning tests have been undertaken, some of which are only possible with near-field metrology, and these are described in the paper.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2016.8532247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532247","Indoor Antenna Range;Spherical Near-Field Measurements;Planar Near-Field Measurements;Far-Field Measurements","Antennas;Antenna measurements;Probes;Software;Anechoic chambers;Poles and towers;Control equipment","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Many clinical trials have evaluated the level of toxicity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ver. 4.03. This criterion accounts for severity in a single sentence only, and no visual classification guide has been available. Thus, there is a risk of subjective interpretation by the individual investigator. This contrasts with the situation with hematologic toxicities, which can be interpreted objectively. The aim of this prospective picture collection study was to develop a grading tool for use in establishing the severity of radiation dermatitis in clinical trials. A total of 118 patients who were scheduled to receive definitive or postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were enrolled from the four participating cancer centers. All researchers in our group used the same model of camera under the same shooting conditions to maintain consistent photographic quality. In all, 1600 photographs were collected. Of these, 100 photographs qualified for the first round of selection and were then graded by six experts, basically in accordance with the CTCAE ver. 4.03 (JCOG ver. in Japanese). After further study, 38 photographs were selected as representing typical models for Grade 1–4 radiation dermatitis; the radiation dermatitis grading atlas was produced from these photographs. The atlas will play a major role in ensuring that the dermatitis rating system is consistent between the institutions participating in trials. We hope that this will contribute to improving the quality of clinical trials, and also to improving the level of routine clinical practice.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrv092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148939","radiation dermatitis;head-and-neck cancer;grading system;radiotherapy;acute toxicity","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Earthquakes in each repeating sequence are located at almost the same place and show low-angle thrust type focal mechanisms, indicating that they represent repeated ruptures of a seismic patch on the plate boundary. We calculated cross-spectra of the waveforms and obtained the phases and coherences for pairs of events in the respective repeating sequences in order to investigate the waveform differences. We used waveform data sampled at 1kHz that were obtained from temporary seismic observations we conducted immediately after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake near the source area. For two repeating sequences, we found that the interevent delay times for the two waveforms in a frequency band higher than the corner frequencies are different from those in a lower frequency band for particular event pairs. The phases and coherences show that there are coherent high-frequency waves for almost all the repeaters regardless of the high-frequency delays. These results indicate that high-frequency waves are always radiated from the same vicinity (subpatch) for these events but the time intervals between the ruptures of the subpatch and the centroid times can vary. We classified events in the sequence into two subgroups according to the high-frequency band interevent delays relative to the low-frequency band. For one sequence, we found that all the events that occurred just after (within 11 days) larger nearby earthquakes belong to one subgroup while other events belong to the other subgroup. This suggests that the high-frequency wave differences were caused by stress perturbations due to the nearby earthquakes. In summary, our observations suggest that high-frequency waves from the repeating sequence are radiated not from everywhere but from a long-duration subpatch within the seismic slip area. The variation in high-frequency radiation can be explained by rupture pattern differences that depend on the stress conditions in and around the seismic patches.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8189340","Fourier analysis;Seismic cycle;Earthquake dynamics;Earthquake source observations;Earthquake interaction, forecasting, and prediction;Dynamics and mechanics of faulting","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This velocity is normally fixed at or near the speed of light. However, this study finds that the radio waves from two submarine communication transmitters at 20.9 kHz and 23.4 kHz exhibit phase propagation velocities that are ∼0.51% slower and ∼0.64% faster than the speed of light as a result of sky wave contributions and ground effects. Therefore, a novel technique with a variable phase propagation velocity is implemented for the first time in the TOA method and applied to electric field recordings with a long-baseline lightning location system that consists of four radio receivers in western Europe. The lightning locations inferred from variable velocities improve the accuracy of locations inferred from a fixed velocity by ∼0.89–1.06 km when compared to the lightning locations reported by the UK MetOffice. The normal distributions of the observed phase propagation velocities in small geographic areas are not centered at the speed of light. Consequently, representative velocities can be calculated for many small geographic areas to produce a velocity map over central France where numerous lightning discharges occurred. This map reflects the impact of sky waves and ground effects on the calculation of lightning locations as a result of the network configuration. It is concluded that the use of variable phase propagation velocities mitigates the influence of sky waves and ground effects in long-range lightning location networks.","1944-799X","","10.1002/2016RS006058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7894421","","Lightning;Receivers;Radio transmitters;Propagation;Transforms;Discharges (electric);Fault diagnosis","","","","","","12 Apr 2017","","","AGU","AGU Journals"
"Sulphide Sinking in Magma Conduits: Evidence from Mafic–Ultramafic Plugs on Rum and the Wider North Atlantic Igneous Province","H. S. R. Hughes; I. McDonald; A. J. Boyce; D. A. Holwell; A. C. Kerr",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Petrology,"18 Jan 2018","2016","57","2","383","416","Ni–Cu–PGE (platinum group element) sulphide mineralization is commonly found in magmatic conduit systems. In many cases the trigger for formation of an immiscible sulphide liquid involves assimilation of S-bearing crustal rocks. Conceptually, the fluid dynamics of sulphide liquid droplets within such conduits is essentially a balance between gravitational sinking and upwards entrainment. Thus, crustal contamination signatures may be present in sulphides preserved both up- and down-flow from the point of interaction with the contaminant. We examine a suite of ultramafic volcanic plugs on the Isle of Rum, Scotland, to decipher controls on sulphide accumulation in near-surface magma conduits intruded into a variable sedimentary stratigraphy. The whole-rock compositions of the plugs broadly overlap with the compositions of ultramafic units within the Rum Layered Complex, although subtle differences between each plug highlight their individuality. Interstitial base metal sulphide minerals occur in all ultramafic plugs on Rum. Sulphide minerals have magmatic δ34S (ranging from –1·3 to +2·1‰) and S/Se ratios (mean = 2299), and demonstrate that the conduit magmas were already S-saturated. However, two plugs in NW Rum contain substantially coarser (sometimes net-textured) sulphides with unusually light δ34S (–14·7 to +0·3‰) and elevated S/Se ratios (mean = 4457), not represented by the immediate host-rocks. Based on the Hebrides Basin sedimentary stratigraphy, it is likely that the volcanic con duits would have intruded through a package of Jurassic mudrocks with characteristically light δ34S (–33·8 to –14·7‰). We propose that a secondary crustal S contamination event took place at a level above that currently exposed, and that these sulphides sank back to their present position. Modelling suggests that upon the cessation of active magma transport, sulphide liquids could have sunk back through the conduit over a distance of several hundreds of metres, over a period of a few days. This sulphide ‘withdrawal’ process may be observed in other vertical or steeply inclined magma conduits globally; for example, in the macrodykes of East Greenland. Sulphide liquid sinking within a non-active conduit or during magma ‘suck-back’ may help to explain crustal S-isotopic compositions in magma conduits that appear to lack appropriate lithologies to support this contamination, either locally or deeper in the system.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egw010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8184820","sulphur isotopes;North Atlantic Igneous Province;sulphide sinking;S/Se;crustal contamination","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Firstly, two hypotheses, i.e., pulse relativity within the same mission and pulse independence among different missions, are proposed by analyzing the antenna pattern and the beam scheduling method of the phased array radar. Based on the above two hypotheses, an optimal model for pulse classification is exploited with pulse amplitude series, where the absolute-value sum of second order difference is taken as the optimal kernel to measure sequence smooth continuity. Finally, several pieces of sequences under different numbers of missions and tracking data rates are simulated for algorithm verification. The simulation results show that the long data length and the high data rate will increase classification efficiency due to the validity of the two hypotheses in sufficient pulse amplitude sequence.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2016.06.07","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828324","optimal model;pulse classification;relativity and independence;multi-function phased array radar","Radar tracking;Phased arrays;Target tracking;Radar antennas;Modeling","","","","","","23 Jan 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The width and depth of the gaps depend on the planet mass and disk properties. We have performed two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for various planet masses, disk aspect ratios, and viscosities, to obtain an empirical formula for the gap width. The gap width is proportional to the square root of the planet mass, −3/4 the power of the disk aspect ratio and −1/4 the power of the viscosity. This empirical formula enables us to estimate the mass of a planet embedded in the disk from the width of an observed gap. We have applied the empirical formula for the gap width to the disk around HL Tau, assuming that each gap observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations is produced by planets, and discussed the planet masses within the gaps. The estimate of planet masses from the gap widths is less affected by the observational resolution and dust filtration than that by the gap depth.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/psw037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8202704","planet–disk interactions;protoplanetary disks;stars: individual (HL Tau)","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In order to handle such a case, an optimization problem by exploiting the sparsity characteristics of both the perturbations and signals is formulated. An algorithm named as the sparse perturbation signal recovery algorithm (SPSRA) is then proposed to solve the formulated optimization problem. The analytical results show that our SPSRA can simultaneously recover the signal and perturbation vectors by an alternative iteration way, while the convergence of the SPSRA is also analytically given and guaranteed. Moreover, the support patterns of the sparse signal and structured perturbation shown are the same and can be exploited to improve the estimation accuracy and reduce the computation complexity of the algorithm.

Besides the longitudinal inverted V-shaped wakes, strong whistler waves are observed when low-density and low-velocity pulses move in plasmas in the presence of a magnetic field. The corresponding stopping powers are enhanced because of drag from these whistler waves. As the beam velocities increase, the whistler waves disappear, and only inverted V-shaped wakes are observed. The corresponding stopping powers are reduced compared with those in isotropic plasmas. When high-density pulses are transported in the magnetized plasmas, the whistler waves are greatly inhibited for low-velocity pulses and disappear for high-velocity pulses.

The growing volume of freely available data coupled with ever expanding computational power opens avenues to tackle larger and more complex problems. Current bottlenecks include inefficient resource usage and insufficient data organization. Properly scaling a problem requires the resolution of both these challenges, and existing data formats are no longer up to the task. ASDF stores any number of synthetic, processed or unaltered waveforms in a single file. A key improvement compared to existing formats is the inclusion of comprehensive meta information, such as event or station information, in the same file. Additionally, it is also usable for any non-waveform data, for example, cross-correlations, adjoint sources or receiver functions. Last but not least, full provenance information can be stored alongside each item of data, thereby enhancing reproducibility and accountability. Any data set in our proposed format is self-describing and can be readily exchanged with others, facilitating collaboration. The utilization of the HDF5 container format grants efficient and parallel I/O operations, integrated compression algorithms and check sums to guard against data corruption. To not reinvent the wheel and to build upon past developments, we use existing standards like QuakeML, StationXML, W3C PROV and HDF5 wherever feasible. Usability and tool support are crucial for any new format to gain acceptance. We developed mature C/Fortran and Python based APIs coupling ASDF to the widely used SPECFEM3D_GLOBE and ObsPy toolkits.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8189346","Time-series analysis;Seismic tomography;Computational seismology;Wave propagation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

As boost planning is recommended for NPC, we performed interim assessments of magnetic resonance (MR) images for boost planning and retrospectively evaluated their predictive value for the survival of NPC patients. Radiation therapy via elective nodal irradiation (median dose: 39.6 Gy) with/without chemotherapy was used to treat 63 NPC patients. Boost irradiation (median total dose: 70 Gy) was performed based on the interim assessment. The largest lymph node (LN) was measured on MR images acquired at the time of interim assessment. The site of first failure was local in 8 (12.7%), regional in 7 (11.1%), and distant in 12 patients (19.0%). All 7 patients with regional failure harbored LNs ≥15 mm at interim assessment. We divided the 63 patients into two groups based on LN size [large (≥15 mm), n = 10 and small (<15 mm), n = 53]. Univariate analysis showed that 5-year overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) rates for large LNs were significantly lower than for small LNs (OS: 12.5% vs 70.5%, P < 0.001 and CSS: 25.0% vs 80.0%, P < 0.001).

Many useful electronic image stabilization algorithms have been studied. A real-time algorithm is proposed based on field image gray projection which enables the regional odd and even field image to be projected into x and y directions and thus to get the regional gray projection curves in x and y directions, respectively. For the odd field image channel, motion parameters can be estimated via iterative minimum absolute difference based on two successive field image regional gray projection curves. Then motion compensations can be obtained after using the Kalman filter method. Finally, the odd field image is adjusted according to the compensations. In the mean time, motion compensation is applied to the even field image channel with the odd field image gray projection curves of the current frame. By minimizing absolute difference between odd and even field image gray projection curves of the current frame, the inter-field motion parameters can be estimated. Therefore, the even field image can be adjusted by combining the inter-field motion parameters and the odd field compensations. Finally, the stabilized image sequence can be obtained by synthesizing the adjusted odd and even field images. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can run in real-time and have a good stabilization performance. In addition, image blurring can be improved.","1004-4132","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424938","image dithering;field based processing;electronic image stabilization;regional gray projection;minimum absolute difference","Real-time systems;Motion compensation;Digital images;Kalman filters;Image sequences;Classification algorithms;Signal processing algorithms","","","","","","3 Mar 2016","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"
"The great 1933 Sanriku-oki earthquake: reappraisal of the main shock and its aftershocks and implications for its tsunami using regional tsunami and seismic data","N. Uchida; S. H. Kirby; N. Umino; R. Hino; T. Kazakami",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2016","206","3","1619","1633","The aftershock distribution of the 1933 Sanriku-oki outer trench earthquake is estimated by using modern relocation methods and a newly developed velocity structure to examine the spatial extent of the source-fault and the possibility of a triggered interplate seismicity. In this study, we first examined the regional data quality of the 1933 earthquake based on smoked-paper records and then relocated the earthquakes by using the 3-D velocity structure and double-difference method. The improvements of hypocentre locations using these methods were confirmed by the examination of recent earthquakes that are accurately located based on ocean bottom seismometer data. The results show that the 1933 aftershocks occurred under both the outer- and inner-trench-slope regions. In the outer-trench-slope region, aftershocks are distributed in a ∼280-km-long area and their depths are shallower than 50km. Although we could not constrain the fault geometry from the hypocentre distribution, the depth distribution suggests the whole lithosphere is probably not under deviatoric tension at the time of the 1933 earthquake. The occurrence of aftershocks under the inner trench slope was also confirmed by an investigation of waveform frequency difference between outer and inner trench earthquakes as recorded at Mizusawa. The earthquakes under the inner trench slope were shallow (depth ≦30km) and the waveforms show a low-frequency character similar to the waveforms of recent, precisely located earthquakes in the same area. They are also located where recent activity of interplate thrust earthquakes is high. These suggest that the 1933 outer-trench-slope main shock triggered interplate earthquakes, which is an unusual case in the order of occurrence in contrast with the more common pairing of a large initial interplate shock with subsequent outer-slope earthquakes. The off-trench earthquakes are distributed about 80km width in the trench perpendicular direction. This wide width cannot be explained from a single high-angle fault confined at a shallow depth (depth≦50km). The upward motion of the 1933 tsunami waveform records observed at Sanriku coast also cannot be explained from a single high-angle west-dipping normal fault. If we consider additional fault, involvement of high-angle, east-dipping normal faults can better explain the tsunami first motion and triggering of the aftershock in a wide area under the outer trench slope. Therefore multiple off-trench normal faults may have activated during the 1933 earthquake. We also relocated recent (2001–2012) seismicity by the same method. The results show that the present seismicity in the outer-trench-slope region can be divided into several groups along the trench. Comparison of the 1933 rupture dimensions based on our aftershock relocations with the morphologies of fault scarps in the outer trench slope suggest that the rupture was limited to the region where fault scarps are largely trench parallel and cross cut the seafloor spreading fabric. These findings imply that bending geometry and structural segmentation of the incoming plate largely controls the spatial extent of the 1933 seismogenic faulting. In this shallow rupture model for this largest outer trench earthquake, triggered seismicity in the forearc and structural control of faulting represent an important deformation styles for off-trench and shallow megathrust zones.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggw234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146885","Earthquake dynamics;Earthquake source observations;Seismicity and tectonics;Subduction zone processes;Dynamics: seismotectonics;Pacific Ocean","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A total of 72 treatment plans were reviewed, and dosimetric factors [including homogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI)] were evaluated. Emphysematous changes in lung were observed in 43 patients (60%). Patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of emphysema: no emphysema (n = 29), mild emphysema (n = 22) and moderate to severe emphysema groups (n = 21). The HI (P < 0.001) and the CI (P = 0.029) were significantly different in accordance with the severity of emphysema in one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The HI value was significantly higher in the moderate to severe emphysema group compared with in the no emphysema (Tukey, P < 0.001) and mild emphysema groups (P = 0.002). The CI value was significantly higher in the moderate to severe emphysema group compared with in the no emphysema group (P = 0.044). In multiple linear regression analysis, the severity of emphysema (P < 0.001) and the mean material density of the lung within the PTV (P < 0.001) were significant factors for HI, and the mean density of the lung within the PTV (P = 0.005) was the only significant factor for CI. The mean density of the lung within the PTV was significantly different in accordance with the severity of emphysema (one-way ANOVA, P = 0.008) and the severity of emphysema (P < 0.001) was one of the significant factors for the density of the lung within the PTV in multiple linear regression analysis.

"Storage and Evolution of Mafic and Intermediate Alkaline Magmas beneath Ross Island, Antarctica","K. Iacovino; C. Oppenheimer; B. Scaillet; P.

Experiments were designed to reproduce the P–T–X–fO2conditions of deep and intermediate magma storage and to place constraints on the differentiation of each of the two predominant lava suites on the island, which are thought to be derived from a common parent melt. The Erebus Lineage (EL) consists of lava erupted from the Erebus summit and the Dry Valley Drilling Project (DVDP) lineage is represented by lavas sampled by drill core on Hut Point Peninsula. Experiments were performed in internally heated pressure vessels over a range of temperatures (1000–1150°C) and pressures (200–400 MPa), under oxidized conditions (NNO to NNO + 3, where NNO is the nickel–nickel oxide buffer), with XH2Oof the H2O–CO2mixture added to the experimental capsule varying between zero and unity. The overall mineralogy and mineral compositions of the natural lavas were reproduced, suggesting oxidizing conditions for the deep magma plumbing system, in marked contrast to the reducing conditions (QFM to QFM – 1, where QFM is the quartz–fayalite–magnetite buffer) in the Erebus lava lake. In basanite, crystallization of spinel is followed by olivine and clinopyroxene; olivine is replaced by kaersutitic amphibole below ∼1050°C at intermediate water contents. In phonotephrite, the liquidus phase is kaersutite except in runs with low water content (XH2Ofluid < 0·2) where it is replaced by clinopyroxene. Experimental kaersutite compositions suggest that the amphibole-bearing DVDP lavas differentiated below 1050°C at 200–400 MPa and NNO + 1·5 to NNO + 2. Olivine- and clinopyroxene-bearing EL lavas are consistent with experiments performed above 1050°C and pressures around 200 MPa. The plagioclase liquidus at <1–2 wt % H2O suggests extremely dry conditions for both lineages (XH2Ofluidapproaching zero for EL, ∼0·25 for DVDP), probably facilitated by dehydration induced by a CO2-rich fluid phase. Our results agree with previous studies that suggest a single plumbing system beneath Ross Island in which DVDP lavas (and probably other peripheral volcanic products) were erupted through radial fractures associated with the ascent of parental magma into the lower crust. The longer travel time of the DVDP lavas through the crust owing to lateral movement along fractures and the lack of a direct, sustained connection to the continuous CO2-rich gas flux that characterizes the main central Erebus conduit is probably responsible for the lower temperatures and slightly wetter conditions and hence the change in mineralogy observed.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egv083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8184767","alkaline volcanism;basanite;CO2;phase equilibria;phonotephrite;Ross Island","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This completely differs from a wired network, where communicating devices are physically connected through cables and a node without direct association is unable to access the network for illicit activities. The open communications environment makes wireless transmissions more vulnerable than wired communications to malicious attacks, including both the passive eavesdropping for data interception and the active jamming for disrupting legitimate transmissions. Therefore, this paper is motivated to examine the security vulnerabilities and threats imposed by the inherent open nature of wireless communications and to devise efficient defense mechanisms for improving the wireless network security. We first summarize the security requirements of wireless networks, including their authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues. Next, a comprehensive overview of security attacks encountered in wireless networks is presented in view of the network protocol architecture, where the potential security threats are discussed at each protocol layer. We also provide a survey of the existing security protocols and algorithms that are adopted in the existing wireless network standards, such as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and the long-term evolution (LTE) systems. Then, we discuss the state of the art in physical-layer security, which is an emerging technique of securing the open communications environment against eavesdropping attacks at the physical layer. Several physical-layer security techniques are reviewed and compared, including information-theoretic security, artificial-noise-aided security, security-oriented beamforming, diversity-assisted security, and physical-layer key generation approaches. Since a jammer emitting radio signals can readily interfere with the legitimate wireless users, we also introduce the family of various jamming attacks and their countermeasures, including the constant jammer, intermittent jammer, reactive jammer, adaptive jammer, and intelligent jammer. Additionally, we discuss the integration of physical-layer security into existing authentication and cryptography mechanisms for further securing wireless networks. Finally, some technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are summarized and the future trends in wireless security are discussed.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2016.2558521","Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61302104,61401223,61522109); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20140887,BK20150040); Key Project of Natural Science Research of Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:15KJA510003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7467419","Artificial noise;beamforming;denial of service (DoS);diversity;eavesdropping attack;information-theoretic security;jamming;network protocol;wireless jamming;wireless networks;wireless security","Communication system security;Wireless networks;Jamming;Authentication;Noise measurement;Array signal processing;Network security","","1039","","202","CCBY","10 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep learning techniques have recently achieved impressive results in a variety of computer vision problems, raising expectations that they might be applied in other domains, such as medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN), designed for the classification of ILD patterns. The proposed network consists of 5 convolutional layers with 2$\,\times\,$2 kernels and LeakyReLU activations, followed by average pooling with size equal to the size of the final feature maps and three dense layers. The last dense layer has 7 outputs, equivalent to the classes considered: healthy, ground glass opacity (GGO), micronodules, consolidation, reticulation, honeycombing and a combination of GGO/reticulation. To train and evaluate the CNN, we used a dataset of 14696 image patches, derived by 120 CT scans from different scanners and hospitals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep CNN designed for the specific problem. A comparative analysis proved the effectiveness of the proposed CNN against previous methods in a challenging dataset. The classification performance ($\sim 85.5\%$) demonstrated the potential of CNNs in analyzing lung patterns. Future work includes, extending the CNN to three-dimensional data provided by CT volume scans and integrating the proposed method into a CAD system that aims to provide differential diagnosis for ILDs as a supportive tool for radiologists.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2535865","Bern University hospital Inselspital; Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF(grant numbers:156511); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422082","Convolutional neural networks;interstitial lung diseases;texture classification","Lungs;Computed tomography;Diseases;Feature extraction;Convolution;Design automation;Neural networks","Algorithms;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Lung;Lung Diseases, Interstitial;Neural Networks (Computer);Tomography, X-Ray Computed","987","13","41","OAPA","29 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to facilitate all these activities, there is an increase in the number of unmanned vehicles or devices deployed underwater, which require high bandwidth and high capacity for information transfer underwater. Although tremendous progress has been made in the field of acoustic communication underwater, however, it is limited by bandwidth. All this has led to the proliferation of underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC), as it provides higher data rates than the traditional acoustic communication systems with significantly lower power consumption and simpler computational complexities for short-range wireless links. UOWC has many potential applications ranging from deep oceans to coastal waters. However, the biggest challenge for underwater wireless communication originates from the fundamental characteristics of ocean or sea water; addressing these challenges requires a thorough understanding of complex physio-chemical biological systems. In this paper, the main focus is to understand the feasibility and the reliability of high data rate underwater optical links due to various propagation phenomena that impact the performance of the system. This paper provides an exhaustive overview of recent advances in UOWC. Channel characterization, modulation schemes, coding techniques, and various sources of noise which are specific to UOWC are discussed. This paper not only provides exhaustive research in underwater optical communication but also aims to provide the development of new ideas that would help in the growth of future underwater communication. A hybrid approach to an acousto-optic communication system is presented that complements the existing acoustic system, resulting in high data rates, low latency, and an energy-efficient system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2552538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7450595","Underwater optical wireless;optical beam propagation;visible light;radio frequency;acoustic communication;hybrid optical-acoustic system;modulation and coding;Underwater optical wireless;optical beam propagation;visible light;radio frequency;acoustic communication;hybrid optical-acoustic system;modulation and coding","Wireless communication;Optical fiber communication;Bandwidth allocation;Acoustic communication;Oceans;Underwater communication;Radio frequency;Modulation;Climate change","","962","2","232","OAPA","11 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to a large brute-force parameter set, we present a minimalistic set of voice parameters here. These were selected based on a) their potential to index affective physiological changes in voice production, b) their proven value in former studies as well as their automatic extractability, and c) their theoretical significance. The set is intended to provide a common baseline for evaluation of future research and eliminate differences caused by varying parameter sets or even different implementations of the same parameters.

In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art techniques used for energy consumption modeling and prediction for data centers and their components. We conduct an in-depth study of the existing literature on data center power modeling, covering more than 200 models. We organize these models in a hierarchical structure with two main branches focusing on hardware-centric and software-centric power models. Under hardware-centric approaches we start from the digital circuit level and move on to describe higher-level energy consumption models at the hardware component level, server level, data center level, and finally systems of systems level. Under the software-centric approaches we investigate power models developed for operating systems, virtual machines and software applications. This systematic approach allows us to identify multiple issues prevalent in power modeling of different levels of data center systems, including: i) few modeling efforts targeted at power consumption of the entire data center ii) many state-of-the-art power models are based on a few CPU or server metrics, and iii) the effectiveness and accuracy of these power models remain open questions.

At the same time, despite the prevalence of radio communication, there are still areas where traditional electromagnetic waves find it difficult or expensive to reach. Points of interest in industry, cities, and medical applications often lie in embedded and entrenched areas, accessible only by ventricles at scales too small for conventional radio waves and microwaves, or they are located in such a way that directional high frequency systems are ineffective. Inspired by nature, one solution to these problems is molecular communication (MC), where chemical signals are used to transfer information. Although biologists have studied MC for decades, it has only been researched for roughly 10 year from a communication engineering lens. Significant number of papers have been published to date, but owing to the need for interdisciplinary work, much of the results are preliminary. In this survey, the recent advancements in the field of MC engineering are highlighted. First, the biological, chemical, and physical processes used by an MC system are discussed. This includes different components of the MC transmitter and receiver, as well as the propagation and transport mechanisms.

This is motivated by the possible reduction in the number of RF chains and analog-to-digital converters. In these architectures, the analog processing network is usually based on variable phase shifters. In this paper, we propose hybrid architectures based on switching networks to reduce the complexity and the power consumption of the structures based on phase shifters. We define a power consumption model and use it to evaluate the energy efficiency of both structures. To estimate the complete MIMO channel, we propose an open-loop compressive channel estimation technique that is independent of the hardware used in the analog processing stage. We analyze the performance of the new estimation algorithm for hybrid architectures based on phase shifters and switches. Using the estimate, we develop two algorithms for the design of the hybrid combiner based on switches and analyze the achieved spectral efficiency. Finally, we study the tradeoffs between power consumption, hardware complexity, and spectral efficiency for hybrid architectures based on phase shifting networks and switching networks. Numerical results show that architectures based on switches obtain equal or better channel estimation performance to that obtained using phase shifters, while reducing hardware complexity and power consumption. For equal power consumption, all the hybrid architectures provide similar spectral efficiencies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2514261","Spanish Government within the European Regional Development Fund through the TACTICA Project and COMPASS Project(grant numbers:TEC2013-47020-C2-1-R); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF-CCF-1319556); Nokia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7370753","Millimeter wave;hybrid architecture;switches;channel estimation;precoding","Channel estimation;Radio frequency;Power demand;Phase shifters;MIMO;Switches;Antenna arrays;Millimeter wave communication;Hybrid systems","","677","13","93","OAPA","1 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed algorithm, the nondominated sorting scheme based on the introduced new dominance relation is employed to rank solutions in the environmental selection phase, ensuring both convergence and diversity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of well-known benchmark problems having 3-15 objectives and compared against eight state-of-the-art algorithms.

In NOMA, by exploiting the channel gain differences, multiple users are multiplexed into transmission power domain and then non-orthogonally scheduled for transmission on the same spectrum resources. Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is then applied at the receivers to decode the message signals. In this paper, first, we briefly describe the differences in the working principles of uplink and downlink NOMA transmissions in a cellular wireless system. Then, for both uplink and downlink NOMAs, we formulate a sum-throughput maximization problem in a cell such that the user clustering (i.e., grouping users into a single cluster or multiple clusters) and power allocations in NOMA clusters can be optimized under transmission power constraints, minimum rate requirements of the users, and SIC constraints. Due to the combinatorial nature of the formulated mixed integer non-linear programming problem, we solve the problem in two steps, i.e., by first grouping users into clusters and then optimizing their respective power allocations. In particular, we propose a low-complexity sub-optimal user grouping scheme. The proposed scheme exploits the channel gain differences among users in an NOMA cluster and groups them into a single cluster or multiple clusters in order to enhance the sum-throughput of the system. For a given set of NOMA clusters, we then derive the optimal power allocation policy that maximizes the sum-throughput per NOMA cluster and in turn maximizes the overall system throughput. Using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, closed-form solutions for optimal power allocations are derived for any cluster size, considering both uplink and downlink NOMA systems. Numerical results compare the performances of NOMA and OMA and illustrate the significance of NOMA in various network scenarios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2604821","Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7557079","5G cellular;non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA);orthogonal multiple access (OMA);power allocation;throughput maximization;user grouping","NOMA;Resource management;Uplink;Downlink;5G mobile communication;Multiplexing;Silicon carbide","","537","","18","OAPA","31 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Techniques that are used for natural images fail to utilize structural properties of stained tissue samples and produce undesirable color distortions. The stain concentration cannot be negative. Tissue samples are stained with only a few stains and most tissue regions are characterized by at most one effective stain. We model these physical phenomena that define the tissue structure by first decomposing images in an unsupervised manner into stain density maps that are sparse and non-negative. For a given image, we combine its stain density maps with stain color basis of a pathologist-preferred target image, thus altering only its color while preserving its structure described by the maps.

However, images captured using typical real-world mobile camera devices are usually afflicted by complex mixtures of multiple distortions, which are not necessarily well-modeled by the synthetic distortions found in existing databases. The originators of existing legacy databases usually conducted human psychometric studies to obtain statistically meaningful sets of human opinion scores on images in a stringently controlled visual environment, resulting in small data collections relative to other kinds of image analysis databases. Toward overcoming these limitations, we designed and created a new database that we call the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database, which contains widely diverse authentic image distortions on a large number of images captured using a representative variety of modern mobile devices. We also designed and implemented a new online crowdsourcing system, which we have used to conduct a very large-scale, multi-month image quality assessment (IQA) subjective study. Our database consists of over 350 000 opinion scores on 1162 images evaluated by over 8100 unique human observers. Despite the lack of control over the experimental environments of the numerous study participants, we demonstrate excellent internal consistency of the subjective data set.

Hence, the wireless research community aspires to conceive full-duplex (FD) operation for supporting concurrent transmission and reception in a single time/frequency channel, which would improve the attainable spectral efficiency by a factor of two. The main challenge encountered in implementing an FD wireless device is the large power difference between the self-interference (SI) imposed by the device’s own transmissions and the signal of interest received from a remote source. In this survey, we present a comprehensive list of the potential FD techniques and highlight their pros and cons. We classify the SI cancellation techniques into three categories, namely passive suppression, analog cancellation and digital cancellation, with the advantages and disadvantages of each technique compared. Specifically, we analyze the main impairments (e.g., phase noise, power amplifier nonlinearity, as well as in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalance, etc.) that degrading the SI cancellation. We then discuss the FD-based media access control (MAC)-layer protocol design for the sake of addressing some of the critical issues, such as the problem of hidden terminals, the resultant end-to-end delay and the high packet loss ratio (PLR) due to network congestion. After elaborating on a variety of physical/MAC-layer techniques, we discuss potential solutions conceived for meeting the challenges imposed by the aforementioned techniques. Furthermore, we also discuss a range of critical issues related to the implementation, performance enhancement and optimization of FD systems, including important topics such as hybrid FD/HD scheme, optimal relay selection and optimal power allocation, etc. Finally, a variety of new directions and open problems associated with FD technology are pointed out.

Nevertheless, a new bottleneck has emerged: the backhaul. The ultra-dense and heavy traffic cells should be connected to the core network through the backhaul, often with extreme requirements in terms of capacity, latency, availability, energy, and cost efficiency. This pioneering survey explains the 5G backhaul paradigm, presents a critical analysis of legacy, cutting-edge solutions, and new trends in backhauling, and proposes a novel consolidated 5G backhaul framework. A new joint radio access and backhaul perspective is proposed for the evaluation of backhaul technologies which reinforces the belief that no single solution can solve the holistic 5G backhaul problem. This paper also reveals hidden advantages and shortcomings of backhaul solutions, which are not evident when backhaul technologies are inspected as an independent part of the 5G network. This survey is key in identifying essential catalysts that are believed to jointly pave the way to solving the beyond-2020 backhauling challenge.

The fact that expert tasks are being outsourced to non-expert users may lead to noisy annotations introducing disagreement between users. Despite being a valuable resource for learning annotation models from crowdsourcing, conventional machine-learning methods may have difficulties dealing with noisy annotations during training. In this manuscript, we present a new concept for learning from crowds that handle data aggregation directly as part of the learning process of the convolutional neural network (CNN) via additional crowdsourcing layer (AggNet). Besides, we present an experimental study on learning from crowds designed to answer the following questions. 1) Can deep CNN be trained with data collected from crowdsourcing? 2) How to adapt the CNN to train on multiple types of annotation datasets (ground truth and crowd-based)? 3) How does the choice of annotation and aggregation affect the accuracy?

This observation recently leads to hybridizing PSO with GA for performance enhancement. However, existing work uses a mechanistic parallel superposition and research has shown that construction of superior exemplars in PSO is more effective. Hence, this paper first develops a new framework so as to organically hybridize PSO with another optimization technique for “learning.” This leads to a generalized “learning PSO” paradigm, the *L-PSO. The paradigm is composed of two cascading layers, the first for exemplar generation and the second for particle updates as per a normal PSO algorithm. Using genetic evolution to breed promising exemplars for PSO, a specific novel *L-PSO algorithm is proposed in the paper, termed genetic learning PSO (GL-PSO). In particular, genetic operators are used to generate exemplars from which particles learn and, in turn, historical search information of particles provides guidance to the evolution of the exemplars. By performing crossover, mutation, and selection on the historical information of particles, the constructed exemplars are not only well diversified, but also high qualified. Under such guidance, the global search ability and search efficiency of PSO are both enhanced. The proposed GL-PSO is tested on 42 benchmark functions widely adopted in the literature. Experimental results verify the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and scalability of the GL-PSO.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2475174","National High-Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China(grant numbers:2013AA01A212); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61125205); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61332002,61502542); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7271066","Exemplar construction;genetic algorithm (GA);hybrid method;learning scheme;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Sociology;Statistics;Animals;Convergence;Algorithm design and analysis","Algorithms;Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Bees;Computer Simulation;Genetics, Behavioral;Models, Genetic","437","","57","OAPA","17 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the stabilizing effect is more difficult to be guaranteed for cost-optimized filters, which are characterized by low-inductance and high-capacitance passive components. In this paper, several passive filter topologies used to interface voltage-source converters with the utility grid are reviewed and evaluated in terms of damping capability, stored energy in the passive components, and power loss in the damping circuit.

Unlike most traditional approaches that rely on the construction of complex handcrafted features, our approach learns high-level spatiotemporal representations using deep neural networks suited to the input modality: a Gaussian-Bernouilli Deep Belief Network (DBN) to handle skeletal dynamics, and a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) to manage and fuse batches of depth and RGB images.

Bit rate savings compared with HEVC simulcast are achieved by enabling the use of inter-view references in motion-compensated prediction.

Each of these models has been recently studied for use in standards bodies such as 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and for use in the design of fifth-generation wireless systems in urban macrocell, urban microcell, and indoor office and shopping mall scenarios. Here, we compare the accuracy and sensitivity of these models using measured data from 30 propagation measurement data sets from 2 to 73 GHz over distances ranging from 4 to 1238 m. A series of sensitivity analyses of the three models shows that the four-parameter ABG model underpredicts path loss when relatively close to the transmitter, and overpredicts path loss far from the transmitter, and that the physically based two-parameter CI model and three-parameter CIF model offer computational simplicity, have very similar goodness of fit (i.e., the shadow fading standard deviation), exhibit more stable model parameter behavior across frequencies and distances, and yield smaller prediction error in sensitivity tests across distances and frequencies, when compared to the four-parameter ABG model. Results show the CI model with a 1-m reference distance is suitable for outdoor environments, while the CIF model is more appropriate for indoor modeling. The CI and CIF models are easily implemented in existing 3GPP models by making a very subtle modification - by replacing a floating non-physically based constant with a frequency-dependent constant that represents free-space path loss in the first meter of propagation. This paper shows this subtle change does not change the mathematical form of existing ITU/3GPP models and offers much easier analysis, intuitive appeal, better model parameter stability, and better accuracy in sensitivity tests over a vast range of microwave and mmWave frequencies, scenarios, and distances, while using a simpler model with fewer parameters.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2016.2543139","AT and T; CableLabs; Ericsson; Huawei; Intel Corporation; InterDigital Inc.; Keysight Technologies; L3 Communications; Nokia; National Instruments; Qualcomm Technologies; Samsung Corporation; SiBeam; Straight Path Communications; Cablevision; UMC; XO Communications; GAANN Fellowship Program; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1555332); NeTS Medium(grant numbers:1302336); NeTS Small(grant numbers:1320472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7434656","Millimeter wave;path loss models;prediction accuracy;5G;Millimeter wave;path loss models;prediction accuracy;5G","Antenna measurements;Loss measurement;Frequency measurement;Predictive models;Propagation losses;Computational modeling","","344","","47","OAPA","16 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Applications span from automatic classification for big data management, through unmanned vehicle control, to control for biomedical prosthesis. However, one of the major challenges of fabricating bioinspired hardware is building ultrahigh-density networks out of complex processing units interlinked by tunable connections. Nanometer-scale devices exploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this context. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are well suited for this purpose because of their multiple tunable functionalities. One such functionality, nonvolatile memory, can provide massive embedded memory in unconventional circuits, thus escaping the von-Neumann bottleneck arising when memory and processors are located separately. Other features of spintronic devices that could be beneficial for bioinspired computing include tunable fast nonlinear dynamics, controlled stochasticity, and the ability of single devices to change functions in different operating conditions. Large networks of interacting spintronic nanodevices can have their interactions tuned to induce complex dynamics such as synchronization, chaos, soliton diffusion, phase transitions, criticality, and convergence to multiple metastable states. A number of groups have recently proposed bioinspired architectures that include one or several types of spintronic nanodevices. In this paper, we show how spintronics can be used for bioinspired computing. We review the different approaches that have been proposed, the recent advances in this direction, and the challenges toward fully integrated spintronics complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) bioinspired hardware.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2016.2597152","European Research Council(grant numbers:682955); European FET-OPEN Bambi(grant numbers:618024); French ANR MEMOS(grant numbers:ANR-14-CE26-0021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7563364","Bioinspired computing;magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs);spintronics","Nanoscale devices;Bionanotechnology;Spintronics;Magnetic tunneling;Big data;Prosthetics","","343","4","147","OAPA","8 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In networks employing IEEE 802.11p only, the broadcast storm and disconnected network problems at high and low vehicle densities, respectively, degrade the delay and delivery ratio of safety message dissemination. Recently, as an alternative to the IEEE 802.11p-based VANET, the usage of cellular technologies has been investigated due to their low latency and wide-range communication. However, a pure cellular-based VANET communication is not feasible due to the high cost of communication between the vehicles and the base stations and the high number of handoff occurrences at the base station, considering the high mobility of the vehicles. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture, namely, VMaSC-LTE, combining IEEE 802.11p-based multihop clustering and the fourth-generation (4G) cellular system, i.e., Long-Term Evolution (LTE), with the goal of achieving a high data packet delivery ratio (DPDR) and low delay while keeping the usage of the cellular architecture at a minimum level. In VMaSC-LTE, vehicles are clustered based on a novel approach named Vehicular Multihop algorithm for Stable Clustering (VMaSC). The features of VMaSC are cluster head (CH) selection using the relative mobility metric calculated as the average relative speed with respect to the neighboring vehicles, cluster connection with minimum overhead by introducing a direct connection to the neighbor that is already a head or a member of a cluster instead of connecting to the CH in multiple hops, disseminating cluster member information within periodic hello packets, reactive clustering to maintain the cluster structure without excessive consumption of network resources, and efficient size- and hop-limited cluster merging mechanism based on the exchange of cluster information among CHs. These features decrease the number of CHs while increasing their stability, therefore minimizing the usage of the cellular architecture. From the clustered topology, elected CHs operate as dual-interface nodes with the functionality of the IEEE 802.11p and LTE interface to link the VANET to the LTE network. Using various key metrics of interest, including DPDR, delay, control overhead, and clustering stability, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed architecture compared with both previously proposed hybrid architectures and alternative routing mechanisms, including flooding and cluster-based routing via extensive simulations in ns-3 with the vehicle mobility input from the Simulation of Urban Mobility. The proposed architecture also allows achieving higher required reliability of the application quantified by the DPDR at the cost of higher LTE usage measured by the number of CHs in the network.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2421277","Turk Telekom Research project(grant numbers:11315-07); Bilim Akademisi—The Science Academy, Turkey through the BAGEP program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081788","vehicular ad hoc networks;clustering;IEEE 802.11p;LTE;safety application;message dissemination;Clustering;IEEE 802.11p;Long-Term Evolution (LTE);message dissemination;safety application;vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)","Vehicles;Delays;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Safety;Computer architecture;Long Term Evolution","","341","","48","OAPA","8 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results show that deep learning is suitable for characterizing Android malware and especially effective with the availability of more training data.

The interferometric processing of TOPS data however requires special consideration of the signal properties, resulting from the ScanSAR-type burst imaging and the antenna beam steering in azimuth. The high Doppler rate in azimuth sets very stringent coregistration requirements, making the use of enhanced spectral diversity (ESD) necessary to obtain the required fine azimuth coregistration accuracy. Other unique aspects of processing IW data, such as azimuth spectral filtering, image resampling, and data deramping and reramping, are reviewed, giving a recipe-like description that enables the user community to use S-1 IW mode repeat-pass SAR data.

However, due to the nature of contour lines for the adopted aggregation functions, they usually fail to preserve the diversity in high-dimensional objective space even by using diverse weight vectors. To address this problem, we propose to maintain the desired diversity of solutions in their evolutionary process explicitly by exploiting the perpendicular distance from the solution to the weight vector in the objective space, which achieves better balance between convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. The idea is implemented to enhance two well-performing decomposition-based algorithms, i.e., MOEA, based on decomposition and ensemble fitness ranking. The two enhanced algorithms are compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms and a series of comparative experiments are conducted on a number of test problems from two well-known test suites.

However, such instruments tend to be expensive and require expert operation and maintenance besides their high cost, thus limiting them to only a small number of specialized centers. Consequently, gait analysis in most clinics today still relies on observation-based assessment. Recent advances in wearable sensors, especially inertial body sensors, have opened up a promising future for gait analysis. Not only can these sensors be more easily adopted in clinical diagnosis and treatment procedures than their current counterparts, but they can also monitor gait continuously outside clinics – hence providing seamless patient analysis from clinics to free-living environments. The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of current techniques for quantitative gait analysis and to propose key metrics for evaluating both existing and emerging methods for qualifying the gait features extracted from wearable sensors. It aims to highlight key advances in this rapidly evolving research field and outline potential future directions for both research and clinical applications.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2608720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7574303","Free-living gait analysis;gait analysis;inertial sensors;insole pressure sensors;medical applications;quantitative gait analysis;wearable sensors","Wearable sensors;Optical variables measurement;Pressure measurement;Biomedical measurement;Motion measurement;Legged locomotion;Medical services","Accelerometry;Algorithms;Biomechanical Phenomena;Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","315","","144","OAPA","22 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose new filters based on 3D rotating frames in so-called orientation scores, which are functions on the Lie-group domain of positions and orientations ℝ2 × S1. By means of a wavelet-type transform, a 2D image is lifted to a 3D orientation score, where elongated structures are disentangled into their corresponding orientation planes. In the lifted domain ℝ2 × S1, vessels are enhanced by means of multi-scale second-order Gaussian derivatives perpendicular to the line structures. More precisely, we use a left-invariant rotating derivative (LID) frame, and a locally adaptive derivative (LAD) frame. The LAD is adaptive to the local line structures and is found by eigensystem analysis of the left-invariant Hessian matrix (computed with the LID). After multi-scale filtering via the LID or LAD in the orientation score domain, the results are projected back to the 2D image plane giving us the enhanced vessels. Then a binary segmentation is obtained through thresholding. The proposed methods are validated on six retinal image datasets with different image types, on which competitive segmentation performances are achieved. In particular, the proposed algorithm of applying the LAD filter on orientation scores (LAD-OS) outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods. The LAD-OS is capable of dealing with typically difficult cases like crossings, central arterial reflex, closely parallel and tiny vessels. The high computational speed of the proposed methods allows processing of large datasets in a screening setting.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2587062","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201206300010); NWO-H’e Programme of Innovation Cooperation(grant numbers:629.001.003); European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes/Chinese Diabetes Society/Lilly; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530915","Gaussian derivatives;orientation scores;retinal image analysis;rotating filter;vessel segmentation","Image segmentation;Retinal vessels;Robustness;Transforms;Two dimensional displays;Feature extraction","Algorithms;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ophthalmoscopy;Retinal Vessels;Wavelet Analysis","312","","40","OAPA","3 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort.

Many control signals for state-of-the-art BCIs involve imagining the movement of body parts that have little to do with the output command, revealing a cognitive disconnection between the user's intent and the action of the end effector. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques that can identify with high spatial resolution the self-modulated neural activity reflective of the actions of a helpful output device. Methods: We extend previous EEG source imaging (ESI) work to decoding natural hand/wrist manipulations by applying a novel technique to classifying four complex motor imaginations of the right hand: flexion, extension, supination, and pronation. Results: We report an increase of up to 18.6% for individual task classification and 12.7% for overall classification using the proposed ESI approach over the traditional sensor-based method. Conclusion: ESI is able to enhance BCI performance of decoding complex right-hand motor imagery tasks.

We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.","2332-7804","","10.1109/TMBMC.2016.2633265","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:HR0011-16-C-0016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809160","Dynamical systems;network inference;nonlinear dynamics;biological networks;machine learning;sparse selection;non-convex optimization","Biological system modeling;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Biochemistry;Machine learning;Computational modeling","","255","","83","OAPA","20 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The motivation lies in the significant advantages provided by this class of non-linear signals. For this aim, many communication schemes and applications have been specially designed for chaos-based communication systems where energy, data rate, and synchronization awareness are considered in most designs. Recently, the major focus, however, has been given to the non-coherent chaos-based systems to benefit from the advantages of chaotic signals and non-coherent detection and to avoid the use of chaotic synchronization, which suffers from weak performance in the presence of additive noise. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the entire wireless radio frequency chaos-based communication systems. First, it outlines the challenges of chaos implementations and synchronization methods, followed by comprehensive literature review and analysis of chaos-based coherent techniques and their applications. In the second part of the survey, we offer a taxonomy of the current literature by focusing on non-coherent detection methods. For each modulation class, this paper categorizes different transmission techniques by elaborating on its modulation, receiver type, data rate, complexity, energy efficiency, multiple access scheme, and performance.

However, in most cases, commercial clinical databases have been designed to document clinical activity for reporting, liability, and billing reasons, rather than for developing new algorithms. With increasing excitement surrounding “secondary use of medical records” and “Big Data” analytics, it is important to understand the limitations of current databases and what needs to change in order to enter an era of “precision medicine.” This review article covers many of the issues involved in the collection and preprocessing of critical care data.

Wearable devices enables gait to be measured in naturalistic environments, however questions remain regarding validity. Previous research suggests that when compared with a laboratory reference, measurement accuracy is acceptable for mean but not variability or asymmetry gait characteristics. Some fundamental reasons for this have been presented, (e.g., synchronization, different sampling frequencies) but to date this has not been systematically examined. The aims of this study were to: 1) quantify a comprehensive range of gait characteristics measured using a single triaxial accelerometer-based monitor; 2) examine outcomes and monitor performance in measuring gait in older adults and those with Parkinson's disease (PD); and 3) carry out a detailed comparison with those derived from an instrumented walkway to account for any discrepancies. Fourteen gait characteristics were quantified in 30 people with incident PD and 30 healthy age-matched controls. Of the 14 gait characteristics compared, agreement between instruments was excellent for four (ICCs 0.913-0.983); moderate for four (ICCs 0.508-0.766); and poor for six characteristics (ICCs 0.637-0.370). Further analysis revealed that differences reflect an increased sensitivity of accelerometry to detect motion, rather than measurement error. This is most likely because accelerometry measures gait as a continuous activity rather than discrete footfall events, per instrumented tools. The increased sensitivity shown for these characteristics will be of particular interest to researchers keen to interpret “real-world” gait data. In conclusion, use of a body-worn monitor is recommended for the measurement of gait but is likely to yield more sensitive data for asymmetry and variability features.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2419317","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); Newcastle Biomedical Research Unit; Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Newcastle University; GlaxoSmithKline; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078919","Accelerometer;algorithm;body worn monitor;Instrumented gait;instrumented walkway;Accelerometer;algorithm;body-worn monitor;instrumented gait;instrumented walkway","Instruments;Integrated circuits;Biomedical measurement;Diseases;Accelerometers;Mathematical model;Legged locomotion","Accelerometry;Aged;Algorithms;Female;Gait;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","250","2","48","OAPA","2 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The review covers a wide spectrum of communication operations, including the accurate modeling of high mobility channels, the transceiver structures that can exploit the properties of high mobility environments, the signal processing techniques that can harvest the benefits (e.g., Doppler diversity) and mitigate the impairments (e.g., carrier frequency offset, intercarrier interference, channel estimation errors) in high mobility systems, and the mobility management and network architectures that are designed specifically for high mobility systems. The survey focuses primarily on physical layer operations, which are affected the most by the mobile environment, with some additional discussions on higher layer operations, such as handover management and control-plane/user-plane decoupling, which are essential to high mobility operations.

The I-DEMS is an optimal or near-optimal DEMS capable of performing grid-connected and islanded microgrid operations. The primary sources of energy are sustainable, green, and environmentally friendly renewable energy systems (RESs), e.g., wind and solar; however, these forms of energy are uncertain and nondispatchable. Backup battery energy storage and thermal generation were used to overcome these challenges. Using the I-DEMS to schedule dispatches allowed the RESs and energy storage devices to be utilized to their maximum in order to supply the critical load at all times. Based on the microgrid's system states, the I-DEMS generates energy dispatch control signals, while a forward-looking network evaluates the dispatched control signals over time. Typical results are presented for varying generation and load profiles, and the performance of I-DEMS is compared with that of a decision tree approach-based DEMS (D-DEMS).

However, since the source model in IVA is based on a spherical multivariate distribution, IVA cannot utilize specific spectral structures such as the harmonic structures of pitched instrumental sounds. To solve this problem, we introduce NMF decomposition as the source model in IVA to capture the spectral structures. The formulation of the proposed method is derived from conventional multichannel NMF (MNMF), which reveals the relationship between MNMF and IVA.

In this paper, a framework is offered for detecting the epileptic seizures from EEG data recorded from normal subjects and epileptic patients. This framework is based on a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) analysis of EEG signals using linear and nonlinear classifiers. The performance of the 14 different combinations of two-class epilepsy detection is studied using naïve Bayes (NB) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers for the derived statistical features from DWT. It has been found that the NB classifier performs better and shows an accuracy of 100% for the individual and combined statistical features derived from the DWT values of normal eyes open and epileptic EEG data provided by the University of Bonn, Germany. It has been found that the computation time of NB classifier is lesser than k-NN to provide better accuracy. So, the detection of an epileptic seizure based on DWT statistical features using NB classifiers is more suitable in real time for a reliable, automatic epileptic seizure detection system to enhance the patient's care and the quality of life.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2585661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502139","Electroencephalograms (EEG);epilepsy;discrete wavelet transform (DWT);naïve Bayes (NB);k-nearest neighbor (k-NN)","Discrete wavelet transforms;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Bayes methods;Physiology;Brain models;Seizures","","240","","49","OAPA","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Algorithms based on Pareto criterion (PC) can suffer from problems such as slow convergence to the optimal front and inferior performance on problems with many objectives. Non-Pareto criterion (NPC), such as decomposition-based criterion and indicator-based criterion, has already shown promising results in this regard, but its high selection pressure may lead to the algorithm to prefer some specific areas of the problem's Pareto front, especially when the front is highly irregular. In this paper, we propose a bi-criterion evolution (BCE) framework of the PC and NPC, which attempts to make use of their strengths and compensates for each other's weaknesses. The proposed framework consists of two parts: PC evolution and NPC evolution. The two parts work collaboratively, with an abundant exchange of information to facilitate each other's evolution. Specifically, the NPC evolution leads the PC evolution forward and the PC evolution compensates the possible diversity loss of the NPC evolution. The proposed framework keeps the freedom on the implementation of the NPC evolution part, thus making it applicable for any non-Pareto-based algorithm. In the PC evolution, two operations, population maintenance and individual exploration, are presented. The former is to maintain a set of representative nondominated individuals and the latter is to explore some promising areas that are undeveloped (or not well-developed) in the NPC evolution. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The BCE works well on seven groups of 42 test problems with various characteristics, including those in which Pareto-based algorithms or non-Pareto-based algorithms struggle.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2015.2504730","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) of the U.K.(grant numbers:EP/K001310/1); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Major International Joint Research Project)(grant numbers:71110107026,61273031); EPSRC Industrial Case(grant numbers:11220252); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347391","Bi-criterion evolution (BCE);evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);non-Pareto criterion (NPC);Pareto criterion (PC)","Sociology;Pareto optimization;Search problems;Maintenance engineering;Convergence","","232","","82","OAPA","4 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of passive damping does provide a robust solution to address these issues, but at the price of reduced efficiency due to the presence of additional passive components. Hence, a new method is proposed in this paper to optimally design the passive damping circuit for the LCL filters and LCL with multituned LC traps. In short, the optimization problem reduces to the proper choice of the multisplit capacitors or inductors in the high-order filter. Compared to existing design procedures, the proposed method simplifies the iterative design of the overall filter while ensuring the minimum resonance peak with a lower damping capacitor and a lower rated resistor. It is shown that there is only one optimal value of the damping resistor or quality factor to achieve a minimum filter resonance. The passive filters are designed, built, and validated both analytically and experimentally for verification.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2015.2441299","European Research Council(grant numbers:Harmony/321149); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118223","LCL filter;harmonic passive filters;resonance damping;trap filter;voltage-source converters;Harmonic passive filters;LCL filter;resonance damping;trap filter;voltage-source converters","Passive filters;Power harmonic filters;Damping;Resonant frequency;Resistors;Power filters;Capacitors","","228","","30","OAPA","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a computationally simple denoising algorithm using the nonlocal self-similarity and the low-rank approximation (LRA). The proposed method consists of three basic steps. First, our method classifies similar image patches by the block-matching technique to form the similar patch groups, which results in the similar patch groups to be low rank. Next, each group of similar patches is factorized by singular value decomposition (SVD) and estimated by taking only a few largest singular values and corresponding singular vectors. Finally, an initial denoised image is generated by aggregating all processed patches. For low-rank matrices, SVD can provide the optimal energy compaction in the least square sense. The proposed method exploits the optimal energy compaction property of SVD to lead an LRA of similar patch groups. Unlike other SVD-based methods, the LRA in SVD domain avoids learning the local basis for representing image patches, which usually is computationally expensive. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce noise and be competitive with the current state-of-the-art denoising algorithms in terms of both quantitative metrics and subjective visual quality.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2416631","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61202150,61272245,61373078,61332015,61472220); National Natural Science Foundation of China Joint Fund with Guangdong(grant numbers:U1201258); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2013M531600); Program for Scientific Research Innovation Team in Colleges and Universities of Shandong Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067415","Back projection;image denoising;low-rank approximation;patch grouping;self-similarity;singular value decomposition;Back projection;image denoising;low-rank approximation (LRA);patch grouping;self-similarity;singular value decomposition (SVD)","Noise reduction;Noise;Image denoising;Least squares approximations;Principal component analysis;Noise measurement","","228","4","49","OAPA","25 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The novelty lies in the approach to formulating the inertia constant and primary power reserve for a variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) that operates at derated conditions. The formulations are extended to evaluate the capability of providing inertia and primary frequency support from a wind farm using an aggregated wind speed. As a consequence, the capability as a function of VSWT operating characteristics and conditions is quantified to rationally adjust the frequency controller gains, thereby ensuring stable performance of the wind farms during frequency transients. A modified system frequency response (SFR) model considering available inertial and droop responses from wind farms is developed to well simulate the SFR following wind power fluctuations.

The novelty of this new scheme is that it confronts the challenge that the existing MIMO-NOMA schemes rely on the assumption that users’ channel conditions are different, a strong assumption which may not be valid in practice. The developed precoding and detection strategies can effectively create a significant difference between the users’ effective channel gains, and therefore, the potential of NOMA can be realized even if the users’ original channel conditions are similar.

In particular, the Euclidean distance between vectors of these perceptual features is invariant to commonly used digital operations to images (e.g., JPEG compression, gamma correction, and brightness/contrast adjustment), which helps in making image hash compact and discriminative. We conduct experiments to evaluate the efficiency with 250 color images, and demonstrate that the proposed hashing algorithm is robust at commonly used digital operations to images.

Changes in the sensor are wirelessly and remotely detected by the readout coil, which makes them highly useful in applications that require the sensor to be powered remotely and to occupy a small volume, such as harsh and sealed environments, where physical access to the sensor is difficult. Although the sensor to accomplish this function dates from the 1960's, its rapid extension over the past decades has benefited from microelectromechanical systems. This paper provides an overview of the status and challenges in the LC passive wireless sensor toward a wireless sensing platform. The basic sensing principles are first categorized into detecting changes of the sensor in response to the capacitance, resistance, inductance, or coupling distance due to the parameter of interest through monitoring the impedance magnitude and phase spectrum. The present state of the art in sensor applications for pressure, strain, temperature, humidity, biochemical, gas, and so on is then reviewed and compared. For emerging applications from many Internet of Things scenarios, geometrical constraints, such as small and non-invasive coils, reduce the magnetic coupling between the sensor and the readout coil, resulting in a limited interrogation distance. Furthermore, an increasing number of applications also require the simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters. Recent efforts to increase the interrogation distance and to extend the measurement of single parameter to multiple parameters are finally outlined.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2602298","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61136006,61401084); National High Technology Development Program of China(grant numbers:2015AA042602); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7558121","Inductor-capacitor (LC);magnetic coupling;passive;wireless;sensor","Inductors;Capacitors;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Couplings;Magnetic sensors","","200","","145","OAPA","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We apply a novel algorithm based on recursive Bayesian filtering, named Channel-SLAM. This approach treats multipath components as signals emitted from virtual transmitters, which are time synchronized to the physical transmitter and static in their positions. Contrary to other approaches, Channel-SLAM considers also paths occurring due to multiple numbers of reflections or scattering as well as the combination. Hence, each received multipath component increases the number of transmitters resulting in a more accurate position estimate or enabling positioning when the number of physical transmitters is insufficient. Channel-SLAM estimates the receiver position and the positions of the virtual transmitters simultaneously; hence, the approach does not require any prior information, such as a room-layout or a database for fingerprinting. The only prior knowledge needed is the physical transmitter position as well as the initial receiver position and moving direction. Based on simulations, the position precision of Channel-SLAM is evaluated by a comparison to simplified algorithms and to the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound. Furthermore, this paper shows the performance of Channel-SLAM based on measurements in an indoor scenario with only a single physical transmitter.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2016.2578336","DLR internal project Dependable Navigation; European Union‘s FP7 project(grant numbers:287242); European Union‘s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:636537); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7487067","Channel-SLAM;CRLB;multipath;positioning;particle filter;SLAM","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Wireless communication;Receiving antennas;Radio transmitters;Scattering","","199","2","51","OAPA","8 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the droop control strategy changes its form for inverters with different types of output impedance, and so far, it is impossible to operate inverters with inductive and capacitive output impedances in parallel. In this paper, it is shown that there exists a universal droop control principle for inverters with output impedance having a phase angle between -(π/2) rad and (π/2) rad. It takes the form of the droop control for inverters with resistive output impedance (R-inverters). Hence, the robust droop controller recently proposed in the literature for R-inverters actually provides one way to implement such a universal droop controller that can be applied to all practical inverters without the need of knowing the impedance angle. The small-signal stability of an inverter equipped with the universal droop controller is analyzed, and it is shown to be stable when the phase angle of the output impedance changes from -(π/2) rad to (π/2) rad. Both real-time simulation results and experimental results from a test rig consisting of an R-inverter, an L-inverter, and a C-inverter operated in parallel are presented to validate the proposed strategy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2526616","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, U.K.(grant numbers:EP/J001333/2,EP/J01558X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7400908","C-inverters;L-inverters;output impedance;parallel operation of inverters;R-inverters;robust droop controller;universal droop controller;C-inverters;L-inverters;output impedance;parallel operation of inverters;R-inverters;robust droop controller;universal droop controller","Inverters;Impedance;Reactive power;Robustness;Voltage control;Stability analysis;Frequency control;Droop controllers;Stability analysis;Real-time systems","","198","","23","OAPA","8 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the low-rank assumption is not sufficient for the recovery of visual data, such as color and 3D images, when the ratio of missing data is extremely high. In this paper, we consider “smoothness” constraints as well as low-rank approximations and propose an efficient algorithm for performing tensor completion that is particularly powerful regarding visual data. The proposed method admits significant advantages, owing to the integration of smooth PARAFAC decomposition for incomplete tensors and the efficient selection of models in order to minimize the tensor rank. Thus, our proposed method is termed as “smooth PARAFAC tensor completion (SPC).” In order to impose the smoothness constraints, we employ two strategies, total variation (SPC-TV) and quadratic variation (SPC-QV), and invoke the corresponding algorithms for model learning. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world visual data illustrate the significant improvements of our method, in terms of both prediction performance and efficiency, compared with many state-of-the-art tensor completion methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2016.2586759","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:15K16067,15K15955); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502115","Tensor completion for images;smoothness;low-rank tensor approximation;CP model;PARAFAC model;total variation (TV);quadratic variation","Tensile stress;TV;Minimization;Matrix decomposition;Visualization;Image color analysis;Interpolation","","195","1","82","OAPA","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is due to a high proportion of nondominated solutions in the population and low selection pressure toward the Pareto front. In order to tackle this issue, a series of indicator-based algorithms have been proposed to guide the search process toward the Pareto front. However, a single indicator might be biased and lead the population to converge to a subregion of the Pareto front. In this paper, a multi-indicator-based algorithm is proposed for many-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm, namely stochastic ranking-based multi-indicator Algorithm (SRA), adopts the stochastic ranking technique to balance the search biases of different indicators. Empirical studies on a large number (39 in total) of problem instances from two well-defined benchmark sets with 5, 10, and 15 objectives demonstrate that SRA performs well in terms of inverted generational distance and hypervolume metrics when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. Empirical studies also reveal that, in the case a problem requires the algorithm to have strong convergence ability, the performance of SRA can be further improved by incorporating a direction-based archive to store well-converged solutions and maintain diversity.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2016.2549267","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61329302,61175065,61573328); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(grant numbers:NCET-12-0512); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/K001523/1,EP/I010297/1); Royal Society Newton Advanced Fellowship(grant numbers:NA150123); Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7445185","Archive method;many-objective evolutionary algorithm;multi-indicator;multiobjective optimization;stochastic ranking","Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Convergence;Algorithm design and analysis;Evolutionary computation;Benchmark testing","","194","","51","CCBY","31 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although the state-of-the-art wavelet denoising methods perform better than other denoising methods, they are not very effective for experimental signals. Unlike images and other signals, experimental signals in chemical and biophysical applications, for example, are less tolerant to signal distortion and under-denoising caused by the standard wavelet denoising methods. The new method: 1) provides a method to select the number of decomposition levels to denoise; 2) uses a new formula to calculate noise thresholds that does not require noise estimation; 3) uses separate noise thresholds for positive and negative wavelet coefficients; 4) applies denoising to the approximation component; and 5) allows the flexibility to adjust the noise thresholds. The new method is applied to continuous wave electron spin resonance spectra and it is found that it increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 32 dB without distorting the signal, whereas standard denoising methods improve the SNR by less than 10 dB and with some distortion.

Therefore, a well-designed battery pack is essential for battery applications. In the literature, the majority of research in battery pack design focuses on battery management system, safety circuit, and cell-balancing strategies. Recently, the reconfigurable battery pack design has gained increasing attentions as a promising solution to solve the problems existing in the conventional battery packs and associated battery management systems, such as low energy efficiency, short pack lifespan, safety issues, and low reliability. One of the most prominent features of reconfigurable battery packs is that the battery cell topology can be dynamically reconfigured in the real-time fashion based on the current condition (in terms of the state of charge and the state of health) of battery cells. So far, there are several reconfigurable battery schemes having been proposed and validated in the literature, all sharing the advantage of cell topology reconfiguration that ensures balanced cell states during charging and discharging, meanwhile providing strong fault tolerance ability. This survey is undertaken with the intent of identifying the state-of-the-art technologies of reconfigurable battery as well as providing review on related technologies and insight on future research in this emerging area.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2545338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442763","Reconfigurable battery pack;energy storage system;SOC;battery management system;Reconfigurable battery pack;energy storage system;SOC;battery management system","Energy storage;Battery management system;Safety;Battery cells;Reconfigurable batteries","","186","","70","OAPA","29 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We also propose the use of medium-time power analysis in which environmental parameters are estimated over a longer duration than is commonly used for speech, as well as frequency smoothing. Experimental results demonstrate that PNCC processing provides substantial improvements in recognition accuracy compared to MFCC and PLP processing for speech in the presence of various types of additive noise and in reverberant environments, with only slightly greater computational cost than conventional MFCC processing, and without degrading the recognition accuracy that is observed while training and testing using clean speech. PNCC processing also provides better recognition accuracy in noisy environments than techniques such as vector Taylor series (VTS) and the ETSI advanced front end (AFE) while requiring much less computation.

When X-rays pass through a metal object, depending on its size and density, different physical effects will negatively affect the measurements, most notably beam hardening, scatter, noise, and the non-linear partial volume effect. These phenomena severely degrade image quality and hinder the diagnostic power and treatment outcomes in many clinical applications. In this paper, we first review the fundamental causes of metal artifacts, categorize metal object types, and present recent trends in the CT metal artifact reduction (MAR) literature. To improve image quality and recover information about underlying structures, many methods and correction algorithms have been proposed and tested. We comprehensively review and categorize these methods into six different classes of MAR: metal implant optimization, improvements to the data acquisition process, data correction based on physics models, modifications to the reconstruction algorithm (projection completion and iterative reconstruction), and image-based post-processing. The primary goals of this paper are to identify the strengths and limitations of individual MAR methods and overall classes, and establish a relationship between types of metal objects and the classes that most effectively overcome their artifacts. The main challenges for the field of MAR continue to be cases with large, dense metal implants, as well as cases with multiple metal objects in the field of view. Severe photon starvation is difficult to compensate for with only software corrections. Hence, the future of MAR seems to be headed toward a combined approach of improving the acquisition process with dual-energy CT, higher energy X-rays, or photon-counting detectors, along with advanced reconstruction approaches. Additional outlooks are addressed, including the need for a standardized evaluation system to compare MAR methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2608621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7565564","Biomedical imaging;computed tomography;radiation therapy;reconstruction algorithms;metal artifact reduction","Metal objects;Computed tomography;X-rays;Image quality;Image reconstruction","","184","2","137","OAPA","13 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, the Pareto-optimal front (POF) of many MOPs has complex characteristics. For example, the POF may have a long tail and sharp peak and disconnected regions, which significantly degrades the performance of MOEA/D. This paper proposes an improved MOEA/D for handling such kind of complex problems. In the proposed algorithm, a two-phase strategy (TP) is employed to divide the whole optimization procedure into two phases. Based on the crowdedness of solutions found in the first phase, the algorithm decides whether or not to delicate computational resources to handle unsolved subproblems in the second phase. Besides, a new niche scheme is introduced into the improved MOEA/D to guide the selection of mating parents to avoid producing duplicate solutions, which is very helpful for maintaining the population diversity when the POF of the MOP being optimized is discontinuous. The performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated on some existing benchmark and newly designed MOPs with complex POF shapes in comparison with several MOEA/D variants and other approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm produces promising performance on these complex problems.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2403131","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of U.K.(grant numbers:EP/K001310/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060668","Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA);multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D);multiobjective optimization;niching;test problems;Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA);multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D);multiobjective optimization;niching;test problems","Vectors;Optical fibers;Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Shape","","182","","49","OAPA","13 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We review recent progresses on the use of frequency-division multiplexing to achieve highly bandwidth-efficient mobile fronthaul with low latency. We present digital signal processing (DSP) techniques for channel aggregation and deaggregation, frequency-domain windowing, adjacent channel leak age ratio reduction, and synchronous transmission of both the I/Q waveforms of wireless signals and the control words (CWs) used for control and management purposes. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate the transmission of 48 20-MHz LTE signals with a common public radio interface (CPRI) equivalent data rate of 59 Gb/s, achieving a low round-trip DSP latency of <2 μs and a low mean error-vector magnitude (EVM) of ∼2.5% after fiber transmission. In a follow-up experiment, we further demonstrate the transmission of 32 20-MHz LTE signals together with CPRI-compliant CWs, corresponding to a CPRI-equivalent data rate of 39.32 Gb/s, in single optical wavelength channel that requires an RF bandwidth of only ∼1.6 GHz. After transmission over 5-km standard single-mode fiber, the CWs are recovered without error, while the LTE signals are recovered with an EVM of lower than 3%. Applying this technique to future 5G wireless networks with massive multiple-input multiple-output is also discussed. This efficient mobile fronthaul technique may find promising applications in future integrated fiber/wireless access networks to provide ultrabroadband access services.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2015.2508451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358044","Optical fiber transmission;mobile fronthaul;frequency-division multiplexing (FDM);cloud radio access network (C-RAN);common public radio interface (CPRI);Cloud radio access network (C-RAN);common public radio interface (CPRI);fifth-generation (5G);frequency-division multiplexing (FDM);mobile fronthaul;optical fiber transmission","Mobile communication;Frequency division multiplexing;Wireless communication;Bandwidth;Optical fibers;Digital signal processing","","180","","23","OAPA","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most effort is placed on various specific experimental work and little has been done to systematically analyze the problem of interest and the existing methods. In this paper, a general scenario description and a system configuration are first presented according to search and rescue scenario. The objective of the problem is then analyzed together with its mathematical formulation extracted from the scenario. Considering the requirement of distributed computing, this paper then proposes a novel heuristic distributed task allocation method for multivehicle multitask assignment problems. The proposed method is simple and effective. It directly aims at optimizing the mathematical objective defined for the problem. A new concept of significance is defined for every task and is measured by the contribution to the local cost generated by a vehicle, which underlies the key idea of the algorithm. The whole algorithm iterates between a task inclusion phase, and a consensus and task removal phase, running concurrently on all the vehicles where local communication exists between them. The former phase is used to include tasks into a vehicle's task list for optimizing the overall objective, while the latter is to reach consensus on the significance value of tasks for each vehicle and to remove the tasks that have been assigned to other vehicles. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method is able to provide a conflict-free solution and can achieve outstanding performance in comparison with the consensus-based bundle algorithm.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2418052","U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Autonomous and Intelligent Systems Programme with BAE Systems as the leading industrial partner(grant numbers:EP/J011525/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7084641","Distributed task allocation;multitask;multivehicle;overall objective;search and rescue;Distributed task allocation;multitask;multivehicle;overall objective;search and rescue","Vehicles;Resource management;Optimization;Servers;Cognition;Fuels;Cybernetics","","178","","23","CCBY","13 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most, if not all, of them suffer from the inability to fully use the rich information in traffic data. In this paper, we present a novel short-term traffic flow prediction approach based on dynamic tensor completion (DTC), in which the traffic data are represented as a dynamic tensor pattern, which is able capture more information of traffic flow than traditional methods, namely, temporal variabilities, spatial characteristics, and multimode periodicity. A DTC algorithm is designed to use the multimode information to forecast traffic flow with a low-rank constraint. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world data sets and compared with other state-of-the-art methods, and the efficacy of the proposed approach is validated on the experiments of traffic flow prediction, particularly when dealing with incomplete traffic data.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2513411","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:6127137651308115); National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program(grant numbers:2012CB725405); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4122067); Basic Research Fund of Beijing Institute of Technology(grant numbers:20120342026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7407622","Short-term traffic flow prediction;multi-mode information;dynamic tensor completion;missing data","Tensile stress;Predictive models;Data models;Time series analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Intelligent transportation systems","","176","","68","OAPA","16 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These physiochemical parameters are used to detect water contaminants. The sensors, which are designed from first principles and implemented with signal conditioning circuits, are connected to a microcontroller-based measuring node, which processes and analyzes the data. In this design, ZigBee receiver and transmitter modules are used for communication between the measuring and notification nodes. The notification node presents the reading of the sensors and outputs an audio alert when water quality parameters reach unsafe levels. Various qualification tests are run to validate each aspect of the monitoring system. The sensors are shown to work within their intended accuracy ranges. The measurement node is able to transmit data by ZigBee to the notification node for audio and visual display.

The objective is to explicitly infer the underlying low-CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)-rank tensor capturing the global information and a sparse tensor capturing the local information (also considered as outliers), thus providing the robust predictive distribution over missing entries. The low-CP-rank tensor is modeled by multilinear interactions between multiple latent factors on which the column sparsity is enforced by a hierarchical prior, while the sparse tensor is modeled by a hierarchical view of Student- $t$  distribution that associates an individual hyperparameter with each element independently. For model learning, we develop an efficient variational inference under a fully Bayesian treatment, which can effectively prevent the overfitting problem and scales linearly with data size. In contrast to existing related works, our method can perform model selection automatically and implicitly without the need of tuning parameters. More specifically, it can discover the groundtruth of CP rank and automatically adapt the sparsity inducing priors to various types of outliers. In addition, the tradeoff between the low-rank approximation and the sparse representation can be optimized in the sense of maximum model evidence.

NALM can deepen energy feedback, support appliance retrofit advice, and support home automation. However, despite the fact that NALM was proposed over 30 years ago, there are still many open challenges with respect to its practicality and effectiveness at low sampling rates. Indeed, the majority of NALM approaches, supervised or unsupervised, require training to build appliance models, and are sensitive to appliance changes in the house, thus requiring regular re-training. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing an NALM approach that does not require any training. The main idea is to build upon the emerging field of graph signal processing to perform adaptive thresholding, signal clustering, and pattern matching. We determine the performance limits of our approach and demonstrate its usefulness in practice. Using two open access datasets-the US REDD data set with active power measurements downsampled to 1 min resolution and the UK REFIT data set with 8-s resolution, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for typical smart meter sampling rate, with the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised NALM approaches as benchmarks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2557460","U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the Transforming Energy Demand in Buildings through the Digital Innovation (BuildTEDDI) Funding Programme(grant numbers:REFIT EP/K002368); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457610","Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring;load disaggregation;graph signal processing;Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring;load disaggregation;graph signal processing","Home appliances;Training;Signal resolution;Energy consumption;Home automation;Load management;Adaptation models;Power system measurements","","174","","44","OAPA","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is usually used to convey implicit information within the message a person transmits. Sarcasm might be used for different purposes, such as criticism or mockery. However, it is hard even for humans to recognize. Therefore, recognizing sarcastic statements can be very useful to improve automatic sentiment analysis of data collected from microblogging websites or social networks. Sentiment Analysis refers to the identification and aggregation of attitudes and opinions expressed by Internet users toward a specific topic. In this paper, we propose a pattern-based approach to detect sarcasm on Twitter. We propose four sets of features that cover the different types of sarcasm we defined. We use those to classify tweets as sarcastic and non-sarcastic. Our proposed approach reaches an accuracy of 83.1% with a precision equal to 91.1%. We also study the importance of each of the proposed sets of features and evaluate its added value to the classification.

We optimize MIGs via a new Boolean algebra, based exclusively on majority and inversion operations, that we formally axiomatize in this paper. As a complement to MIG algebraic optimization, we develop powerful Boolean methods exploiting global properties of MIGs, such as bit-error masking. MIG algebraic and Boolean methods together attain very high optimization quality. Considering the set of IWLS'05 benchmarks, our MIG optimizer (MIGhty) enables a 7% depth reduction in LUT-6 circuits mapped by ABC while also reducing size and power activity, with respect to similar and-inverter graph (AIG) optimization. Focusing on arithmetic intensive benchmarks instead, MIGhty enables a 16% depth reduction in LUT-6 circuits mapped by ABC, again with respect to similar AIG optimization. Employed as front-end to a delay-critical 22-nm application-specified integrated circuit flow (logic synthesis + physical design) MIGhty reduces the average delay/area/power by 13%/4%/3%, respectively, over 31 academic and industrial benchmarks.

As epileptic EEG signals contain huge fluctuating information about the functional behavior of the brain, it is hard to distinguish the fundamental dynamic, complex network of EEG signals without considering the strength among the nodes as they are connected with each other on the basis of these strengths. The prior research on natural visibility graph did not consider this issue in epileptic seizure, although it is a very important key point to have representative information from the signals. Hence, this paper aims to introduce a new idea for epilepsy detection using complex network statistical properties by measuring different strengths of the edges in natural visibility graph theory, which is considered as weight. Thus, the proposed method is named “weighted visibility graph”. In this proposed method, first, the epileptic EEG signals are transformed into complex network and then two important statistical properties of a network such as modularity and average weighted degree used for extracting the imperative characteristics from a network of EEG signals. After that, the extracted features are evaluated by two modern machine-learning classifiers such as, support vector machine with a different kernel function and k-nearest neighbor. The experimental results demonstrate that the combined effect of both features is valuable for network metrics to characterize the EEG time series signals in case of weighted complex network generating up to 100% classification accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2612242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572884","Average weighted degree;complex network;EEG;Epilepsy;KNN;modularity;SVM;visibility graph;weighted visibility graph","Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Complex networks;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Electric variables;Weight measurement","","164","","36","OAPA","21 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using particle-based simulators, the channel's impulse response is obtained and mathematically modeled. These models are then used to determine interlink interference (ILI) and intersymbol interference (ISI). It is assumed that when the receiver has incomplete information regarding the system and the channel state, low complexity symbol detection methods are preferred since the receiver is small and simple.

Since, for cost efficiency, PHEVs have a limited battery capacity, they must be recharged often and especially after trips. Thus, efficient battery charging plays an important role on the success of PHEVs commercial adoption. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art of existing PHEV battery charging schemes. We classify these schemes into four classes, namely, uncontrolled, indirectly controlled, smart, and bidirectional charging, and review various existing techniques within each class. For uncontrolled charging, existing studies focus on evaluating the impact of adding variable charging load on the smart grid. Various indirectly controlled charging schemes have been proposed to control energy prices, in order to indirectly influence the charging operations. Smart charging schemes can directly control a rich set of charging parameters to achieve various performance objectives, such as minimizing power loss, maximizing operator's profit, ensuring fairness, and so on. Finally, bidirectional charging allows a PHEV to discharge energy into smart grid, such that the vehicle can act as a mobile energy source to further stabilize the grid, which is partially supplied by intermittent renewable energy sources. This survey provides a comprehensive one-stop introductory reference to quickly learn about the key features and technical challenges, addressed by existing PHEV battery charging schemes in smart grid.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2614689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586042","Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;uncontrolled charging;indirectly-controlled charging;smart charging;bidirectional charging;smart grid","Electric vehicles;Batteries;Smart grids;Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;Global warming;Environmental factors;Fossill fuels;Discharges (electric);Emissions;Greenhouse effect","","163","","140","OAPA","7 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the widely used thermal models based on lumps of thermal resistances and capacitances have their limits to correctly predict the device temperatures, especially when considering the thermal grease and heat sink attached to the power semiconductor devices. In this paper, frequency-domain approach is applied to the modeling of the thermal dynamics for power devices. The limits of the existing RC lump-based thermal networks are explained from a point of view of frequency domain. Based on the discovery, a more advanced thermal model developed in the frequency domain is proposed, which can be easily established by characterizing the slope variation from the bode diagram of the typically used Foster thermal network. The proposed model can be used to predict not only the internal temperature behaviors of the devices but also the behaviors of the heat flowing out of the devices. As a result, more correct estimation of device temperature can be achieved when considering the cooling conditions for the devices.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2015.2509506","H2020 European Research Council; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC(grant numbers:616344); Centre of Reliable Power Electronics, Aalborg University, Denmark; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359136","Power electronics;power semiconductor device;thermal model","Thermal resistance;Heating;Frequency-domain analysis;Temperature measurement;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Heat sinks;Capacitance","","162","1","22","OAPA","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to evaluate this goal, verification tests were conducted by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding of ITU-T SG 16 WP 3 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29. This paper presents the subjective and objective results of a verification test in which the performance of the new standard is compared with its highly successful predecessor, the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) video compression standard (ITU-T H.264 and ISO/IEC 14496-10). The test used video sequences with resolutions ranging from 480p up to ultra-high definition, encoded at various quality levels using the HEVC Main profile and the AVC High profile. In order to provide a clear evaluation, this paper also discusses various aspects for the analysis of the test results. The tests showed that bit rate savings of 59% on average can be achieved by HEVC for the same perceived video quality, which is higher than a bit rate saving of 44% demonstrated with the PSNR objective quality metric. However, it has been shown that the bit rates required to achieve good quality of compressed content, as well as the bit rate savings relative to AVC, are highly dependent on the characteristics of the tested content.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2477916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7254155","Advanced Video Coding (AVC);H.265;High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC);JCT-VC;MPEG;MPEG-H Part 2;standards;VCEG;video compression;Advanced Video Coding (AVC);H.265;High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC);Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC);Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG);MPEG-H Part 2;standards;Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG);video compression","Video coding;Bit rate;Encoding;Quality assessment;Video recording;ISO Standards","","162","3","32","OAPA","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rapid response to requirements for frequency, gain, and skew angle inspired a search for an alternative to conventional, commercial slot array acquisition. The solution to this requirement is high-resolution 3-D printing of modified slot arrays combined with metal plating. Modification of the structure included removal of wall material in regions where these openings would not cause radiation, opening the structure to enable metal plating while not affecting gain. A 3-D-printed slot array requires no further assembly, unlike conventional waveguide-based arrays that require soldering or brazing, block machining, or plate assembled, brazed structures. Stereolithography 3-D printing of plastic slot array antennas, modified to enable metal plating, has been used to produce a 30 dBi realized gain slot array at 21 GHz for under $1000 USD in a few weeks. Metal plated, 3-D printed plastic slot arrays are also very lightweight in comparison with conventional metal structures.

Although this is an area with ongoing intensive research and new methods and results are reported regularly, it is time to have a review about the basic approaches and methods for CS-based DOA estimation, in particular for the underdetermined case. We start from the basic time-domain CS-based formulation for narrowband arrays and then move to the case for recently developed methods for sparse arrays based on the co-array concept. After introducing two specifically designed structures (the two-level nested array and the co-prime array) for optimizing the virtual sensors corresponding to the difference co-array, this CS-based DOA estimation approach is extended to the wideband case by employing the group sparsity concept, where a much larger physical aperture can be achieved by allowing a larger unit inter-element spacing and therefore leading to further improved performance. Finally, a specifically designed uniform linear array structure with associated CS-based underdetermined DOA estimation is presented to exploit the difference co-array concept in the spatio-spectral domain, leading to a significant increase in degrees of freedom. Representative simulation results for typical narrowband and wideband scenarios are provided to demonstrate their performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2628869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7744507","Compressive sensing;direction of arrival estimation;underdetermined;difference co-array;sparse array structures","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Sensor arrays;Wideband;Narrowband;Signal reconstruction","","153","","74","OAPA","15 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Excited by a harmonically rich tank current, a typical oscillation voltage waveform is observed to have asymmetric rise and fall times due to even-order current harmonics flowing into the capacitive part, as it presents the lowest impedance path. The asymmetric oscillation waveform results in an effective impulse sensitivity function of a nonzero dc value, which facilitates the 1/f noise upconversion into the oscillator's 1/f3 phase noise. We demonstrate that if the ω0 tank exhibits an auxiliary resonance at 2ω0, thereby forcing this current harmonic to flow into the equivalent resistance of the 2ω0 resonance, then the oscillation waveform would be symmetric and the flicker noise upconversion would be largely suppressed. The auxiliary resonance is realized at no extra silicon area in both inductor-and transformer-based tanks by exploiting different behaviors of inductors and transformers in differential-and common-mode excitations. These tanks are ultimately employed in designing modified class-D and class-F oscillators in 40 nm CMOS technology. They exhibit an average flicker noise corner of less than 100 kHz.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2016.2602214","European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator(grant numbers:307624 TDRFSP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7571191","Class-D oscillator;class-F oscillator;digitally controlled oscillator;flicker noise;flicker noise upconversion;impulse sensitivity function (ISF);phase noise (PN);voltage-biased RF oscillator","Oscillators;Harmonic analysis;Resonant frequency;Transistors;Resistors;Radio frequency;Capacitors","","149","1","31","OAPA","19 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to the different communication protocols, securing such communications and establishing a certain trustiness among vehicles are among the main challenges to address, since the presence of dishonest peers can lead to unwanted situations. To this end, existing security solutions are typically divided into two main categories, cryptography and trust, where trust appeared as a complement to cryptography on some specific adversary models and environments where the latter was not enough to mitigate all possible attacks. In this paper, we provide an adversary-oriented survey of the existing trust models for VANETs. We also show when trust is preferable to cryptography, and the opposite. In addition, we show how trust models are usually evaluated in VANET contexts, and finally, we point out some critical scenarios that existing trust models cannot handle, together with some possible solutions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2645452","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, Programa Estatal de Investigación Desarrollo e Innovación Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad, Proyectos I+D+I 2014, Spain(grant numbers:TEC2014-52690-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797493","VANETs;trust management;attacker models","Cryptography;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Vehicles;Privacy;Biological system modeling;Safety","","148","","94","OAPA","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By introducing optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (opticalOFDM), the new system achieves a more than fivefold higher data rate. Additionally, the frequency response characteristics and circuit noise of the OCI are closely analyzed and taken into account in the signal design.

Among all existing technologies, the techniques for the fifth generation (5G) systems are the main driving force for the actualization of IoT concept. However, due to the heterogeneous environment in 5G networks and the broadcast nature of radio propagation, the security assurance against eavesdropping is a vital yet challenging task. In this paper, we focus on the transmission design for secure relay communications in IoT networks, where the communication is exposed to eavesdroppers with unknown number and locations. The randomize-and-forward relay strategy specially designed for secure multi-hop communications is employed in our transmission protocol. First, we consider a single-antenna scenario, where all the devices in the network are equipped with the single antenna. We derive the expression for the secrecy outage probability of the two-hop transmission. Following this, a secrecy-rate-maximization problem subject to a secrecy-outage-probability constraint is formulated. The optimal power allocation and codeword rate design are obtained. Furthermore, we generalize the above analyses to a more generic scenario, where the relay and eavesdroppers are equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results show that the proper use of relay transmission can enhance the secrecy throughput and extend the secure coverage range.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2575863","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61431011); Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(grant numbers:20120201110066); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7484703","Internet of Things (IoT);physical layer security;relay transmission;resource allocation;stochastic geometry","Radio propagation;Internet of things;5G mobile communication;Antenna measurements;Sensors;Security;Resource management","","146","","38","OAPA","7 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In single-node spectrum sensing, a two-phase spectrum sensing algorithm based on compressive sensing is proposed to reduce the computational complexity and improve the robustness at secondary users (SUs). In the cooperative multiple nodes case, the signals received at SUs exhibit a sparsity property that yields a low-rank matrix of compressed measurements at the fusion center. This therefore leads to a two-phase cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm for cooperative multiple SUs based on low-rank matrix completion. In addition, the two proposed spectrum sensing algorithms are evaluated on the TV white space (TVWS), in which pioneering work aimed at enabling dynamic spectrum access into practice has been promoted by both the Federal Communications Commission and the U.K. Office of Communications. The proposed algorithms are tested on the real-time signals after they have been validated by the simulated signals in TVWS.

Our method first performs a deterministic step (computation of the gradient of the objective function at the starting point), followed by a large number of stochastic steps. The process is repeated a few times with the last iterate becoming the new starting point. The novelty of our method is in introduction of mini-batching into the computation of stochastic steps. In each step, instead of choosing a single function, we sample $b$ functions, compute their gradients, and compute the direction based on this. We analyze the complexity of the method and show that it benefits from two speedup effects. First, we prove that as long as $b$ is below a certain threshold, we can reach any predefined accuracy with less overall work than without mini-batching.

Due to the existence of the dc bias, the current model in the transient process is different from the traditional model in the steady process, and the models are different with different operating conditions. On this basis, a transient phase-shift (TPS) strategy is proposed to improve the transient performance of the SPS strategy. Unlike in the SPS strategy, the voltages of the transformer are symmetrical in the TPS strategy, which causes that the voltage-time product of the transformer voltages is zero during a switching period, then eliminates the transient dc bias and improves the current impact, and further increases the response speed of the transient process effectively.

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides an opportunity to automatically measure a 3-D canopy structure in large areas. Compared with other point cloud technologies such as the image-based Structure from Motion, the power of ALS lies in its ability to penetrate canopies and depict subordinate trees. However, such capabilities have been poorly explored so far. In this paper, the potential of ALS-based approaches in depicting a 3-D canopy structure is explored in detail through an international benchmarking of five recently developed ALS-based individual tree detection (ITD) methods. For the first time, the results of the ITD methods are evaluated for each of four crown classes, i.e., dominant, codominant, intermediate, and suppressed trees, which provides insight toward understanding the current status of depicting a 3-D canopy structure using ITD methods, particularly with respect to their performances, potential, and challenges. This benchmarking study revealed that the canopy structure plays a considerable role in the detection accuracy of ITD methods, and its influence is even greater than that of the tree species as well as the species composition in a stand. The study also reveals the importance of utilizing the point cloud data for the detection of intermediate and suppressed trees. Different from what has been reported in previous studies, point density was found to be a highly influential factor in the performance of the methods that use point cloud data. Greater efforts should be invested in the point-based or hybrid ITD approaches to model the 3-D canopy structure and to further explore the potential of high-density and multiwavelengths ALS data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2543225","Finnish Academy projects “Centre of Excellence in Laser Scanning Research (CoE-LaSR)”(grant numbers:272195); “Interaction of Lidar/Radar Beams with Forests Using Mini-UAV and Mobile Forest Tomography”(grant numbers:259348); “Competence Based Growth Through Integrated Disruptive Technologies of 3-D Digitalization, Robotics, Geospatial Information and Image Processing/Computing Point Cloud Ecosystem”(grant numbers:293389); European Community's Seventh Framework Program ([FP7/2007–2013])(grant numbers:606971); French National Research Agency; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493651","Airborne laser scanning (ALS);benchmark;canopy structure;crown class;individual tree detection (ITD);LiDAR;point cloud;subordinate tree","Vegetation;Benchmark testing;Three-dimensional displays;Remote sensing;Solid modeling;Geospatial analysis;Geography","","139","","24","OAPA","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It may cause attenuation that is up to hundreds of decibels per kilometer. Hence, accurate modeling of fog attenuation will help telecommunication operators to engineer and appropriately manage their networks. In this paper, we examine fog measurement data coming from several locations in Europe and the United States and derive a unified channel attenuation model. Compared with existing attenuation models, our proposed model achieves a minimum of 9 dB, which is lower than the average root-mean-square error (RMSE). Moreover, we have investigated the statistical behavior of the channel and developed a probabilistic model under stochastic fog conditions. Furthermore, we studied the performance of the FSO system addressing various performance metrics, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), bit-error rate (BER), and channel capacity. Our results show that in communication environments with frequent fog, FSO is typically a short-range data transmission technology. Therefore, FSO will have its preferred market segment in future wireless fifth-generation/sixth-generation (5G/6G) networks having cell sizes that are lower than a 1-km diameter. Moreover, the results of our modeling and analysis can be applied in determining the switching/thresholding conditions in highly reliable hybrid FSO/radio-frequency (RF) networks.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2592705","King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology(grant numbers:APR 34-145); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515199","Free space optics (FSO);fifth-generation/sixth-generation (5G/6G) wireless communication;attenuation model;channel capacity;curve fitting","Attenuation;Channel capacity;Bit error rate;Predictive models;Wavelength measurement;Data models","","136","","46","CCBY","18 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Next, a comprehensive review to advances in OEO-based sensing, measurement, and detection applications is presented, including length change and distance measurement, refractive index estimation, load and strain sensing, temperature and acoustic sensing, optical clock recovery, and low-power RF signal detection. As a new application example, a novel approach for in-line position finding is proposed. When a long fiber Bragg grating inserted into OEO is locally heated to slightly broaden its reflection spectrum, the target position heated is mapped into the oscillating frequency shift, according to the first operation principle. A sensitivity of 254.66 kHz/cm is obtained for position finding in the experiment.

In this paper, the optimal torque distribution is formulated as the solution of a parametric optimization problem, depending on the vehicle speed. An analytical solution is provided for the case of equal drivetrains, under the experimentally confirmed hypothesis that the drivetrain power losses are strictly monotonically increasing with the torque demand.

Two bowtie GPR transducers are chosen for the simulations and two widely employed antipersonnel (AP) landmines, namely PMA-1 and PMN are used. The validity of the modeled antennas and landmines is tested through a comparison between numerical and laboratory measurements. The modeled AP landmines are buried in a realistically simulated soil. The geometrical characteristics of soil's inhomogeneity are modeled using fractal correlated noise, which gives rise to Gaussian semivariograms often encountered in the field. Fractals are also employed in order to simulate the roughness of the soil's surface. A frequency-dependent complex electrical permittivity model is used for the dielectric properties of the soil, which relates both the velocity and the attenuation of the electromagnetic waves with the soil's bulk density, sand particles density, clay fraction, sand fraction, and volumetric water fraction. Debye functions are employed to simulate this complex electrical permittivity. Background features like vegetation and water puddles are also included in the models and it is shown that they can affect the performance of GPR at frequencies used for landmine detection (0.5-3 GHz).

The performance of the proposed method is validated by simulation results in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and the results show that the proposed converter configuration is able to eliminate commutation failures under both fault cases. Consequently partial power transferring capability during single-phase fault and fast fault recovery from three-phase fault can be achieved. Further simulation results show that the harmonic content of inverter AC voltage and current are not significantly increased and the voltage stress of the thyristor valve is comparable to that of the original benchmark system.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2491784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307232","Commutation failures;controllable capacitor;HVDC transmission;LCC HVDC;series capacitor insertion","Capacitors;Inverters;HVDC transmission;Valves;Impedance;Thyristors;Converters","","132","","19","OAPA","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods based on fixed thermal models are typically unable to compensate for degradation of the thermal path resulting from aging and the effect of variable cooling conditions. Thermosensitive electrical parameters (TSEPs), on the other hand, can give an estimate of junction temperature TJ, but measurement inaccuracies and the masking effect of varying operating conditions can corrupt the estimate. This paper presents a robust and noninvasive real-time estimate of junction temperature that can provide enhanced accuracy under all operating and cooling conditions when compared to model-based or TSEP-based methods alone. The proposed method uses a Kalman filter to fuse the advantages of model-based estimates and an online measurement of TSEPs. Junction temperature measurements are obtained from an online measurement of the on-state voltage, VCE (ON), at high current and processed by a Kalman filter, which implements a predict-correct mechanism to generate an adaptive estimate of TJ. It is shown that the residual signal from the Kalman filter may be used to detect changes in thermal model parameters, thus allowing the assessment of thermal path degradation. The algorithm is implemented on a full-bridge inverter and the results verified with an IR camera.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2015.2418711","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/I031707/1,EP/H03014X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073633","Real-time;junction temperature;Kalman filter;Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT);Thermo-Sensitive Electrical Parameters (TSEPs);Solder Fatigue;Health Management;Health management;insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT);junction temperature;Kalman filter;real time;solder fatigue;thermosensitive electrical parameters (TSEPs)","Temperature measurement;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Junctions;Current measurement;Semiconductor device measurement;Voltage measurement;Multichip modules","","131","","36","IEEE","31 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A major factor limiting this understanding is the difficulty of bridging between events taking place at the neurophysiologic level (i.e., motor neuron firings) with those emerging at the musculoskeletal level (i.e. joint actuation), in vivo in the intact moving human. This review presents emerging model-based methodologies for filling this gap that are promising for developing clinically viable technologies. Methods: We provide a design overview of musculoskeletal modeling formulations driven by recordings of neuromuscular activity with a critical comparison to alternative model-free approaches in the context of neurorehabilitation technologies. We present advanced electromyography-based techniques for interfacing with the human nervous system and model-based techniques for translating the extracted neural information into estimates of motor function. Results: We introduce representative application areas where modeling is relevant for accessing neuromuscular variables that could not be measured experimentally. We then show how these variables are used for designing personalized rehabilitation interventions, biologically inspired limbs, and human-machine interfaces. Conclusion: The ability of using electrophysiological recordings to inform biomechanical models enables accessing a broader range of neuromechanical variables than analyzing electrophysiological data or movement data individually. This enables understanding the neuromechanical interplay underlying in vivo movement function, pathology, and robot-assisted motor recovery. Significance: Filling the gap between our understandings of movement neural and mechanical functions is central for addressing one of the major challenges in neurorehabilitation: personalizing current technologies and interventions to an individual's anatomy and impairment.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2538296","ERC(grant numbers:DEMOVE 267888); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440844","electromyography (EMG);musculoskeletal modeling;neural recordings;neurorehabilitation technologies;wearable robots;Electromyography (EMG);musculoskeletal modeling;neural recordings;neurorehabilitation technologies;wearable robots","Muscles;Electromyography;Neurons;Brain modeling;Force","Biomechanical Phenomena;Clothing;Electromyography;Gait;Humans;Models, Neurological;Motor Neurons;Muscle, Skeletal;Neurological Rehabilitation;Orthotic Devices;Prostheses and Implants;Robotics;Walking","130","23","121","CCBY","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A multiwavelength approach for targeting specific endogenous or exogenous chromophores can enhance cellular detail and resolve single organelles with contrast not possible with traditional optical microscopy. A quantitative analysis of the photoacoustic signals acquired from single cells can provide insight into their anatomical, biomechanical, and functional properties.

Nonlinear forward models can provide more accurate interpretation of the measured data than their linear counterparts, but they generally result in computationally prohibitive reconstruction algorithms. Although sparsity-driven regularizers significantly improve the quality of reconstructed image, they further increase the computational burden of imaging. In this paper, we present a novel iterative imaging method for optical tomography that combines a nonlinear forward model based on the beam propagation method (BPM) with an edge-preserving three-dimensional (3-D) total variation (TV) regularizer. The central element of our approach is a time-reversal scheme, which allows for an efficient computation of the derivative of the transmitted wave-field with respect to the distribution of the refractive index. This time-reversal scheme together with our stochastic proximal-gradient algorithm makes it possible to optimize under a nonlinear forward model in a computationally tractable way, thus enabling a high-quality imaging of the refractive index throughout the object.

However, its full time series potential has not been fully explored, mainly due to inconsistencies in the temporal signal. Previous studies have tried to resolve this issue in order to generate a consistent NTL time series. However, due to geographic limitations with the algorithms, these approaches cannot generate a coherent NTL time series globally. The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to create a consistent NTL time series that can be applied globally. Our method is based on a novel sampling strategy to identify pseudoinvariant features. We select data points along a ridgeline-the densest part of a density plot generated between the reference image and the target image-and then use those data points to derive calibration models to minimize inconsistencies in the NTL time series. Results show that the algorithm successfully calibrates DMSP/OLS annual composites and generates a consistent NTL time series. Evaluation of the results shows that the calibrated NTL time series significantly reduces the differences between two images within the same year and increases the correlations between the NTL time series and gross domestic product as well as with energy consumption, and outperforms the Elvidge et al. (2014) method. The methodology is simple, robust, and easy to implement. The quality-enhanced NTL time series can be used in a myriad of applications that require a consistent data set over time.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2572724","One Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Science; NASA Land Cover/Land Use Change(grant numbers:NNX11AE88G); International Science and Technology Collaboration Project of China(grant numbers:2010DFA92720-24,2010DFA92720-8-1); 2015 Scientific and Technological Activities Preferential Funding Program for Returning Scholars, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490418","Calibration sites;intersensor calibration;ridge regression;ridge sampling and regression;ridgeline sampling regression (RSR);satellite image normalization","Time series analysis;Calibration;Satellites;Sensors;Earth;Satellite broadcasting;Systematics","","129","","48","OAPA","13 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By migrating NFs from dedicated hardware to virtualization platform, NFV can effectively improve the flexibility to deploy and manage service function chains (SFCs). However, resource allocation for requested SFC in NFV-based infrastructures is not trivial as it mainly consists of three phases: virtual network functions (VNFs) chain composition, VNFs forwarding graph embedding, and VNFs scheduling. The decision of these three phases can be mutually dependent, which also makes it a tough task. Therefore, a coordinated approach is studied in this paper to jointly optimize NFV resource allocation in these three phases. We apply a general cost model to consider both network costs and service performance. The coordinate NFV-RA is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming, and a heuristic-based algorithm (JoraNFV) is proposed to get the near optimal solution. To make the coordinated NFV-RA more tractable, JoraNFV is divided into two sub-algorithms, one-hop optimal traffic scheduling and a multi-path greedy algorithm for VNF chain composition and VNF forwarding graph embedding. Last, extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of JoraNFV, and results have shown that JoraNFV can get a solution within 1.25 times of the optimal solution with reasonable execution time, which indicates that JoraNFV can be used for online NFV planning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2629278","Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission research(grant numbers:D151100000115002); China Ministry of Education-CMCC research under Project “5G Core Network Prototype Research and Develop”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7747433","NFV;resource allocation;service function chain;traffic scheduling;virtual function placement","Resource management;Noise measurement;Telecommunication traffic;Scheduling;Mix integer linear programming;Virtual function placement","","129","","28","OAPA","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore it is essential to develop efficient and reliable ciphertext search techniques. One challenge is that the relationship between documents will be normally concealed in the process of encryption, which will lead to significant search accuracy performance degradation. Also the volume of data in data centers has experienced a dramatic growth. This will make it even more challenging to design ciphertext search schemes that can provide efficient and reliable online information retrieval on large volume of encrypted data. In this paper, a hierarchical clustering method is proposed to support more search semantics and also to meet the demand for fast ciphertext search within a big data environment. The proposed hierarchical approach clusters the documents based on the minimum relevance threshold, and then partitions the resulting clusters into sub-clusters until the constraint on the maximum size of cluster is reached. In the search phase, this approach can reach a linear computational complexity against an exponential size increase of document collection. In order to verify the authenticity of search results, a structure called minimum hash sub-tree is designed in this paper. Experiments have been conducted using the collection set built from the IEEE Xplore. The results show that with a sharp increase of documents in the dataset the search time of the proposed method increases linearly whereas the search time of the traditional method increases exponentially. Furthermore, the proposed method has an advantage over the traditional method in the rank privacy and relevance of retrieved documents.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2015.2425407","Strategic Priority Re-search Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA06040601); Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region science and technology plan(grant numbers:201230121); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA06010701); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2013AA01A24); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091954","Cloud computing;ciphertext search;ranked search;multi-keyword search;hierarchical clustering;big data;security;Cloud computing;ciphertext search;ranked search;multi-keyword search;hierarchical clustering;security","Servers;Indexes;Privacy;Computer architecture;Encryption","","127","","41","OAPA","22 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among the existing approaches, morphological profile and attribute profile (AP) have gained great attention due to their ability to classify remote sensing data. This paper proposes a novel approach that makes it possible to precisely extract spatial and contextual information from remote sensing images. The proposed approach is based on extinction filters, which are used here for the first time in the remote sensing community. Then, the approach is carried out on two well-known high-resolution panchromatic data sets captured over Rome, Italy, and Reykjavik, Iceland. In order to prove the capabilities of the proposed approach, the obtained results are compared with the results from one of the strongest approaches in the literature, i.e., APs, using different points of view such as classification accuracies, simplification rate, and complexity analysis. Results indicate that the proposed approach can significantly outperform its alternative in terms of classification accuracies. In addition, based on our implementation, profiles can be generated in a very short processing time.

"A Tensor Decomposition-Based Anomaly Detection Algorithm for Hyperspectral Image","X. Zhang; G. Wen; W. Dai","Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China; Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China; Automatic Target Recognition Laboratory, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China",IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"11 Aug 2016","2016","54","10","5801","5820","Anomalies usually refer to targets with a spot of pixels (even subpixels) that stand out from their neighboring background clutter pixels in hyperspectral imagery (HSI). Compared to backgrounds, anomalies have two main characteristics. One is the spectral anomaly, i.e., their spectral signatures are different from those associated to their surrounding backgrounds; another is the spatial anomaly, i.e., anomalies occur as few pixels (even subpixels) embedded in the local homogeneous backgrounds. However, most of the existing anomaly detection algorithms for HSI only employed the spectral anomaly. If the two characteristics are exploited in a detection method simultaneously, better performance may be achieved. The third-order (two modes for space and one mode for spectra) tensor representation of HSI has been proved to be an effective tool to describe the spatial and spectral information equivalently; therefore, tensor representation is convenient for exhibiting the two characteristics of anomalies simultaneously. In this paper, a new anomaly detection method based on tensor decomposition is proposed and divided into three steps. Three factor matrices and a core tensor are first estimated from the third-order tensor that is constructed from the HSI data cube by using the Tucker decomposition, and their major and minor principal components (PCs) are more likely to correspond to the spectral signatures of the backgrounds and the anomalies, respectively. In the second step, a reconstruction-error-based method is presented to find the first largest PCs along each mode to eliminate the spectral signatures of the backgrounds as much as possible, and thus, the remaining data may be modeled as the spectral signatures of the anomalies with a Gaussian noise. Finally, a CFAR test is implemented to detect the anomalies from the remaining data. Experiments with simulated, synthetic, and real HSI data sets reveal that the proposed method outperforms those spectral-anomaly-based methods with better detection probability and less false alarm rate.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2572400","Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of China(grant numbers:NCET-11-0866); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493677","Anomaly detection;hyperspectral imagery (HSI);tensor representation;Tucker decomposition","Tensile stress;Detection algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Detectors;Hyperspectral imaging;Computational modeling","","124","","46","OAPA","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This multi-graph matching problem involves two correlated components: i) the local pairwise matching affinity across pairs of graphs; ii) the global matching consistency that measures the uniqueness of the pairwise matchings by different composition orders. Previous studies typically either enforce the matching consistency constraints in the beginning of an iterative optimization, which may propagate matching error both over iterations and across graph pairs; or separate affinity optimization and consistency enforcement into two steps. This paper is motivated by the observation that matching consistency can serve as a regularizer in the affinity objective function especially when the function is biased due to noises or inappropriate modeling. We propose composition-based multi-graph matching methods to incorporate the two aspects by optimizing the affinity score, meanwhile gradually infusing the consistency. We also propose two mechanisms to elicit the common inliers against outliers.

We assume that the microgrid takes part in a pool market and responds actively to the electricity price to maximize its profit by scheduling its controllable resources. To address various uncertainties, a risk-constrained scenario-based stochastic programming framework is proposed using the conditional value at risk method. The designed model is solved by two levels of stochastic optimization methods. One level of optimization is to submit optimal hourly bids to the day-ahead market under the forecast data. The other level of optimization is to determine the optimal scheduling using the scenario-based stochastic data of the uncertain resources. The proposed energy management system is not only beneficial for the microgrid and customers, but also applies the microgrid aggregator and virtual power plant.

The double-frequency ripple (DFR) energy needs to be buffered by passive network. Otherwise, the ripple energy will flow into the input side and adversely affect the PV energy harvest. In a conventional PV system, electrolytic capacitors are usually used for this purpose due to their high capacitance. However, electrolytic capacitors are considered to be one of the most failure prone components in a PV inverter. In this paper, a capacitance reduction control strategy is proposed to buffer the DFR energy in single-phase Z-source/quasi-Z-source inverter applications. Without using any extra hardware components, the proposed control strategy can significantly reduce the capacitance requirement and achieve low input voltage DFR. Consequently, highly reliable film capacitors can be used. The increased switching device voltage stress and power loss due to the proposed control strategy will also be discussed. A 1-kW quasi-Z-source PV inverter using gallium nitride (GaN) devices is built in the lab. Experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2015.2432070","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1125658); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7105921","Capacitance reduction;double-frequency ripple (DFR);Z-source (ZS)/quasi-Z-source (qZS);Capacitance reduction;double-frequency ripple (DFR);Z-source (ZS)/quasi-Z-source (qZS)","Capacitors;Capacitance;Stress;Inverters;Voltage control;Switches","","123","1","19","OAPA","12 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This optimum interval may vary, depending on cleaning costs, as well as seasonal variations in soiling loss and energy production. In this work, a general expression has been derived for the optimal cleaning interval and then applied to losses actually observed over a one-year interval at a test site in central Saudi Arabia and fitted to a simple exponential loss model.

To accomplish the idea, we first model adherent raindrops using law of physics, and detect raindrops based on these models in combination with motion and intensity temporal derivatives of the input video. Having detected the raindrops, we remove them and restore the images based on an analysis that some areas of raindrops completely occludes the scene, and some other areas occlude only partially. For partially occluding areas, we restore them by retrieving as much as possible information of the scene, namely, by solving a blending function on the detected partially occluding areas using the temporal intensity derivative. For completely occluding areas, we recover them by using a video completion technique.

Methods: Because excessive neuronal activities in the preictal period of epilepsy affect the autonomic nervous systems and autonomic nervous function affects HRV, it is assumed that a seizure can be predicted through monitoring HRV. In the proposed method, eight HRV features are monitored for predicting seizures by using multivariate statistical process control, which is a well-known anomaly monitoring method. Results: We applied the proposed method to the clinical data collected from 14 patients. In the collected data, 8 patients had a total of 11 awakening preictal episodes and the total length of interictal episodes was about 57 h. The application results of the proposed method demonstrated that seizures in ten out of eleven awakening preictal episodes could be predicted prior to the seizure onset, that is, its sensitivity was 91%, and its false positive rate was about 0.7 times per hour. Conclusion: This study proposed a new HRV-based epileptic seizure prediction method, and the possibility of realizing an HRV-based epileptic seizure prediction system was shown. Significance: The proposed method can be used in daily life, because the heart rate can be measured easily by using a wearable sensor.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2512276","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:25282175); SEI Group CSR Foundation; Japan Prize Foundation; Japan Epilepsy Research Foundation; Mitsubishi Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7365453","Epilepsy;Heart rate variability analysis;Multivariate statistical process control;Seizure prediction;Epilepsy;heart rate variability analysis;multivariate statistical process control (MSPC);seizure prediction","Heart rate variability;Rail to rail inputs;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Frequency-domain analysis;Process control;Prediction methods","Adolescent;Adult;Databases, Factual;Electrocardiography;Epilepsy;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Young Adult","121","1","32","OAPA","24 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A valuable information source for such a procedure can be remote sensing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. However, flood scenarios are typical examples of complex situations in which different factors have to be considered to provide accurate and robust interpretation of the situation on the ground. For this reason, a data fusion approach of remote sensing data with ancillary information can be particularly useful. In this paper, a Bayesian network is proposed to integrate remotely sensed data, such as multitemporal SAR intensity images and interferometric-SAR coherence data, with geomorphic and other ground information. The methodology is tested on a case study regarding a flood that occurred in the Basilicata region (Italy) on December 2013, monitored using a time series of COSMO-SkyMed data. It is shown that the synergetic use of different information layers can help to detect more precisely the areas affected by the flood, reducing false alarms and missed identifications which may affect algorithms based on data from a single source. The produced flood maps are compared to data obtained independently from the analysis of optical images; the comparison indicates that the proposed methodology is able to reliably follow the temporal evolution of the phenomenon, assigning high probability to areas most likely to be flooded, in spite of their heterogeneous temporal SAR/InSAR signatures, reaching accuracies of up to 89%.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2520487","Italian Ministry of Research (MIUR) within the “Apulia Space” PON project(grant numbers:PON03PE_00067_6); Research Project PRIN 2011; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429750","Bayesian networks (BNs);data fusion;flood mapping;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) change detection;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)/interferometric SAR (InSAR) time series analysis;Bayesian networks (BNs);data fusion;flood mapping;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) change detection;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)/interferometric SAR (InSAR) time series analysis","Synthetic aperture radar;Remote sensing;Rivers;Sensors;Data models;Probabilistic logic;Data integration","","119","","47","OAPA","9 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Without using the mean value theorem, the difficulty of the control design for pure-feedback systems is overcome by modeling the nonaffine functions appropriately. With the help of neural network approximators, an adaptive neural controller is developed by combining the dynamic surface control (DSC) and minimal learning parameter (MLP) techniques. The key features of our approach are that, first, the restrictive assumptions on the partial derivative of nonaffine functions are removed, second, the DSC technique is used to avoid “the explosion of complexity” in the backstepping design, and the number of adaptive parameters is reduced significantly using the MLP technique, third, smooth robust compensators are employed to circumvent the influences of approximation errors and disturbances. Furthermore, it is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded.

If realized, this could provide reference inputs to proactive control and protection systems which could enhance not only system stability but also operational economics through, for example, more informed ancillary reserve planning using knowledge of prevailing system conditions and stability margins. Performing these predictions in real time is a significant challenge owing to the complex stochastic and temporal relationships between available measurements. This paper proposes a statistical model capable of estimating system inertia in real time through observed steady-state and relatively small frequency variations; it is trained to learn the features that inter-relate steady-state averaged frequency variations and system inertia, using historical system data demonstrated over two consecutive years. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a Gaussian Mixture Model with temporal dependence encoded as Markov chains. Applied to the U.K. power system, it produces an optimized mean squared error within 0.1 s2 for 95% of the daily estimation if being calibrated on a half-hourly basis and maintains robustness through measurement interruptions of up to a period of two hours.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2501458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7348724","Real-time inertia estimation;Gaussian mixture models;Markov chain;model training","Estimation;Power system dynamics;Power system stability;Markov processes;Frequency estimation;Mathematical model;Time-frequency analysis","","119","","36","OAPA","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior knowledge about the problem is embedded through prior distributions that account for the different parameter constraints and their spatial correlation among the image pixels. In particular, a gamma Markov random field (MRF) is used to model the joint distribution of the target reflectivity, and a second MRF is used to model the distribution of the target depth, which are both expected to exhibit significant spatial correlations.

The difference between ours and the conventional coverage problem is that we only select a subset of mobile users so that the coverage quality is maximized with constrained budget. To address this new problem, which is proved to be NP-hard, we first prove that the set function of coverage quality is nondecreasing submodular. By leveraging the favorable property in submodular optimization, we then propose an (1 - (1/e)) approximation algorithm with O(nk+2) time complexity, where k is an integer that is greater than or equal to 3. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations for the proposed scheme, and the results demonstrate that ours outperforms the random selection scheme and one of the state of the art in terms of total coverage quality by, at most, 2.4× and 1.5× and by, on average, 1.4× and 1.3×, respectively.

The maximum transmitted power is related to the maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power to highlight the relevance of the output power restrictions for a communication channel. A comparison between the simulation and measurement data is provided for a canonical monopole antenna. For small distances, with the antennas transmitting directly toward the human body, it is found that the maximum transmitted power is significantly below the UE power levels used in existing third and fourth generation mobile communication systems.

We present an implementation of a zero-velocity-update gait analysis system based on a Kalman filter and off-the-shelf shoe-worn inertial sensors. The algorithms for gait events and step length estimation were specifically designed to comply with pathological gait patterns.

The spectral efficiency is improved by shrinking base stations' (BSs) footprints, thus improving the spatial frequency reuse and reducing the number of users sharing the resources of each BS. However, the foreseen densification gains are achieved at the expense of increasing handover (HO) rates. Hence, HO rate is a key performance limiting factor that should be carefully considered in densification planning. This paper sheds light on the HO problem that appears in dense 5G networks and proposes an effective solution via topology aware HO skipping. Different skipping techniques are considered and compared with the conventional best connected scheme. To this end, the proposed schemes are validated via the average user rate in downlink single-tier and two-tier cellular networks, which are modeled using the Poisson point process and the Poisson cluster process, respectively. The proposed skipping schemes show up to 47% gains in the average throughput, which would maximize the benefit of network densification.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2642538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792669","Downlink cellular networks;handover management;stochastic geometry;average throughput","Cellular networks;Trajectory;Throughput;Handover;Delays;Computer architecture","","115","","50","OAPA","21 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous researchers have comprehensively studied ankle joint kinetics and kinematics during many biomechanical tasks, including locomotion; however, only recently have researchers been able to quantify how the mechanical impedance of the ankle varies during walking. The mechanical impedance describes the dynamic relationship between the joint position and the joint torque during perturbation, and is often represented in terms of stiffness, damping, and inertia. The purpose of this short communication is to unify the results of the first two studies measuring ankle mechanical impedance in the sagittal plane during walking, where each study investigated differing regions of the gait cycle. Rouse et al. measured ankle impedance from late loading response to terminal stance, where Lee et al. quantified ankle impedance from pre-swing to early loading response. While stiffness component of impedance increases significantly as the stance phase of walking progressed, the change in damping during the gait cycle is much less than the changes observed in stiffness. In addition, both stiffness and damping remained low during the swing phase of walking. Future work will focus on quantifying impedance during the “push off” region of stance phase, as well as measurement of these properties in the coronal plane.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2016.2601613","NIH(grant numbers:R01 HD069776); Toyota Motor Corporation’s Partner Robot Division; Samsung Scholarship; U.S. Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center(grant numbers:W81XWH-09-2-0020); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(grant numbers:F31NS074687); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(grant numbers:T32HD007318); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7547952","Human ankle;ankle impedance;ankle stiffness;ankle damping","Impedance;Legged locomotion;Torque;Damping;Estimation;Mechatronics","","115","2","46","OAPA","19 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a reliable full reference IQA model is proposed that utilize gradient similarity (GS), chromaticity similarity (CS), and deviation pooling (DP). By considering the shortcomings of the commonly used GS to model the human visual system (HVS), a new GS is proposed through a fusion technique that is more likely to follow HVS. We propose an efficient and effective formulation to calculate the joint similarity map of two chromatic channels for the purpose of measuring color changes. In comparison with a commonly used formulation in the literature, the proposed CS map is shown to be more efficient and provide comparable or better quality predictions. Motivated by a recent work that utilizes the standard DP, a general formulation of the DP is presented in this paper and used to compute a final score from the proposed GS and CS maps. This proposed formulation of DP benefits from the Minkowski pooling and a proposed power pooling as well. The experimental results on six data sets of natural images, a synthetic data set, and a digitally retouched dataset show that the proposed index provides comparable or better quality predictions than the most recent and competing state-of-the-art IQA metrics in the literature, it is reliable and has low complexity.

This can be used by the healthcare professionals to make a more informed decision providing improved quality of care. However, due to the inherent heterogeneous and imbalanced characteristics of medical data from EHRs, data analysis task faces a big challenge. In this paper, we address the challenges of imbalanced medical data about a brain tumor diagnosis problem. Morphometric analysis of histopathological images is rapidly emerging as a valuable diagnostic tool for neuropathology. Oligodendroglioma is one type of brain tumor that has a good response to treatment provided the tumor subtype is recognized accurately. The genetic variant, 1p-/19q-, has recently been found to have high chemosensitivity, and has morphological attributes that may lend it to automated image analysis and histological processing and diagnosis. This paper aims to achieve a fast, affordable, and objective diagnosis of this genetic variant of oligodendroglioma with a novel data mining approach combining a feature selection and ensemble-based classification. In this paper, 63 instances of brain tumor with oligodendroglioma are obtained due to prevalence and incidence of the tumor variant. In order to minimize the effect of an imbalanced healthcare data set, a global optimization-based hybrid wrapper-filter feature selection with ensemble classification is applied.

By migrating network functions from dedicated devices to general purpose computing platforms, NFV can help reduce the cost to deploy and operate large IT infrastructures. In particular, NFV is expected to play a pivotal role in mobile networks where significant cost reductions can be obtained by dynamically deploying and scaling virtual network functions (VNFs) in the core network. However, in order to achieve its full potential, NFV needs to extend its reach also to the radio access segment. Here, mobile virtual network operators shall be allowed to request radio access VNFs with custom resource allocation solutions. Such a requirement raises several challenges in terms of performance isolation and resource provisioning. In this work, we formalize the wireless VNF placement problem in the radio access network as an integer linear programming problem and we propose a VNF placement heuristic, named wireless network embedding (WiNE), to solve the problem. Moreover, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of an NFV management and orchestration framework for enterprise WLANs. The proposed architecture builds on a programmable network fabric where pure forwarding nodes are mixed with radio and packet processing capable nodes.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2016.2549563","European Union’s H2020 Research and Innovation Action(grant numbers:H2020-ICT-644843,H2020-ICT-671639); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7445873","Network Management;Resource allocation;Virtual Network Embedding;Virtual Network Functions Placement;Network Function Virtualization;Wireless Networks;Network Management;Resource allocation;Virtual Network Embedding;Virtual Network Functions Placement;Network Function Virtualization;Wireless Networks","Substrates;Data structures;Boolean functions;Wireless communication;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Resource management","","114","","45","CCBY","1 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A voltage envelope line is generated by the proposed voltage envelope function. By comparing the preprocessed diagnosis eigenvalue and the voltage envelope, single-switch open-circuit faults can be located precisely. Because the proposed method does not rely on the accurate amplitude of the output line-to-line voltage, the influence of the load changing is minimized and simple hardware is adopted, which has advantages of low cost, high reliability, and short diagnosis time. Moreover, as long as the inverter output voltages have the feature of periodic nonpositive and nonnegative, this method is valid no matter what control strategy is adopted by the inverter and no control signal is required for the diagnosis process. The prototype system is tested to validate the adaptability of the proposed method under different conditions, such as the diverse loads, various control strategies, and fault-occurrence time.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2016.2535960","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61273158); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422066","Fault diagnosis;fault location;inverters;open-circuit fault;Fault diagnosis;fault location;inverters;open-circuit fault","Circuit faults;Inverters;Fault diagnosis;Capacitors;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Hardware","","113","","26","OAPA","29 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, substantial savings on space, weight, and cost are achieved. The considered configurations fully incorporate either a symmetrical or an asymmetrical six-phase machine, as well as a six-phase inverter, into the charging process. Due to the nature of the connections, torque production is avoided during the charging/vehicle-to-grid (V2G) modes of operation.

Tunneling FETs (TFETs) are reverse-biased gated PIN diodes where the gate controls the electric field in the interband tunneling junction. Technological solutions for improved performance will be described, including alternative channel materials and geometries, as well as a proposed paradigm shift of increasing the current drive by internal amplification in the bipolar-enhanced TFET.

They have similar gated-diode configuration, but are operated in forward-bias mode. Electrostatic barriers are formed (via gate biasing) to prevent electron/hole injection into the channel until the gate or drain bias reaches a turn-on value.

Collectively the controllable devices and the network implement a gradient projection algorithm for the OPF problem in real time. The key design feature that enables this approach is that the intermediate iterates of our algorithm always satisfy power flow equations and operational constraints. This is achieved by explicitly exploiting the network to implicitly solve power flow equations for us in real time at scale. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to the set of local optima and provide sufficient conditions under which it converges to a global optimum. We derive an upper bound on the suboptimality gap of any local optimum. This bound suggests that any local minimum is almost as good as any strictly feasible point. We explain how to greatly reduce the gradient computation in each iteration by using approximate gradient derived from linearized power flow equations. Numerical results on test networks, ranging from 42-bus to 1990-bus, show a great speedup over a second-order cone relaxation method with negligible difference in objective values.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2525598","Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy(grant numbers:DE-AR0000226); Defense Threat Reduction Agency(grant numbers:HDTRA 1-15-1-0003); Skoltech through a collaboration(grant numbers:1075-MRA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397846","Branch flow model;distflow equations;interior point method;online optimization algorithm;optimal power flow (OPF)","Mathematical model;Real-time systems;Approximation algorithms;Projection algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Energy resources;Computational modeling","","111","","34","OAPA","3 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the ETB system, the wireless-charging infrastructure installed under the road charges the fleet of electric buses that are operative over that road. The technology is innovative in that the battery in the bus is charged while it is moving over the charging infrastructure. Unlike conventional electric vehicles, the OLEV-based ETB system is a road-vehicle integrated system. Since charging occurs while the vehicle is operational, the performance of the operation depends on the system integration of the vehicle and the road in which the charging infrastructure is embedded. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze the benefits of the OLEV-based ETB system from the energy logistics perspective. We then present two analytical economic design optimization models. The first model is for an ETB system operating in a “closed environment” with no traffic and no heavy vehicle interactions. The OLEV-based shuttle bus currently operating on the KAIST campus constitutes such a case. The second model is the “open environment model” and considers an ETB system operating in normal traffic conditions. We also present the result of numerical case studies for the optimization models.

The security of WSNs is one of the key issues of smart cities. In resource-restrained WSNs, dynamic ongoing or unknown attacks usually steer clear of isolated defense components. Therefore, to resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical framework based on chance discovery and usage control (UCON) technologies to improve the security of WSNs while still taking the low-complexity and high security requirements of WSNs into account. The features of continuous decision and dynamic attributes in UCON can address ongoing attacks using advanced persistent threat detection. In addition, we use a dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism to detect unknown attacks. To design and implement a system using the mechanism described above, a unified framework is proposed in which low-level attack detection with simple rules is performed in sensors, and high-level attack detection with complex rules is performed in sinks and at the base station. Moreover, software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies are used to perform attack mitigation when either low-level or high-level attacks are detected. An experiment was performed to acquire an attack data set for evaluation. Then, a simulation was created to evaluate the resource consumption and attack detection rate.

Interior-point method (IPM)-based simultaneous dynamic optimization methodology is adopted to solve the formulated dynamic optimization problem numerically. Given that near-feasible solutions have been widely acknowledged to ease optimizing nonlinear programs (NLPs), a critical region-based initialization strategy is proposed to facilitate the offline NLP-solving process, a lookup table-based strategy is proposed to guarantee the on-site planning performance, and a receding-horizon optimization framework is proposed for online maneuver planning. A series of parallel parking cases is tested, and simulation results demonstrate that our proposal is efficient even when the slot length is merely 10.19% larger than the car length.

For this purpose, we present AutoDietary, a wearable system to monitor and recognize food intakes in daily life. An embedded hardware prototype is developed to collect food intake sensor data, which is highlighted by a high-fidelity microphone worn on the subject's neck to precisely record acoustic signals during eating in a noninvasive manner. The acoustic data are preprocessed and then sent to a smartphone via Bluetooth, where food types are recognized. In particular, we use hidden Markov models to identify chewing or swallowing events, which are then processed to extract their time/frequency-domain and nonlinear features. A lightweight decision-tree-based algorithm is adopted to recognize the type of food. We also developed an application on the smartphone, which aggregates the food intake recognition results in a user-friendly way and provides suggestions on healthier eating, such as better eating habits or nutrition balance. Experiments show that the accuracy of food-type recognition by AutoDietary is 84.9%, and those to classify liquid and solid food intakes are up to 97.6% and 99.7%, respectively.

Wideband spectrum sensing is a critical functionality to enable dynamic spectrum access by enhancing the opportunities of exploring spectral holes, but entails a major implementation challenge in compact commodity radios that only have limited energy and computation capabilities. In contrast to the traditional sub-Nyquist approaches where a wideband signal or its power spectrum is first reconstructed from compressed samples, this paper proposes a sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing scheme that locates occupied channels blindly by recovering the signal support, based on the jointly sparse nature of multiband signals. Exploiting the common signal support shared among multiple secondary users (SUs), an efficient cooperative spectrum sensing scheme is developed, in which the energy consumption on wideband signal acquisition, processing, and transmission is reduced with detection performance guarantee. Based on subspace decomposition, the low-dimensional measurement matrix, computed at each SU from local sub-Nyquist samples, is deployed to reduce the transmission and computation overhead while improving noise robustness. The theoretical analysis of the proposed sub-Nyquist wideband sensing algorithm is derived and verified by numerical analysis and further tested on real-world TV white space signals. It shows that the proposed scheme can achieve good detection performance as well as reduce the computation and implementation complexity, in comparison with the conventional cooperative wideband spectrum sensing schemes.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2605998","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/L024241/1); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61328102/61629101,61571100,61631005); DoD(grant numbers:HDTRA1-13-1-0029); NSF(grant numbers:AST-1547436,ECCS-1508051,CNS-1343155,ECCS-1305979,CNS-1265227); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7559788","Wideband spectrum sensing;cooperative spectrum sensing;sub-Nyquist sampling;multicoset sampling;joint sparse recovery","Sensors;Wideband;Wireless sensor networks;Cognitive radio;Sparse matrices;Reliability","","107","","40","CCBY","2 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although these proposed sparse-reconstruction-based methods lead to promising results, three issues remained unsolved: 1) high computational cost; 2) no consideration given to the possibility of mutually correlated information in different multispectral channels; and 3) requirement that the spectral responses of the panchromatic (Pan) image and the multispectral image cover the same wavelength range, which is not necessarily valid for most sensors. In this paper, we propose a sophisticated sparse image fusion algorithm, which is named “jointly sparse fusion of images” (J-SparseFI). It is based on the earlier proposed sparse fusion of images (SparseFI) algorithm and overcomes the aforementioned three drawbacks of the existing sparse image fusion algorithms. The computational problem is handled by reducing the problem size and by proposing a fully parallelizable scheme. Moreover, J-SparseFI exploits the possible signal structure correlations between multispectral channels by introducing the joint sparsity model (JSM) and sharpening the highly correlated adjacent multispectral channels together. This is done by exploiting the distributed compressive sensing theory that restricts the solution of an underdetermined system by considering an ensemble of signals being jointly sparse. J-SparseFI also offers a practical solution to overcome spectral range mismatch between the Pan and multispectral images. By means of sensor spectral response and channel mutual correlation analysis, the multispectral channels are assigned to primary groups of joint channels, secondary groups of joint channels, and individual channels. Primary groups of joint channels, individual channels, and secondary groups of joint channels are then reconstructed sequentially, by the JSM or by modified SparseFI, using a dictionary trained from the Pan image or previously reconstructed high-resolution multispectral channels. A recipe of how to choose appropriate algorithm parameters, including the most crucial regularization parameter, is provided. The algorithm is evaluated and validated using WorldView-2-like images that are simulated using very high resolution airborne HySpex hyperspectral imagery and further practically demonstrated using real WorldView-2 images. The algorithm's performance is compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Visual and quantitative analyses demonstrate the high quality of the proposed method. In particular, the analysis of the difference images suggests that J-SparseFI is superior in image resolution recovery.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2504261","Helmholtz Association(grant numbers:VH-NG-1018); Munich Aerospace e.V.—Fakultät für Luft- und Raumfahrt; Gauss Centre for Supercomputing e.V.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360927","Data fusion;joint sparsity;jointly sparse fusion of images (J-SparseFI);pansharpening;sparse fusion of images (SparseFI);Data fusion;joint sparsity;jointly sparse fusion of images (J-SparseFI);pansharpening;sparse fusion of images (SparseFI)","Sensors;Spatial resolution;Image sensors;Image fusion;Correlation","","106","","34","CCBY","18 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design of medium access control (MAC) protocols has been traditionally an intense area of research due to their high impact on the overall performance of wireless communications. The majority of research activities in this field deal with different variations of protocols somehow based on ALOHA, either with or without listen before talk, i.e., carrier sensing multiple access. These protocols operate well under low traffic loads and low number of simultaneous devices. However, they suffer from congestion as the traffic load and the number of devices increase. For this reason, unless revisited, the MAC layer can become a bottleneck for the success of the IoT. In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing MAC solutions for the IoT, describing current limitations and envisioned challenges for the near future. Motivated by those, we identify a family of simple algorithms based on distributed queueing (DQ), which can operate for an infinite number of devices generating any traffic load and pattern. A description of the DQ mechanism is provided and most relevant existing studies of DQ applied in different scenarios are described in this paper.

However, it is challenging to fabricate the self-rectifying cells operating at low program/erase voltages with high non-linearity for both read and write operations and exhibiting good retention and endurance characteristics at the same time for a single device. 1S1R devices are more attractive than SRC due to large optimization possibilities to obtain better device performance as they have separate selector cell and memory cell which decouples the control parameters. Various kinds of selector devices like Si-based selector, metal-oxide based selector, threshold switch selector, mixed ionic-electronic conduction selector etc., are under intense research to obtain the best performance cross point memory devices. In this paper, we have briefly discussed about recent progress on various self-rectifying cells and selector devices for obtaining 3-D stackable cross point memory arrays.;Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles<br><br> ""Overview of Selector Devices for 3-D Stackable Cross Point RRAM Arrays,""<br> by Rakesh Aluguri and Tseung-Yuen Tseng<br> in IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society, vol. 4, no. 5, September 2016, pp. 294-306,<br><br> After careful and considered review of the content and authorship of this paper by a duly constituted expert committee, this paper has been found to be in violation of IEEE’s Publication Principles.<br><br> This paper copies substantial content the original text from the paper cited below.

"Affective Haptics: Current Research and Future Directions","M. A. Eid; H.

Affective haptics is an emerging field, which focuses on the analysis, design, and evaluation of systems that can capture, process, or display emotions through the sense of touch. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the recent achievements in affective haptics and to discuss how the sense of touch can elicit or influence human emotions. We first introduce a definition to the term affective haptics and describe its multidisciplinary nature-as a field that integrates ideas from affective computing, haptic technology, and user experience. Second, we provide a thorough discussion about the effectiveness of using the haptic channel to communicate affective information through direct and mediated means. Third, we present a variety of applications in the area ranging from interhuman social interaction systems to human robot interaction applications. Finally, we discuss some of the key findings discerned from the various surveyed papers, and present some of the challenges and trends in this field. We extract the following conclusions pertaining to affective haptics: 1) haptic stimulation can be successfully used to achieve a higher level of emotional immersion during media consumption or emotional telepresence; 2) existing research has demonstrated that haptics is effective in communicating valence and arousal, and the emotions of happiness, sadness, anger and fear, and less focus have been given to the communication of disgust and surprise; 3) the haptic-based affect detection remains an understudied topic, whereas the haptic-based affect display is a well-established subject; and 4) the interpretation of the haptic stimulation by human beings is highly contextual.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2497316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320966","Affective computing;Haptic interfaces;Human computer interaction;social computing,;tactile sensors;Affective computing;haptic interfaces;human computer interaction;social computing;tactile sensors","Affective computing;Haptic interfaces;Psychology;Human computer interaction;Emotion recognition;Force feedback;Tactile sensors","","104","1","106","OAPA","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It affects the body in various ways by leading to many serious illnesses and premature mortality. Heart and kidney diseases, which are caused by diabetes, are increasing at an alarming rate. In this paper, we report a study of a noninvasive measurement technique to determine the glucose levels in the human body. Current existing methods to quantify the glucose level in the blood are predominantly invasive that involve taking the blood samples using finger pricking. In this paper, we report a spectroscopy-based noninvasive glucose monitoring system to measure glucose concentration. Near-infrared transmission spectroscopy is used and in vitro experiments are conducted, as well as in vivo. Our experimental study confirms a correlation between the sensor output voltage and glucose concentration levels. We report a low-cost prototype of spectroscopy-based noninvasive glucose monitoring system that demonstrates promising results in vitro and establishes a relationship between the optical signals and the changing levels of blood-glucose concentration.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2616491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782291","Remote sensing and sensor;optical sensing and sensors;optical spectroscopy.","Sugar;Diabetes;Blood;Spectroscopy;Monitoring;Optical sensors;Biomedical monitoring","","104","","49","OAPA","13 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a new approach to extract keys efficiently from the channel responses of individual orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers. The efficiency is achieved by: 1) fully exploiting randomness from time and frequency domains and 2) improving the cross-correlation of the channel measurements. Through the theoretical modeling of the time and frequency autocorrelation relationship of the OFDM subcarrier's channel responses, we can obtain the optimal probing rate and use multiple uncorrelated subcarriers as random sources. We also study the effects of non-simultaneous measurements and noise on the cross-correlation of the channel measurements. We find that the cross-correlation is mainly impacted by noise effects in a slow fading channel and use a low-pass filter to reduce the key disagreement rate and extend the system's working signal-to-noise ratio range. The system is evaluated in terms of randomness, key generation rate, and key disagreement rate, verifying that it is feasible to extract randomness from both time and frequency domains of the OFDM subcarrier's channel responses.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2552165","Queen’s University Belfast university studentship, Newton Institutional Links(grant numbers:172719890); Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship(grant numbers:RF1415\14\22); U.S.–Ireland R&D Partnership USI033 ‘WiPhyLoc8’ grant involving Rice University (USA), University College Dublin (Ireland) and Queen’s University Belfast (Northern Ireland); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448884","Physical layer security;key generation;OFDM;time and frequency autocorrelation;channel reciprocity;Physical layer security;key generation;OFDM;time and frequency autocorrelation;channel reciprocity","OFDM;Correlation;Noise measurement;Security;Time-frequency analysis","","104","2","49","Crown","7 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

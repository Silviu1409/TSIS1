The cognitive radio, built on a software-defined radio, is defined as an intelligent wireless communication system that is aware of its environment and uses the methodology of understanding-by-building to learn from the environment and adapt to statistical variations in the input stimuli, with two primary objectives in mind: /spl middot/ highly reliable communication whenever and wherever needed; /spl middot/ efficient utilization of the radio spectrum. Following the discussion of interference temperature as a new metric for the quantification and management of interference, the paper addresses three fundamental cognitive tasks. 1) Radio-scene analysis. 2) Channel-state estimation and predictive modeling. 3) Transmit-power control and dynamic spectrum management. This work also discusses the emergent behavior of cognitive radio.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.839380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1391031","Awareness;channel-state estimation and predictive modeling;cognition;competition and cooperation;emergent behavior;interference temperature;machine learning;radio-scene analysis;rate feedback;spectrum analysis;spectrum holes;spectrum management;stochastic games;transmit-power control;water filling","Cognitive radio;Wireless communication;Interference;Radio spectrum management;Electromagnetic spectrum;Intelligent systems;Channel estimation;Predictive models;Radio control;Temperature control","","9328","91","90","IEEE","7 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453511","Index Terms- Feature selection;mutual information;minimal redundancy;maximal relevance;maximal dependency;classification.","Mutual information;Redundancy;Pattern classification;Diversity reception;Costs;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Performance analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Cancer","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Humans;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Neoplasms;Neoplasms;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","7529","48","32","IEEE","20 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We wish to recover an input vector f/spl isin/R/sup n/ from corrupted measurements y=Af+e. Here, A is an m by n (coding) matrix and e is an arbitrary and unknown vector of errors. Is it possible to recover f exactly from the data y? We prove that under suitable conditions on the coding matrix A, the input f is the unique solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/-minimization problem (/spl par/x/spl par//sub /spl lscr/1/:=/spl Sigma//sub i/|x/sub i/|) min(g/spl isin/R/sup n/) /spl par/y - Ag/spl par//sub /spl lscr/1/ provided that the support of the vector of errors is not too large, /spl par/e/spl par//sub /spl lscr/0/:=|{i:e/sub i/ /spl ne/ 0}|/spl les//spl rho//spl middot/m for some /spl rho/>0.

In addition, numerical experiments suggest that this recovery procedure works unreasonably well; f is recovered exactly even in situations where a significant fraction of the output is corrupted. This work is related to the problem of finding sparse solutions to vastly underdetermined systems of linear equations. There are also significant connections with the problem of recovering signals from highly incomplete measurements. In fact, the results introduced in this paper improve on our earlier work. Finally, underlying the success of /spl lscr//sub 1/ is a crucial property we call the uniform uncertainty principle that we shall describe in detail.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.858979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542412","Basis pursuit;decoding of (random) linear codes;duality in optimization;Gaussian random matrices;linear codes;linear programming;principal angles;restricted orthonormality;singular values of random matrices;sparse solutions to underdetermined systems","Decoding;Linear programming;Vectors;Linear code;Sparse matrices;Mathematics;Error correction;Equations;Error correction codes;Information theory","","5047","54","29","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D.

We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best.

In this paper, we pursue a ""true"" two-dimensional transform that can capture the intrinsic geometrical structure that is key in visual information. The main challenge in exploring geometry in images comes from the discrete nature of the data. Thus, unlike other approaches, such as curvelets, that first develop a transform in the continuous domain and then discretize for sampled data, our approach starts with a discrete-domain construction and then studies its convergence to an expansion in the continuous domain. Specifically, we construct a discrete-domain multiresolution and multidirection expansion using nonseparable filter banks, in much the same way that wavelets were derived from filter banks. This construction results in a flexible multiresolution, local, and directional image expansion using contour segments, and, thus, it is named the contourlet transform. The discrete contourlet transform has a fast iterated filter bank algorithm that requires an order N operations for N-pixel images. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between the developed filter bank and the associated continuous-domain contourlet expansion via a directional multiresolution analysis framework. We show that with parabolic scaling and sufficient directional vanishing moments, contourlets achieve the optimal approximation rate for piecewise smooth functions with discontinuities along twice continuously differentiable curves. Finally, we show some numerical experiments demonstrating the potential of contourlets in several image processing applications.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.859376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532309","Contourlets;contours;filter banks;geometric image processing;multidirection;multiresolution;sparse representation;wavelets","Image resolution;Image representation;Discrete transforms;Filter bank;Fourier transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Geometry;Wavelet transforms;Discrete Fourier transforms;Convergence","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","2942","8","41","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) which effectively see only the Euclidean structure of face space, LPP finds an embedding that preserves local information, and obtains a face subspace that best detects the essential face manifold structure. The Laplacianfaces are the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the face manifold. In this way, the unwanted variations resulting from changes in lighting, facial expression, and pose may be eliminated or reduced. Theoretical analysis shows that PCA, LDA, and LPP can be obtained from different graph models. We compare the proposed Laplacianface approach with Eigenface and Fisherface methods on three different face data sets.

The stability analysis is based upon a blend of graph-theoretic and system-theoretic tools with the notion of convexity playing a central role. The analysis is integrated within a formal framework of set-valued Lyapunov theory, which may be of independent interest.

The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L/sub 1/ norm in the target space approximates the ""semantic"" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions.

The issue of MPPT has been addressed in different ways in the literature but, especially for low-cost implementations, the perturb and observe (P&O) maximum power point tracking algorithm is the most commonly used method due to its ease of implementation. A drawback of P&O is that, at steady state, the operating point oscillates around the MPP giving rise to the waste of some amount of available energy; moreover, it is well known that the P&O algorithm can be confused during those time intervals characterized by rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. In this paper it is shown that, in order to limit the negative effects associated to the above drawbacks, the P&O MPPT parameters must be customized to the dynamic behavior of the specific converter adopted. A theoretical analysis allowing the optimal choice of such parameters is also carried out. Results of experimental measurements are in agreement with the predictions of theoretical analysis.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.850975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461481","Maximum power point (MPP);maximum power point tracking (MPPT);perturb and observe (P&O);photovoltaic (PV)","Optimization methods;Voltage;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Power generation;Steady-state;Temperature dependence;Current-voltage characteristics;Fuzzy logic;Neural networks","","2173","10","14","IEEE","5 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a series of experiments using simulated and real data, the VCA algorithm competes with state-of-the-art methods, with a computational complexity between one and two orders of magnitude lower than the best available method.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.844293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1411995","Linear unmixing;simplex;spectral mixture model;unmixing hypespectral data;unsupervised endmember extraction;vertex component analysis (VCA)","Algorithm design and analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Independent component analysis;Scattering;Least squares approximation;Telecommunications;Data mining;Remote sensing;Pixel","","2088","5","62","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We enforce sparsity by imposing penalties based on the /spl lscr//sub 1/-norm. A number of recent theoretical results on sparsifying properties of /spl lscr//sub 1/ penalties justify this choice. Explicitly enforcing the sparsity of the representation is motivated by a desire to obtain a sharp estimate of the spatial spectrum that exhibits super-resolution. We propose to use the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix to summarize multiple time or frequency samples. Our formulation leads to an optimization problem, which we solve efficiently in a second-order cone (SOC) programming framework by an interior point implementation. We propose a grid refinement method to mitigate the effects of limiting estimates to a grid of spatial locations and introduce an automatic selection criterion for the regularization parameter involved in our approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on simulated data by plots of spatial spectra and by comparing the estimator variance to the Crame/spl acute/r-Rao bound (CRB). We observe that our approach has a number of advantages over other source localization techniques, including increased resolution, improved robustness to noise, limitations in data quantity, and correlation of the sources, as well as not requiring an accurate initialization.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.850882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468495","Direction-of-arrival estimation;overcomplete representation;sensor array processing;source localization;sparse representation;superresolution","Sensor arrays;Signal reconstruction;Spatial resolution;Signal resolution;Array signal processing;Multiple signal classification;Maximum likelihood estimation;Acoustic sensors;Signal representations;Singular value decomposition","","1992","12","37","IEEE","18 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Systems can scavenge power from human activity or derive limited energy from ambient heat, light, radio, or vibrations. Ongoing power management developments enable battery-powered electronics to live longer. Such advances include dynamic optimization of voltage and clock rate, hybrid analog-digital designs, and clever wake-up procedures that keep the electronics mostly inactive. Exploiting renewable energy resources in the device's environment, however, offers a power source limited by the device's physical survival rather than an adjunct energy store. Energy harvesting's true legacy dates to the water wheel and windmill, and credible approaches that scavenge energy from waste heat or vibration have been around for many decades. Nonetheless, the field has encountered renewed interest as low-power electronics, wireless standards, and miniaturization conspire to populate the world with sensor networks and mobile devices.

Two basic schemes are studied: the relays decode-and-forward the source message to the destination, or they compress-and-forward their channel outputs to the destination. The decode-and-forward scheme is a variant of multihopping, but in addition to having the relays successively decode the message, the transmitters cooperate and each receiver uses several or all of its past channel output blocks to decode. For the compress-and-forward scheme, the relays take advantage of the statistical dependence between their channel outputs and the destination's channel output. The strategies are applied to wireless channels, and it is shown that decode-and-forward achieves the ergodic capacity with phase fading if phase information is available only locally, and if the relays are near the source node. The ergodic capacity coincides with the rate of a distributed antenna array with full cooperation even though the transmitting antennas are not colocated. The capacity results generalize broadly, including to multiantenna transmission with Rayleigh fading, single-bounce fading, certain quasi-static fading problems, cases where partial channel knowledge is available at the transmitters, and cases where local user cooperation is permitted. The results further extend to multisource and multidestination networks such as multiaccess and broadcast relay channels.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.853304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1499041","Antenna arrays;capacity;coding;multiuser channels;relay channels","Decoding;Rayleigh channels;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Wireless sensor networks;Information theory;Digital relays;Antenna arrays;Broadcasting;Channel capacity","","1956","22","100","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Usually, initial designs obtained by all means need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired. This stimulates the development of ""intelligent"" tools that can assist engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system identification and ""intelligent"" techniques in software based PID systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a useful degree. This should also assist future development of ""plug-and-play"" PID controllers that are widely applicable and can be set up easily and operate optimally for enhanced productivity, improved quality and reduced maintenance requirements.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2005.847331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453566","Patents;proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control;PID hardware;PID software;PID tuning","Three-term control;Control system analysis;Hardware;Automatic control;Pi control;Proportional control;Stability;Computer simulation;Software packages;System identification","","1914","8","77","IEEE","20 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An example LCL filter design is reported and a filter has been built and tested using the values obtained from this design. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the design procedure both for the LCL filter and for the rectifier controller. The system is stable and the grid current harmonic content is low both in the lowand high-frequency ranges. Moreover, the good agreement that was obtained between simulation and experimental results validates the proposed approach.

Sometimes, altogether different techniques, such as thermal measurements, chemical analysis, etc., are also employed to find out the nature and the degree of the fault. In addition, human involvement in the actual fault detection decision making is slowly being replaced by automated tools, such as expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy-logic-based systems; to name a few. It is indeed evident that this area is vast in scope. Hence, keeping in mind the need for future research, a review paper describing different types of faults and the signatures they generate and their diagnostics' schemes will not be entirely out of place.

Basis images spanning this space are usually obtained in one of three ways: a large set of images of the object under different lighting conditions is acquired, and principal component analysis (PCA) is used to estimate a subspace. Alternatively, synthetic images are rendered from a 3D model (perhaps reconstructed from images) under point sources and, again, PCA is used to estimate a subspace. Finally, images rendered from a 3D model under diffuse lighting based on spherical harmonics are directly used as basis images. In this paper, we show how to arrange physical lighting so that the acquired images of each object can be directly used as the basis vectors of a low-dimensional linear space and that this subspace is close to those acquired by the other methods. More specifically, there exist configurations of k point light source directions, with k typically ranging from 5 to 9, such that, by taking k images of an object under these single sources, the resulting subspace is an effective representation for recognition under a wide range of lighting conditions. Since the subspace is generated directly from real images, potentially complex and/or brittle intermediate steps such as 3D reconstruction can be completely avoided; nor is it necessary to acquire large numbers of training images or to physically construct complex diffuse (harmonic) light fields. We validate the use of subspaces constructed in this fashion within the context of face recognition.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407873","Index Terms- Illumination subspaces;illumination cone;face recognition;harmonic images;harmonic subspaces;ambient lighting.","Face recognition;Lighting;Image recognition;Light sources;Principal component analysis;Humans;Shadow mapping;Rendering (computer graphics);Image reconstruction;Image analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Lighting;Linear Models;Models, Biological;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photometry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","1727","3","23","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We establish formal criteria for comparing two different measures for learning algorithms and we show theoretically and empirically that AUC is a better measure (defined precisely) than accuracy. We then reevaluate well-established claims in machine learning based on accuracy using AUC and obtain interesting and surprising new results. For example, it has been well-established and accepted that Naive Bayes and decision trees are very similar in predictive accuracy.

Data from 24 drives of at least 50-min duration were collected for analysis. The data were analyzed in two ways. Analysis I used features from 5-min intervals of data during the rest, highway, and city driving conditions to distinguish three levels of driver stress with an accuracy of over 97% across multiple drivers and driving days. Analysis II compared continuous features, calculated at 1-s intervals throughout the entire drive, with a metric of observable stressors created by independent coders from videotapes. The results show that for most drivers studied, skin conductivity and heart rate metrics are most closely correlated with driver stress level. These findings indicate that physiological signals can provide a metric of driver stress in future cars capable of physiological monitoring.

We consider the case where quantizers are static (memoryless). The common aim of these design problems is to stabilize the given system or to achieve certain performance with the coarsest quantization density. Our main discovery is that the classical sector bound approach is nonconservative for studying these design problems. Consequently, we are able to convert many quantized feedback design problems to well-known robust control problems with sector bound uncertainties. In particular, we derive the coarsest quantization densities for stabilization for multiple-input-multiple-output systems in both state feedback and output feedback cases; and we also derive conditions for quantized feedback control for quadratic cost and H/sub /spl infin// performances.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2005.858689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532398","linear quadratic control;quadratic stabilization;quantized feedback;sector bound approach","Feedback control;Quantization;Limit-cycles;Uncertainty;Linear feedback control systems;Robust stability;Steady-state;Decoding;Linear systems;Robust control","","1321","","25","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a simple encoding algorithm that achieves near-capacity at sum rates of tens of bits/channel use. The algorithm is a variation on channel inversion that regularizes the inverse and uses a ""sphere encoder"" to perturb the data to reduce the power of the transmitted signal. This work is comprised of two parts. In this first part, we show that while the sum capacity grows linearly with the minimum of the number of antennas and users, the sum rate of channel inversion does not. This poor performance is due to the large spread in the singular values of the channel matrix. We introduce regularization to improve the condition of the inverse and maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the receivers. Regularization enables linear growth and works especially well at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), but as we show in the second part, an additional step is needed to achieve near-capacity performance at all SNRs.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2004.840638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1391204","Broadcast channel;channel inversion;multiple-antenna multiple-user wireless;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);regularization;spatial equalization","MIMO;Receiving antennas;Communication system control;Transmitters;Wireless LAN;DSL;Telephony;Switches;Interference channels;Transmitting antennas","","1297","60","19","IEEE","7 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This policy has been de jure practice to protect systems from mutual interference for many years. However, with increasing demand for the spectrum and scarcity of vacant bands, a spectrum policy reform seems inevitable. Meanwhile, recent measurements suggest the possibility of sharing spectrum among different parties subject to interference-protection constraints. In this paper we study spectrum-sharing between a primary licensee and a group of secondary users. In order to enable access to unused licensed spectrum, a secondary user has to monitor licensed bands and opportunistically transmit whenever no primary signal is detected. However, detection is compromised when a user experiences shadowing or fading effects. In such cases, user cannot distinguish between an unused band and a deep fade. Collaborative spectrum sensing is proposed and studied in this paper as a means to combat such effects.

Generally, uncertainties in evolutionary computation can be divided into the following four categories. First, the fitness function is noisy. Second, the design variables and/or the environmental parameters may change after optimization, and the quality of the obtained optimal solution should be robust against environmental changes or deviations from the optimal point. Third, the fitness function is approximated, which means that the fitness function suffers from approximation errors. Fourth, the optimum of the problem to be solved changes over time and, thus, the optimizer should be able to track the optimum continuously. In all these cases, additional measures must be taken so that evolutionary algorithms are still able to work satisfactorily. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the related work within a unified framework, which has been scattered in a variety of research areas. Existing approaches to addressing different uncertainties are presented and discussed, and the relationship between the different categories of uncertainties are investigated.

A morphological profile is constructed based on the repeated use of openings and closings with a structuring element of increasing size, starting with one original image. In order to apply the morphological approach to hyperspectral data, principal components of the hyperspectral imagery are computed. The most significant principal components are used as base images for an extended morphological profile, i.e., a profile based on more than one original image.

Helix scattering power is added as the fourth component to the three-component scattering model which describes surface, double bounce, and volume scattering. This helix scattering term is added to take account of the co-pol and the cross-pol correlations which generally appear in complex urban area scattering and disappear for a natural distributed scatterer. This term is relevant for describing man-made targets in urban area scattering. In addition, asymmetric volume scattering covariance matrices are introduced in dependence of the relative backscattering magnitude between HH and VV. A modification of probability density function for a cloud of dipole scatterers yields asymmetric covariance matrices. An appropriate choice among the symmetric or asymmetric volume scattering covariance matrices allows us to make a best fit to the measured data. A four-component decomposition algorithm is developed to deal with a general scattering case. The result of this decomposition is demonstrated with L-band Pi-SAR images taken over the city of Niigata, Japan.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.852084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1487628","Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR);radar polarimetry;scattering contribution decomposition;symmetric and asymmetric covariance matrix","Image decomposition;Radar scattering;Covariance matrix;Urban areas;Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;Synthetic aperture radar;Reflection;Backscatter;Probability density function;Clouds","","1081","3","13","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Traditionally, image QA algorithms interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a ""reference"" or ""perfect"" image in some perceptual space. Such ""full-reference"" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by arbitrary signal fidelity criteria. In this paper, we approach the problem of image QA by proposing a novel information fidelity criterion that is based on natural scene statistics. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of images and videos that are meant for ""human consumption"". Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of natural signals, that is, pictures and videos of the visual environment. Using these statistical models in an information-theoretic setting, we derive a novel QA algorithm that provides clear advantages over the traditional approaches. In particular, it is parameterless and outperforms current methods in our testing. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images. We also show that, although our approach distinctly departs from traditional HVS-based methods, it is functionally similar to them under certain conditions, yet it outperforms them due to improved modeling.

One of the main obstacles to the real-world deployment of location-sensitive wearable computing, including mixed reality (MR), is that current position-tracking technologies require an instrumented, marked, or premapped environment. At InterSense, we've developed a system called NavShoe, which uses a new approach to position tracking based on inertial sensing. Our wireless inertial sensor is small enough to easily tuck into the shoelaces, and sufficiently low power to run all day on a small battery. Although it can't be used alone for precise registration of close-range objects, in outdoor applications augmenting distant objects, a user would barely notice the NavShoe's meter-level error combined with any error in the head's assumed location relative to the foot. NavShoe can greatly reduce the database search space for computer vision, making it much simpler and more robust. The NavShoe device provides not only robust approximate position, but also an extremely accurate orientation tracker on the foot.","1558-1756","","10.1109/MCG.2005.140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1528431","inertial;navigation;Tracking;pedestrian;dead reckoning;kalman filtering;magnetometers;MEMS;calibration;GPS","Foot;Navigation;Virtual reality;Computer errors;Robustness;Mobile computing;Augmented reality;Wearable computers;Instruments;Wireless sensor networks","Acceleration;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Foot;Humans;Movement;Shoes;Telemetry;Telemetry;Transducers;User-Computer Interface","1067","142","4","IEEE","7 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Wireless location finding has emerged as an essential public safety feature of cellular systems in response to an order issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1996. The FCC mandate aims to solve a serious public safety problem caused by the fact that, at present, a large proportion of all 911 calls originate from mobile phones, the location of which cannot be determined with the existing technology. However, many difficulties intrinsic to the wireless environment make meeting the FCC objective challenging. These challenges include channel fading, low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), multiuser interference, and multipath conditions. In addition to emergency services, there are many other applications for wireless location technology, including monitoring and tracking for security reasons, location sensitive billing, fraud protection, asset tracking, fleet management, intelligent transportation systems, mobile yellow pages, and even cellular system design and management.

For instance, in a Gaussian broadcast channel with M transmit antennas and n single-antenna users, the sum rate capacity scales like Mloglogn for large n if perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter, yet only logarithmically with M if it is not. In systems with large n, obtaining full CSI from all users may not be feasible. Since lack of CSI does not lead to multiuser gains, it is therefore of interest to investigate transmission schemes that employ only partial CSI. We propose a scheme that constructs M random beams and that transmits information to the users with the highest signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratios (SINRs), which can be made available to the transmitter with very little feedback. For fixed M and n increasing, the throughput of our scheme scales as MloglognN, where N is the number of receive antennas of each user. This is precisely the same scaling obtained with perfect CSI using dirty paper coding. We furthermore show that a linear increase in throughput with M can be obtained provided that M does not not grow faster than logn. We also study the fairness of our scheduling in a heterogeneous network and show that, when M is large enough, the system becomes interference dominated and the probability of transmitting to any user converges to 1/n, irrespective of its path loss. In fact, using M=/spl alpha/logn transmit antennas emerges as a desirable operating point, both in terms of providing linear scaling of the throughput with M as well as in guaranteeing fairness.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.840897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386524","Broadcast channel;channel state information (CSI);multiuser diversity;wireless communications","MIMO;Broadcasting;Transmitters;Throughput;Channel capacity;Transmitting antennas;Channel state information;Signal to noise ratio;Feedback;Receiving antennas","","1033","91","23","IEEE","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since in these systems the power-sharing accuracy is highly sensitive to the inverters output impedance, novel control loops to achieve both stable output impedance and proper power balance are proposed. In this sense, a novel wireless controller is designed by using three nested loops: 1) the inner loop is performed by using feedback linearization control techniques, providing a good quality output voltage waveform; 2) the intermediate loop enforces the output impedance of the inverter, achieving good harmonic power sharing while maintaining low output voltage total harmonic distortion; and 3) the outer loop calculates the output active and reactive powers and adjusts the output impedance value and the output voltage frequency during the load transients, obtaining excellent power sharing without deviations in either the frequency or the amplitude of the output voltage.

The two-class variance ratio is used to rank these new features according to how well they separate sample distributions of object and background pixels. This feature evaluation mechanism is embedded in a mean-shift tracking system that adaptively selects the top-ranked discriminative features for tracking. Examples are presented that demonstrate how this method adapts to changing appearances of both tracked object and scene background.

In this paper, we propose a new model called possibilistic-fuzzy c-means (PFCM) model. PFCM produces memberships and possibilities simultaneously, along with the usual point prototypes or cluster centers for each cluster. PFCM is a hybridization of possibilistic c-means (PCM) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) that often avoids various problems of PCM, FCM and FPCM. PFCM solves the noise sensitivity defect of FCM, overcomes the coincident clusters problem of PCM and eliminates the row sum constraints of FPCM. We derive the first-order necessary conditions for extrema of the PFCM objective function, and use them as the basis for a standard alternating optimization approach to finding local minima of the PFCM objective functional. Several numerical examples are given that compare FCM and PCM to PFCM. Our examples show that PFCM compares favorably to both of the previous models. Since PFCM prototypes are less sensitive to outliers and can avoid coincident clusters, PFCM is a strong candidate for fuzzy rule-based system identification.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2004.840099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1492404","c-means models;fuzzy clustering;hybrid clustering;possibilistic clustering","Clustering algorithms;Prototypes;Phase change materials;Fuzzy systems;Knowledge based systems;Government;Strontium;Engineering management;Computer science;Fuzzy logic","","972","","16","IEEE","8 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space.

Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter.

Although the foundation has been established in the form of finite set statistics (FISST), its relationship to conventional probability is not clear. Furthermore, optimal Bayesian multitarget filtering is not yet practical due to the inherent computational hurdle. Even the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, which propagates only the first moment (or PHD) instead of the full multitarget posterior, still involves multiple integrals with no closed forms in general. This article establishes the relationship between FISST and conventional probability that leads to the development of a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) multitarget filter. In addition, an SMC implementation of the PHD filter is proposed and demonstrated on a number of simulated scenarios. Both of the proposed filters are suitable for problems involving nonlinear nonGaussian dynamics.

This work investigates two approaches based on the concept of random forests of classifiers implemented within a binary hierarchical multiclassifier system, with the goal of achieving improved generalization of the classifier in analysis of hyperspectral data, particularly when the quantity of training data is limited.

Wyner-Ziv coding, i.e., lossy compression with receiver side information, enables low-complexity video encoding where the bulk of the computation is shifted to the decoder. Since the interframe dependence of the video sequence is exploited only at the decoder, an intraframe encoder can be combined with an interframe decoder. The rate-distortion performance is superior to conventional intraframe coding, but there is still a gap relative to conventional motion-compensated interframe coding. Wyner-Ziv coding is naturally robust against transmission errors and can be used for joint source-channel coding. A Wyner-Ziv MPEG encoder that protects the video waveform rather than the compressed bit stream achieves graceful degradation under deteriorating channel conditions without a layered signal representation.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2004.839619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369699","Distributed source coding;low-complexity video coding;robust video transmission;video coding;Wyner-Ziv coding","Video coding;Video compression;Decoding;Video sequences;Rate-distortion;Robustness;Transform coding;Protection;Streaming media;Degradation","","945","26","88","IEEE","27 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem is equivalent to finding the closest lattice point to a given point and is known to be NP-hard. In communications applications, however, the given vector is not arbitrary but rather is an unknown lattice point that has been perturbed by an additive noise vector whose statistical properties are known. Therefore, in this paper, rather than dwell on the worst-case complexity of the integer least-squares problem, we study its expected complexity, averaged over the noise and over the lattice. For the ""sphere decoding"" algorithm of Fincke and Pohst, we find a closed-form expression for the expected complexity, both for the infinite and finite lattice. It is demonstrated in the second part of this paper that, for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and numbers of antennas, the expected complexity is polynomial, in fact, often roughly cubic. Since many communications systems operate at noise levels for which the expected complexity turns out to be polynomial, this suggests that maximum-likelihood decoding, which was hitherto thought to be computationally intractable, can, in fact, be implemented in real time-a result with many practical implications.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.850352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468474","Expected complexity;integer least-squares problem;lattice problems;multiple-antenna systems;NP hard;sphere decoding;wireless communications","Lattices;Vectors;Maximum likelihood decoding;Polynomials;Equations;Cryptography;Global Positioning System;Additive noise;Closed-form solution;Signal to noise ratio","","939","25","30","IEEE","18 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, our result covers FDIs in finite frequency intervals for both continuous/discrete-time settings as opposed to the standard infinite frequency range. The class of systems for which FDIs are considered is no longer constrained to be proper, and nonproper transfer functions including polynomials can also be treated. We study implications of this generalization, and develop a proper interface between the basic result and various engineering applications.

Each of these regions can be thought of as a texture element having a characteristic elliptic shape and a distinctive appearance pattern. This pattern is captured in an affine-invariant fashion via a process of shape normalization followed by the computation of two novel descriptors, the spin image and the RIFT descriptor. When affine invariance is not required, the original elliptical shape serves as an additional discriminative feature for texture recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated in retrieval and classification tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a publicly available collection of 1,000 photographs of textured surfaces taken from different viewpoints.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453514","Index Terms- Image processing and computer vision;feature measurement;texture;pattern recognition.","Surface texture;Shape;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Image databases;Spatial databases;Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Detectors;Image recognition","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","890","4","51","IEEE","20 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the conditions under which the problem is ""solvable"" are not understood or characterized. To provide a means for measuring progress and characterizing the properties of gait recognition, we introduce the humanlD gait challenge problem. The challenge problem consists of a baseline algorithm, a set of 12 experiments, and a large data set. The baseline algorithm estimates silhouettes by background subtraction and performs recognition by temporal correlation of silhouettes. The 12 experiments are of increasing difficulty, as measured by the baseline algorithm, and examine the effects of five covariates on performance. The covariates are: change in viewing angle, change in shoe type, change in walking surface, carrying or not carrying a briefcase, and elapsed time between sequences being compared. Identification rates for the 12 experiments range from 78 percent on the easiest experiment to 3 percent on the hardest. All five covariates had statistically significant effects on performance, with walking surface and time difference having the greatest impact. The data set consists of 1,870 sequences from 122 subjects spanning five covariates (1.2 gigabytes of data). This infrastructure supports further development of gait recognition algorithms and additional experiments to understand the strengths and weaknesses of new algorithms. The experimental results are presented, the more detailed is the possible meta-analysis and greater is the understanding. It is this potential from the adoption of this challenge problem that represents a radical departure from traditional computer vision research methodology.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374864","Index Terms- Gait recognition;human motion analysis;biometrics;human identification;silhouette detection;spatiotemporal correlation.","Performance analysis;Humans;Computer vision;Motion analysis;Legged locomotion;Pattern analysis;Character recognition;Shape;Data mining;Performance evaluation","Adult;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Databases, Factual;Female;Gait;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Male;Middle Aged;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Video Recording","890","5","40","IEEE","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a clustering ensemble - a set of object partitions, is produced. Given a data set (n objects or patterns in d dimensions), different ways of producing data partitions are: 1) applying different clustering algorithms and 2) applying the same clustering algorithm with different values of parameters or initializations. Further, combinations of different data representations (feature spaces) and clustering algorithms can also provide a multitude of significantly different data partitionings. We propose a simple framework for extracting a consistent clustering, given the various partitions in a clustering ensemble. According to the EAC concept, each partition is viewed as an independent evidence of data organization, individual data partitions being combined, based on a voting mechanism, to generate a new n × n similarity matrix between the n patterns. The final data partition of the n patterns is obtained by applying a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm on this matrix. We have developed a theoretical framework for the analysis of the proposed clustering combination strategy and its evaluation, based on the concept of mutual information between data partitions. Stability of the results is evaluated using bootstrapping techniques. A detailed discussion of an evidence accumulation-based clustering algorithm, using a split and merge strategy based on the k-means clustering algorithm, is presented. Experimental results of the proposed method on several synthetic and real data sets are compared with other combination strategies, and with individual clustering results produced by well-known clustering algorithms.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432715","Cluster analysis;combining clustering partitions;cluster fusion;evidence accumulation;robust clustering;K-means algorithm;single-link method;cluster validity;mutual information","Clustering algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Shape;Feature extraction;Robustness;Mutual information","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Neoplasms;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","880","","61","IEEE","5 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our work, we differentiate between the relay, cooperative broadcast (down-link), and cooperative multiple-access (CMA) (up-link) channels. The proposed protocols are evaluated using Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. For the relay channel, we investigate two classes of cooperation schemes; namely, amplify and forward (AF) protocols and decode and forward (DF) protocols. For the first class, we establish an upper bound on the achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with a single relay. We then construct a new AF protocol that achieves this upper bound. The proposed algorithm is then extended to the general case with (N-1) relays where it is shown to outperform the space-time coded protocol of Laneman and Wornell without requiring decoding/encoding at the relays. For the class of DF protocols, we develop a dynamic decode and forward (DDF) protocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for multiplexing gains 0lesrles1/N. Furthermore, with a single relay, the DDF protocol is shown to dominate the class of AF protocols for all multiplexing gains. The superiority of the DDF protocol is shown to be more significant in the cooperative broadcast channel. The situation is reversed in the CMA channel where we propose a new AF protocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for all multiplexing gains. A distinguishing feature of the proposed protocols in the three scenarios is that they do not rely on orthogonal subspaces, allowing for a more efficient use of resources. In fact, using our results one can argue that the suboptimality of previously proposed protocols stems from their use of orthogonal subspaces rather than the half-duplex constraint.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.858920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542409","Cooperative diversity;diversity–multiplexing tradeoff;dynamic decode and forward (DDF);half-duplex node;multiple-access channel;nonorthogonal amplify and forward (NAF);relay channel","Relays;Decoding;Delay;Fading;Broadcasting;Upper bound;AWGN;Subspace constraints;Wireless application protocol;Additive white noise","","853","7","26","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a new neural model, called graph neural network (GNN), capable of directly processing graphs. GNNs extends recursive neural networks and can be applied on most of the practically useful kinds of graphs, including directed, undirected, labelled and cyclic graphs. A learning algorithm for GNNs is proposed and some experiments are discussed which assess the properties of the model.","2161-4407","0-7803-9048-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1555942","","Neural networks;Focusing;Application software;Machine learning;Recurrent neural networks;Encoding;Data structures;Machine learning algorithms;Tree graphs;Software engineering","","841","1","11","IEEE","27 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The practical ED problems have nonsmooth cost functions with equality and inequality constraints that make the problem of finding the global optimum difficult using any mathematical approaches. A modified PSO (MPSO) mechanism is suggested to deal with the equality and inequality constraints in the ED problems. A constraint treatment mechanism is devised in such a way that the dynamic process inherent in the conventional PSO is preserved. Moreover, a dynamic search-space reduction strategy is devised to accelerate the optimization process. To show its efficiency and effectiveness, the proposed MPSO is applied to test ED problems, one with smooth cost functions and others with nonsmooth cost functions considering valve-point effects and multi-fuel problems. The results of the MPSO are compared with the results of conventional numerical methods, Tabu search method, evolutionary programming approaches, genetic algorithm, and modified Hopfield neural network approaches.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2004.831275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388490","Constrained optimization;economic dispatch (ED);nonsmooth optimization;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Particle swarm optimization;Cost function;Power system security;Power system dynamics;Power generation economics;Power system simulation;Constraint optimization;Genetic programming;Genetic algorithms;Power system control","","835","","17","IEEE","31 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, a hierarchical calculation of mutual information based matching is shown, which is almost as fast as intensity based matching.

The sum capacity of MU-OFDM is maximized when each subchannel is assigned to the user with the best channel-to-noise ratio for that subchannel, with power subsequently distributed by water-filling. However, fairness among the users cannot generally be achieved with such a scheme. In this paper, a set of proportional fairness constraints is imposed to assure that each user can achieve a required data rate, as in a system with quality of service guarantees. Since the optimal solution to the constrained fairness problem is extremely computationally complex to obtain, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm that separates subchannel allocation and power allocation is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, subchannel allocation is first performed by assuming an equal power distribution. An optimal power allocation algorithm then maximizes the sum capacity while maintaining proportional fairness. The proposed algorithm is shown to achieve about 95% of the optimal capacity in a two-user system, while reducing the complexity from exponential to linear in the number of subchannels. It is also shown that with the proposed resource allocation algorithm, the sum capacity is distributed more fairly and flexibly among users than the sum capacity maximization method.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2005.858010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1545851","Channel capacity;dynamic resource allocation;multiuser OFDM;proportional fairness;water-filling","Resource management;OFDM;Wireless communication;AWGN;Time division multiple access;Bit error rate;Linear programming;Downlink;Cellular networks;Wireless LAN","","834","11","15","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Incorrect correspondences establish links with the other correspondences only accidentally, so they are unlikely to belong to strongly connected clusters. We recover the correct assignments based on how strongly they belong to the main cluster of M, by using the principal eigenvector of M and imposing the mapping constraints required by the overall correspondence mapping (one-to-one or one-to-many).

We present an approach for the coordination of multiple robots, which simultaneously takes into account the cost of reaching a target point and its utility. Whenever a target point is assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored area visible from this target position is reduced. In this way, different target locations are assigned to the individual robots. We furthermore describe how our algorithm can be extended to situations in which the communication range of the robots is limited.

This relationship holds for both scalar and vector signals, as well as for discrete-time and continuous-time noncausal MMSE estimation. This fundamental information-theoretic result has an unexpected consequence in continuous-time nonlinear estimation: For any input signal with finite power, the causal filtering MMSE achieved at SNR is equal to the average value of the noncausal smoothing MMSE achieved with a channel whose SNR is chosen uniformly distributed between 0 and SNR.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.844072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1412024","Gaussian channel;minimum mean-square error (MMSE);mutual information;nonlinear filtering;optimal estimation;smoothing;Wiener process","Mutual information;Gaussian channels;Signal to noise ratio;Additive noise;Gaussian noise;Network address translation;Statistics;Power filters;Filtering;Smoothing methods","","809","5","60","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These classifiers are then refined using unlabeled examples in the tri-training process. In detail, in each round of tri-training, an unlabeled example is labeled for a classifier if the other two classifiers agree on the labeling, under certain conditions. Since tri-training neither requires the instance space to be described with sufficient and redundant views nor does it put any constraints on the supervised learning algorithm, its applicability is broader than that of previous co-training style algorithms.

The method does not use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a parameter-free, universal, similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal. However, the optimality comes at the price of using the noncomputable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose axioms to capture the real-world setting, and show that the NCD approximates optimality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (ternary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics, we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.844059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1412045","Heterogenous data analysis;hierarchical unsupervised clustering;Kolmogorov complexity;normalized compression distance;parameter-free data mining;quartet tree method;universal dissimilarity distance","Genomics;Bioinformatics;Robustness;Compressors;Clustering methods;Data mining;Application software;Astronomy;Dictionaries;Sorting","","756","16","44","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, dielectric spectroscopy showed a decrease in dielectric permittivity for the nanocomposite over the base polymer, and changes in the space charge distribution and dynamics have been documented. The most significant difference between micron scale and nanoscale fillers is the tremendous increase in interfacial area in nanocomposites. Because the interfacial region (interaction zone) is likely to be pivotal in controlling properties, the bonding between the silica and polyethylene was characterized using Fourier transformed infrared (FTTR) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The picture which is emerging suggests that the enhanced interfacial zone, in addition to particle-polymer bonding, plays a very important role in determining the dielectric behavior of nanocomposites.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2005.1511089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1511089","","Polymers;Dielectrics;Silicon compounds;Polyethylene;Breakdown voltage;Bonding;Infrared spectra;Spectroscopy;Paramagnetic resonance;Nanoparticles","","747","2","53","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, several pioneering works suggested such a separation be based on variational formulation and others using independent component analysis and sparsity. This paper presents a novel method for separating images into texture and piecewise smooth (cartoon) parts, exploiting both the variational and the sparsity mechanisms. The method combines the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) algorithm and the total-variation (TV) regularization scheme. The basic idea presented in this paper is the use of two appropriate dictionaries, one for the representation of textures and the other for the natural scene parts assumed to be piecewise smooth. Both dictionaries are chosen such that they lead to sparse representations over one type of image-content (either texture or piecewise smooth). The use of the BPDN with the two amalgamed dictionaries leads to the desired separation, along with noise removal as a by-product. As the need to choose proper dictionaries is generally hard, a TV regularization is employed to better direct the separation process and reduce ringing artifacts. We present a highly efficient numerical scheme to solve the combined optimization problem posed by our model and to show several experimental results that validate the algorithm's performance.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.852206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510691","Basis pursuit denoising (BPDN);curvelet;local discrete cosine transform (DCT);piecewise smooth;ridgelet;sparse representations;texture;total variation;wavelet","Image decomposition;Dictionaries;TV;Image coding;Image restoration;Independent component analysis;Noise reduction;Pursuit algorithms;Layout;Separation processes","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","747","2","38","IEEE","19 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At each step, every node can compute a local weighted least-squares estimate, which converges to the global maximum-likelihood solution. This scheme is robust to unreliable communication links.

The approximate expression derived for the exact bandwidth of a tuned antenna differs from previous approximate expressions in that it is inversely proportional to the magnitude |Z'/sub 0/(/spl omega//sub 0/)| of the frequency derivative of the input impedance and, for not too large a bandwidth, it is nearly equal to the exact bandwidth of the tuned antenna at every frequency /spl omega//sub 0/, that is, throughout antiresonant as well as resonant frequency bands. It is also shown that an appropriately defined exact Q of a tuned lossy or lossless antenna is approximately proportional to |Z'/sub 0/(/spl omega//sub 0/)| and thus this Q is approximately inversely proportional to the bandwidth (for not too large a bandwidth) of a simply tuned antenna at all frequencies. The exact Q of a tuned antenna is defined in terms of average internal energies that emerge naturally from Maxwell's equations applied to the tuned antenna. These internal energies, which are similar but not identical to previously defined quality-factor energies, and the associated Q are proven to increase without bound as the size of an antenna is decreased. Numerical solutions to thin straight-wire and wire-loop lossy and lossless antennas, as well as to a Yagi antenna and a straight-wire antenna embedded in a lossy dispersive dielectric, confirm the accuracy of the approximate expressions and the inverse relationship between the defined bandwidth and the defined Q over frequency ranges that cover several resonant and antiresonant frequency bands.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2005.844443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1417209","Antennas;antiresonance;bandwidth;impedance;quality factor;resonance","Impedance;Bandwidth;Dielectric losses;Resonant frequency;Yagi-Uda antennas;Q factor;Magnetic resonance;Maxwell equations;Dispersion","","728","12","40","IEEE","11 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the number of subspaces is known, we show that these polynomials can be estimated linearly from data; hence, subspace segmentation is reduced to classifying one point per subspace. We select these points optimally from the data set by minimizing certain distance function, thus dealing automatically with moderate noise in the data. A basis for the complement of each subspace is then recovered by applying standard PCA to the collection of derivatives (normal vectors). Extensions of GPCA that deal with data in a high-dimensional space and with an unknown number of subspaces are also presented. Our experiments on low-dimensional data show that GPCA outperforms existing algebraic algorithms based on polynomial factorization and provides a good initialization to iterative techniques such as k-subspaces and expectation maximization.

Furthermore, approximate representations of the decoding computations are shown to achieve a reduction in complexity by simplifying the check-node update, or symbol-node update, or both. In particular, two main approaches for simplified check-node updates are presented that are based on the so-called min-sum approximation coupled with either a normalization term or an additive offset term.

These to data fusion problems are solved is a distributed way using low-pass and band-pass consensus filters. Consensus filters are distributed algorithms that allow calculation of average-consensus of time-varying signals. The stability properties of consensus filters is discussed in a companion CDC ’05 paper [24]. We show that a central Kalman filter for sensor networks can be decomposed into n micro-Kalman filters with inputs that are provided by two types of consensus filters. This network of micro-Kalman filters collectively are capable to provide an estimate of the state of the process (under observation) that is identical to the estimate obtained by a central Kalman filter given that all nodes agree on two central sums. Later, we demonstrate that our consensus filters can approximate these sums and that gives an approximate distributed Kalman filtering algorithm.

Although most of the research papers mention the use of oxygen plasma for developing chemical (siloxane) bonds between the participating surfaces, yet they only define a certain set of parameters, tailored to a specific setup. An important requirement of all the microfluidics/biosensors industry is the development of a general regime, which defines a systematic method of gauging the bond strength between the participating surfaces in advance by correlation to a common parameter. This enhances the reliability of the devices and also gives a structured approach to its future large-scale manufacturing. In this paper, we explore the possibility of the existence of a common scale, which can be used to gauge bond strength between various surfaces. We find that the changes in wettability of surfaces owing to various levels of plasma exposure can be a useful parameter to gauge the bond strength. We obtained a good correlation between contact angle of deionized water (a direct measure of wettability) on the PDMS and glass surfaces based on various dosages or oxygen plasma treatment. The exposure was done first in an inductively coupled high-density (ICP) plasma system and then in plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system.

It is somewhat surprising that the upper bound can meet the lower bound under certain regularity conditions (not necessarily degradedness), and therefore the capacity can be characterized exactly; previously this has been proven only for the degraded Gaussian relay channel. We investigate sufficient conditions for achieving the ergodic capacity; and in particular, for the case where all nodes have the same number of antennas, the capacity can be achieved under certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

The key of the solution is to limit the high current in the rotor in order to protect the converter and to provide a bypass for this current via a set of resistors that are connected to the rotor windings. With these resistors, it is possible to ride through grid faults without disconnecting the turbine from the grid. Because the generator and converter stay connected, the synchronism of operation remains established during and after the fault and normal operation can be continued immediately after the fault has been cleared. An additional feature is that reactive power can be supplied to the grid during long dips in order to facilitate voltage restoration. A control strategy has been developed that takes care of the transition back to normal operation. Without special control action, large transients would occur.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2005.845526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432858","Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG);protection;wind power generation","Power system stability;Wind turbines;Induction generators;Voltage fluctuations;Electronics packaging;Wind energy generation;Rotors;Protection;Resistors;Power generation","","677","2","20","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective is to obtain the image that would be observed by a sensor with the same spectral response (i.e., spectral sensitivity and quantum efficiency) as the multispectral sensors and the spatial resolution of the panchromatic sensor. But in these methods, features from electromagnetic spectrum regions not covered by multispectral sensors are injected into them, and physical spectral responses of the sensors are not considered during this process. This produces some undesirable effects, such as resolution overinjection images and slightly modified spectral signatures in some features. The authors present a technique which takes into account the physical electromagnetic spectrum responses of sensors during the fusion process, which produces images closer to the image obtained by the ideal sensor than those obtained by usual wavelet-based image fusion methods.

This consensus filter plays a crucial role in solving a data fusion problem that allows implementation of a scheme for distributed Kalman filtering in sensor networks. The analysis of the convergence, noise propagation reduction, and ability to track fast signals are provided for consensus filters. As a byproduct, a novel critical phenomenon is found that relates the size of a sensor network to its tracking and sensor fusion capabilities. We characterize this performance limitation as a tracking uncertainty principle. This answers a fundamental question regarding how large a sensor network must be for effective sensor fusion. Moreover, regular networks emerge as efficient topologies for distributed fusion of noisy information. Though, arbitrary overlay networks can be used.

Under the mild assumption that the similarity measure predicts correctness of a match better than random guessing, we show that PROSAC achieves large computational savings. Experiments demonstrate it is often significantly faster (up to more than hundred times) than RANSAC. For the derived size of the sampled set of correspondences as a function of the number of samples already drawn, PROSAC converges towards RANSAC in the worst case.

These methods learn classifiers that incorporate weighted sums of basis functions with sparsity-promoting priors encouraging the weight estimates to be either significantly large or exactly zero. From a learning-theoretic perspective, these methods control the capacity of the learned classifier by minimizing the number of basis functions used, resulting in better generalization. This paper presents three contributions related to learning sparse classifiers. First, we introduce a true multiclass formulation based on multinomial logistic regression. Second, by combining a bound optimization approach with a component-wise update procedure, we derive fast exact algorithms for learning sparse multiclass classifiers that scale favorably in both the number of training samples and the feature dimensionality, making them applicable even to large data sets in high-dimensional feature spaces. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms to perform exact multinomial logistic regression with a sparsity-promoting prior. Third, we show how nontrivial generalization bounds can be derived for our classifier in the binary case.

It is high time that these various individual efforts be put into perspective and a more holistic view be taken. In this article, we take a step in that direction by presenting a survey of the literature in the area of cross-layer design, and by taking stock of the ongoing work. We suggest a definition for cross-layer design, discuss the basic types of cross-layer design with examples drawn from the literature, and categorize the initial proposals on how cross-layer interactions may be implemented.

To exploit the NoC capacity unused by the GS traffic, we provide best-effort services.","1558-1918","","10.1109/MDT.2005.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1511973","Network Architecture and Design;Real-time and embedded systems","Network-on-a-chip;Wires;Switching circuits;Routing;Network interfaces;Communication switching;Streaming media;Bandwidth;Delay;Upper bound","","626","6","12","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Bandelet bases lead to optimal approximation rates for geometrically regular images. For image compression and noise removal applications, the geometric flow is optimized with fast algorithms so that the resulting bandelet basis produces minimum distortion.

In this paper a new methodology is presented which quantifies the reserve needed on a system taking into account the uncertain nature of the wind power. Generator outage rates and load and wind power forecasts are taken into consideration when quantifying the amount of reserve needed. The reliability of the system is used as an objective measure to determine the effect of increasing wind power penetration. The methodology is applied to a model of the all Ireland electricity system, and results show that as wind power capacity increases, the system must increase the amount of reserve carried or face a measurable decrease in reliability.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2005.846206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425549","Forecasting;power generation faults;power system security;wind power generation","Wind energy;Wind energy generation;Wind forecasting;Power generation;Load forecasting;Power system reliability;Wind power generation;Power measurement;Wind farms;Power system modeling","","617","1","25","IEEE","2 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, the characteristics of the source code of these projects need to be measured to obtain more information about it. This paper describes how we calculated the object-oriented metrics given by Chidamber and Kemerer to illustrate how fault-proneness detection of the source code of the open source Web and e-mail suite called Mozilla can be carried out. We checked the values obtained against the number of bugs found in its bug database - called Bugzilla - using regression and machine learning methods to validate the usefulness of these metrics for fault-proneness prediction.

Power and wire design constraints are forcing the adoption of new design methodologies for system-on-chip (SoC), namely, those that incorporate modularity and explicit parallelism. To enable these MP-SoC platforms, researchers have recently pursued scaleable communication-centric interconnect fabrics, such as networks-on-chip (NoC), which possess many features that are particularly attractive for these. These communication-centric interconnect fabrics are characterized by different trade-offs with regard to latency, throughput, energy dissipation, and silicon area requirements. In this paper, we develop a consistent and meaningful evaluation methodology to compare the performance and characteristics of a variety of NoC architectures. We also explore design trade-offs that characterize the NoC approach and obtain comparative results for a number of common NoC topologies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort in characterizing different NoC architectures with respect to their performance and design trade-offs. To further illustrate our evaluation methodology, we map a typical multiprocessing platform to different NoC interconnect architectures and show how the system performance is affected by these design trade-offs.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2005.134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453503","Index Terms- Network-on-chip;MP-SoC;infrastructure IP;interconnect architecture;system-on-chip.","Computer architecture;Multiprocessing;Integrated circuit interconnections","","606","15","36","IEEE","20 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The inductive quality factor (Q/sub L/) is proposed as a more representative metric for transmission lines, and for a standard CMOS back-end process, coplanar waveguide (CPW) lines are determined to possess a higher Q/sub L/ than microstrip lines. Techniques for accurate modeling of active and passive components at mm-wave frequencies are presented.

The low commercial penetration of products based on ad hoc networking technology could be explained by noting that the ongoing research is mainly focused on implementing military or specialized civilian applications. On the other hand, users are interested in general-purpose applications where high bandwidth and open access to the Internet are consolidated and cheap commodities. To turn mobile ad hoc networks into a commodity, we should move to more pragmatic ""opportunistic ad hoc networking"" in which multihop ad hoc networks are not isolated self-configured networks, but rather emerge as a flexible and low-cost extension of wired infrastructure networks coexisting with them. Indeed, a new class of networks is emerging from this view: mesh networks. This article provides an overview of mesh networking technology. In particular, starting from commercial case studies we describe the core building blocks and distinct features on which wireless mesh networks should be based.

The Si wire waveguide promises size reduction and high-density integration of optical circuits due to its strong light confinement. However, large connection and propagation losses had been serious problems. We solved these problems by using a spot-size converter and improving the microfabrication technology. As a result, propagation losses as low as 2.8 dB/cm for a 400/spl times/200 nm waveguide and a coupling loss of 0.5 dB per connection were obtained.

Spatial multiplexing is a common space-time modulation technique for MIMO communication systems where independent information streams are sent over different transmit antennas. Unfortunately, spatial multiplexing is sensitive to ill-conditioning of the channel matrix. Precoding can improve the resilience of spatial multiplexing at the expense of full channel knowledge at the transmitter-which is often not realistic. This correspondence proposes a quantized precoding system where the optimal precoder is chosen from a finite codebook known to both receiver and transmitter. The index of the optimal precoder is conveyed from the receiver to the transmitter over a low-delay feedback link. Criteria are presented for selecting the optimal precoding matrix based on the error rate and mutual information for different receiver designs. Codebook design criteria are proposed for each selection criterion by minimizing a bound on the average distortion assuming a Rayleigh-fading matrix channel. The design criteria are shown to be equivalent to packing subspaces in the Grassmann manifold using the projection two-norm and Fubini-Study distances. Simulation results show that the proposed system outperforms antenna subset selection and performs close to optimal unitary precoding with a minimal amount of feedback.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.850152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468321","Diversity methods;Grassmannian subspace packing;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems;quantized precoding;Rayleigh channels;spatial multiplexing;vertical Bell Labs layered space–time (V-BLAST) architecture","Feedback;MIMO;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Wireless sensor networks;Receiving antennas;Antenna arrays;Resilience;Error analysis;Mutual information","","597","286","42","IEEE","18 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the GIF method, it is shown that the pixel values of the high-resolution multispectral images are determined by the corresponding pixel values of the low-resolution panchromatic image, the approximation of the high-resolution panchromatic image at the low-resolution level. Many of the existing image fusion methods, including, but not limited to, intensity-hue-saturation, Brovey transform, principal component analysis, high-pass filtering, high-pass modulation, the a/spl grave/ trous algorithm-based wavelet transform, and multiresolution analysis-based intensity modulation (MRAIM), are evaluated and found to be particular cases of the GIF method. The performance of each image fusion method is theoretically analyzed based on how the corresponding low-resolution panchromatic image is computed and how the modulation coefficients are set. An experiment based on IKONOS images shows that there is consistency between the theoretical analysis and the experimental results and that the MRAIM method synthesizes the images closest to those the corresponding multisensors would observe at the high-resolution level.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.846874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1433035","General image fusion (GIF) method;image formation principle;image fusion","Image analysis;Image fusion;Multispectral imaging;Pixel;Wavelet transforms;Intensity modulation;Principal component analysis;Filtering algorithms;Wavelet analysis;Image resolution","","594","15","39","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, several emerging nanoelectronic devices such as carbon-nanotube field-effect transistors (FETs), Si nanowire FETs, and planar III-V compound semiconductor (e.g., InSb, InAs) FETs, all hold promise as potential device candidates to be integrated onto the silicon platform for enhancing circuit functionality and also for extending Moore's Law. For high-performance and low-power logic transistor applications, it is important that these research devices are frequently benchmarked against the existing Si logic transistor data in order to gauge the progress of research. In this paper, we use four key device metrics to compare these emerging nanoelectronic devices to the state-of-the-art planar and nonplanar Si logic transistors. These four metrics include: 1) CV/I or intrinsic gate delay versus physical gate length L/sub g/; 2) energy-delay product versus L/sub g/; 3) subthreshold slope versus L/sub g/; and 4) CV/I versus on-to-off-state current ratio I/sub ON//I/sub OFF/. The results of this benchmarking exercise indicate that while these novel nanoelectronic devices show promise and opportunities for future logic applications, there still remain shortcomings in the device characteristics and electrostatics that need to be overcome.

The algorithm is a variation on channel inversion that regularizes the inverse and uses a ""sphere encoder"" to perturb the data to reduce the energy of the transmitted signal. The paper is comprised of two parts. In this second part, we show that, after the regularization of the channel inverse introduced in the first part, a certain perturbation of the data using a ""sphere encoder"" can be chosen to further reduce the energy of the transmitted signal.

The exponential decay of light output as a function of time provided a convenient method to rapidly estimate life by data extrapolation.

With network coding, each node of the distribution network is able to generate and transmit encoded blocks of information. The randomization introduced by the coding process eases the scheduling of block propagation, and, thus, makes the distribution more efficient. This is particularly important in large unstructured overlay networks, where the nodes need to make block forwarding decisions based on local information only. We compare network coding to other schemes that transmit unencoded information (i.e. blocks of the original file) and, also, to schemes in which only the source is allowed to generate and transmit encoded packets. We study the performance of network coding in heterogeneous networks with dynamic node arrival and departure patterns, clustered topologies, and when incentive mechanisms to discourage free-riding are in place. We demonstrate through simulations of scenarios of practical interest that the expected file download time improves by more than 20-30% with network coding compared to coding at the server only and, by more than 2-3 times compared to sending unencoded information. Moreover, we show that network coding improves the robustness of the system and is able to smoothly handle extreme situations where the server and nodes leave the system.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498511","","Network coding;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;File servers;Network servers;Network topology;Web server;Bandwidth;Educational institutions;Distributed computing","","579","26","30","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sources of this uncertainty include imprecise knowledge of the angle of arrival and uncertainty in the array manifold. In our method, uncertainty in the array manifold is explicitly modeled via an ellipsoid that gives the possible values of the array for a particular look direction. We choose weights that minimize the total weighted power output of the array, subject to the constraint that the gain should exceed unity for all array responses in this ellipsoid. The robust weight selection process can be cast as a second-order cone program that can be solved efficiently using Lagrange multiplier techniques. If the ellipsoid reduces to a single point, the method coincides with Capon's method. We describe in detail several methods that can be used to derive an appropriate uncertainty ellipsoid for the array response. We form separate uncertainty ellipsoids for each component in the signal path (e.g., antenna, electronics) and then determine an aggregate uncertainty ellipsoid from these. We give new results for modeling the element-wise products of ellipsoids.

Environmental energy harvesting, in particular solar based, has emerged as a viable technique to supplement battery supplies. However, designing an efficient solar harvesting system to realize the potential benefits of energy harvesting requires an in-depth understanding of several factors. For example, solar energy supply is highly time varying and may not always be sufficient to power the embedded system. Harvesting components, such as solar panels, and energy storage elements, such as batteries or ultracapacitors, have different voltage-current characteristics, which must be matched to each other as well as the energy requirements of the system to maximize harvesting efficiency. Further, battery non-idealities, such as self-discharge and round trip efficiency, directly affect energy usage and storage decisions. The ability of the system to modulate its power consumption by selectively deactivating its sub-components also impacts the overall power management architecture. This paper describes key issues and tradeoffs which arise in the design of solar energy harvesting, wireless embedded systems and presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of Heliomote, our prototype that addresses several of these issues. Experimental results demonstrate that Heliomote, which behaves as a plug-in to the Berkeley/Crossbow motes and autonomously manages energy harvesting and storage, enables near-perpetual, harvesting aware operation of the sensor node.","","0-7803-9201-9","10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440973","","Solar energy;Embedded system;Batteries;Energy storage;Wireless sensor networks;Energy management;Sensor systems;Potential energy;Time varying systems;Supercapacitors","","576","4","28","IEEE","13 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We achieve this using a model developed in the statistical text literature: probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). In text analysis, this is used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we treat object categories as topics, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modeled as a mixture of topics. The model is applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT-like region descriptors. The topic discovery approach successfully translates to the visual domain: for a small set of objects, we show that both the object categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. Performance of this unsupervised method is compared to the supervised approach of Fergus et al. (2003) on a set of unseen images containing only one object per image. We also extend the bag-of-words vocabulary to include 'doublets' which encode spatially local co-occurring regions. It is demonstrated that this extended vocabulary gives a cleaner image segmentation. Finally, the classification and segmentation methods are applied to a set of images containing multiple objects per image. These results demonstrate that we can successfully build object class models from an unsupervised analysis of images.","2380-7504","0-7695-2334-X","10.1109/ICCV.2005.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541280","","Image segmentation;Vocabulary;Graphical models;Histograms;Computer vision;Random variables;Labeling;Clustering algorithms;Frequency;Object detection","","568","8","24","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach is based on a closed-loop process made up of three main steps: (1) a novel preprocessing based on a controlled adaptive iterative filtering; (2) a comparison between multitemporal images carried out according to a standard log-ratio operator; and (3) a novel approach to the automatic analysis of the log-ratio image for generating the change-detection map. The first step aims at reducing the speckle noise in a controlled way in order to maximize the discrimination capability between changed and unchanged classes. In the second step, the two filtered multitemporal images are compared to generate a log-ratio image that contains explicit information on changed areas. The third step produces the change-detection map according to a thresholding procedure based on a reformulation of the Kittler-Illingworth (KI) threshold selection criterion. In particular, the modified KI criterion is derived under the generalized Gaussian assumption for modeling the distributions of changed and unchanged classes. This parametric model was chosen because it is capable of better fitting the conditional densities of classes in the log-ratio image. In order to control the filtering step and, accordingly, the effects of the filtering process on change-detection accuracy, we propose to identify automatically the optimal number of despeckling filter iterations [Step 1] by analyzing the behavior of the modified KI criterion. This results in a completely automatic and self-consistent change-detection approach that avoids the use of empirical methods for the selection of the best number of filtering iterations. Experiments carried out on two sets of multitemporal images (characterized by different levels of speckle noise) acquired by the European Remote Sensing 2 satellite SAR sensor confirm the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised approach, which results in change-detection accuracies very similar to those that can be achieved by a manual supervised thresholding.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.842441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1411993","Change detection;generalized Gaussian (GG) distribution;multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images;threshold selection","Filtering;Image analysis;Image generation;Speckle;Automatic control;Radar detection;Synthetic aperture radar;Automatic generation control;Programmable control;Adaptive control","","568","","28","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It classifies a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs acquired by us, ii) images from the Web and iii) images from the recently released Pascal dataset.

Once deployed, the small sensor nodes are usually inaccessible to the user, and thus replacement of the energy source is not feasible. Hence, energy efficiency is a key design issue that needs to be enhanced in order to improve the life span of the network. Several network layer protocols have been proposed to improve the effective lifetime of a network with a limited energy supply. In this article we propose a centralized routing protocol called base-station controlled dynamic clustering protocol (BCDCP), which distributes the energy dissipation evenly among all sensor nodes to improve network lifetime and average energy savings. The performance of BCDCP is then compared to clustering-based schemes such as low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), LEACH-centralized (LEACH-C), and power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems (PEGASIS). Simulation results show that BCDCP reduces overall energy consumption and improves network lifetime over its comparatives.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2005.1404592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1404592","","Energy efficiency;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;Energy resources;Centralized control;Energy dissipation;Sensor systems;Information systems;Energy consumption","","565","3","10","IEEE","14 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A multiresolution search algorithm and an expectation-maximization (EM) like iterative algorithm are proposed to expedite the computation of source locations.

In some cases, the algorithm is referred to as an algorithm of polynomial complexity without clearly specifying what assumptions are made about the problem structure. Another claim is that although worst-case complexity is exponential, the expected complexity of the algorithm is polynomial. Herein, we study the expected complexity where the problem size is defined to be the number of symbols jointly detected, and our main result is that the expected complexity is exponential for fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrary to previous claims. The sphere radius, which is a parameter of the algorithm, must be chosen to ensure a nonvanishing probability of solving the detection problem. This causes the exponential complexity since the squared radius must grow linearly with problem size. The rate of linear increase is, however, dependent on the noise variance, and thus, the rate of the exponential function is strongly dependent on the SNR. Therefore sphere decoding can be efficient for some SNR and problems of moderate size, even though the number of operations required by the algorithm strictly speaking always grows as an exponential function of the problem size.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.843746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1408197","Expected complexity;large deviation theory;ML detection;sphere decoding","Decoding;Digital communication;Polynomials;Signal to noise ratio;Multiuser detection;Multiaccess communication;Viterbi algorithm;Dispersion;Block codes;Computational complexity","","559","7","17","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These methods are inspired by models of natural systems that combine the evolutionary adaptation of a population with individual learning within the lifetimes of its members. Additionally, MAs are inspired by Richard Dawkin's concept of a meme, which represents a unit of cultural evolution that can exhibit local refinement (Dawkins, 1976). In the case of MA's, ""memes"" refer to the strategies (e.g., local refinement, perturbation, or constructive methods, etc.) that are employed to improve individuals. In this paper, we review some works on the application of MAs to well-known combinatorial optimization problems, and place them in a framework defined by a general syntactic model. This model provides us with a classification scheme based on a computable index D, which facilitates algorithmic comparisons and suggests areas for future research. Also, by having an abstract model for this class of metaheuristics, it is possible to explore their design space and better understand their behavior from a theoretical standpoint.

Power-constrained wireless sensor networks are usable as long as they can communicate sensed data to a processing node. Sensing and communications consume energy, therefore judicious power management and sensor scheduling can effectively extend network lifetime. To cover a set of targets with known locations when ground access in the remote area is prohibited, one solution is to deploy the sensors remotely, from an aircraft. The lack of precise sensor placement is compensated by a large sensor population deployed in the drop zone, that would improve the probability of target coverage. The data collected from the sensors is sent to a central node (e.g. cluster head) for processing. In this paper we propose un efficient method to extend the sensor network life time by organizing the sensors into a maximal number of set covers that are activated successively. Only the sensors from the current active set are responsible for monitoring all targets and for transmitting the collected data, while all other nodes are in a low-energy sleep mode. By allowing sensors to participate in multiple sets, our problem formulation increases the network lifetime compared with related work [M. Cardei et al], that has the additional requirements of sensor sets being disjoint and operating equal time intervals. In this paper we model the solution as the maximum set covers problem and design two heuristics that efficiently compute the sets, using linear programming and a greedy approach. Simulation results are presented to verify our approaches.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498475","","Energy efficiency;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Computer science;Scheduling;Energy management;Monitoring;Transceivers;Application software","","546","","19","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, segmentation performance degrades when only chrominance channels are used in classification. Furthermore, we find that color quantization can be as low as 64 bins per channel, although higher histogram sizes give better segmentation performance. The Bayesian classifier with the histogram technique and the multilayer perceptron classifier are found to perform better compared to other tested classifiers, including three piecewise linear classifiers, three unimodal Gaussian classifiers, and a Gaussian mixture classifier.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359760","Index Terms- Pixel classification;skin segmentation;classifier design and evaluation;color space;face detection.","Skin;Color;Histograms;Quantization;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Degradation;Multilayer perceptrons;Performance evaluation;Testing","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Colorimetry;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Skin Pigmentation;Subtraction Technique","545","7","19","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning algorithm called neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE). Different from principal component analysis (PCA) which aims at preserving the global Euclidean structure, NPE aims at preserving the local neighborhood structure on the data manifold. Therefore, NPE is less sensitive to outliers than PCA. Also, comparing to the recently proposed manifold learning algorithms such as Isomap and locally linear embedding, NPE is defined everywhere, rather than only on the training data points. Furthermore, NPE may be conducted in the original space or in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space into which data points are mapped. This gives rise to kernel NPE.

The core operations in DONet are very simple: every node periodically exchanges data availability information with a set of partners, and retrieves unavailable data from one or more partners, or supplies available data to partners. We emphasize three salient features of this data-driven design: 1) easy to implement, as it does not have to construct and maintain a complex global structure; 2) efficient, as data forwarding is dynamically determined according to data availability while not restricted by specific directions; and 3) robust and resilient, as the partnerships enable adaptive and quick switching among multi-suppliers. We show through analysis that DONet is scalable with bounded delay. We also address a set of practical challenges for realizing DONet, and propose an efficient member and partnership management algorithm, together with an intelligent scheduling algorithm that achieves real-time and continuous distribution of streaming contents. We have extensively evaluated the performance of DONet over the PlanetLab. Our experiments, involving almost all the active PlanetLab nodes, demonstrate that DONet achieves quite good streaming quality even under formidable network conditions. Moreover, its control overhead and transmission delay are both kept at low levels. An Internet-based DONet implementation, called CoolStreaming v.0.9, was released on May 30, 2004, which has attracted over 30000 distinct users with more than 4000 simultaneously being online at some peak times. We discuss the key issues toward designing CoolStreaming in this paper, and present several interesting observations from these large-scale tests; in particular, the larger the overlay size, the better the streaming quality it can deliver.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498486","","Streaming media;Peer to peer computing;Availability;Delay;Scheduling algorithm;Information retrieval;Robustness;Content management;Internet;Large-scale systems","","540","47","31","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The growing and pruning strategy of GGAP-RBF is based on linking the required learning accuracy with the significance of the nearest or intentionally added new neuron. Significance of a neuron is a measure of the average information content of that neuron. The GGAP-RBF algorithm can be used for any arbitrary sampling density for training samples and is derived from a rigorous statistical point of view.

In this context, we assume that there exist several experts who may have different background and knowledge to solve a particular problem and, therefore, different linguistic term sets (multigranular linguistic information) could be used to express their opinions. The aim of this paper is to present a model of consensus support system to assist the experts in all phases of the consensus reaching process of group decision-making problems with multigranular linguistic preference relations. This consensus support system model is based on i) a multigranular linguistic methodology, ii) two consensus criteria, consensus degrees and proximity measures, and iii) a guidance advice system. The multigranular linguistic methodology permits the unification of the different linguistic domains to facilitate the calculus of consensus degrees and proximity measures on the basis of experts' opinions. The consensus degrees assess the agreement amongst all the experts' opinions, while the proximity measures are used to find out how far the individual opinions are from the group opinion. The guidance advice system integrated in the consensus support system model acts as a feedback mechanism, and it is based on a set of advice rules to help the experts change their opinions and to find out which direction that change should follow in order to obtain the highest degree of consensus possible. There are two main advantages provided by this model of consensus support system. Firstly, its ability to cope with group decision-making problems with multigranular linguistic preference relations, and, secondly, the figure of the moderator, traditionally presents in the consensus reaching process, is replaced by the guidance advice system, and in such a way, the whole group decision-making process is automated","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.856561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1516155","Consensus;fuzzy preference relation;group decision-making (GDM);linguistic modeling","Decision making;Computer science;Calculus;Feedback;Artificial intelligence;Computational intelligence;Fuzzy set theory;Context modeling","","532","","44","IEEE","10 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been used to electrically characterize the interface for various electrode materials: platinum, platinum black, and titanium nitride; and varying electrode sizes: 1 cm/sup 2/, and 900 /spl mu/m/sup 2/. An equivalent circuit model comprising an interface capacitance, shunted by a charge transfer resistance, in series with the solution resistance has been fitted to the experimental results. Theoretical equations have been used to calculate the interface capacitance impedance and the solution resistance, yielding results that correspond well with the fitted parameter values, thereby confirming the validity of the equations. The effect of incubation time, and two organic cell-adhesion promoting coatings, poly-L-lysine and laminin, on the interface impedance has been quantified using the model.

Despite the enormous amount of academic and industrial research in the past 20 years on interference-aware receivers and the large performance improvements promised by these multi-user techniques, today's receivers still generally treat interference as background noise. In this article, we enumerate the reasons for this widespread scepticism, and discuss how current and future trends increases the need for and viability of multi-user receivers for both the uplink, where many asynchronous users are simultaneously detected, and the downlink, where users are scheduled and largely orthogonalized; but the mobile handset still needs to cope with a few dominant interfering base stations. New results for interference cancelling receivers that use conventional front-ends are shown to alleviate many of the shortcomings of prior techniques, particularly for the challenging uplink. This article gives an overview of key recent research breakthroughs on interference cancellation and highlights system-level considerations for future multi-user receivers.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2005.1421925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1421925","","Modulation coding;Signal processing;Wireless communication;Interference cancellation;Multiaccess communication;Base stations;Downlink;Signal processing algorithms;Decoding;Land mobile radio cellular systems","","527","20","82","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The network consists of power constrained nodes that transmit over wireless links with adaptive transmission rates. Packets randomly enter the system at each node and wait in output queues to be transmitted through the network to their destinations. We establish the capacity region of all rate matrices (/spl lambda//sub ij/) that the system can stably support-where /spl lambda//sub ij/ represents the rate of traffic originating at node i and destined for node j. A joint routing and power allocation policy is developed that stabilizes the system and provides bounded average delay guarantees whenever the input rates are within this capacity region. Such performance holds for general arrival and channel state processes, even if these processes are unknown to the network controller. We then apply this control algorithm to an ad hoc wireless network, where channel variations are due to user mobility. Centralized and decentralized implementations are compared, and the stability region of the decentralized algorithm is shown to contain that of the mobile relay strategy developed by Grossglauser and Tse (2002).","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.837349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374962","Capacity;control;optimization;queueing","Routing;Wireless networks;Peer to peer computing;Control systems;Time-varying channels;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Delay;Stability;Relays","","527","4","41","IEEE","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The present algorithm is purely algebraic; hence, its formulation and implementation are integral equation kernel (Green's function) independent. The algorithm starts with a multilevel partitioning of the computational domain. The interactions of well-separated partitioning clusters are accounted through a rank-revealing LU decomposition. The acceleration and memory savings of ACA come from the partial assembly of the rank-deficient interaction submatrices. It has been demonstrated that the ACA algorithm results in O(NlogN) complexity (where N is the number of unknowns) when applied to static and electrically small electromagnetic problems. In this paper the ACA algorithm is extended to electromagnetic compatibility-related problems of moderate electrical size. Specifically, the ACA algorithm is used to study compact-range ground planes and electromagnetic interference and shielding in vehicles. Through numerical experiments, it is concluded that for moderate electrical size problems the memory and CPU time requirements for the ACA algorithm scale as N/sup 4/3/logN.","1558-187X","","10.1109/TEMC.2005.857898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580747","Automotive electromagnetic compatibility (EMC);fast integral equation methods;infinite ground plane;method of moments (MoM)","Electromagnetic compatibility;Approximation methods;Moment methods;Integral equations;Green's functions","","524","3","42","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present an object detection scheme that has three innovations over existing approaches. First, the model of the intensities of image pixels as independent random variables is challenged and it is asserted that useful correlation exists in intensities of spatially proximal pixels. This correlation is exploited to sustain high levels of detection accuracy in the presence of dynamic backgrounds. By using a nonparametric density estimation method over a joint domain-range representation of image pixels, multimodal spatial uncertainties and complex dependencies between the domain (location) and range (color) are directly modeled. We propose a model of the background as a single probability density. Second, temporal persistence is proposed as a detection criterion. Unlike previous approaches to object detection which detect objects by building adaptive models of the background, the foregrounds modeled to augment the detection of objects (without explicit tracking) since objects detected in the preceding frame contain substantial evidence for detection in the current frame. Finally, the background and foreground models are used competitively in a MAP-MRF decision framework, stressing spatial context as a condition of detecting interesting objects and the posterior function is maximized efficiently by finding the minimum cut of a capacitated graph. Experimental validation of the proposed method is performed and presented on a diverse set of dynamic scenes.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512057","Index Terms- Object detection;kernel density estimation;joint domain range;MAP-MRF estimation.","Bayesian methods;Layout;Object detection;Pixel;Cameras;Colored noise;Uncertainty;Motion compensation;Technological innovation;Random variables","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Subtraction Technique;Video Recording","522","1","40","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When only a limited number of frequency converters are available, conventional antenna selection schemes show severe performance degradation in most fading channels. To alleviate those degradations, we propose to adopt a transformation of the signals in the RF domain that requires only simple, variable phase shifters and combiners to reduce the number of RF chains. The constrained optimum design of these shifters, adapting to the channel state, is given in analytical form, which requires no search or iterations. The resulting system shows a significant performance advantage for both correlated and uncorrelated channels. The technique works for both transmitter and receiver design, which leads to the joint transceiver antenna selection. When only a single information stream is transmitted through the channel, the new design can achieve the same SNR gain as the full-complexity system while requiring, at most, two RF chains. With multiple information streams transmitted, it is demonstrated by computer experiments that the capacity performance is close to optimum.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.857024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1519678","","MIMO;Radio frequency;Degradation;Signal design;Baseband;Signal processing;Frequency conversion;Fading;RF signals;Phase shifters","","521","9","45","IEEE","17 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper explores the detection of domain-specific emotions using language and discourse information in conjunction with acoustic correlates of emotion in speech signals. The specific focus is on a case study of detecting negative and non-negative emotions using spoken language data obtained from a call center application. Most previous studies in emotion recognition have used only the acoustic information contained in speech. In this paper, a combination of three sources of information-acoustic, lexical, and discourse-is used for emotion recognition. To capture emotion information at the language level, an information-theoretic notion of emotional salience is introduced. Optimization of the acoustic correlates of emotion with respect to classification error was accomplished by investigating different feature sets obtained from feature selection, followed by principal component analysis. Experimental results on our call center data show that the best results are obtained when acoustic and language information are combined. Results show that combining all the information, rather than using only acoustic information, improves emotion classification by 40.7% for males and 36.4% for females (linear discriminant classifier used for acoustic information).","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2004.838534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1395974","Acoustic correlates;dialog systems;emotion recognition;emotional salience;feature selection;information fusion;principal component analysis;spoken language processing","Emotion recognition;Humans;Natural languages;Psychology;Acoustic signal detection;Principal component analysis;Man machine systems;Signal analysis;Automatic speech recognition;Information resources","","514","9","28","IEEE","22 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve this, we exploit the new paradigm of a deep-submicron CMOS process environment by leveraging on the fast switching times of MOS transistors, the fine lithography and the precise device matching, while avoiding problems related to the limited voltage headroom.

This prevents them from being used as an ISP's wireless last-mile access network or as a wireless enterprise backbone network. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel wireless mesh network (WMN) architecture (called Hyacinth) that equips each mesh network node with multiple 802.11 network interface cards (NICs). The central design issues of this multi-channel WMN architecture are channel assignment and routing. We show that intelligent channel assignment is critical to Hyacinth's performance, present distributed algorithms that utilize only local traffic load information to dynamically assign channels and to route packets, and compare their performance against a centralized algorithm that performs the same functions. Through an extensive simulation study, we show that even with just 2 NICs on each node, it is possible to improve the network throughput by a factor of 6 to 7 when compared with the conventional single-channel ad hoc network architecture.

We compare several types of nonlinear filters, including: particle filters (PFs), unscented Kalman filters, extended Kalman filters, batch filters and exact recursive filters. The key practical issue in nonlinear filtering is computational complexity, which is often called ""the curse of dimensionality"". It has been asserted that PFs avoid the curse of dimensionality, but this is generally incorrect. Well-designed PFs with good proposal densities sometimes avoid the curse of dimensionality, but not otherwise. Future research in nonlinear filtering will exploit recent progress in quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms (rather than boring old Monte Carlo methods), as well as ideas borrowed from physics (e.g., dimensional interpolation) and new mesh-free adjoint methods for solving PDEs. This tutorial was written for normal engineers, who do not have nonlinear filters for breakfast.","1557-959X","","10.1109/MAES.2005.1499276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1499276","","Nonlinear filters;Computational complexity;Covariance matrix;Costs;State estimation;Shape measurement;Particle filters;Proposals;Filtering algorithms;Physics","","506","8","48","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

While the particle filter is fairly easy to implement and tune, its main drawback is that it is quite computer intensive, with the computational complexity increasing quickly with the state dimension. One remedy to this problem is to marginalize out the states appearing linearly in the dynamics. The result is that one Kalman filter is associated with each particle. The main contribution in this paper is the derivation of the details for the marginalized particle filter for a general nonlinear state-space model. Several important special cases occurring in typical signal processing applications will also be discussed. The marginalized particle filter is applied to an integrated navigation system for aircraft. It is demonstrated that the complete high-dimensional system can be based on a particle filter using marginalization for all but three states. Excellent performance on real flight data is reported.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.849151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453762","Kalman filter;marginalization;navigation systems;nonlinear systems;particle filter;state estimation","Particle filters;Aircraft navigation;Filtering;State estimation;Density measurement;Noise measurement;Time measurement;Density functional theory;Nonlinear filters;Computational complexity","","505","2","37","IEEE","20 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes and evaluates an optimization algorithm for the powerful de-identification procedure known as k-anonymization. A k-anonymized dataset has the property that each record is indistinguishable from at least k - 1 others. Even simple restrictions of optimized k-anonymity are NP-hard, leading to significant computational challenges. We present a new approach to exploring the space of possible anonymizations that tames the combinatorics of the problem, and develop data-management strategies to reduce reliance on expensive operations such as sorting. Through experiments on real census data, we show the resulting algorithm can find optimal k-anonymizations under two representative cost measures and a wide range of k. We also show that the algorithm can produce good anonymizations in circumstances where the input data or input parameters preclude finding an optimal solution in reasonable time. Finally, we use the algorithm to explore the effects of different coding approaches and problem variations on anonymization quality and performance. To our knowledge, this is the first result demonstrating optimal k-anonymization of a non-trivial dataset under a general model of the problem.","2375-026X","0-7695-2285-8","10.1109/ICDE.2005.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410124","","Data privacy;Proposals;Costs;Iterative algorithms;Sorting;Stochastic processes;Frequency;Data engineering;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning","","504","9","16","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, finding a consensus clustering from multiple partitions is a difficult problem that can be approached from graph-based, combinatorial, or statistical perspectives. This study extends previous research on clustering ensembles in several respects. First, we introduce a unified representation for multiple clusterings and formulate the corresponding categorical clustering problem. Second, we propose a probabilistic model of consensus using a finite mixture of multinomial distributions in a space of clusterings. A combined partition is found as a solution to the corresponding maximum-likelihood problem using the EM algorithm. Third, we define a new consensus function that is related to the classical intraclass variance criterion using the generalized mutual information definition. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of combining partitions generated by weak clustering algorithms that use data projections and random data splits. A simple explanatory model is offered for the behavior of combinations of such weak clustering components. Combination accuracy is analyzed as a function of several parameters that control the power and resolution of component partitions as well as the number of partitions. We also analyze clustering ensembles with incomplete information and the effect of missing cluster labels on the quality of overall consensus.

This paper presents a novel, software-only, transient-fault-detection technique, called SWIFT. SWIFT efficiently manages redundancy by reclaiming unused instruction-level resources present during the execution of most programs. SWIFT also provides a high level of protection and performance with an enhanced control-flow checking mechanism. We evaluate an implementation of SWIFT on an Itanium 2 which demonstrates exceptional fault coverage with a reasonable performance cost.

In the proposed strategy, a coupled inductor with a lower-voltage-rated switch is used for raising the voltage gain (whether the switch is turned on or turned off). Moreover, a passive regenerative snubber is utilized for absorbing the energy of stray inductance so that the switch duty cycle can be operated under a wide range, and the related voltage gain is higher than other coupled-inductor-based converters. In addition, all devices in this scheme also have voltage-clamped properties and their voltage stresses are relatively smaller than the output voltage. Thus, it can select low-voltage low-conduction-loss devices, and there are no reverse-recovery currents within the diodes in this circuit. Furthermore, the closed-loop control methodology is utilized in the proposed scheme to overcome the voltage drift problem of the power source under the load variations. As a result, the proposed converter topology can promote the voltage gain of a conventional boost converter with a single inductor, and deal with the problem of the leakage inductor and demagnetization of transformer for a coupled-inductor-based converter. Some experimental results via examples of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) power source and a traditional battery are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power conversion strategy.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.854023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1504873","Battery;converter;coupled inductor;fuel cell;passive regenerative snubber;proton exchange membrane;reverse recovery","Switches;Inductors;Snubbers;Inductance;Coupling circuits;Switching converters;Stress;Diodes;Voltage control;Load management","","494","6","22","IEEE","6 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Optimal solutions to this problem can be prohibitively complex for online implementation at the base station and entail so-called Dirty Paper (DP) precoding for known interference. Suboptimal solutions capitalize on multiuser (selection) diversity to achieve a significant fraction of sum capacity at lower complexity cost. We analyze the throughput performance in Rayleigh fading of a suboptimal greedy DP-based scheme proposed by Tu and Blum.

Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces.","1063-6919","0-7695-2372-2","10.1109/CVPR.2005.320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467245","","Shape;Object recognition;Computer vision;Algorithms;Deformable models;Quadratic programming;Cost function;Spline;Nearest neighbor searches;Face detection","","479","13","33","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When combined with silver, chalcogenide glasses such as Se-rich Ge-Se are good solid electrolytes, exhibiting high Ag ion mobility and availability. By placing an anode that has oxidizable Ag and an inert cathode (e.g., Ni) in contact with a thin layer of such a material, a device is formed that has an intrinsically high resistance, but which can be switched to a low-resistance state at small voltage via reduction of the silver ions. An opposite bias will return the device to a high-resistance state, and this reversible switching effect is the basis of programmable metallization cell technology. In this paper, electron beam lithography was used to make sub-100-nm openings in polymethylmethacrylate layers used as the dielectric between the device electrodes. The solid electrolyte film was formed in these via-holes so that their small diameter defined the active switching area between the electrodes. The Ag-Ge-Se electrolyte was created by the photodiffusion, with or without thermal assistance, of an Ag layer into the Ge-Se base glass. Combined thermal and photodiffusion leads to a nanophase separated material with a dispersed Ag ion-rich material with an average crystallite size of 7.5 nm in a glassy insulating Ge-rich continuous phase. The nanoscale devices write at an applied bias as low as 0.2 V, erase by -0.5 V, and fall from over 10/sup 7/ /spl Omega/ to a low-resistance state (e.g., 10/sup 4/ /spl Omega/ for a 10-/spl mu/A programming current) in less than 100 ns. Cycling appears excellent with projected endurance well beyond 10/sup 11/ cycles.","1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2005.846936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1430669","Electrical switching;nanoscale devices;nanostructured materials;nonvolatile memory;solid-state electrolytes","Solid state circuits;Silver;Glass;Electrodes;Crystalline materials;Fabrication;Availability;Anodes;Cathodes;Contact resistance","","477","29","13","IEEE","16 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on key-points or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or mutual information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance.","2380-7504","0-7695-2334-X","10.1109/ICCV.2005.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541309","","Statistical analysis;Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Quantization;Robustness;Layout;Object recognition;Image sampling;Image classification;Support vector machines","","475","11","29","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To accomplish this, a negative binomial regression model has been developed and used to predict the expected number of faults in each file of the next release of a system. The predictions are based on the code of the file in the current release, and fault and modification history of the file from previous releases. The model has been applied to two large industrial systems, one with a history of 17 consecutive quarterly releases over 4 years, and the other with nine releases over 2 years. The predictions were quite accurate: for each release of the two systems, the 20 percent of the files with the highest predicted number of faults contained between 71 percent and 92 percent of the faults that were actually detected, with the overall average being 83 percent. The same model was also used to predict which files of the first system were likely to have the highest fault densities (faults per KLOC). In this case, the 20 percent of the files with the highest predicted fault densities contained an average of 62 percent of the system's detected faults. However, the identified files contained a much smaller percentage of the code mass than the files selected to maximize the numbers of faults. The model was also used to make predictions from a much smaller input set that only contained fault data from integration testing and later. The prediction was again very accurate, identifying files that contained from 71 percent to 93 percent of the faults, with the average being 84 percent. Finally, a highly simplified version of the predictor selected files containing, on average, 73 percent and 74 percent of the faults for the two systems.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2005.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435354","Index Terms- Software faults;fault-prone;prediction;regression model;empirical study;software testing.","Software systems;Predictive models;Fault diagnosis;System testing;History;Fault detection;Software testing;Personnel;Resource management;Sorting","","474","6","17","IEEE","31 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The tag generally reads its internal memory of stored data and changes the loading on the tag antenna in a coded manner corresponding to the stored data.

Then, an algorithm is presented, which inverts the image formation process for recovering good visibility in images of scenes. The algorithm is based on a couple of images taken through a polarizer at different orientations. As a by-product, a distance map of the scene is also derived.

A simple feasibility-based comparison mechanism is used to guide the process toward the feasible region of the search space. Also, the initial stepsize of the evolution strategy is reduced in order to perform a finer search and a combined (discrete/intermediate) panmictic recombination technique improves its exploitation capabilities. The approach was tested with a well-known benchmark. The results obtained are very competitive when comparing the proposed approach against other state-of-the art techniques and its computational cost (measured by the number of fitness function evaluations) is lower than the cost required by the other techniques compared.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.836819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1395847","Constrained optimization;multimembered evolution strategy;nonlinear optimization;panmictic recombination technique","Constraint optimization;Benchmark testing;Art;Computational efficiency;Cost function;Region 6;Scholarships;Evolutionary computation;Computer science;Cities and towns","","472","","32","IEEE","22 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The minimum energy analysis shows that the optimal power supply typically occurs in subthreshold (e.g., supply voltages that are below device thresholds). New subthreshold logic and memory design methodologies are developed and demonstrated on a fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor. The FFT processor uses an energy-aware architecture that allows for variable FFT length (128-1024 point), variable bit-precision (8 b and 16 b) and is designed to investigate the estimated minimum energy point.

We answer this question by presenting a distributed power control algorithm that couples with existing transmission control protocols (TCPs) to increase end-to-end throughput and energy efficiency of the network. Under the rigorous framework of nonlinearly constrained utility maximization, we prove the convergence of this coupled algorithm to the global optimum of joint power control and congestion control, for both synchronized and asynchronous implementations. The rate of convergence is geometric and a desirable modularity between the transport and physical layers is maintained. In particular, when congestion control uses TCP Vegas, a simple utilization in the physical layer of the queueing delay information suffices to achieve the joint optimum. Analytic results and simulations illustrate other desirable properties of the proposed algorithm, including robustness to channel outage and to path loss estimation errors, and flexibility in trading off performance optimality for implementation simplicity. This work presents a step toward a systematic understanding of ""layering"" as ""optimization decomposition,"" where the overall communication network is modeled by a generalized network utility maximization problem, each layer corresponds to a decomposed subproblem, and the interfaces among layers are quantified as the optimization variables coordinating the subproblems. In the case of the transport and physical layers, link congestion prices turn out to be the optimal ""layering prices."".","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.837347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374963","Congestion control;convex optimization;cross-layer design;energy-aware protocols;Lagrange duality;power control;transmission control protocol;utility maximization;wireless ad hoc networks","Physical layer;Spread spectrum communication;Optimal control;Power control;Couplings;Convergence;Wireless networks;Interference;Protocols;Throughput","","469","10","34","IEEE","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We exploit the spatial arrangement of data points, and recursively propagate an aggregated histogram by starting from the origin and traversing through the remaining points along either a scan-line or a wave-front.

Although good forgeries may leave no visual clues of having been tampered with, they may, nevertheless, alter the underlying statistics of an image. Most digital cameras, for example, employ a single sensor in conjunction with a color filter array (CFA), and then interpolate the missing color samples to obtain a three channel color image.

We quantify the specific correlations introduced by CFA interpolation, and describe how these correlations, or lack thereof, can be automatically detected in any portion of an image.

They are useful for augmented reality (AR), robot navigation, and general applications where the relative pose between a camera and object is required. Important parameters for such marker systems is their false detection rate (false positive rate), their inter-marker confusion rate, minimal detection size (in pixels) and immunity to lighting variation. ARTag is a marker system that uses digital coding theory to get a very low false positive and inter-marker confusion rate with a small required marker size, employing an edge linking method to give robust lighting variation immunity. ARTag markers are bi-tonal planar patterns containing a unique ID number encoded with robust digital techniques of checksums and forward error correction (FEC). This proposed new system, ARTag has very low and numerically quantifiable error rates, does not require a grey scale threshold as does other marker systems, and can encode up to 2002 different unique ID's with no need to store patterns. Experimental results are shown validating this system.","1063-6919","0-7695-2372-2","10.1109/CVPR.2005.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467495","","Robustness;Forward error correction;Digital cameras;Detection algorithms;Augmented reality;Robotics and automation;Navigation;Robot vision systems;Codes;Joining processes","","463","17","11","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting from the study of PDE-based formalisms previously proposed in the literature for the regularization of scalar and vector-valued data, we propose a unifying expression that gathers the majority of these previous frameworks into a single generic anisotropic diffusion equation. On one hand, the resulting expression provides a simple interpretation of the regularization process in terms of local filtering with spatially adaptive Gaussian kernels. On the other hand, it naturally disassembles any regularization scheme into the smoothing process itself and the underlying geometry that drives the smoothing. Thus, we can easily specialize our generic expression into different regularization PDE that fulfill desired smoothing behaviors, depending on the considered application: image restoration, inpainting, magnification, flow visualization, etc. Specific numerical schemes are also proposed, allowing us to implement our regularization framework with accuracy by taking the local filtering properties of the proposed equations into account.

In this paper, a solution to the reactive power dispatch problem with a novel particle swarm optimization approach based on multiagent systems (MAPSO) is presented. This method integrates the multiagent system (MAS) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. An agent in MAPSO represents a particle to PSO and a candidate solution to the optimization problem. All agents live in a lattice-like environment, with each agent fixed on a lattice point. In order to obtain optimal solution quickly, each agent competes and cooperates with its neighbors, and it can also learn by using its knowledge. Making use of these agent-agent interactions and evolution mechanism of PSO, MAPSO realizes the purpose of optimizing the value of objective function. MAPSO applied to optimal reactive power dispatch is evaluated on an IEEE 30-bus power system and a practical 118-bus power system. Simulation results show that the proposed approach converges to better solutions much faster than the earlier reported approaches. The optimization strategy is general and can be used to solve other power system optimization problems as well.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2005.846064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425605","Multiagent system;particle swarm optimization (PSO);power system;reactive power dispatch","Particle swarm optimization;Reactive power;Power system simulation;Power systems;Constraint optimization;Multiagent systems;Reactive power control;Power generation;Shunt (electrical);Capacitors","","457","","27","IEEE","2 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is able to replan faster than planning from scratch since it modifies its previous search results locally. Consequently, it has been extensively used in mobile robotics. In this article, we introduce an alternative to D/sup */ that determines the same paths and thus moves the robot in the same way but is algorithmically different. D/sup */ Lite is simple, can be rigorously analyzed, extendible in multiple ways, and is at least as efficient as D/sup */.

The Signal Space Separation method (SSS) idealizes magnetic multichannel signals by transforming them into device-independent idealized channels representing the measured data in uncorrelated form. The transformation has separate components for the biomagnetic and external interference signals, and thus, the biomagnetic signals can be reconstructed simply by leaving out the contribution of the external interference. The foundation of SSS is a basis spanning all multichannel signals of magnetic origin. It is based on Maxwell's equations and the geometry of the sensor array only, with the assumption that the sensors are located in a current free volume. SSS is demonstrated to provide suppression of external interference signals, standardization of different positions of the subject, standardization of different sensor configurations, compensation for distortions caused by movement of the subject (even a subject containing magnetic impurities), suppression of sporadic sensor artifacts, a tool for fine calibration of the device, extraction of biomagnetic DC fields, and an aid for realizing an active compensation system. Thus, SSS removes many limitations of traditional biomagnetic measurements.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.853302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495874","Biomagnetism;calibration;DC measurements;interference suppression;magnetoencephalography;movement compensation;source modeling;spherical harmonics;virtual signals","Biomagnetics;Biosensors;Magnetic sensors;Sensor arrays;Interference;Magnetic separation;Magnetic devices;Standardization;Sensor systems;Position measurement","","450","7","27","IEEE","15 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such architectures, however, also bring about their own security challenges that require due consideration. Unfortunately, the current information security mechanisms are insufficient to address these challenges. In particular, the access control models today are mostly static and coarsely grained; they are not well-suited for the service-oriented environments where information access is dynamic and ad-hoc in nature. This paper outlines the access control challenges for Web services and SOA, and proposes an attribute based access control (ABAC) model as a new approach, which is based on subject, object, and environment attributes and supports both mandatory and discretionary access control needs. The paper describes the ABAC model in terms of its authorization architecture and policy formulation, and makes a detailed comparison between ABAC and traditional role-based models, which clearly shows the advantages of ABAC. The paper then describes how this new model can be applied to securing Web service invocations, with an implementation based on standard protocols and open-source tools. The paper concludes with a summary of the ABAC model's benefits and some future directions.","","0-7695-2409-5","10.1109/ICWS.2005.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1530847","","Access control;Web services;Service oriented architecture;Information security;Government;Collaboration;Joining processes;Authorization;Protocols;Open source software","","447","16","17","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This model is compared with the previous models derived for similar systems. The strong accessibility condition is checked and the maximum relative degree of the system is found. Based on this result, a partial feedback linearization of the system is obtained and the internal dynamics equations are isolated. The resulting equations are then used to design two novel controllers. The first one is a two-level velocity controller for tracking vehicle orientation and heading speed set-points, while controlling the vehicle pitch (pendulum angle from the vertical) within a specified range. The second controller is also a two-level controller which stabilizes the vehicle's position to the desired point, while again keeping the pitch bounded between specified limits.

In the filter, the gyroscope bias error, orientation error, and magnetic disturbance error are estimated. The filter was tested under quasi-static and dynamic conditions with ferromagnetic materials close to the sensor module. The quasi-static experiments implied static positions and rotations around the three axes. In the dynamic experiments, three-dimensional rotations were performed near a metal tool case. The orientation estimated by the filter was compared with the orientation obtained with an optical reference system Vicon. Results show accurate and drift-free orientation estimates. The compensation results in a significant difference (p<0.01) between the orientation estimates with compensation of magnetic disturbances in comparison to no compensation or only gyroscopes.

Our variational formulation consists of an internal energy term that penalizes the deviation of the level set function from a signed distance function, and an external energy term that drives the motion of the zero level set toward the desired image features, such as object boundaries. The resulting evolution of the level set function is the gradient flow that minimizes the overall energy functional. The proposed variational level set formulation has three main advantages over the traditional level set formulations. First, a significantly larger time step can be used for numerically solving the evolution partial differential equation, and therefore speeds up the curve evolution. Second, the level set function can be initialized with general functions that are more efficient to construct and easier to use in practice than the widely used signed distance function. Third, the level set evolution in our formulation can be easily implemented by simple finite difference scheme and is computationally more efficient. The proposed algorithm has been applied to both simulated and real images with promising results.","1063-6919","0-7695-2372-2","10.1109/CVPR.2005.213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467299","","Level set;Active contours;Solid modeling;Computed tomography;Partial differential equations;Image segmentation;Computer vision;Lagrangian functions;Mathematics;Data visualization","","443","7","19","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis framework can also provide a useful guide for the design and analysis of more general spherical microphone arrays which do not use spherical harmonics explicitly.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2004.839244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369318","Plane-wave decomposition;sound-field analysis;spatial aliasing;spatial sampling;spherical Fourier transform;spherical microphone arrays","Microphone arrays;Harmonic analysis;Array signal processing;Performance analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Sampling methods;Position measurement;Noise measurement;Particle measurements;Acoustic noise","","443","13","21","IEEE","20 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

High-k materials show novel reliability phenomena related to the asymmetric gate band structure and the presence of fast and reversible charge. Reliability of high-k structures is influenced both by the interfacial layer as well as the high-k layer.

However, there are no reliable methods for measuring blood flow patterns in vivo. In this paper, an efficient methodology for patient-specific modeling and characterization of the hemodynamics in cerebral aneurysms from medical images is described. A sensitivity analysis of the hemodynamic characteristics with respect to variations of several variables over the expected physiologic range of conditions is also presented. This sensitivity analysis shows that although changes in the velocity fields can be observed, the characterization of the intra-aneurysmal flow patterns is not altered when the mean input flow, the flow division, the viscosity model, or mesh resolution are changed. It was also found that the variable that has the greater impact on the computed flow fields is the geometry of the vascular structures.

Assuming that the nodes are randomly distributed in space according to a Poisson point process, we derive upper and lower bounds for frequency hopping (FH-CDMA) and direct sequence (DS-CDMA) SS networks, which incorporate traditional modulation types (no spreading) as a special case. These bounds cleanly summarize how ad hoc network capacity is affected by the outage probability, spreading factor, transmission power, target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and other system parameters. Using these bounds, it can be shown that FH-CDMA obtains a higher transmission capacity than DS-CDMA on the order of M/sup 1-2//spl alpha//, where M is the spreading factor and /spl alpha/>2 is the path loss exponent. A tangential contribution is an (apparently) novel technique for obtaining tight bounds on tail probabilities of additive functionals of homogeneous Poisson point processes.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.858939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542405","Ad hoc networks;capacity;stochastic geometry","Ad hoc networks;Capacity planning;Mobile ad hoc networks;Multiaccess communication;Spread spectrum communication;Frequency;Signal to noise ratio;Propagation losses;Tail;Additives","","435","","12","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work we present a semi-supervised approach to training object detection systems based on self-training. We implement our approach as a wrapper around the training process of an existing object detector and present empirical results. The key contributions of this empirical study is to demonstrate that a model trained in this manner can achieve results comparable to a model trained in the traditional manner using a much larger set of fully labeled data, and that a training data selection metric that is defined independently of the detector greatly outperforms a selection metric based on the detection confidence generated by the detector.","","0-7695-2271-8","10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4129456","","Object detection;Conferences;Application software;Computer vision","","432","11","25","IEEE","19 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach considers a new fairness criterion, which is a generalized proportional fairness based on Nash bargaining solutions and coalitions. First, a two-user algorithm is developed to bargain subcarrier usage between two users. Then a multiuser bargaining algorithm is developed based on optimal coalition pairs among users. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms not only provide fair resource allocation among users, but also have a comparable overall system rate with the scheme maximizing the total rate without considering fairness. They also have much higher rates than that of the scheme with max-min fairness.

The focus of this paper is on slow-light delay lines in which the group velocity is reduced using linear processes, including electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), population oscillations (POs), and microresonator-based photonic-crystal (PC) filters. We also consider slow-light delay lines in which the group velocity is reduced by an adiabatic process of bandwidth compression. A framework is developed for comparing these techniques and identifying fundamental physical limitations of linear slow-light technologies. It is shown that slow-light delay lines have limited capacity and delay-bandwidth product. In principle, the group velocity in slow-light delay lines can be made to approach zero. But very slow group velocity always comes at the cost of very low bandwidth or throughput. In many applications, miniaturization of the delay line is an important consideration. For all delay-line buffers, the minimum physical size of the buffer for a given number of buffered data bits is ultimately limited by the physical size of each stored bit. We show that in slow-light optical buffers, the minimum achievable size of 1 b is approximately equal to the wavelength of light in the buffer. We also compare the capabilities and limitations of a range of delay-line buffers, investigate the impact of waveguide losses on the buffer capacity, and look at the applicability of slow-light delay lines in a number of applications.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2005.853125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1566732","Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT);optical delay lines;optical memories;optical propagation in dispersive media;photonic crystals (PCs);slow light","Optical buffering;Delay lines;Buffer storage;Optical filters;Bandwidth;Optical waveguides;Nonlinear filters;Costs;Throughput;Propagation delay","","429","1","31","IEEE","3 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such cross-layer design can run at cross purposes with sound and longer-term architectural principles, and lead to various negative consequences. This motivates us to step back and reexamine holistically the issue of cross-layer design and its architectural ramifications. We contend that a good architectural design leads to proliferation and longevity, and illustrate this with some historical examples. Even though the wireless medium is fundamentally different from the wired one, and can offer undreamt of modalities of cooperation, we show that the conventional layered architecture is a reasonable way to operate wireless networks, and is in fact optimal up to an order. However the temptation and perhaps even the need to optimize by incorporating cross-layer adaptation cannot be ignored, so we examine the issues involved. We show that unintended cross-layer interactions can have undesirable consequences on overall system performance. We illustrate them by certain cross-layer schemes loosely based on recent proposals. We attempt to distill a few general principles for cross-layer design. Moreover, unbridled cross-layer design can lead to spaghetti design, which can stifle further innovation and be difficult to upkeep. At a critical time when wireless networks may be on the cusp of massive proliferation, the architectural considerations may be paramount. We argue that it behooves us to exercise caution while engaging in cross-layer design.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2005.1404568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1404568","","Cross layer design;Contracts;Wireless networks;Wireless application protocol;Robust stability;Optimization;Performance gain;Costs;Control theory;System performance","","426","","15","IEEE","14 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In the designs and applications of neural networks, it is necessary to consider the deviation effects of bounded perturbations of network parameters. In this case, a delayed neural network must be formulated as a interval neural network model.

One important aspect of the proposed system is that the depth maps are pre-processed using an asymmetric filter to smoothen the sharp changes in depth at object boundaries. In addition to ameliorating the effects of blocky artifacts and other distortions contained in the depth maps, the smoothing reduces or completely removes newly exposed (disocclusion) areas where potential artifacts can arise from image warping which is needed to generate images from new viewpoints. The asymmetric nature of the filter reduces the amount of geometric distortion that might be perceived otherwise.

A scale multiplication function is defined as the product of the responses of the detection filter at two scales. Edge maps are constructed as the local maxima by thresholding the scale multiplication results. The detection and localization criteria of the scale multiplication are derived. At a small loss in the detection criterion, the localization criterion can be much improved by scale multiplication. The product of the two criteria for scale multiplication is greater than that for a single scale, which leads to better edge detection performance.

The affective content of a given video clip can be defined as the intensity and type of feeling or emotion (both are referred to as affect) that are expected to arise in the user while watching that clip. The availability of methodologies for automatically extracting this type of video content will extend the current scope of possibilities for video indexing and retrieval. For instance, we will be able to search for the funniest or the most thrilling parts of a movie, or the most exciting events of a sport program. Furthermore, as the user may want to select a movie not only based on its genre, cast, director and story content, but also on its prevailing mood, the affective content analysis is also likely to contribute to enhancing the quality of personalizing the video delivery to the user. We propose in this paper a computational framework for affective video content representation and modeling. This framework is based on the dimensional approach to affect that is known from the field of psychophysiology. According to this approach, the affective video content can be represented as a set of points in the two-dimensional (2-D) emotion space that is characterized by the dimensions of arousal (intensity of affect) and valence (type of affect). We map the affective video content onto the 2-D emotion space by using the models that link the arousal and valence dimensions to low-level features extracted from video data. This results in the arousal and valence time curves that, either considered separately or combined into the so-called affect curve, are introduced as reliable representations of expected transitions from one feeling to another along a video, as perceived by a viewer.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2004.840618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386249","Affective video content analysis;video abstraction;video content modeling;video content representation;video highlights extraction","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Motion pictures;Algorithm design and analysis;Streaming media;Information filtering;Information filters;Layout;Indexing;Mood","","424","38","29","IEEE","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a consequence, the within-class scatter matrix is singular and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method cannot be applied directly. This problem is known as the ""small sample size"" problem. In this paper, we propose a new face recognition method called the discriminative common vector method based on a variation of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis for the small sample size case. Two different algorithms are given to extract the discriminative common vectors representing each person in the training set of the face database. One algorithm uses the within-class scatter matrix of the samples in the training set while the other uses the subspace methods and the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to obtain the discriminative common vectors. Then, the discriminative common vectors are used for classification of new faces. The proposed method yields an optimal solution for maximizing the modified Fisher's linear discriminant criterion given in the paper. Our test results show that the discriminative common vector method is superior to other methods in terms of recognition accuracy, efficiency, and numerical stability.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359747","Index Terms- Common vectors;discriminative common vectors;face recognition;Fisher's linear discriminant analysis;principal component analysis;small sample size;subspace methods.","Face recognition;Face detection;Vectors;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis;Application software;Image recognition;Light scattering;Databases;Testing","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Discriminant Analysis;Face;History, Ancient;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Principal Component Analysis;Sample Size;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","424","","26","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior to the optimization of the microgrid itself, several schemes for sharing power between two generators are compared. The minimization of fuel use in a microgrid with a variety of power sources is then discussed. The optimization of a small power system has important differences from the case of a large system and its traditional economic dispatch problem. Among the most important differences is the presence of a local heat demand which adds another dimension to the optimization problem. The microgrid considered in this paper consists of two reciprocating gas engines, a combined heat and power plant, a photovoltaic array and a wind generator. The optimization is aimed at reducing the fuel consumption rate of the system while constraining it to fulfil the local energy demand (both electrical and thermal) and provide a certain minimum reserve power. A penalty is applied for any heat produced in excess of demand. The solution of the optimization problem strongly supports the idea of having a communication infrastructure operating between the power sources.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2005.847277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432989","Distributed generation;microgrids;power sharing;small power systems;unit commitment","Power generation;Cogeneration;Heat engines;Cost function;Power systems;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Fuel economy;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation","","423","2","14","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, image quality assessment (QA) algorithms interpret image quality as similarity with a ""reference"" or ""perfect"" image. The obvious limitation of this approach is that the reference image or video may not be available to the QA algorithm. The field of blind, or no-reference, QA, in which image quality is predicted without the reference image or video, has been largely unexplored, with algorithms focussing mostly on measuring the blocking artifacts. Emerging image and video compression technologies can avoid the dreaded blocking artifact by using various mechanisms, but they introduce other types of distortions, specifically blurring and ringing. In this paper, we propose to use natural scene statistics (NSS) to blindly measure the quality of images compressed by JPEG2000 (or any other wavelet based) image coder. We claim that natural scenes contain nonlinear dependencies that are disturbed by the compression process, and that this disturbance can be quantified and related to human perceptions of quality. We train and test our algorithm with data from human subjects, and show that reasonably comprehensive NSS models can help us in making blind, but accurate, predictions of quality. Our algorithm performs close to the limit imposed on useful prediction by the variability between human subjects.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.854492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1518954","Blind quality assessment (QA);image QA;JPEG2000;natural scene statistics (NSS);no reference (NR) image QA","Quality assessment;Layout;Statistics;Video compression;Image coding;Image quality;Humans;Transform coding;Distortion measurement;Image restoration","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Quality Control;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;Video Recording","417","8","41","IEEE","17 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, self-localization involves the combination of absolute location information (e.g., from a global positioning system) with relative calibration information (e.g., distance measurements between sensors) over regions of the network. Furthermore, it is generally desirable to distribute the computational burden across the network and minimize the amount of intersensor communication. We demonstrate that the information used for sensor localization is fundamentally local with regard to the network topology and use this observation to reformulate the problem within a graphical model framework. We then present and demonstrate the utility of nonparametric belief propagation (NBP), a recent generalization of particle filtering, for both estimating sensor locations and representing location uncertainties. NBP has the advantage that it is easily implemented in a distributed fashion, admits a wide variety of statistical models, and can represent multimodal uncertainty. Using simulations of small to moderately sized sensor networks, we show that NBP may be made robust to outlier measurement errors by a simple model augmentation, and that judicious message construction can result in better estimates. Furthermore, we provide an analysis of NBP's communications requirements, showing that typically only a few messages per sensor are required, and that even low bit-rate approximations of these messages can be used with little or no performance impact.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.843548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413473","Algorithms;calibration;distributed estimation;localization;message passing;sensor network","Belief propagation;Military computing;Calibration;Distance measurement;Sensor systems;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Network topology;Graphical models;Filtering","","416","4","32","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key advantage of this distance measure is that it can be embedded in most image classification techniques such as SVM, LDA, and PCA. The embedding is rather efficient by involving a transformation referred to as standardizing transform (ST). We show that ST is a transform domain smoothing.

To reduce delays in the network, each user sends redundant packets along multiple paths to the destination. Assuming the network has a cell partitioned structure and users move according to a simplified independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) mobility model, we compute the exact network capacity and the exact end-to-end queueing delay when no redundancy is used. The capacity-achieving algorithm is a modified version of the Grossglauser-Tse two-hop relay algorithm and provides O(N) delay (where N is the number of users). We then show that redundancy cannot increase capacity, but can significantly improve delay. The following necessary tradeoff is established: delay/rate/spl ges/O(N). Two protocols that use redundancy and operate near the boundary of this curve are developed, with delays of O(/spl radic/N) and O(log(N)), respectively.

This trend is exemplified by the growing number of network-on-chip (NoC) architectures that have been proposed recently for system-on-chip (SoC) integration. Developing NoC-based systems tailored to a particular application domain is crucial for achieving high-performance, energy-efficient customized solutions. The effectiveness of this approach largely depends on the availability of an ad hoc design methodology that, starting from a high-level application specification, derives an optimized NoC configuration with respect to different design objectives and instantiates the selected application specific on-chip micronetwork. Automatic execution of these design steps is highly desirable to increase SoC design productivity. This work illustrates a complete synthesis flow, called Netchip, for customized NoC architectures, that partitions the development work into major steps (topology mapping, selection, and generation) and provides proper tools for their automatic execution (SUNMAP, xpipescompiler). The entire flow leverages the flexibility of a fully reusable and scalable network components library called xpipes, consisting of highly-parameterizable network building blocks (network interface, switches, switch-to-switch links) that are design-time tunable and composable to achieve arbitrary topologies and customized domain-specific NoC architectures.

The actuator is also flexible with very small inherent damping. It has potential applications in active antennas. A series of tests are conducted to study the hysteresis properties of the piezoceramic actuator system. The numerical expressions of the classical Preisach model for different input variations are presented. The classical Preisach model is applied to simulate the static hysteresis behavior of the system. Higher order hysteresis reversal curves predicted by the classical Preisach model are verified experimentally. The good agreement found between the measured and predicted curves showed that the classical Preisach model is an effective mean for modeling the hysteresis of the piezoceramic actuator system. Subsequently, the inverse classical Preisach model is established and applied to cancel the hysteresis the piezoceramic actuator system for the real-time microposition tracking control. In order to improve the control accuracy and to increase damping of the actuator system, a cascaded PD/lead-lag feedback controller is designed with consideration of the dynamics of the actuator. In the experiments, two cases are considered, control with major loop hysteresis compensation, and control with minor loop hysteresis compensation. Experimental results show that RMS tracking errors are reduced by 50% to 70% if the hysteresis compensation is added in the feedforward path in both cases. Therefore, hysteresis compensation with the feedback controller greatly improves the tracking control accuracy of the piezoceramic actuator.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2005.844708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420328","Hysteresis nonlinearity;piezoceramic;Preisach model;tracking control","Piezoelectric materials;Actuators;Hysteresis;Inverse problems;Predictive models;Damping;Adaptive control;System testing;Real time systems;Control systems","","413","1","31","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, approaches based on the well-known Kalman Filter (KF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), are presented, using a generic cell model, to provide correction for offset, drift, and long-term state divergence-an unfortunate feature of more traditional coulomb-counting techniques. The underlying dynamic behavior of each cell is modeled using two capacitors (bulk and surface) and three resistors (terminal, surface, and end), from which the SoC is determined from the voltage present on the bulk capacitor. Although the structure of the model has been previously reported for describing the characteristics of lithium-ion cells, here it is shown to also provide an alternative to commonly employed models of lead-acid cells when used in conjunction with a KF to estimate SoC and an EKF to predict state-of-health (SoH). Measurements using real-time road data are used to compare the performance of conventional integration-based methods for estimating SoC with those predicted from the presented state estimation schemes. Results show that the proposed methodologies are superior to more traditional techniques, with accuracy in determining the SoC within 2% being demonstrated. Moreover, by accounting for the nonlinearities present within the dynamic cell model, the application of an EKF is shown to provide verifiable indications of SoH of the cell pack.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2004.842461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1433224","Batteries, Kalman Filter, observers, state-of-charge, state-of-health","Battery powered vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;State estimation;Battery charge measurement;Capacitors;Predictive models;Hybrid electric vehicles;Resistors;Voltage;Roads","","412","9","15","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Alternative descriptions have been proposed as well. In spite of this, there is still no agreement on how to describe charge transport and there is still some controversy as regards the applicability of semiconductors physics to the case of disordered insulating materials and in particular to polymers used in electrical engineering applications. The last twenty years have been marked by the publication of excellent review papers summarizing the physical concepts available to describe charge transport. Enormous steps forward have been achieved as regards computing facilities and our ability to spatially map the space charge, quantitatively, inside dielectric materials. We consider these two factors as fundamental in providing possibilities for developing sound models of charge transport, by using the basis of fundamental knowledge that has been accumulated in the previous years, and by coupling up-to-date techniques in experiments and in simulation.

To facilitate understanding of Z-source inverter modulation, this paper presents a detailed analysis, showing how various conventional pulse-width modulation strategies can be modified to switch a voltage-type Z-source inverter either continuously or discontinuously, while retaining all the unique harmonic performance features of these conventional modulation strategies. This paper starts by analyzing the modulation requirements of a single-phase H-bridge Z-source inverter, and subsequently extends the analysis to cover the more complex three-phase-leg and four-phase-leg Z-source inverters, with carrier-based implementation reference equations derived for all the inverters.

Since 802.22 is required to reuse the fallow TV spectrum without causing any harmful interference to incumbents (i.e., the TV receivers), cognitive radio techniques are of primary importance in order to sense and measure the spectrum and detect the presence/absence of incumbent signals. On top of that, other advanced techniques that facilitate coexistence such as dynamic spectrum management and radio environment characterization could be designed.

Experimental tests using a 10-kVA DVR show that the no-energy storage concept is feasible, but an improved performance can be achieved for certain voltage sags using stored energy topologies.

Relay networks take advantage of the broadcast-oriented nature of radio and require node-based, rather than link-based protocols. Prior work on relay networks has studied performance limits either with unrealistic assumptions, complicated protocols, or only a single relay. In this paper, a practical approach to networks comprising multiple relays operating over orthogonal time slots is proposed based on a generalization of hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ). In contrast with conventional hybrid-ARQ, retransmitted packets do not need to come from the original source radio but could instead be sent by relays that overhear the transmission. An information theoretic framework is exposed that establishes the performance limits of such systems in a block fading environment, and numerical results are presented for some representative topologies and protocols. The results indicate a significant improvement in the energy-latency tradeoff when compared with conventional multihop protocols implemented as a cascade of point-to-point links.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.837352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374955","Block fading;cooperative diversity;hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ);relay channel","Relays;Diversity reception;Radio broadcasting;Automatic repeat request;Fading;Topology;Wireless application protocol;Receivers;Broadcast technology;Throughput","","399","17","35","IEEE","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fundamental deficiency in the pattern-matching approach to malware detection is that it is purely syntactic and ignores the semantics of instructions. In this paper, we present a malware-detection algorithm that addresses this deficiency by incorporating instruction semantics to detect malicious program traits. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our malware-detection algorithm can detect variants of malware with a relatively low run-time overhead.

As the main theoretical contribution, we first formulate the problem of energy- and performance-aware mapping in a topological sense, and show how the routing flexibility can be exploited to expand the solution space and improve the solution quality.

In our proposed technique, such users generate several false position data (dummies) to send to service providers with the true position data of users. Because service providers cannot distinguish the true position data, user location privacy is protected. We also describe a cost reduction technique for communication between a client and a server. Moreover, we conducted performance study experiments on our proposed technique using practical position data.

We present a general analytical procedure, and derive the packet loss rate, the average throughput, and the average spectral efficiency (ASE) of AMC. Guided by our performance analysis, we introduce a cross-layer design, which optimizes the target packet error rate of AMC at the physical layer, to minimize thpacket loss rate and maximize the average throughput, when combined with a finite-length queue at the data link layer. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of system performance on various parameters, and quantify the performance gain due to cross-layer optimization.

This paper introduces an algorithm to protect the privacy of individuals in video surveillance data by deidentifying faces such that many facial characteristics remain but the face cannot be reliably recognized. A trivial solution to deidentifying faces involves blacking out each face. This thwarts any possible face recognition, but because all facial details are obscured, the result is of limited use. Many ad hoc attempts, such as covering eyes, fail to thwart face recognition because of the robustness of face recognition methods. This work presents a new privacy-enabling algorithm, named k-Same, that guarantees face recognition software cannot reliably recognize deidentified faces, even though many facial details are preserved. The algorithm determines similarity between faces based on a distance metric and creates new faces by averaging image components, which may be the original image pixels (k-Same-Pixel) or eigenvectors (k-Same-Eigen). Results are presented on a standard collection of real face images with varying k.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377174","Index Terms- Video surveillance;privacy;privacy-preserving data mining;k-anonymity.","Face recognition;Video surveillance;Data privacy;Image databases;Licenses;Protection;Character recognition;Eyes;Robustness;Software algorithms","","393","18","25","IEEE","10 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Once confined to specialized, proprietary, high-end server and mainframe systems, virtualization is now becoming more broadly available and is supported in off-the-shelf systems based on Intel architecture (IA) hardware.

In this paper, from the viewpoint of constructive approach, we first propose some definitions of upper and lower approximation operators of fuzzy sets by means of arbitrary fuzzy relations and study the relations among them, the connections between special fuzzy relations and upper and lower approximation operators of fuzzy sets are also examined.

We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to fit the input face image as a linear combination of the low-resolution face images in the training set. The high-resolution image is rendered by replacing the low-resolution training images with high-resolution ones, while retaining the same combination coefficients.

MC-CDMA is based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The time-variant channel is estimated individually for every flat-fading subcarrier, assuming small intercarrier interference. The temporal variation of every subcarrier over the duration of a data block is upper bounded by the Doppler bandwidth determined by the maximum velocity of the users. Slepian showed that time-limited snapshots of bandlimited sequences span a low-dimensional subspace. This subspace is also spanned by discrete prolate spheroidal (DPS) sequences. We expand the time-variant subcarrier coefficients in terms of orthogonal DPS sequences we call Slepian basis expansion. This enables a time-variant channel description that avoids the frequency leakage effect of the Fourier basis expansion. The square bias of the Slepian basis expansion per subcarrier is three magnitudes smaller than the square bias of the Fourier basis expansion. We show simulation results for a fully loaded MC-CDMA downlink with classic linear minimum mean square error multiuser detection. The users are moving with 19.4 m/s.

In many practical scenarios, users may be restricted to assume roles only at predefined time periods. Furthermore, roles may only be invoked on prespecified intervals of time depending upon when certain actions are permitted. To capture such dynamic aspects of a role, a temporal RBAC (TRBAC) model has been recently proposed. However, the TRBAC model addresses the role enabling constraints only. In This work, we propose a generalized temporal role-based access control (GTRBAC) model capable of expressing a wider range of temporal constraints. In particular, the model allows expressing periodic as well as duration constraints on roles, user-role assignments, and role-permission assignments. In an interval, activation of a role can further be restricted as a result of numerous activation constraints including cardinality constraints and maximum active duration constraints. The GTRBAC model extends the syntactic structure of the TRBAC model and its event and trigger expressions subsume those of TRBAC. Furthermore, GTRBAC allows expressing role hierarchies and separation of duty (SoD) constraints for specifying fine-grained temporal semantics.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1363762","Index Terms- Access control;role-based;temporal constraints;role hierarchy;separation of duty.","Access control;Security;Permission;Power generation;Energy management;Runtime","","388","1","18","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we describe the results of an electrochemical study of the interaction of the organic additives used with copper and copper ions in solution. It is shown that cuprous intermediates near the copper surface affect the overpotential and the kinetics of plating. The additives regulate the presence of cuprous species on the surface; levelers and suppressors inhibit Cu+ formation, whereas accelerating additives enhance Cu+ formation. Acceleration by the bis(sodiumsulfopropyl) disulfide (SPS) additive results from accumulation of cuprous complexes near the surface.

Prominent examples include the spread of worms and email viruses, and, more generally, faults. Many types of information dissemination can also be modeled as spreads of epidemics. In this paper we address the question of what makes an epidemic either weak or potent. More precisely, we identify topological properties of the graph that determine the persistence of epidemics. In particular, we show that if the ratio of cure to infection rates is larger than the spectral radius of the graph, then the mean epidemic lifetime is of order log n, where n is the number of nodes. Conversely, if this ratio is smaller than a generalization of the isoperimetric constant of the graph, then the mean epidemic lifetime is of order e/sup na/, for a positive constant a. We apply these results to several network topologies including the hypercube, which is a representative connectivity graph for a distributed hash table, the complete graph, which is an important connectivity graph for BGP, and the power law graph, of which the AS-level Internet graph is a prime example. We also study the star topology and the Erdos-Renyi graph as their epidemic spreading behaviors determine the spreading behavior of power law graphs.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498374","","Network topology;Hypercubes;Computer worms;Sufficient conditions;Computer science;Graph theory;Stochastic processes;Impedance;Power system faults","","384","1","18","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm is optimized for finding the time-trajectory of single particles in very noisy dynamic (two- or three-dimensional) image sequences. It proceeds in three steps. First, the images are aligned to compensate for the movement of the biological structure under investigation. Second, the particle's signature is enhanced by applying a Mexican hat filter, which we show to be the optimal detector of a Gaussian-like spot in 1//spl omega//sup 2/ noise. Finally, the optimal trajectory of the particle is extracted by applying a dynamic programming optimization procedure. We have used this software, which is implemented as a Java plug-in for the public-domain ImageJ software, to track the movement of chromosomal loci within nuclei of budding yeast cells. Besides reducing trajectory analysis time by several 100-fold, we achieve high reproducibility and accuracy of tracking. The application of the method to yeast chromatin dynamics reveals different classes of constraints on mobility of telomeres, reflecting differences in nuclear envelope association. The generic nature of the software allows application to a variety of similar biological imaging tasks that require the extraction and quantitation of a moving particle's trajectory.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.852787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495509","Dynamic programming (DP);fluorescence microscopy;image sequence analysis;living cell;particle tracking","Particle tracking;Fluorescence;Biological cells;Fungi;Application software;Robustness;Biology computing;Microscopy;Image sequences;Filters","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Chromosomes;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Microscopy, Fluorescence;Microscopy, Video;Motion;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","383","2","29","IEEE","15 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analyzed permanent-magnetic gear has a gear ratio of 5.5 and is able to deliver 27 N/spl middot/m. The analysis has shown that special attention needs to be paid to the system where the gear is to be installed because of a low natural torsion spring constant. The analyzed gear was also constructed in practice in order to validate the analysis and predict the efficiency. The measured torque from the magnetic gear was only 16 N/spl middot/m reduced by the large end-effects. A systematic analysis of the loss components in the magnetic gear is also performed in order to figure out why the efficiency for the actual construction was only 81%. A large magnetic loss component originated in the bearings, where an unplanned extra bearing was necessary due to mechanical problems. Without the losses of magnetic origin in the bearings and less end-effects caused by relatively short stack, an impressive efficiency estimated at 96% can be obtained. Comparison with classical mechanical gears has shown that the magnetic gear has a better efficiency and a comparable torque per volume density. Finally, it is concluded that the results in this paper may help to initiate a shift from mechanical gears to magnetic gears.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2005.847319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1433001","End-effects;finite-element analysis (FEA);gearbox;high torque density;magnetic gear","Gears;Magnetic flux;Permanent magnets;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic levitation;Torque;Couplings;Topology;Magnetic losses;Industry Applications Society","","372","8","14","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerous applications - including communications, coding, and sparse approximation- require finite-dimensional tight frames that possess additional structural properties. This paper proposes an alternating projection method that is versatile enough to solve a huge class of inverse eigenvalue problems (IEPs), which includes the frame design problem. To apply this method, one needs only to solve a matrix nearness problem that arises naturally from the design specifications. Therefore, it is the fast and easy to develop versions of the algorithm that target new design problems. Alternating projection will often succeed even if algebraic constructions are unavailable. To demonstrate that alternating projection is an effective tool for frame design, the paper studies some important structural properties in detail. First, it addresses the most basic design problem: constructing tight frames with prescribed vector norms. Then, it discusses equiangular tight frames, which are natural dictionaries for sparse approximation. Finally, it examines tight frames whose individual vectors have low peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR), which is a valuable property for code-division multiple-access (CDMA) applications. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm succeeds in each of these three cases.

For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite. In experiments on classification of graph models of proteins, our shortest-path kernels show significantly higher classification accuracy than walk-based kernels.","2374-8486","0-7695-2278-5","10.1109/ICDM.2005.132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565664","","Kernel;Data mining;Polynomials;Proteins;Time measurement;Graph theory;Computer science;Statistical learning;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification","","372","2","23","IEEE","3 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods for mining frequent itemsets have been implemented using a prefix-tree structure, known as an FP-tree, for storing compressed information about frequent itemsets. Numerous experimental results have demonstrated that these algorithms perform extremely well. In this paper, we present a novel FP-array technique that greatly reduces the need to traverse FP-trees, thus obtaining significantly improved performance for FP-tree-based algorithms. Our technique works especially well for sparse data sets. Furthermore, we present new algorithms for mining all, maximal, and closed frequent itemsets. Our algorithms use the FP-tree data structure in combination with the FP-array technique efficiently and incorporate various optimization techniques. We also present experimental results comparing our methods with existing algorithms. The results show that our methods are the fastest for many cases. Even though the algorithms consume much memory when the data sets are sparse, they are still the fastest ones when the minimum support is low. Moreover, they are always among the fastest algorithms and consume less memory than other methods when the data sets are dense.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1501819","Index Terms- Data mining;association rules.","Itemsets;Data mining;Association rules;Lattices;Transaction databases;Data structures;Multidimensional systems","","370","2","36","IEEE","29 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time series discords have many uses for data mining, including improving the quality of clustering, data cleaning, summarization, and anomaly detection. Discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of discords with objective experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, medicine, surveillance, and industry, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our discord discovery algorithm with more than one million experiments, on 82 different datasets from diverse domains.","2374-8486","0-7695-2278-5","10.1109/ICDM.2005.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565683","Time Series Data Mining;Anomaly Detection;Clustering","Telemetry;Computer science;Data mining;Detectors;Detection algorithms;Space shuttles;Surveillance;Aerospace industry;Cleaning;Monitoring","","369","5","13","IEEE","3 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For simple waterfilling solutions with a single waterlevel and a single constraint (typically, a power constraint), some algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute the solutions numerically. However, some other optimization problems result in significantly more complicated waterfilling solutions that include multiple waterlevels and multiple constraints. For such cases, it may still be possible to obtain practical algorithms to evaluate the solutions numerically but only after a painstaking inspection of the specific waterfilling structure. In addition, a unified view of the different types of waterfilling solutions and the corresponding practical algorithms is missing. The purpose of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it overviews the waterfilling results existing in the literature from a unified viewpoint. On the other hand, it bridges the gap between a wide family of waterfilling solutions and their efficient implementation in practice; to be more precise, it provides a practical algorithm to evaluate numerically a general waterfilling solution, which includes the currently existing waterfilling solutions and others that may possibly appear in future problems.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.840816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381759","Constrained optimization problems;MIMO transceiver;parallel channels;practical algorithms;waterfilling;waterpouring","MIMO;Bit error rate;Frequency;Transmitters;Constraint optimization;Mutual information;Government;Power engineering and energy;Inspection;Bridges","","368","12","27","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a novel non-statistics based face representation approach, local Gabor binary pattern histogram sequence (LGBPHS), in which training procedure is unnecessary to construct the face model, so that the generalizability problem is naturally avoided. In this approach, a face image is modeled as a ""histogram sequence"" by concatenating the histograms of all the local regions of all the local Gabor magnitude binary pattern maps. For recognition, histogram intersection is used to measure the similarity of different LGBPHSs and the nearest neighborhood is exploited for final classification. Additionally, we have further proposed to assign different weights for each histogram piece when measuring two LGBPHSes.

(1998) with two important new contributions. The first contribution is a new red lesion candidate detection system based on pixel classification. Using this technique, vasculature and red lesions are separated from the background of the image. After removal of the connected vasculature the remaining objects are considered possible red lesions. Second, an extensive number of new features are added to those proposed by Spencer-Frame. The detected candidate objects are classified using all features and a k-nearest neighbor classifier. An extensive evaluation was performed on a test set composed of images representative of those normally found in a screening set. When determining whether an image contains red lesions the system achieves a sensitivity of 100% at a specificity of 87%. The method is compared with several different automatic systems and is shown to outperform them all.

For clarity of analysis, we focus on primary transmissions that are BPSK-modulated random data without any pilot tones or training sequences. The results should all generalize to more general primary transmissions as long as no deterministic component is present. Specifically, we show that for every 'moment detector' there exists an SNR below which detection becomes impossible in the presence of noise uncertainty. In the neighborhood of that SNR wall, we show how the sample complexity of detection approaches infinity. We also show that if our radio has a finite dynamic range (upper and lower limits to the voltages we can quantize), then at low enough SNR, any detector can be rendered useless even under moderate noise uncertainty.","","0-7803-9305-8","10.1109/WIRLES.2005.1549453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1549453","","Signal to noise ratio;Uncertainty;Detectors;Cognitive radio;Signal processing;Computer science;Dynamic range;Radiometry;Gaussian noise;Additive white noise","","363","3","16","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the use of wireless local area networks spreads beyond simple data transfer to bandwidth-intense, delay-sensitive, and loss-tolerant multimedia applications, addressing quality of service issues become extremely important. Currently, a multitude of protection and adaptation strategies exists in the different layers of the open systems interconnection (OSI) stack. Hence, an in-depth understanding and comparative evaluation of these strategies are necessary to effectively assess and enable the possible trade-offs in multimedia quality, power consumption, implementation complexity, and spectrum utilization that are provided by the various OSI layers. This further opens the question of cross-layer optimization and its effectiveness in providing an improved solution with respect to the above trade-offs. In this article we formalize the cross-layer problem, discuss its challenges, and present several possible solutions. Moreover, we also discuss the impact the cross-layer optimization strategy deployed at one station has on the multimedia performance of other stations. We introduce a new fairness concept for wireless multimedia systems that employs different cross-layer strategies, and show its advantages when compared to existing resource allocation mechanisms used in wireline communications. Finally, we propose a new paradigm for wireless communications based on competition, which allows wireless stations to harvest additional resources or free up resources as well as optimally and dynamically adapt their cross-layer transmission strategies to improve multimedia quality and/or power consumption.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2005.1497858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1497858","","Streaming media;Open systems;Energy consumption;Wireless networks;Wireless LAN;Quality of service;Power system protection;LAN interconnection;Power system interconnection;Multimedia systems","","363","9","24","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is shown that the closed-loop system obtained from the controller plus the antiwindup gain can be modeled by a linear system with a deadzone nonlinearity. A modified sector condition is then used to obtain stability conditions based on quadratic Lyapunov functions. Differently from previous works these conditions are directly in linear matrix inequality form. Some numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design technique when compared with the previous ones.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2004.841128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381655","Actuator saturation;antiwindup;linear matrix inequality (LMI);stability","Stability;Linear systems;Linear matrix inequalities;Lyapunov method;Hydraulic actuators;Open loop systems;Proportional control;Output feedback;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems","","360","","17","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Models for the matching of MOS and bipolar devices from open literature show that matching improves with increasing device area. As a result, accuracy requirements impose a minimal device area and this paper explores the impact of this constraint on the performance of general analog circuits. It results in a fixed bandwidth-accuracy-power tradeoff which is set by technology constants. This tradeoff is independent of bias point for bipolar circuits whereas for MOS circuits some bias point optimizations are possible. The performance limitations imposed by matching are compared to the limits imposed by thermal noise. For MOS circuits the power constraints due to matching are several orders of magnitude higher than for thermal noise. For the bipolar case the constraints due to noise and matching are of comparable order of magnitude. The impact of technology scaling on the conclusions of this work are briefly explored.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2005.848021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435599","BiCMOS analog integrated circuits;bipolar analog integrated circuits;bipolar transistors;circuit analysis;CMOS analog integrated circuits;design methodology;mismatch;matching;MOSFETs;sensitivity","Analog circuits;Signal analysis;Circuit noise;MOSFETs;Signal processing;Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Sensor arrays;Integrated circuit noise;Analog integrated circuits","","359","12","56","IEEE","13 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While previous studies in the literature have reported gender or age differences separately, the pattern of results from the study reported here indicated that gender effects in individual adoption and use of technology differed based on age. Specifically, gender differences in technology perceptions became more pronounced among older workers, but a unisex pattern of results emerged among younger workers. The theory and empirical results are also discussed in relation to the widely employed technology acceptance model. The results from this study suggest that old stereotypes that portray ""technology"" as a male-oriented domain may be disappearing; particularly among younger workers.

This acceleration simultaneously requires the industry to intensify research on two highly challenging thrusts: one is scaling CMOS into an increasingly difficult manufacturing domain well below the 90-nm node for high performance (HP), low operating power (LOP), and low standby power (LSTP) applications, and the other is an exciting opportunity to invent fundamentally new approaches to information and signal processing to sustain functional scaling beyond the domain of CMOS.

Isomap is one of the most promising nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. However, when Isomap is applied to real-world data, it shows some limitations, such as being sensitive to noise. In this paper, an improved version of Isomap, namely S-Isomap, is proposed. S-Isomap utilizes class information to guide the procedure of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Such a kind of procedure is called supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In S-Isomap, the neighborhood graph of the input data is constructed according to a certain kind of dissimilarity between data points, which is specially designed to integrate the class information. The dissimilarity has several good properties which help to discover the true neighborhood of the data and, thus, makes S-Isomap a robust technique for both visualization and classification, especially for real-world problems. In the visualization experiments, S-Isomap is compared with Isomap, LLE, and WeightedIso. The results show that S-Isomap performs the best. In the classification experiments, S-Isomap is used as a preprocess of classification and compared with Isomap, WeightedIso, as well as some other well-established classification methods, including the K-nearest neighbor classifier, BP neural network, J4.8 decision tree, and SVM. The results reveal that S-Isomap excels compared to Isomap and WeightedIso in classification, and it is highly competitive with those well-known classification methods.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.850151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542257","Classification;dimensionality reduction;manifold learning;supervised learning;visualization","Data visualization;Classification tree analysis;Space technology;Principal component analysis;Independent component analysis;Robustness;Neural networks;Decision trees;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Data Display;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated;User-Computer Interface","358","3","18","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the coil displacements and/or loading changes may induce large fluctuations in transmitted power into the implant if no adaptive control is used. In such cases, it is required to transmit excessive power to accommodate all the working conditions, which substantially reduces the power efficiency and imposes potential safety concerns. We have implemented a power transfer system with adaptive control technique to eliminate the power variations due to the loading or coupling coefficient changes. A maximum of 250mW power is transmitted through an optimized coil pair driven by Class-E power amplifier. Load shift keying is implemented to wirelessly transfer data back from the secondary to primary side over the same coil pair, with data rate of 3.3 kbps and packet error rate less than 10/sup -5/. A pseudo pulsewidth modulation has been designed to facilitate back data transmission along with forward power transmission. Through this back telemetry the system transmits the information on received power, back from implant to primary side. According to the data received, the system adjusts the supply voltage of the Class-E power amplifier through a digitally controlled dc-dc converter, thus varying the power sent to the implant. The key system parameters are optimized to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system. Measurements show that the system can transmit the 'just-needed' power for a wide range of coil separation and/or loading conditions, with power efficiency doubled when compared to the uncompensated link.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2005.852923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1519624","Back telemetry;closed-loop control;inductive link;power telemetry;reverse telemetry;transcutaneous power transfer","Telemetry;Implants;Coils;Back;Pulse amplifiers;Adaptive control;Power amplifiers;Fluctuations;Employee welfare;Safety","","356","11","21","IEEE","17 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Environmental problems promote the adoption of new-generation electric vehicles for urban transportation. As it is well known, one of the weakest points of electric vehicles is the battery system. Vehicle autonomy and, therefore, accurate detection of battery state of charge (SoC) together with battery expected life, i.e., battery state of health, are among the major drawbacks that prevent the introduction of electric vehicles in the consumer market. The electric scooter may provide the most feasible opportunity among EVs. They may be a replacement product for the primary-use vehicle, especially in Europe and Asia, provided that drive performance, safety, and cost issues are similar to actual engine scooters. The battery system choice is a crucial item, and thanks to an increasing emphasis on vehicle range and performance, the Li-ion battery could become a viable candidate. This paper deals with the design of a battery pack based on Li-ion technology for a prototype electric scooter with high performance and autonomy. The adopted battery system is composed of a suitable number of cells series connected, featuring a high voltage level. Therefore, cell equalization and monitoring need to be provided. Due to manufacturing asymmetries, charge and discharge cycles lead to cell unbalancing, reducing battery capacity and, depending on cell type, causing safety troubles or strongly limiting the storage capacity of the full pack. No solution is available on the market at a cheap price, because of the required voltage level and performance, therefore, a dedicated battery management system was designed, that also includes a battery SoC monitoring. The proposed solution features a high capability of energy storing in braking conditions, charge equalization, overvoltage and undervoltage protection and, obviously, SoC information in order to optimize autonomy instead of performance or vice-versa.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2005.855664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512466","Batteries;electric vehicles (EVs)","Battery management systems;Electric vehicles;Motorcycles;Engines;Battery powered vehicles;Vehicle safety;Voltage;Pollution;Environmental factors;Transportation","","353","1","17","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Making changes in the shape of such topology or in the neighborhood may give birth to a high number of algorithmic variants. We perform these changes in a methodological way by tuning the concept of ratio. Since the relationship (ratio) between the topology and the neighborhood shape defines the search selection pressure, we propose to analyze in depth the influence of this ratio on the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. As we will see, it is difficult to decide which ratio is best suited for a given problem. Therefore, we introduce a preprogrammed change of this ratio during the evolution as a possible additional improvement that removes the need of specifying a single ratio. A later refinement will lead us to the first adaptive dynamic kind of cellular models to our knowledge.

This new approach seeks a manifold coordinate system that preserves geodesic distances in the high-dimensional hyperspectral data space. Algorithms for deriving manifold coordinates, such as isometric mapping (ISOMAP), have been developed for other applications. ISOMAP guarantees a globally optimal solution, but is computationally practical only for small datasets because of computational and memory requirements. Here, we develop a hybrid technique to circumvent ISOMAP's computational cost. We divide the scene into a set of smaller tiles. The manifolds derived from the individual tiles are then aligned and stitched together to recomplete the scene. Several alignment methods are discussed. This hybrid approach exploits the fact that ISOMAP guarantees a globally optimal solution for each tile and the presumed similarity of the manifold structures derived from different tiles. Using land-cover classification of hyperspectral imagery in the Virginia Coast Reserve as a test case, we show that the new manifold representation provides better separation of spectrally similar classes than one of the standard linear mixing models. Additionally, we demonstrate that this technique provides a natural data compression scheme, which dramatically reduces the number of components needed to model hyperspectral data when compared with traditional methods such as the minimum noise fraction transform.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.842292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1396318","Airborne Visible Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS);bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF);compression;Cuprite;geodesic distance;hyperspectral;isometric mapping (ISOMAP);land-cover classification;linear mixture;local linear embedding (LLE);manifold coordinates;nonlinearity;PROBE2;Virginia Coast Reserve","Geometry;Hyperspectral imaging;Geophysics computing;Standards development;Computational efficiency;Testing;Data compression;Noise reduction","","352","","46","IEEE","22 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reliable event detection at the sink is based on collective information provided by source nodes and not on any individual report. However, conventional end-to-end reliability definitions and solutions are inapplicable in the WSN regime and would only lead to a waste of scarce sensor resources. Hence, the WSN paradigm necessitates a collective event-to-sink reliability notion rather than the traditional end-to-end notion. To the best of our knowledge, reliable transport in WSN has not been studied from this perspective before. In order to address this need, a new reliable transport scheme for WSN, the event-to-sink reliable transport (ESRT) protocol, is presented in this paper. ESRT is a novel transport solution developed to achieve reliable event detection in WSN with minimum energy expenditure. It includes a congestion control component that serves the dual purpose of achieving reliability and conserving energy. Importantly, the algorithms of ESRT mainly run on the sink, with minimal functionality required at resource constrained sensor nodes. ESRT protocol operation is determined by the current network state based on the reliability achieved and congestion condition in the network. This self-configuring nature of ESRT makes it robust to random, dynamic topology in WSN. Furthermore, ESRT can also accommodate multiple concurrent event occurrences in a wireless sensor field. Analytical performance evaluation and simulation results show that ESRT converges to the desired reliability with minimum energy expenditure, starting from any initial network state.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2005.857076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1528490","Congestion control;energy conservation;event-to-sink reliability;reliable transport protocols;wireless sensor networks","Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Telecommunication network reliability;Event detection;Transport protocols;Microsensors;Network topology;Laboratories;Computer networks;Sensor systems","","351","1","13","IEEE","7 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The historical root and still core domain of BAS is the automation of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems in large functional buildings. Their primary goal is to realize significant savings in energy and reduce cost. Yet the reach of BAS has extended to include information from all kinds of building systems, working toward the goal of ""intelligent buildings"". Since these systems are diverse by tradition, integration issues are of particular importance. When compared with the field of industrial automation, building automation exhibits specific, differing characteristics. The present paper introduces the task of building automation and the systems and communications infrastructure necessary to address it. Basic requirements are covered as well as standard application models and typical services.

The conditions for optimal flux weakening can be achieved while simultaneously delivering sinusoidal line-to-line back-electromotive-force waveforms and low cogging torque. A closed-form analytical model is described that can be used to design SPM machines to achieve optimal flux-weakening conditions.

Several approaches, including range-based and range-free, have been proposed to calculate positions for randomly deployed sensor nodes. With specific hardware, the range-based schemes typically achieve high accuracy based on either node-to-node distances or angles. On the other hand, the range-free mechanisms support coarse positioning accuracy with the less expense. This paper describes a range-free localization scheme using mobile anchor points. Each anchor point equipped with the GPS moves in the sensing field and broadcasts its current position periodically. The sensor nodes obtaining the information are able to compute their locations. With the scheme, no extra hardware or data communication is needed for the sensor nodes. Moreover, obstacles in the sensing fields can be tolerated. The localization mechanism has been implemented in the network simulator ns-2.

We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: a) a tree-relaxed linear program (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and b) a tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm.

In the piecewise constant conductivity head model, this can be accomplished by the boundary element method (BEM) using a suitable integral formulation. Most previous work uses the same integral formulation, corresponding to a double-layer potential. We present a conceptual framework based on a well-known theorem (Theorem 1) that characterizes harmonic functions defined on the complement of a bounded smooth surface. This theorem says that such harmonic functions are completely defined by their values and those of their normal derivatives on this surface. It allows us to cast the previous BEM approaches in a unified setting and to develop two new approaches corresponding to different ways of exploiting the same theorem. Specifically, we first present a dual approach which involves a single-layer potential. Then, we propose a symmetric formulation, which combines single- and double-layer potentials, and which is new to the field of EEG, although it has been applied to other problems in electromagnetism. The three methods have been evaluated numerically using a spherical geometry with known analytical solution, and the symmetric formulation achieves a significantly higher accuracy than the alternative methods. Additionally, we present results with realistically shaped meshes. Beside providing a better understanding of the foundations of BEM methods, our approach appears to lead also to more efficient algorithms.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.837363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375158","Boundary element method;EEG;integral method;Poisson equation","Electroencephalography;Conductivity;Magnetic heads;Integral equations;Poisson equations;Brain modeling;Electric potential;Boundary element methods;Geometry;Electric variables measurement","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Head;Humans;Models, Neurological;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","346","","43","IEEE","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior to intraprediction, an edge map is created and a local edge direction histogram is then established for each subblock. Based on the distribution of the edge direction histogram, only a small part of intraprediction modes are chosen for RDO calculation.

This is achieved by matching distinctive visual landmarks in the current frame to a database map. A Hough transform approach and a RANSAC approach for global localization are compared, showing that RANSAC is much more efficient for matching specific features, but much worse for matching nonspecific features. Moreover, robust global localization can be achieved by matching a small submap of the local region built from multiple frames. This submap alignment algorithm for global localization can be applied to map building, which can be regarded as alignment of multiple 3-D submaps. A global minimization procedure is carried out using the loop closure constraint to avoid the effects of slippage and drift accumulation. Landmark uncertainty is taken into account in the submap alignment and the global minimization process. Experiments show that global localization can be achieved accurately using the scale-invariant landmarks. Our approach of pairwise submap alignment with backward correction in a consistent manner produces a better global 3-D map.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2004.839228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435480","Global localization;map building;mobile robots;visual landmarks","Mobile robots;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Robustness;Uncertainty;Intelligent robots;Buildings;Spatial databases;Visual databases;Computer vision;Intelligent systems","","345","29","33","IEEE","31 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A specific example of the hybrid built from two size 18650 lithium-ion cells and two 100-F ultracapacitors achieved a peak power of 132 W which is a three-times improvement in peak power compared to the passive hybrid power source (hybrid without a converter), and a seven times improvement as compared to the lithium-ion cells alone. The design presented here can be scaled to larger or smaller power capacities for a variety of applications.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.839784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377413","Hybrid power source;lithium-ion battery;peak power enhancement;power converter;ultracapacitor","Batteries;Supercapacitors;Pulse power systems;Hybrid power systems;Power system simulation;Load flow;Voltage control;Control systems;Space vehicles;Hybrid electric vehicles","","342","22","13","IEEE","10 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper provides an overview of the excitation of UHF signals by PD inside transformers. The use of externally mounted sensors has been outlined, and the structure of a dielectric window that can be constructed on an inspection hatch has been outlined. Attenuation of UHF signals propagating inside a transformer tank has been shown to be relatively low. A new approach to locating PD sources in three dimensions has been presented, based on using a numerical model of the transformer materials, which defines electromagnetic propagation velocities on a mesh of 5-cm sub-cells. The concepts of the propagation-velocity matrix (PVM) and the propagation-time matrix (PTM) were thereby introduced. Once the PD source has been located to a specific region of the transformer, the PVM might be used to index a database of physical descriptions of the transformer that could provide additional information to assist with diagnosis.","1558-4402","","10.1109/MEI.2005.1412214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1412214","","Partial discharges;Power transformers;Electromagnetic propagation;Condition monitoring;Power generation economics;Dielectrics;Inspection;Attenuation;UHF propagation;Numerical models","","340","2","31","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

For this purpose, both off-line optimization methods using knowledge of the driving pattern and on-line implementable ones are developed and tested in a simulation environment. Results show a reduction in fuel use of 2%, even without a prediction of the driving cycle being used. Simultaneously, even larger reductions of the emissions are obtained.

We construct a graph encoding pairwise pixel affinity, and partition the graph for image segmentation. We demonstrate that large image graphs can be compressed into multiple scales capturing image structure at increasingly large neighborhood. We show that the decomposition of the image segmentation graph into different scales can be determined by ecological statistics on the image grouping cues. Our segmentation algorithm works simultaneously across the graph scales, with an inter-scale constraint to ensure communication and consistency between the segmentations at each scale.

This work presents a new algorithm based on the foraging behavior of E. coli bacteria in our intestine to estimate the harmonic components present in power system voltage/current waveforms. The basic foraging strategy is made adaptive, through a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy scheme, depending on the operating condition to make the convergence faster. Besides, the harmonic estimation is linear in amplitude and nonlinear in phase. As the proposed algorithm does not rely on Newton-like gradient descent methods, this is used for phase estimation whereas the linear least square scheme estimates the amplitude, thereby presenting the hybrid method. The improvement in %error, as well as the processing time compared with the conventional discrete Fourier transform and genetic algorithm method is demonstrated in this paper. Besides, the performance is quite acceptable even in the presence of decaying dc component as well as to change in amplitude and phase angle of harmonic components.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2004.840144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1395852","Bacterial foraging;cost function;discrete fourier transform (DFT);genetic algorithm (GA);harmonic estimation;least square","Microorganisms;Power system harmonics;Phase estimation;Amplitude estimation;Harmonic distortion;Additive noise;Power engineering and energy;Intestines;Voltage;Takagi-Sugeno model","","338","","13","IEEE","22 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stochastic security criterion accounts for a pre-selected set of random generator and line outages with known historical failure rates and involuntary load shedding as optimization variables. Unlike the classical deterministic reserve-constrained unit commitment, here the reserve services are determined by economically penalizing the operation of the market by the expected load not served. The proposed formulation is a stochastic programming problem that optimizes, concurrently with the pre-contingency social welfare, the expected operating costs associated with the deployment of the reserves following the contingencies. This stochastic programming formulation is solved in the second companion paper using mixed-integer linear programming methods. Two cases are presented: a small transmission-constrained three-bus network scheduled over a horizon of four hours and the IEEE Reliability Test System scheduled over 24 h. The impact on the resulting generation and reserve schedules of transmission constraints and generation ramp limits, of demand-side reserve, of the value of load not served, and of the constitution of the pre-selected set of contingencies are assessed.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2005.857016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1525111","Deterministic/probabilistic security criteria;electricity markets;expected load not served;failure rate;reserve;stochastic programming;transmission limits;unit commitment;value of lost load","Stochastic processes;Spinning;Cost function;Security;Linear programming;Voltage;Load flow;Power transmission lines;Power system economics;Power generation economics","","335","","50","IEEE","31 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As human attention is an effective and efficient mechanism for information prioritizing and filtering, user attention model provides an effective approach to video indexing based on importance ranking. In particular, we define viewer attention through multiple sensory perceptions, i.e. visual and aural stimulus as well as partly semantic understanding. Also, a set of modeling methods for visual and aural attentions are proposed. As one of important applications of user attention model, a feasible solution of video summarization, without fully semantic understanding of video content as well as complex heuristic rules, is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and generality of the user attention model.

For growth on nonplanar geometries, this leads to enrichment of the catalyst on advancing concave surfaces and dilution on advancing convex sections, thereby giving rise to bottom-up superfilling of submicrometer trenches and vias.

A multilevel voltage-source inverter can be formed by connecting one of the MLDCLs with a single-phase bridge inverter. The MLDCL provides a dc voltage with the shape of a staircase approximating the rectified shape of a commanded sinusoidal wave, with or without pulsewidth modulation, to the bridge inverter, which in turn alternates the polarity to produce an ac voltage. Compared with the cascaded H-bridge, diode-clamped, and flying-capacitor multilevel inverters, the MLDCL inverters can significantly reduce the switch count as well as the number of gate drivers as the number of voltage levels increases. For a given number of voltage levels m, the required number of active switches is 2/spl times/(m-1) for the existing multilevel inverters but is m+3 for the MLDCL inverters.

Long-term array reliability is an important requirement for these applications. Here, we demonstrate the reliability of a regular array of 100 microelectrodes to obtain neural recordings from primary motor cortex (MI) of monkeys for at least three months and up to 1.5 years. We implanted Bionic (Cyberkinetics, Inc., Foxboro, MA) silicon probe arrays in MI of three Macaque monkeys. Neural signals were recorded during performance of an eight-direction, push-button task. Recording reliability was evaluated for 18, 35, or 51 sessions distributed over 83, 179, and 569 days after implantation, respectively, using qualitative and quantitative measures. A four-point signal quality scale was defined based on the waveform amplitude relative to noise. A single observer applied this scale to score signal quality for each electrode. A mean of 120 (/spl plusmn/17.6 SD), 146 (/spl plusmn/7.3), and 119 (/spl plusmn/16.9) neural-like waveforms were observed from 65-85 electrodes across subjects for all recording sessions of which over 80% were of high quality. Quantitative measures demonstrated that waveforms had signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to 20 with maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of over 1200 /spl mu/v with a mean SNR of 4.8 for signals ranked as high quality. Mean signal quality did not change over the duration of the evaluation period (slope 0.001, 0.0068 and 0.03; NS). By contrast, neural waveform shape varied between, but not within days in all animals, suggesting a shifting population of recorded neurons over time. Arm-movement related modulation was common and 66% of all recorded neurons were tuned to reach direction. The ability for the array to record neural signals from parietal cortex was also established. These results demonstrate that neural recordings that can provide movement related signals for neural prostheses, as well as for fundamental research applications, can be reliably obtained for long time periods using a monolithic microelectrode array in primate MI and potentially from other cortical areas as well.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2005.857687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556610","Brain–machine interface;chronically implanted;long-term reliability;silicon electrode arrays","Electrodes;Sensor arrays;Microelectrodes;Neurons;Neural prosthesis;Signal restoration;Humans;Micromotors;Silicon;Probes","Action Potentials;Animals;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Electroencephalography;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Evoked Potentials, Motor;Female;Humans;Macaca mulatta;Male;Microelectrodes;Motor Cortex;Primates;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Silicon","330","16","31","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for mobile applications channel time-variations in one OFDM symbol introduce intercarrier-interference (ICI) which degrades the performance. This becomes more severe as mobile speed, carrier frequency or OFDM symbol duration increases. As delay spread increases, symbol duration should also increase in order to maintain a near-constant channel in every frequency subband. Also, due to the high demand for bandwidth, there is a trend toward higher carrier frequencies. Therefore, to have an acceptable reception quality for the applications that experience high delay and Doppler spread, there is a need for ICI mitigation within one OFDM symbol. We introduce two new methods to mitigate ICI in an OFDM system with coherent channel estimation. Both methods use a piece-wise linear model to approximate channel time-variations. The first method extracts channel time-variations information from the cyclic prefix. The second method estimates these variations using the next symbol. We find a closed-form expression for the improvement in average signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) when our mitigation methods are applied for a narrowband time-variant channel. Finally, our simulation results show how these methods would improve the performance in a highly time-variant environment with high delay spread.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2004.840235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413242","Channel estimation;intercarrier-interference (ICI) mitigation;mobility;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","OFDM;Delay;Frequency division multiplexing;Robustness;Fading;Degradation;Bandwidth;Channel estimation;Piecewise linear techniques;Linear approximation","","330","6","21","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The discontinuities in the activations are an ideal model of the situation where the gain of the neuron amplifiers is very high and tends to infinity, while the delay accounts for the finite switching speed of the neuron amplifiers, or the finite signal propagation speed. It is known that the delay in combination with high-gain nonlinearities is a particularly harmful source of potential instability. The goal of this paper is to single out a subclass of the considered discontinuous neural networks for which stability is instead insensitive to the presence of a delay. More precisely, conditions are given under which there is a unique equilibrium point of the neural network, which is globally exponentially stable for the states, with a known convergence rate. The conditions are easily testable and independent of the delay. Moreover, global convergence in finite time of the state and output is investigated. In doing so, new interesting dynamical phenomena are highlighted with respect to the case without delay, which make the study of convergence in finite time significantly more difficult. The obtained results extend previous work on global stability of delayed neural networks with Lipschitz continuous neuron activations, and neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations but without delays.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2005.852862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1528523","Convergence in finite time;delayed neural networks;discontinuous dynamical systems;global exponential stability","Convergence;Intelligent networks;Delay effects;Neural networks;Neurons;Stability analysis;Robust stability;Propagation delay;Cellular neural networks;Computer networks","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors","329","","38","IEEE","7 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed approach benefits from the fact that most of the texture patterns either have directionality (anisotropic textures) or are not with a specific direction (isotropic textures). The wavelet energy features of the directional textures change significantly when the image is rotated. However, for the isotropic images, the wavelet features are not sensitive to rotation. Therefore, for the directional textures, it is essential to calculate the wavelet features along a specific direction. In the proposed approach, the Radon transform is first employed to detect the principal direction of the texture. Then, the texture is rotated to place its principal direction at 0 degrees. A wavelet transform is applied to the rotated image to extract texture features. This approach provides a features space with small intraclass variability and, therefore, good separation between different classes. The performance of the method is evaluated using three texture sets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach compared with some existing methods.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424459","Index Terms- Texture classification;Radon transform;wavelet transform;rotation invariance.","Wavelet transforms;Frequency;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Image texture analysis;Strontium;Feature extraction;Image analysis;Computer vision;Image processing;Application software","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","328","7","17","IEEE","5 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For these links closer to processors, issues such as packaging, power dissipation, and components cost assume increasing importance along with link bandwidth and link distance. Also, as optical links move steadily closer to the processors, we may see significant differences in how servers, particularly high-end servers, are designed and packaged to exploit the unique characteristics of optical interconnects.

A way to reconstruct a full three-color representation of color images by estimating the missing pixel components in each color plane is called a demosaicing algorithm. This paper presents three inherent problems often associated with demosaicing algorithms that incorporate two-dimensional (2-D) directional interpolation: misguidance color artifacts, interpolation color artifacts, and aliasing. The level of misguidance color artifacts present in two images can be compared using metric neighborhood modeling. The proposed demosaicing algorithm estimates missing pixels by interpolating in the direction with fewer color artifacts. The aliasing problem is addressed by applying filterbank techniques to 2-D directional interpolation. The interpolation artifacts are reduced using a nonlinear iterative procedure. Experimental results using digital images confirm the effectiveness of this approach.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.838691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1395991","Color artifact;demosaicing algorithm;digital camera;filterbank;interpolation;metric neighborhood model","Interpolation;Digital cameras;Digital filters;Image reconstruction;Color;Pixel;Two dimensional displays;Iterative algorithms;Filter bank;Digital images","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Color;Colorimetry;Computer Graphics;Data Compression;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","327","20","17","IEEE","22 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main idea is to design a Lyapunov-based predictive controller for each constituent mode in which the switched system operates and incorporate constraints in the predictive controller design which upon satisfaction ensure that the prescribed transitions between the modes occur in a way that guarantees stability of the switched closed-loop system. This is achieved as follows: For each constituent mode, a Lyapunov-based model predictive controller (MPC) is designed, and an analytic bounded controller, using the same Lyapunov function, is used to explicitly characterize a set of initial conditions for which the MPC, irrespective of the controller parameters, is guaranteed to be feasible, and hence stabilizing. Then, constraints are incorporated in the MPC design which, upon satisfaction, ensure that: 1) the state of the closed-loop system, at the time of the transition, resides in the stability region of the mode that the system is switched into, and 2) the Lyapunov function for each mode is nonincreasing wherever the mode is reactivated, thereby guaranteeing stability. The proposed control method is demonstrated through application to a chemical process example.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2005.858692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532396","Bounded Lyapunov-based control;input constraints;model predictive control (MPC);multiple Lyapunov functions;stability regions;switched systems","Predictive control;Nonlinear systems;Control systems;Chemical engineering;Lyapunov method;Switched systems;Nonlinear control systems;Predictive models;Stability analysis;Chemical processes","","326","","32","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, the real system appears as a different virtual system or even as multiple virtual systems.

It requires an optimal technique to continuously detect drivers' cognitive state related to abilities in perception, recognition, and vehicle control in (near-) real-time. The major challenges in developing such a system include: 1) the lack of significant index for detecting drowsiness and 2) complicated and pervasive noise interferences in a realistic and dynamic driving environment. In this paper, we develop a drowsiness-estimation system based on electroencephalogram (EEG) by combining independent component analysis (ICA), power-spectrum analysis, correlation evaluations, and linear regression model to estimate a driver's cognitive state when he/she drives a car in a virtual reality (VR)-based dynamic simulator. The driving error is defined as deviations between the center of the vehicle and the center of the cruising lane in the lane-keeping driving task. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of quantitatively estimating drowsiness level using ICA-based multistream EEG spectra. The proposed ICA-based method applied to power spectrum of ICA components can successfully (1) remove most of EEG artifacts, (2) suggest an optimal montage to place EEG electrodes, and estimate the driver's drowsiness fluctuation indexed by the driving performance measure. Finally, we present a benchmark study in which the accuracy of ICA-component-based alertness estimates compares favorably to scalp-EEG based.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2005.857555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556780","Correlation coefficient;drowsiness;electroencephalogram;independent component analysis (ICA);linear regression model;power spectrum;virtual reality (VR)","Safety;Independent component analysis;Electroencephalography;Vehicle driving;Vehicle dynamics;Brain modeling;Accidents;Vehicle detection;Optimal control;Working environment noise","","325","36","62","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Harnessing this potential, however, requires new mechanisms at the medium access and network layers for intelligently and adaptively exploiting the antenna system. While recent years have seen a surge of research into such mechanisms, the problem of developing a complete ad hoc networking system, including the unique challenge of real-life prototype development and experimentation has not been addressed. In this paper, we present utilizing directional antennas for ad hoc networking (UDAAN). UDAAN is an interacting suite of modular network- and medium access control (MAC)-layer mechanisms for adaptive control of steered or switched antenna systems in an ad hoc network. UDAAN consists of several new mechanisms-a directional power-controlled MAC, neighbor discovery with beamforming, link characterization for directional antennas, proactive routing and forwarding-all working cohesively to provide the first complete systems solution. We also describe the development of a real-life ad hoc network testbed using UDAAN with switched directional antennas, and we discuss the lessons learned during field trials. High fidelity simulation results, using the same networking code as in the prototype, are also presented both for a specific scenario and using random mobility models. For the range of parameters studied, our results show that UDAAN can produce a very significant improvement in throughput over omnidirectional communications.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.842556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402579","Ad hoc networks;beamforming;directional antenna;medium access control (MAC)","Directional antennas;Ad hoc networks;Adaptive arrays;Intelligent networks;Surges;Prototypes;Media Access Protocol;Adaptive control;Array signal processing;Routing","","324","10","15","IEEE","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The closed-form outage probability of the system with transmit antenna selection is presented. The bit error rate (BER) of the TAS/MRC scheme is derived for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) in flat Rayleigh fading channels. The BER analysis demonstrates that the TAS/MRC scheme can achieve a full diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), as if all the transmit antennas were used. The average SNR gain of the TAS/MRC is quantified and compared with those of uncoded receiver MRC and space-time block codes (STBCs). The analytical results are verified by simulation. It is shown that the TAS/MRC scheme outperforms some more complex space-time codes of the same spectral efficiency. The cost of the improved performance is a low-rate feedback channel. We also show that channel estimation errors based on pilot symbols have no impact on the diversity order over quasi-static fading channels.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2005.851319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1492684","Antenna selection;diversity;fading channels;maximal-ratio combining;space-time code","Transmitting antennas;Diversity reception;Fading;Bit error rate;MIMO;Receiving antennas;Phase shift keying;Binary phase shift keying;Signal analysis;Signal to noise ratio","","322","1","40","IEEE","8 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aim is to simplify the implementation of SSI-based current harmonic compensation for industrial implementations where strict limitations on the harmonic distortion of the mains' currents are required. To compensate current harmonics, the SSIs are implemented to operate both on positive and negative sequence signals. One regulator, for the fundamental current component, is implemented in the stationary reference frame. The other regulators, for the current harmonics, are all implemented in a synchronous reference frame rotating at the fundamental frequency. This allows the simultaneous compensation of two current harmonics with just one regulator, yielding a significant reduction of the computational effort compared with other current control methods employing sinusoidal signal integrators implemented in stationary reference frame. A simple and robust voltage filter is also proposed by the authors to obtain a smooth and accurate position estimation of the voltage vector at the point of common coupling (PCC) under distorted mains' voltages.

First, correspondence information and geometry are computed based on new quasi-dense point features that are resampled subpixel points from a disparity map. The quasi-dense approach gives more robust and accurate geometry estimations than the standard sparse approach. The robustness is measured as the success rate of full automatic geometry estimation with all involved parameters fixed. The accuracy is measured by a fast gauge-free uncertainty estimation algorithm. The quasi-dense approach also works for more largely separated images than the sparse approach, therefore, it requires fewer images for modeling. More importantly, the quasi-dense approach delivers a high density of reconstructed 3D points on which a surface representation can be reconstructed. This fills the gap of insufficiency of the sparse approach for surface reconstruction, essential for modeling and visualization applications. Second, surface reconstruction methods from the given quasi-dense geometry are also developed. The algorithm optimizes new unified functionals integrating both 3D quasi-dense points and 2D image information, including silhouettes. Combining both 3D data and 2D images is more robust than the existing methods using only 2D information or only 3D data. An efficient bounded regularization method is proposed to implement the surface evolution by level-set methods. Its properties are discussed and proven for some cases. As a whole, a complete automatic and practical system of 3D modeling from raw images captured by hand-held cameras to surface representation is proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the quasi-dense approach with respect to the standard sparse approach in robustness, accuracy, and applicability.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388267","Index Terms- Three-dimensional reconstruction;surface reconstruction;structure from motion;3D modeling;matching;uncertainty;variational calculus;level-set method.","Surface reconstruction;Image reconstruction;Robustness;Cameras;Layout;Stereo image processing;Stereo vision;Computational geometry;Information geometry;Data visualization","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Calibration;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photogrammetry;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","322","29","65","IEEE","31 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These shock waves result in longer travel times and in sudden large variations in the speeds of the vehicles, which could lead to unsafe situations. Dynamic speed limits can be used to eliminate or at least to reduce the effects of shock waves. However, coordination of the variable speed limits is necessary in order to prevent the occurrence of new shock waves and/or a negative impact on the traffic flows in other locations. In this paper, we present a model predictive control approach to optimally coordinate variable speed limits for freeway traffic with the aim of suppressing shock waves. First, we optimize continuous valued speed limits, such that the total travel time is minimal. Next, we include a safety constraint that prevents drivers from encountering speed limit drops larger than, e.g., 10 km/h. Furthermore, to get a better correspondence between the computed and applied control signals, we also consider discrete speed limits.

We derive worst case capacity formulas and strategies for ""strong"" or arbitrarily varying interference. In the causal side information (SI) case, we develop a capacity formula based on minimum noise entropy strategies. We then show that strategies associated with entropy-constrained quantizers provide lower and upper bounds on the capacity. At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, i.e., if N is weak relative to the power constraint P/sub X/, these bounds coincide, the optimum strategies take the form of scalar lattice quantizers, and the capacity loss due to not having S at the receiver is shown to be exactly the ""shaping gain"" 1/2log(2/spl pi/e/12)/spl ap/ 0.254 bit. We extend the schemes to obtain achievable rates at any SNR and to noncausal SI, by incorporating minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) scaling, and by using k-dimensional lattices. For Gaussian N, the capacity loss of this scheme is upper-bounded by 1/2log2/spl pi/eG(/spl Lambda/), where G(/spl Lambda/) is the normalized second moment of the lattice. With a proper choice of lattice, the loss goes to zero as the dimension k goes to infinity, in agreement with the results of Costa. These results provide an information-theoretic framework for the study of common communication problems such as precoding for intersymbol interference (ISI) channels and broadcast channels.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.856935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1522643","Causal side information (SI);common randomness;dirty-paper channel;dither;interference;minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation;noncausal SI;precoding;randomized code","Lattices;Interference cancellation;Signal to noise ratio;Intersymbol interference;Gaussian noise;Transmitters;Additive noise;Information theory;Entropy;Upper bound","","321","7","45","IEEE","24 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its aim is to achieve a deadbeat dynamic response for the controlled variables (output voltage and inverter current). Besides the linear state feedback which allocates system poles at the origin so as to achieve deadbeat response for all state variables, the use of a disturbance observer for the estimation of the load current and of any other source of errors (such as dead-times, parameter, and model mismatches) is investigated. The proposed solution is able to guarantee a fast dynamic response and also a precise compensation of any source of unpredictable disturbance. Moreover, with a proper design of observer parameters, it is possible to reduce control sensitivity to model uncertainties, parameter mismatches, and noise on sensed variables, which usually characterizes existing deadbeat control techniques. Finally, the control algorithm is quite simple and requires only the measurements of the output voltage and inductor current. Experimental results on a single-phase 2 kVA prototype show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2004.837912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1391109","Digital control;disturbance observer;uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs)","Uninterruptible power systems;Inverters;Inductors;Voltage control;Digital control;Regulators;State feedback;Observers;State estimation;Noise reduction","","321","","14","IEEE","7 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main reason is that the sensor nodes located near a base station have to relay data for a large part of the network and thus deplete their batteries very quickly. The solution we propose in this paper suggests that the base station be mobile; in this way, the nodes located close to it change over time. Data collection protocols can then be optimized by taking both base station mobility and multi-hop routing into account. We first study the former, and conclude that the best mobility strategy consists in following the periphery of the network (we assume that the sensors are deployed within a circle). We then consider jointly mobility and routing algorithms in this case, and show that a better routing strategy uses a combination of round routes and short paths. We provide a detailed analytical model for each of our statements, and corroborate it with simulation results. We show that the obtained improvement in terms of network lifetime is in the order of 500%.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498454","","Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Base stations;Analytical models;Telecommunication traffic;Batteries;Routing protocols;Computer networks;Energy efficiency;Relays","","320","","41","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Managers face several barriers, real and perceived, when they try to bring agile approaches into traditional organizations. They categorized the barriers either as problems only in terms of scope or scale, or as significant general issues needing resolution.

Improvements in the capabilities as well the lower cost of sensors, electronics and memory is partly the reason for the increased popularity of PD diagnostics. Another reason has been the development of methods-including the use of ultrawide band detection-to improve the reliability of the PD measurement in the presence of noise. In addition, rapid progress is being made in automated pattern recognition techniques that also helps to suppress noise.

The concepts of signal modulation and matched filtering are given, and a simple model of attenuation relates the matched filter response with the ambiguity function, known from radar. Based on this analysis and the properties of the ambiguity function, the selection of coded waveforms suitable for ultrasound imaging is discussed. It is shown that linear frequency modulation (FM) signals have the best and most robust features for ultrasound imaging. Other coded signals such as nonlinear FM and binary complementary Golay codes also have been considered and characterized in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity to frequency shifts. Using the simulation program Field II, it is found that in the case of linear FM signals, a SNR improvement of 12 to 18 dB can be expected for large imaging depths in attenuating media, without any depth-dependent filter compensation. In contrast, nonlinear FM modulation and binary codes are shown to give a SNR improvement of only 4 to 9 dB when processed with a matched filter. Other issues, such as depth-dependent matched filtering and use of filters other than the matched filter (inverse and Wiener filters) also are addressed.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1406545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1406545","","Ultrasonic imaging;Matched filters;Frequency modulation;Wiener filter;Biomedical imaging;Filtering;Pulse compression methods;Attenuation;Radar imaging;Image analysis","Humans;Mathematics;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography","316","23","47","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The result is a system that is transparent to, and easily ""tweaked"" by, the prosthetist/clinician. Other algorithms in current literature assume a longer period of unperceivable delay, while the system we present has an update rate of 45.7 ms with little postprocessing time, making it suitable for real-time application. Five subjects were investigated (three with intact limbs, one with a unilateral transradial amputation, and one with a unilateral transradial limb-deficiency from birth). Four subjects were used for system offline analysis, and the remaining intact-limbed subject was used for system real-time analysis. We discriminated between four EMG patterns for subjects with intact limbs, and between three patterns for limb-deficient subjects. Overall classification rates ranged from 94% to 99%. The fuzzy algorithm also demonstrated success in real-time classification, both during steady state motions and motion state transitioning. This functionality allows for seamless control of multiple degrees-of-freedom in a multifunctional prosthesis.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2005.847357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1506815","Clustering;electromyogram (EMG);fuzzy logic;heuristics;multifunctional control;myoelectric prostheses;pattern recognition","Fuzzy logic;Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Prosthetics;Automatic control;Real time systems;Statistics;Clustering algorithms;Inference algorithms;Delay systems","Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Electromyography;Forearm;Fuzzy Logic;Humans;Joint Prosthesis;Male;Movement;Muscle Contraction;Muscle, Skeletal;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Prosthesis Design;Therapy, Computer-Assisted","316","2","30","IEEE","12 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally, we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery and tracking in video.","2380-7504","0-7695-2334-X","10.1109/ICCV.2005.148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541329","","Image segmentation;Shape;Object segmentation;Object recognition;Humans;Training data;Image recognition;Computer vision;Lighting;Computational modeling","","315","1","20","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These four core technologies include: the design of the exoskeleton architecture, control schemes, a body local area network (bLAN) to host the control algorithm and an on-board power unit to power the actuators, sensors and the computers. This article gives an overview of one of the control schemes. The analysis here is an extension of the classical definition of the sensitivity function of a system: the ability of a system to reject disturbances or the measure of system robustness. The control algorithm developed here increases the closed loop system sensitivity to its wearer’s forces and torques without any measurement from the wearer (such as force, position, or electromyogram signal). The control method has little robustness to parameter variations and therefore requires a relatively good dynamic model of the system. The tradeoffs between having sensors to measure human variables and the lack of robustness to parameter variation are described.","1050-4729","0-7803-8914-X","10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1570790","BLEEX;exoskeleton;human-machine;wearable robotics;control","Extremities;Exoskeletons;Robustness;Force measurement;Legged locomotion;Payloads;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Local area networks;Actuators","","315","34","16","IEEE","10 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A one degree of freedom (DoF) wrist manipulator and a two-DoF elbow-shoulder manipulator were designed using an admittance control strategy; if the patient could not move the handle, the devices completed the motor task. Two groups of chronic post-stroke patients (G1 n=7, and G2 n=9) were enrolled in a three week rehabilitation program including standard physical therapy (45 min daily) plus treatment by means of robot devices, respectively, for wrist and elbow-shoulder movements (40 min, twice daily). Both groups were evaluated by means of standard clinical assessment scales and a new robot measured evaluation metrics that included an active movement index quantifying the patient's ability to execute the assigned motor task without robot assistance, the mean velocity, and a movement accuracy index measuring the distance of the executed path from the theoretic one. After treatment, both groups improved their motor deficit and disability. In G1, there was a significant change in the clinical scale values (p<0.05) and range of motion wrist extension (p<0.02). G2 showed a significant change in clinical scales (p<0.01), in strength (p<0.05) and in the robot measured parameters (p<0.01). The relationship between robot measured parameters and the clinical assessment scales showed a moderate and significant correlation (r>0.53 p<0.03).

The performance of these devices considering different scenarios is determined and compared. Factors such as voltage-dependent loads, generator inertia constant, and multidistributed generator systems are analyzed. False operation of these relays due to faults in adjacent feeders is also addressed.

Often, the ultimate objective is to estimate a parameter or function from these data, and such estimators are typically the solution of an optimization problem (e.g., maximum likelihood, minimum mean-squared error, or maximum a posteriori). This paper investigates a general class of distributed optimization algorithms for ""in-network"" data processing, aimed at reducing the amount of energy and bandwidth used for communication. Our intuition tells us that processing the data in-network should, in general, require less energy than transmitting all of the data to a fusion center. In this paper, we address the questions: When, in fact, does in-network processing use less energy, and how much energy is saved? The proposed distributed algorithms are based on incremental optimization methods. A parameter estimate is circulated through the network, and along the way each node makes a small gradient descent-like adjustment to the estimate based only on its local data. Applying results from the theory of incremental subgradient optimization, we find that the distributed algorithms converge to an approximate solution for a broad class of problems. We extend these results to the case where the optimization variable is quantized before being transmitted to the next node and find that quantization does not affect the rate of convergence. Bounds on the number of incremental steps required for a certain level of accuracy provide insight into the tradeoff between estimation performance and communication overhead. Our main conclusion is that as the number of sensors in the network grows, in-network processing will always use less energy than a centralized algorithm, while maintaining a desired level of accuracy.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.843546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413472","Distributed algorithms;energy-accuracy tradeoff;gradient methods;wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks;Energy resources;Parameter estimation;Distributed algorithms;Optimization methods;Maximum likelihood estimation;Data processing;Bandwidth;Quantization;Gradient methods","","313","4","12","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system exploits the P300 component of event-related brain potentials (ERP) as a medium for communication. The processing methods distinguish this work from Donchin's work. In this work, independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate the P300 source from the background noise.

The processing method was evaluated offline on data recorded from six healthy subjects. The method achieved a communication rate of 5.45 symbols/min with an accuracy of 92.1% compared to 4.8 symbols/min with an accuracy of 90% in Donchin's work.

In the proposed approach, for a fixed rate, either multiplexing or diversity is chosen based on the instantaneous channel state and the decision is conveyed to the transmitter via a low-rate feedback channel. The minimum Euclidean distance at the receiver is computed for spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity and is used to derive the selection criterion. Additionally, the Demmel condition number of the matrix channel is shown to provide a sufficient condition for multiplexing to outperform diversity.

Based on this requirement, the conditional diagnosability of the n-dimensional hypercube is shown to be 4(n - 2) +1, which is about four times as large as the classical diagnosability. Besides, we propose some useful conditions for verifying if a system is t-diagnosable and introduce a new concept, called a strongly t-diagnosable system, under the PMC model.

With little effort, an adversary may capture nodes, analyze and replicate them, and surreptitiously insert these replicas at strategic locations within the network. Such attacks may have severe consequences; they may allow the adversary to corrupt network data or even disconnect significant parts of the network. Previous node replication detection schemes depend primarily on centralized mechanisms with single points of failure, or on neighborhood voting protocols that fail to detect distributed replications. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose two new algorithms based on emergent properties (Gligor (2004)), i.e., properties that arise only through the collective action of multiple nodes. Randomized multicast distributes node location information to randomly-selected witnesses, exploiting the birthday paradox to detect replicated nodes, while line-selected multicast uses the topology of the network to detect replication. Both algorithms provide globally-aware, distributed node-replica detection, and line-selected multicast displays particularly strong performance characteristics. We show that emergent algorithms represent a promising new approach to sensor network security; moreover, our results naturally extend to other classes of networks in which nodes can be captured, replicated and re-inserted by an adversary.","2375-1207","0-7695-2339-0","10.1109/SP.2005.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425058","","Intelligent networks;Voting;Multicast algorithms;Hardware;Base stations;Protocols;Network topology;Displays;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Government","","308","6","37","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper begins by investigating the multiband properties exhibited by a conventional electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) AMC that consists of a frequency selective surface (FSS) on top of a thin dielectric substrate with a PEC back plane. The higher-order resonances associated with these surfaces have not been discussed in detail to date, as previous research has been concerned only with exploiting the primary resonant frequency. However, it will be shown that by understanding and making appropriate use of these higher order resonances, it is possible to design multiband AMC surfaces that work for nearly any desired combination of operating frequencies. The first multiband AMC design approach that will be considered is based on the introduction of FSS screens that have fractal or nearly fractal unit cell geometries. This is followed by a more general and robust genetic algorithm (GA) technique for the synthesis of optimal multiband AMC surfaces. In this case, a GA is used to evolve multiband AMC surface designs by simultaneously optimizing the geometry and size of the FSS unit cell as well as the thickness and dielectric constant of the substrate material. Finally, several examples of multiband AMC surfaces are presented, including some practical dual-band and tri-band designs genetically evolved for operation at GPS and cellular frequencies, as well as an example illustrating the success in creating a multiband AMC surface with angular stability.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2004.840540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377569","Artificial magnetic conducting (AMC);electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) surface;frequency selective surface (FSS);metamaterials;multiband;perfect magnetic conductor (PMC)","Conductors;Surface impedance;Frequency selective surfaces;Magnetic resonance;Dielectric substrates;Fractals;Geometry;Design methodology;Periodic structures;Metamaterials","","307","13","37","IEEE","10 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A metafilm is the two-dimensional equivalent of a metamaterial, and is essentially a surface distribution of electrically small scatterers characterized by electric- and magnetic-polarizability densities. In this paper, the GSTC is used to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients of the metafilm. These coefficients are derived for both TM and TE polarized plane waves with arbitrary incidence angles. We show that the reflection and transmission properties of the metafilm are expressed in terms of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the scatterers themselves, and we derive conditions on the polarizabilities of the scatterers required to obtain total transmission and/or total reflection. We show various examples to illustrate the validity of the GSTC for the analysis of a metafilm. By controlling the polarization densities of the scatterers in the metafilm, a ""smart"" and/or ""controllable"" surface can be realized. We propose a metafilm composed of spherical magneto-dielectric particles for achieving such a controllable surface. To validate the results for the spherical particle metafilm, we show comparisons with a full-wave computation obtained from a mode-matching technique applied to the doubly infinite array of spherical scatterers. The results in this paper are in principle scalable; that is, the dimensions of the scatterers can range from relatively large to relatively small depending on the frequencies of interest.","1558-187X","","10.1109/TEMC.2005.853719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580755","Generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTC);metafilm;metamaterial;polarizabilities;reflection and transmission properties;smart controllable surface","Films;Electromagnetic reflection;Electromagnetic scattering;Polarization;Mode matching methods","","307","","42","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An original algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the full polarimetric (FP) information from this architecture.

Our facial feature detection and tracking based on active IR illumination provides reliable visual information under variable lighting and head motion. Our approach to facial expression recognition lies in the proposed dynamic and probabilistic framework based on combining DBN with Ekman's facial action coding system (FACS) for systematically modeling the dynamic and stochastic behaviors of spontaneous facial expressions. The framework not only provides a coherent and unified hierarchical probabilistic framework to represent spatial and temporal information related to facial expressions, but also allows us to actively select the most informative visual cues from the available information sources to minimize the ambiguity in recognition. The recognition of facial expressions is accomplished by fusing not only from the current visual observations, but also from the previous visual evidences. Consequently, the recognition becomes more robust and accurate through explicitly modeling temporal behavior of facial expression. In this paper, we present the theoretical foundation underlying the proposed probabilistic and dynamic framework for facial expression modeling and understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can accurately and robustly recognize spontaneous facial expressions from an image sequence under different conditions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.93","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407874","Index Terms- Facial expression analysis;dynamic Bayesian networks;visual information fusion;active sensing.","Image sequences;Face recognition;Robustness;Bayesian methods;Facial features;Face detection;Infrared detectors;Motion detection;Tracking;Lighting","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Face;Facial Expression;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;Video Recording","306","7","51","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An aircraft visits the area periodically and gathers data about the activity in the area from the sensor nodes. There are two types of nodes that are distributed over the area using two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson point processes; type 0 nodes with intensity (average number per unit area) /spl lambda//sub 0/ and battery energy E/sub 0/; and type 1 nodes with intensity /spl lambda//sub 1/ and battery energy E/sub 1/. Type 0 nodes do the sensing while type 1 nodes act as the cluster heads besides doing the sensing. Nodes use multihopping to communicate with their closest cluster heads. We determine them optimum node intensities (/spl lambda//sub 0/, /spl lambda//sub 1/) and node energies (E/sub 0/, E/sub 1/) that guarantee a lifetime of at least T units, while ensuring connectivity and coverage of the surveillance area with a high probability. We minimize the overall cost of the network under these constraints. Lifetime is defined as the number of successful data gathering trips (or cycles) that are possible until connectivity and/or coverage are lost. Conditions for a sharp cutoff are also taken into account, i.e., we ensure that almost all the nodes run out of energy at about the same time so that there is very little energy waste due to residual energy. We compare the results for random deployment with those of a grid deployment in which nodes are placed deterministically along grid points. We observe that in both cases /spl lambda//sub 1/ scales approximately as /spl radic/(/spl lambda//sub 0/).

This is achieved by using dynamic element matching, a chopped current-gain independent PTAT bias circuit, and a low-offset second-order sigma-delta ADC that combines chopping and correlated double sampling.

For such devices, data transmission is a very energy-consuming operation. It thus becomes essential to the lifetime of a WSN to minimize the number of bits sent by each device. One well-known approach is to aggregate sensor data (e.g., by adding) along the path from sensors to the sink. Aggregation becomes especially challenging if end-to-end privacy between sensors and the sink is required. In this paper, we propose a simple and provably secure additively homomorphic stream cipher that allows efficient aggregation of encrypted data. The new cipher only uses modular additions (with very small moduli) and is therefore very well suited for CPU-constrained devices. We show that aggregation based on this cipher can be used to efficiently compute statistical values such as mean, variance and standard deviation of sensed data, while achieving significant bandwidth gain.","","0-7695-2375-7","10.1109/MOBIQUITOUS.2005.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540992","","Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Computer networks;Privacy;Computer science;Data communication;Monitoring;Authentication;Ad hoc networks","","304","12","14","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MRINSPECT IV has been developed for the inspection of urban gas pipelines with a nominal 4-in inside diameter. The mechanism for steering with differential-drive wheels, arranged three-dimensionally, allows it to easily adapt to most of the existing configurations of pipelines, as well as providing excellent mobility during navigation. After carrying out analysis for fittings in pipelines, mathematical descriptions of their geometries are presented, which make it possible to estimate the movement patterns of the robot while passing through the fittings. Also, we propose a method of controlling the robot by modulating speeds of driving wheels that is applicable without sophisticated sensory information. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are performed, and supplementary considerations on the design of the in-pipe robot are discussed.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2004.838000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1391010","Branch;differential drive;elbow;in-pipe robot;steering mechanism","Pipelines;Mobile robots;Robot sensing systems;Inspection;Wheels;Control systems;Elbow;Navigation;Pattern analysis;Computational geometry","","304","1","47","IEEE","7 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The methods are tested on simulated data for which the classification ground truth is known. Different noise and intensity nonuniformities are added to simulate real imaging conditions. No enhancement of the image quality is considered either before or during the classification process. This way, the accuracy of the methods and their robustness against image artifacts are tested. Classification is also performed on real data where a quantitative validation compares the methods' results with an estimated ground truth from manual segmentations by experts. Validity of the various classification methods in the labeling of the image as well as in the tissue volume is estimated with different local and global measures. Results demonstrate that methods relying on both intensity and spatial information are more robust to noise and field inhomogeneities. We also demonstrate that partial volume is not perfectly modeled, even though methods that account for mixture classes outperform methods that only consider pure Gaussian classes.

The understanding of the mechanisms of delayed stall, molecular design of artificial muscles and the neural approaches to the actuation of control surfaces is reviewed in the context of devices based on the pectoral fins of fish, while remaining focused on their integrated implementation in biorobotic AUVs. A mechanistic understanding of the balance between cruising and maneuvering in swimming animals and undersea vehicles is given.

Cache sharing impacts threads nonuniformly, where some threads may be slowed down significantly, while others are not. This may cause severe performance problems such as sub-optimal throughput, cache thrashing, and thread starvation for threads that fail to occupy sufficient cache space to make good progress. Unfortunately, there is no existing model that allows extensive investigation of the impact of cache sharing. To allow such a study, we propose three performance models that predict the impact of cache sharing on co-scheduled threads. The input to our models is the isolated L2 cache stack distance or circular sequence profile of each thread, which can be easily obtained on-line or off-line. The output of the models is the number of extra L2 cache misses for each thread due to cache sharing. The models differ by their complexity and prediction accuracy. We validate the models against a cycle-accurate simulation that implements a dual-core CMP architecture, on fourteen pairs of mostly SPEC benchmarks. The most accurate model, the inductive probability model, achieves an average error of only 3.9%. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness and practicality of the model, a case study that details the relationship between an application's temporal reuse behavior and its cache sharing impact is presented.","2378-203X","0-7695-2275-0","10.1109/HPCA.2005.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385956","","Yarn;Predictive models;Computer architecture;Throughput;Accuracy;Hardware;Career development;Bars;Art;Analytical models","","300","4","26","IEEE","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There have been extensive recent research efforts on how to design protocols and algorithms to prolong network lifetime. However, due to energy constraint, even under the most efficient protocols and algorithms, the network lifetime may still be unable to meet the mission's requirements. In this paper, we consider the energy provisioning (EP) problem for a two-tiered wireless sensor network. In addition to provisioning additional energy on the existing nodes, we also consider deploying relay nodes (RNs) into the network to mitigate network geometric deficiencies and prolong network lifetime. We formulate the joint problem of EP and RN placement (EP-RNP) into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Since an MINLP problem is NP-hard in general, and even state-of-the-art software and techniques are unable to offer satisfactory solutions, we develop a heuristic algorithm, called Smart Pairing and INtelligent Disc Search (SPINDS), to address this problem. We show a number of novel algorithmic design techniques in the design of SPINDS that effectively transform a complex MINLP problem into a linear programming (LP) problem without losing critical points in its search space. Through numerical results, we show that SPINDS offers a very attractive solution and some important insights to the EP-RNP problem.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2005.853969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532241","Energy provisioning;flow routing;network lifetime;power control;relay node placement;wireless sensor networks","Relays;Wireless sensor networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Routing;Protocols;Power control;Senior members;Batteries;Heuristic algorithms;Software algorithms","","299","","26","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Above the base speed corresponding to the high wind speed region, the current- and voltage-limited maximum output control is applied, where the current vector is optimally controlled so that the output may become the maximum in consideration of the constraints of current and voltage.

We formulate this problem as one of minimizing the closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to constraints on the controller structure. We define the notion of quadratic invariance of a constraint set with respect to a system, and show that if the constraint set has this property, then the constrained minimum-norm problem may be solved via convex programming. We also show that quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the constraint set to be preserved under feedback. These results are developed in a very general framework, and are shown to hold in both continuous and discrete time, for both stable and unstable systems, and for any norm. This notion unifies many previous results identifying specific tractable decentralized control problems, and delineates the largest known class of convex problems in decentralized control. As an example, we show that optimal stabilizing controllers may be efficiently computed in the case where distributed controllers can communicate faster than their dynamics propagate. We also show that symmetric synthesis is included in this classification, and provide a test for sparsity constraints to be quadratically invariant, and thus amenable to convex synthesis.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2005.860365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556730","Convex optimization;decentralized control;delayed control;extended linear spaces;networked control","Distributed control;Optimal control;Control systems;Feedback;Automatic control;Network synthesis;Control system synthesis;Space vehicles;Quadratic programming;Distributed computing","","297","","31","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automated recognition of gait changes has many advantages including, early identification of at-risk gait and monitoring the progress of treatment outcomes. In this paper, we apply an artificial intelligence technique [support vector machines (SVM)] for the automatic recognition of young-old gait types from their respective gait-patterns. Minimum foot clearance (MFC) data of 30 young and 28 elderly participants were analyzed using a PEAK-2D motion analysis system during a 20-min continuous walk on a treadmill at self-selected walking speed. Gait features extracted from individual MFC histogram-plot and Poincare/spl acute/-plot images were used to train the SVM. Cross-validation test results indicate that the generalization performance of the SVM was on average 83.3% (/spl plusmn/2.9) to recognize young and elderly gait patterns, compared to a neural network's accuracy of 75.0/spl plusmn/5.0. A ""hill-climbing"" feature selection algorithm demonstrated that a small subset (3-5) of gait features extracted from MFC plots could differentiate the gait patterns with 90% accuracy. Performance of the gait classifier was evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic plots. Improved performance of the classifier was evident when trained with reduced number of selected good features and with radial basis function kernel. These results suggest that SVMs can function as an efficient gait classifier for recognition of young and elderly gait patterns, and has the potential for wider applications in gait identification for falls-risk minimization in the elderly.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.845241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420704","Feature selection;gait analysis;histogram;minimum foot clearance;PoincarÉ plot;support vector machines","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Senior citizens;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Aging;Automatic control;Computerized monitoring;Artificial intelligence;Foot","Adult;Aged;Aging;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Female;Foot;Gait;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","296","1","34","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a frequency-domain approach to characterize and model the statistical variation of power-line noise. The model considers both the background noise and the impulsive noise. The background noise model is based on statistical analysis of the results from two long-term measurements of noise spectrum conducted at two separate sites of a laboratory and a residential apartment. On the other hand, the impulsive noise model is obtained by direct measurements from the noise sources (i.e., various electrical household appliances). The amount of impulse noise reaching a power-line communications (PLC) receiver can then be determined with consideration of the channel transfer characteristics between the noise sources and the PLC receiver. Using these noise models, the performance of two major classes of digital modulation schemes, namely single-carrier modulation and multicarrier modulation, are analyzed and compared. It is found that the multicarrier scheme performs better than the single-carrier scheme when subjected to the observed power-line noise with non-Gaussian statistics.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2005.844349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413296","Noise modeling;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM);performance study;power-line communications","Broadband communication;Background noise;Digital modulation;Noise measurement;Programmable control;Frequency domain analysis;Statistical analysis;Laboratories;Electric variables measurement;Home appliances","","294","1","26","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective of these signal-processing techniques is to form a spatial image of scattered microwave energy, and to identify the presence and location of malignant lesions from their scattering signatures. Next, we present numerical studies based on finite-difference time-domain simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of MIST beamforming for detecting small malignant breast lesions in both prone and supine configurations.

The methods are applicable to general nonlinear and non-Gaussian models for the target dynamics and measurement likelihood. We provide efficient solutions to two very pertinent problems: the data association problem that arises due to unlabelled measurements in the presence of clutter, and the curse of dimensionality that arises due to the increased size of the state-space associated with multiple targets. We develop a number of algorithms to achieve this. The first, which we refer to as the Monte Carlo joint probabilistic data association filter (MC-JPDAF), is a generalisation of the strategy proposed by Schulz et al. (2001) and Schulz et al. (2003). As is the case for the JPDAF, the distributions of interest are the marginal filtering distributions for each of the targets, but these are approximated with particles rather than Gaussians. We also develop two extensions to the standard particle filtering methodology for tracking multiple targets. The first, which we refer to as the sequential sampling particle filter (SSPF), samples the individual targets sequentially by utilising a factorisation of the importance weights. The second, which we refer to as the independent partition particle filter (IPPF), assumes the associations to be independent over the individual targets, leading to an efficient component-wise sampling strategy to construct new particles. We evaluate and compare the proposed methods on a challenging synthetic tracking problem.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2005.1413764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413764","","Monte Carlo methods;Filtering;Target tracking;Sampling methods;Particle filters;Size measurement;Gaussian approximation;Gaussian distribution;Standards development;Particle tracking","","294","6","47","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The core of the system is an array of 32 /spl times/ 32 rangefinding pixels that independently measure the time-of-flight of a ray of light as it is reflected back from the objects in a scene. A single cone of pulsed laser light illuminates the scene, thus no complex mechanical scanning or expensive optical equipment are needed. Millimetric depth accuracies can be reached thanks to the rangefinder's optical detectors that enable picosecond time discrimination. The detectors, based on a single photon avalanche diode operating in Geiger mode, utilize avalanche multiplication to enhance light detection. On-pixel high-speed electrical amplification can therefore be eliminated, thus greatly simplifying the array and potentially reducing its power dissipation. Optical power requirements on the light source can also be significantly relaxed, due to the array's sensitivity to single photon events. A number of standard performance measurements, conducted on the imager, are discussed in the paper. The 3-D imaging system was also tested on real 3-D subjects, including human facial models, demonstrating the suitability of the approach.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2005.848173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1501983","CMOS avalanche photodiodes;highly sensitive photodetectors;LIDAR;photon timing;rangefinder;single photon detectors;SPAD arrays;time-correlated measurements;3-D image sensor;3-D vision","CMOS image sensors;Image sensors;Optoelectronic and photonic sensors;Diodes;Optical arrays;Optical imaging;Layout;High speed optical techniques;Stimulated emission;Optical sensors","","294","76","14","IEEE","29 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nodes in such networks operate under limited computational, communication and energy resources. These constraints naturally give rise to ""gossip"" algorithms: schemes which distribute the computational burden and in which a node communicates with a randomly chosen neighbor. We analyze the averaging problem under the gossip constraint for arbitrary network, and find that the averaging time of a gossip algorithm depends on the second largest eigenvalue of a doubly stochastic matrix characterizing the algorithm. Using recent results of Boyd, Diaconis and Xiao (2003), we show that minimizing this quantity to design the fastest averaging algorithm on the network is a semi-definite program (SDP). In general, SDPs cannot be solved distributedly; however, exploiting problem structure, we propose a subgradient method that distributedly solves the optimization problem over the network. The relation of averaging time to the second largest eigenvalue naturally relates it to the mixing time of a random walk with transition probabilities that are derived from the gossip algorithm. We use this connection to study the performance of gossip algorithm on two popular networks: wireless sensor networks, which are modeled as geometric random graphs, and the Internet graph under the so-called preferential connectivity model.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498447","","Algorithm design and analysis;Peer to peer computing;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Solid modeling;Ad hoc networks;Energy resources;Stochastic processes;Optimization methods","","294","2","41","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When a PV power system is constructed with a number of small power systems, the total system cost will increase and will be a matter of concern. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes a PV system that uses no expensive dc current sensor but utilizes the method of estimating the PV current from the PV voltage. The paper shows that the application of this novel sensorless current flyback inverter to an MPPT-operated PV system exhibits satisfactory MPPT performance similar to the one exhibited by the system with a dc current sensor as well.

In doing so, Polygraph leverages our insight that for a real-world exploit to function properly, multiple invariant substrings must often be present in all variants of a payload; these substrings typically correspond to protocol framing, return addresses, and in some cases, poorly obfuscated code. We contribute a definition of the polymorphic signature generation problem; propose classes of signature suited for matching polymorphic worm payloads; and present algorithms for automatic generation of signatures in these classes.

Mechanical testing showed that these microneedles were sufficiently strong to pierce living skin without breaking. Arrays containing 16 microneedles measuring 500 /spl mu/m in length with a 75 /spl mu/m tip diameter were then inserted into the skin of anesthetized, diabetic, hairless rats. Insulin delivery through microneedles caused blood glucose levels to drop steadily to 47% of pretreatment values over a 4-h insulin delivery period and were then approximately constant over a 4-h postdelivery monitoring period.

These mechanisms use derivative action in processing opponent actions and, in some cases, can lead to behavior converging to Nash equilibria in previously nonconvergent situations. We analyze convergence in the case of exact and approximate derivative measurements of the dynamic update mechanisms.

"Advances in Scalable Video Coding","J. . -R. Ohm","Institute of Communications Engineering, RWTH Aachen University of Technology, Aachen, Germany",Proceedings of the IEEE,"27 Jun 2005","2005","93","1","42","56","Scalable video coding is attractive due to the capability of reconstructing lower resolution or lower quality signals from partial bit streams. This allows for simple solutions in adaptation to network and terminal capabilities. Different modalities of scalability are specified by video coding standards like MPEG-2 and MPEG-4. This paper gives a short overview over these techniques and analyzes in more detail the encoder/decoder drift problem, which is the major reason why scalable coding has been significantly less efficient than single-layer coding in most of these implementations. Only recently, new scalable video coding technology has evolved, which seems to close the gap of compression performance compared to state of the art single-layer video coding. New methods of efficient enhancement layer prediction were developed to improve traditional (motion-compensated hybrid) scalable coders, providing more flexible compromises on the drift problem. As a new technology trend, motion-compensated spatiotemporal wavelet coding has matured which entirely discards the drift and allows most flexible combinations of spatial, temporal, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scalability with fine granularity over a broad range of data rates.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2004.839611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369697","Motion compensation;motion picture encoding;scalability;wavelet transforms","Video coding;Scalability;Decoding;Signal resolution;Streaming media;MPEG 4 Standard;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Signal to noise ratio;Motion pictures;Bandwidth","","289","74","42","IEEE","27 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However this must be done in the context of the energy constraints imposed by the network. In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of two node scheduling regimes within MERLIN (MAC energy efficient, routing and localization integrated), an energy-efficient low-latency integrated protocol for WSNs. In particular we contrast the X and V scheduling family schemes with respect to the following properties: network setup time, network lifetime and message latency.

Each sensor collects one noise-corrupted sample, performs a local estimation, and transmits a message to the fusion center, while the latter combines the received messages to produce a final estimate. This correspondence investigates optimal local estimation and final fusion schemes under the constraint that the communication from each sensor to the fusion center must be a one-bit message. Such a binary message constraint is well motivated by the bandwidth limitation of the communication links, fusion center, and by the limited power budget of local sensors. In the absence of bandwidth constraint and assuming the noises are bounded to the interval [-U,U], additive, independent, but otherwise unknown, the classical estimation theory suggests that a total of O(U2/epsi2) sensors are necessary and sufficient in order for the sensors and the fusion center to jointly estimate the unknown parameter within epsi root mean squared error (MSE). It is shown in this correspondence that the same remains true even with the binary message constraint. Furthermore, the optimal decentralized estimation scheme suggests allocating 1/2 of the sensors to estimate the first bit of the unknown parameter, 1/4 of the sensors to estimate the second bit, and so on","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.847692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435664","Decentralized estimation;distributed signal processing;sensor network","Intelligent networks;Bandwidth;Sensor fusion;Geometry;Parameter estimation;Wireless sensor networks;Galois fields;Constraint theory;Additive noise;Estimation theory","","289","","23","IEEE","31 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Arbitrary input distributions and flat fading are considered. A generic multiuser detector in the form of the posterior mean estimator is applied before single-user decoding. The generic detector can be particularized to the matched filter, decorrelator, linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector, the jointly or the individually optimal detector, and others. It is found that the detection output for each user, although in general asymptotically non-Gaussian conditioned on the transmitted symbol, converges as the number of users go to infinity to a deterministic function of a ""hidden"" Gaussian statistic independent of the interferers. Thus, the multiuser channel can be decoupled: Each user experiences an equivalent single-user Gaussian channel, whose signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) suffers a degradation due to the multiple-access interference (MAI). The uncoded error performance (e.g., symbol error rate) and the mutual information can then be fully characterized using the degradation factor, also known as the multiuser efficiency, which can be obtained by solving a pair of coupled fixed-point equations identified in this paper. Based on a general linear vector channel model, the results are also applicable to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels such as in multiantenna systems.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.847700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435646","Channel capacity;code-division multiple access (CDMA);free energy;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel;multiuser detection;multiuser efficiency;replica method;statistical mechanics","Multiaccess communication;Physics;Detectors;Degradation;Multiple access interference;MIMO;Multiuser detection;Fading;Decoding;Matched filters","","288","","20","IEEE","31 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This statistic is relevant to a scenario appearing in adaptive array processing, in which there are auxiliary, signal-free, training-data vectors that can be used to form a sample covariance estimate for clutter and interference suppression. The result is based on earlier work by Bose and Steinhardt, who found a two-dimensional (2-D) maximal invariant when test and training data share the same noise covariance. Their 2-D maximal invariant is given by Kelly's Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) statistic and the Adaptive Matched Filter (AMF). We extend the maximal-invariant framework to the problem for which the ACE is a GLRT: The test data shares the same covariance structure as the training data, but the relative power level is not constrained. In this case, the maximal invariant statistic collapses to a one-dimensional (1-D) scalar, which is also the ACE statistic. Furthermore, we show that the probability density function for the ACE possesses the property of ""total positivity,"" which establishes that it has monotone likelihood ratio. Thus, a threshold test on the ACE is UMP-invariant. This means that it has a claim to optimality, having the largest detection probability out of the class of detectors that are also invariant to affine transformations on the data matrix that leave the hypotheses unchanged. This requires an additional invariance not imposed by Bose and Steinhardt: invariance to relative scaling of test and training data. The ACE is invariant and has a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) with respect to such scaling, whereas Kelly's GLRT and the AMF are invariant, and CFAR, only with respect to common scaling.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2004.840823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381736","Adaptive detection;adaptive coherence estimator;adaptive radar and sonar;adaptive array processing;constant false alarm rate;invariant detection;sample covariance;uniformly most powerful invariant","Statistics;Testing;Training data;Coherence;Array signal processing;Signal processing;Clutter;Interference suppression;Two dimensional displays;Statistical analysis","","288","","27","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Does independent component analysis play a role in unmixing hyperspectral data?","J. M. P. Nascimento; J. M. B.

ICA is founded on two assumptions: 1) the observed spectrum vector is a linear mixture of the constituent spectra (endmember spectra) weighted by the correspondent abundance fractions (sources); 2)sources are statistically independent. Independent factor analysis (IFA) extends ICA to linear mixtures of independent sources immersed in noise. Concerning hyperspectral data, the first assumption is valid whenever the multiple scattering among the distinct constituent substances (endmembers) is negligible, and the surface is partitioned according to the fractional abundances. The second assumption, however, is violated, since the sum of abundance fractions associated to each pixel is constant due to physical constraints in the data acquisition process. Thus, sources cannot be statistically independent, this compromising the performance of ICA/IFA algorithms in hyperspectral unmixing. This paper studies the impact of hyperspectral source statistical dependence on ICA and IFA performances. We conclude that the accuracy of these methods tends to improve with the increase of the signature variability, of the number of endmembers, and of the signal-to-noise ratio. In any case, there are always endmembers incorrectly unmixed. We arrive to this conclusion by minimizing the mutual information of simulated and real hyperspectral mixtures. The computation of mutual information is based on fitting mixtures of Gaussians to the observed data. A method to sort ICA and IFA estimates in terms of the likelihood of being correctly unmixed is proposed.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.839806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381633","Independent component analysis (ICA);independent factor analysis (IFA);mixture of Gaussians;unmixing hyperspectral data","Independent component analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Mutual information;Vectors;1f noise;Scattering;Data acquisition;Partitioning algorithms;Signal to noise ratio;Computational modeling","","287","1","70","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model enables the magnetic field distribution in the air gap and magnet regions to be determined, by neglecting the eddy-current redistribution effect and assuming that the eddy currents are resistance limited. It can account for space-harmonic magnetomotive forces (MMFs) resulting from the winding distribution and time-harmonic MMFs due to nonsinusoidal phase currents, as well as for the effect of curvature and circumferential segmentation of the magnets. We have validated the model by finite-element analysis, and used it to investigate the eddy-current loss in the magnets of three surface-mounted magnet brushless motors that have similar slot and pole numbers, and employ identical rotors but different stators, when they are operated in brushless ac (BLAC) and dc (BLDC) modes.

New asymmetric and hybrid solutions, using different voltages and devices in various parts of the inverter, promise significant improvements for medium-voltage industrial drives. This paper investigates such a hybrid asymmetric nine-level inverter. It consists of a three-phase three-level integrated gate-commutated thyristor inverter (main inverter), with a two-level insulated-gate bipolar transistor H-bridge (subinverter) in series with each phase. To keep the power part simple and the efficiency high, the subinverters have no feeding from the net and can only supply reactive power. This is a very interesting solution in terms of power quality, efficiency, reliability, and cost. But the nonsupplied intermediate-circuit capacitors form an unstable system. This paper proposes a control method to stabilize their voltages. Power balancing is guaranteed by varying the common-mode voltage, using an online nonlinear model-predictive controller. The controller predicts the system evolution as a function of the control inputs. A cost function of system and control quantities is iteratively minimized in real time, to find the optimal control to apply to the system. Simulations and measurements demonstrate stable behavior in steady state and during transients. Precharging of the nonsupplied capacitors is also an issue to consider. This paper proposes a startup method that charges them in parallel with the supplied ones, without any additional equipment. Measurements show its successful application in the proposed drive system.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2005.844382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413535","Converters;motor drives;multilevel systems;optimal control;power electronics;predictive control","Inverters;Medium voltage;Industrial control;Control systems;Capacitors;Voltage control;Optimal control;Thyristors;Insulation;Insulated gate bipolar transistors","","285","5","30","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article we develop a network selection scheme for an integrated cellular/wireless LAN system. The design goal is to provide the user the best available QoS at any time. The proposed scheme comprises two parts, with the first applying an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to decide the relative weights of evaluative criteria set according to user preferences and service applications, while the second adopts grey relational analysis (GRA) to rank the network alternatives with faster and simpler implementation than AHP.

In this paper, a novel method for scalable information dissemination in highly mobile ad hoc networks is proposed: segment-oriented data abstraction and dissemination (SODAD). With SODAD, information can be distributed in an information range multiple orders of magnitude larger than the transmission range of the air interface, even if only 1%-3% of all vehicles are equipped with an IVC system, e.g., during market introduction. By restricting the method to the dissemination of map/position-based data, scalability is achieved. In the second half of this paper, an example application for the SODAD method is presented: a self-organizing traffic-information system (SOTIS). In SOTIS, a car is equipped with a satellite navigation receiver, an IVC system, and a digital map. Each individual vehicle collects traffic information for its local area. Using the digital map, the traffic information is analyzed based on road segments. By distributing the information in the ad hoc intervehicle network using the SODAD method, a decentralized traffic information system is created. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using network simulation with vehicular mobility models. Simulation results for typical scenarios are presented. Furthermore, a prototype implementation based on commercially available standard hardware demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2004.842407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402433","Car-to-car communication (C2CC);data dissemination;intervehicle communication (IVC);traffic-information system;vehicular","Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Vehicles;Mobile communication;Manufacturing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Scalability;Satellite navigation systems;Information analysis;Roads","","283","7","14","IEEE","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The demosaicking of the color samples is critical to the image quality. This paper presents a new color demosaicking technique of optimal directional filtering of the green-red and green-blue difference signals. Under the assumption that the primary difference signals (PDS) between the green and red/blue channels are low pass, the missing green samples are adaptively estimated in both horizontal and vertical directions by the linear minimum mean square-error estimation (LMMSE) technique. These directional estimates are then optimally fused to further improve the green estimates. Finally, guided by the demosaicked full-resolution green channel, the other two color channels are reconstructed from the LMMSE filtered and fused PDS. The experimental results show that the presented color demosaicking technique outperforms the existing methods both in PSNR measure and visual perception.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.857260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532316","Color demosaicking;Bayer color filter array (CFA);directional filtering;linear minimum mean square-error estimation (LMMSE)","Interpolation;Filtering;Color;Image reconstruction;Nonlinear filters;Cameras;Layout;Image quality;PSNR;Visual perception","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Color;Colorimetry;Computer Graphics;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Least-Squares Analysis;Linear Models;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","283","3","21","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Much of this work is targeted at finding a feasible route from a source to a destination without considering current network traffic or application requirements. Therefore, the network may easily become overloaded with too much traffic and the application has no way to improve its performance under a given network traffic condition. While this may be acceptable for data transfer, many real-time applications require quality-of-service (QoS) support from the network. We believe that such QoS support can be achieved by either finding a route to satisfy the application requirements or offering network feedback to the application when the requirements cannot be met. We propose a QoS-aware routing protocol that incorporates an admission control scheme and a feedback scheme to meet the QoS requirements of real-time applications. The novel part of this QoS-aware routing protocol is the use of the approximate bandwidth estimation to react to network traffic. Our approach implements these schemes by using two bandwidth estimation methods to find the residual bandwidth available at each node to support new streams. We simulate our QoS-aware routing protocol for nodes running the IEEE 802.11 medium access control. Results of our experiments show that the packet delivery ratio increases greatly, and packet delay and energy dissipation decrease significantly, while the overall end-to-end throughput is not impacted, compared with routing protocols that do not provide QoS support.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2004.842560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402584","Bandwidth estimation;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);quality-of-service (QoS)-aware routing","Bandwidth;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Feedback;Quality of service;Admission control;Communication system traffic control;Traffic control;Media Access Protocol","","282","7","24","IEEE","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, a refinement procedure reduces misclassifications and improves parameter estimates. The third stage determines a polyhedral partition of the regressor set via two-class or multiclass linear separation techniques. As a main feature, the algorithm imposes that the identification error is bounded by a quantity /spl delta/. Such a bound is a useful tuning parameter to trade off between quality of fit and model complexity.

However, experience shows some projects overspending considerably. Recently, systemic modeling research into the behavior of large projects explains project oversponds by ""systemic"" effects and the (sometimes counterintuitive) effect of management actions. However, while this work is becoming more widely known, embedding the lessons in project-management practice is not straightforward. The current prescriptive dominant discourse of project management contains implicit underlying assumptions with which the systemic modeling work clashes, indeed showing how conventional methods can exacerbate rather than alleviate project problems. Exploration of this modeling suggests that for projects that are complex, uncertain, and time-limited, conventional methods might be inappropriate, and aspects of newer methodologies in which the project ""emerges"" rather than being fully preplanned might be more appropriate. Some of the current literature on project-classification schemes also suggests similar parameters, without the rationale that the systemic modeling provides, thus providing useful backup to this analysis. The eventual aim of this line of work is to enable project managers to choose effective ways to manage projects based on understanding and model-based theory.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2005.856572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1522702","Project failures;project management theory;systemic modeling","Project management","","281","","117","IEEE","24 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using both color information and a classifier trained to recognize gray-scale patterns, given the lighting direction, each image derivative is classified as being caused by shading or a change in the surface's reflectance. The classifiers gather local evidence about the surface's form and color, which is then propagated using the generalized belief propagation algorithm.

We describe the use of a self-policing mechanism based on reputation to enable mobile ad hoc networks to keep functioning despite the presence of misbehaving nodes. The reputation system in all nodes makes them detect misbehavior locally by observation and use of second-hand information. Once a misbehaving node is detected it is automatically isolated from the network. We classify the features of such reputation systems and describe possible implementations of each of them. We explain in particular how it is possible to use second-hand information while mitigating contamination by spurious ratings.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2005.1470831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1470831","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Monitoring;Protocols;Information analysis;Contamination;Fabrication;Timing;Testing;Receiving antennas","","280","9","12","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The GBM speed of growth depends on the invaded tissue: faster in white than in gray matter, it is stopped by the dura or the ventricles. These different structures are introduced into the model using an atlas matching technique. The atlas includes both the segmentations of anatomical structures and diffusion information in white matter fibers. We use the finite element method (FEM) to simulate the invasion of the GBM in the brain parenchyma and its mechanical interaction with the invaded structures (mass effect). Depending on the considered tissue, the former effect is modeled with a reaction-diffusion or a Gompertz equation, while the latter is based on a linear elastic brain constitutive equation. In addition, we propose a new coupling equation taking into account the mechanical influence of the tumor cells on the invaded tissues. The tumor growth simulation is assessed by comparing the in-silico GBM growth with the real growth observed on two magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of a patient acquired with 6 mo difference. Results show the feasibility of this new conceptual approach and justifies its further evaluation.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2005.857217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514552","Brain;DTI;growth;model;simulation;tumor","Brain modeling;Deformable models;Neoplasms;Equations;Medical treatment;Tumors;Magnetic resonance;Hospitals;Inverse problems;Diffusion bonding","Algorithms;Biomechanics;Brain Neoplasms;Brain Neoplasms;Computer Simulation;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Elasticity;Glioblastoma;Glioblastoma;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Neoplasm Invasiveness;Neoplasm Invasiveness;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","279","5","46","IEEE","3 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During utility grid voltage unbalance, the four-phase-leg compensator can compensate for all the unwanted positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence voltage-current components found within the unbalanced utility. Specifically, the shunt four-leg inverter is controlled to ensure balanced voltages within the microgrid and to regulate power sharing among the parallel-connected DG systems. The series inverter is controlled complementarily to inject negative- and zero-sequence voltages in series to balance the line currents, while generating zero real and reactive power. During utility voltage sags, the series inverter can also be controlled using a newly proposed flux-charge current-limiting algorithm to limit the flow of large fault currents between the micro- and utility grids.

This paper proposes a novel extension of histogram equalization, actually histogram specification, to overcome such drawback as HE. To maximize the entropy is the essential idea of HE to make the histogram as flat as possible. Following that, the essence of the proposed algorithm, named brightness preserving histogram equalization with maximum entropy (BPHEME), tries to find, by the variational approach, the target histogram that maximizes the entropy, under the constraints that the mean brightness is fixed, then transforms the original histogram to that target one using histogram specification. Comparing to the existing methods including HE, brightness preserving bi-histogram equalization (BBHE), equal area dualistic sub-image histogram equalization (DSIHE), and minimum mean brightness error bi-histogram equalization (MMBEBHE), experimental results show that BPHEME can not only enhance the image effectively, but also preserve the original brightness quite well, so that it is possible to be utilized in consumer electronic products.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2005.1561863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561863","","Brightness;Histograms;Entropy;Consumer electronics;Signal processing;Information science;Chaos;Signal processing algorithms;Statistical distributions","","278","2","10","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The redesign of the quantization scheme in H.264/AVC results in that the relationship between the quantization parameter and the true quantization stepsize is no longer linear. Based on this observation, we propose a new rate-distortion (R-D) model by utilizing the true quantization stepsize and then develop an improved rate-control scheme for the H.264/AVC encoder based on this new R-D model. In general, the current R-D optimization (RDO) mode-selection scheme in H.264/AVC test model is difficult for rate control, because rate control usually requires a predetermined set of motion vectors and coding modes to select the quantization parameter, whereas the RDO does in the different order and requires a predetermined quantization parameter to select motion vectors and coding modes. To tackle this problem, we develop a complexity-adjustable rate-control scheme based on the proposed R-D model. Briefly, the proposed scheme is a one-pass process at frame level and a partial two-pass process at macroblock level. Since the number of macroblocks with the two-pass processing can be controlled by an encoder parameter, the fully one-pass implementation is a subset of the proposed algorithm. An additional topic discussed in this paper is about video buffering. Since a hypothetical reference decoder (HRD) has been defined in H.264/AVC to guarantee that the buffers never overflow or underflow, the more accurate rate-allocation schemes are proposed to satisfy these requirements of HRD.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2005.857300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1546001","H.264/AVC;hypothetical reference decoder (HRD);rate control;rate-distortion optimization (RDO);video coding","Rate-distortion;Automatic voltage control;Video coding;Quantization;Decoding;Video compression;Motion control;Encoding;Testing;Process control","","277","14","28","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control.

Although many privacy-related issues can be addressed by security mechanisms, one sensor network privacy issue that cannot be adequately addressed by network security is source-location privacy. Adversaries may use RF localization techniques to perform hop-by-hop traceback to the source sensor’s location. This paper provides a formal model for the source-location privacy problem in sensor networks and examines the privacy characteristics of different sensor routing protocols. We examine two popular classes of routing protocols: the class of flooding protocols, and the class of routing protocols involving only a single path from the source to the sink. While investigating the privacy performance of routing protocols, we considered the tradeoffs between location-privacy and energy consumption. We found that most of the current protocols cannot provide efficient source-location privacy while maintaining desirable system performance. In order to provide efficient and private sensor communications, we devised new techniques to enhance source-location privacy that augment these routing protocols. One of our strategies, a technique we have called phantom routing, has proven flexible and capable of protecting the source’s location, while not incurring a noticeable increase in energy overhead. Further, we examined the effect of source mobility on location privacy. We showed that, even with the natural privacy amplification resulting from source mobility, our phantom routing techniques yield improved source-location privacy relative to other routing methods.","1063-6927","0-7695-2331-5","10.1109/ICDCS.2005.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437121","","Privacy;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Imaging phantoms;Sensor systems;Radio frequency;Floods;Energy consumption;System performance;Protection","","276","","25","IEEE","20 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A robot suit HAL (hybrid assistive limb) has been developed as an assistive device for lower limbs. Human can appropriately produce muscle contraction torque and control joint viscoelasticity by muscle effort such as co-contraction. Thus, to implement functions equivalent to human muscles using HAL, it is necessary to control viscoelasticity of HAL as well as to produce torque in accordance with operator's intention. Therefore the purpose of this study is to propose a control method of HAL using biological and motion information. In this method, HAL produces torque corresponding to muscle contraction torque by referring to the myoelectricity that is biological information to control operator's muscles. In addition, the viscoelasticities of HAL are adjusted in proportion to operator's viscoelasticity that is estimated from motion information by using an on-line parameter identification method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the method was applied to a swinging motion of a lower leg. When this method was applied, HAL could work like operator's muscles in the swinging motion, and as a consequence, the muscle activities of the operator were reduced. As a result of this experiment, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2153-0866","0-7803-8912-3","10.1109/IROS.2005.1545505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1545505","robot suit;viscoelastic properties;impedance control;on-line parameter identification;myoelectricity","Robot control;Biological control systems;Muscles;Viscosity;Elasticity;Humans;Torque control;Motion control;Motion estimation;Parameter estimation","","276","","11","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To satisfy their measurement objectives, many spaceborne passive sensors must operate in unprotected bands, and future sensors may also need to operate in unprotected bands. Data from these sensors are likely to be increasingly contaminated by RFI as the spectrum becomes more crowded. In a previous paper we reported on a preliminary investigation of RFI observed over the United States in the 6.9-GHz channels of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on the Earth Observing System Aqua satellite. Here, we extend the analysis to an investigation of RFI in the 6.9- and 10.7-GHz AMSR-E channels over the global land domain and for a one-year observation period. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the RFI are examined by the use of spectral indices. The observed RFI at 6.9 GHz is most densely concentrated in the United States, Japan, and the Middle East, and is sparser in Europe, while at 10.7 GHz the RFI is concentrated mostly in England, Italy, and Japan. Classification of RFI using means and standard deviations of the spectral indices is effective in identifying strong RFI. In many cases, however, it is difficult, using these indices, to distinguish weak RFI from natural geophysical variability. Geophysical retrievals using RFI-filtered data may therefore contain residual errors due to weak RFI. More robust radiometer designs and continued efforts to protect spectrum allocations will be needed in future to ensure the viability of spaceborne passive microwave sensing.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.837507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424270","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR);microwave radiometry;microwave remote sensing;radio-frequency interference (RFI)","Statistics;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency interference;Microwave radiometry;Geophysical measurements;Pollution measurement;Earth Observing System;Satellite broadcasting;Europe;Information retrieval","","276","","13","IEEE","25 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our scheme decomposes a MIMO channel into multiple identical parallel subchannels, which can make it rather convenient to design modulation/demodulation and coding/decoding schemes. Moreover, we prove that our scheme is asymptotically optimal for (moderately) high SNR in terms of both channel throughput and bit error rate (BER) performance. This desirable property is not shared by any other conventional schemes. We also consider the subchannel selection issues when some of the subchannels are too poor to be useful.

To this end, we introduce the switching hidden semi-markov model (S-HSMM), a two-layered extension of the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) for the modeling task. Activities are modeled in the S-HSMM in two ways: the bottom layer represents atomic activities and their duration using HSMMs; the top layer represents a sequence of high-level activities where each high-level activity is made of a sequence of atomic activities. We consider two methods for modeling duration: the classic explicit duration model using multinomial distribution, and the novel use of the discrete Coxian distribution. In addition, we propose an effective scheme to detect abnormality without the need for training on abnormal data. Experimental results show that the S-HSMM performs better than existing models including the flat HSMM and the hierarchical hidden Markov model in both classification and abnormality detection tasks, alleviating the need for presegmented training data. Furthermore, our discrete Coxian duration model yields better computation time and generalization error than the classic explicit duration model.","1063-6919","0-7695-2372-2","10.1109/CVPR.2005.61","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467354","","Hidden Markov models;Pervasive computing;Humans;Atomic layer deposition;Buildings;Artificial intelligence;Learning;Training data;Computational modeling;Aging","","274","7","23","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in some terrain orientations, SCS experiences an overcorrection problem similar to other simple photometric functions. To address this problem, we propose a new SCS+C correction that accounts for diffuse atmospheric irradiance based on the C-correction. A rigorous, comprehensive, and flexible method for independent validation based on canopy geometric optical reflectance models is also introduced as an improvement over previous validation approaches, and forms a secondary contribution of this paper. Results for a full range of slopes, aspects, and crown closures showed SCS+C provided improved corrections compared to the SCS and four other photometric approaches (cosine, C, Minnaert, statistical-empirical) for a Rocky Mountain forest setting in western Canada. It was concluded that SCS+C should be considered for topographic correction of remote sensing imagery in forested terrain.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.852480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1499030","Canopy reflectance model;forests;radiometric processing;Rocky Mountains;sun-canopy-sensor (SCS), SCS with C-correction (SCS+C);topographic correction","Photometry;Geometry;Lighting;Geometrical optics;Optical sensors;Optical variables control;Reflectivity;Atmospheric modeling;Solid modeling;Remote sensing","","274","","37","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fractional bandwidth design graphs are used to determine proper geometric parameters of each coupled stage when filter specification is given. Realizable fractional bandwidths of the two passbands for a coupled SIR structure are clearly depicted in fractional bandwidth design graphs.

Unfortunately, MR images always contain a significant amount of noise caused by operator performance, equipment, and the environment, which can lead to serious inaccuracies with segmentation. A robust segmentation technique based on an extension to the traditional fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. A neighborhood attraction, which is dependent on the relative location and features of neighboring pixels, is shown to improve the segmentation performance dramatically. The degree of attraction is optimized by a neural-network model. Simulated and real brain MR images with different noise levels are segmented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique compared to other FCM-based methods. This segmentation method is a key component of an MR image-based classification system for brain tumors, currently being developed.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2005.847500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1504816","Improved fuzzy c-means clustering (IFCM);magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);neighborhood attraction;segmentation","Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain;Image segmentation;Visualization;Humans;Clinical diagnosis;Magnetic resonance;Working environment noise;Magnetic noise;Noise robustness","Algorithms;Brain;Fuzzy Logic;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated","274","4","29","IEEE","6 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We give a new analytic perspective that justifies the use of total-variation regularization from a signal processing perspective, based on an analysis that specifies the requirements of edge-directed filtering. This approach leads to a new data fidelity term that has been coupled with a total-variation regularizer to yield our objective function. This objective function is minimized using a level-sets motion that is based on the level-set method, with two types of motion that interact simultaneously. A new choice of these motions leads to a stable solution scheme that has a unique minimum. One aspect of the human visual system, perceptual uniformity, is treated in accordance with the linear nature of the data fidelity term. The method was implemented and has been verified to provide improved results, yielding crisp edges without introducing ringing or other artifacts.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.851684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510697","Data fidelity;gamma correction;image up-sampling;interpolation;level-sets motion (LSM);observation model;regularization;total variation","Interpolation;Cameras;Lattices;Image sampling;Signal analysis;Filtering;Application software;Optical filters;Image resolution;Digital filters","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sample Size","273","5","54","IEEE","19 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is one modality using standard diagnostic ultrasound scanners to generate localized, impulsive, acoustic radiation forces in tissue. The dynamic response of tissue is measured via conventional ultrasonic speckle-tracking methods and provides information about the mechanical properties of tissue. A finite-element method (FEM) model has been developed that simulates the dynamic response of tissues, with and without spherical inclusions, to an impulsive acoustic radiation force excitation from a linear array transducer. These FEM models were validated with calibrated phantoms. Shear wave speed, and therefore elasticity, dictates tissue relaxation following ARFI excitation, but Poisson's ratio and density do not significantly alter tissue relaxation rates. Increased acoustic attenuation in tissue increases the relative amount of tissue displacement in the near field compared with the focal depth, but relaxation rates are not altered. Applications of this model include improving image quality, and distilling material and structural information from tissue's dynamic response to ARFI excitation. Future work on these models includes incorporation of viscous material properties and modeling the ultrasonic tracking of displaced scatterers.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561624","","Finite element methods;Biological tissues;Mechanical factors;Ultrasonic imaging;Acoustic imaging;Acoustic measurements;Mechanical variables measurement;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Acoustic arrays;Acoustic transducers","Acoustics;Algorithms;Animals;Computer Simulation;Connective Tissue;Connective Tissue;Elasticity;Finite Element Analysis;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Biological;Sonication;Stress, Mechanical;Ultrasonic Therapy;Ultrasonography;Viscosity","270","10","37","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous vision-based approaches have used only a few degrees of freedom for hand motion and have required hand motions that are unnatural for object manipulation tasks. This paper presents a noncontacting vision-based method of robot teleoperation that allows a human operator to communicate simultaneous six-degree-of-freedom motion tasks to a robot manipulator by having the operator perform the three-dimensional human hand-arm motion that would naturally be used to complete an object manipulation task. A vision-based human-robot interface is used for communication of human motion to the robot and for feedback of the robot motion and environment to the human operator. Teleoperation under operator position control was performed with high accuracy in object placement on a target. Semi-autonomous traded and shared control using robot-vision guidance aided in achieving a more accurate positioning and orientation of the end-effector for object gripping tasks.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2005.855696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512452","Human–robot interface;real time;robot manipulator;semi-autonomous control;teleoperation;traded and shared control;vision-based tracking","Robot vision systems;Humans;Manipulator dynamics;Robot control;Mechanical sensors;Shape control;Intelligent robots;Mechanical engineering;Design engineering;Systems engineering and theory","","270","8","13","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While most previous efforts in simulating wireless sensor networks have focused on protocol-level issues utilizing models of the software implementation, a significant challenge remains in precisely measuring time-dependent properties such as radio channel utilization. One promising approach, first demonstrated by ATEMU, is to simulate the behavior of sensor network programs at the machine code level with cycle-accuracy, but poor performance has so far limited its scalability. In this paper we present Avrora, a cycle-accurate instruction-level sensor network simulator which scales to networks of up to 10,000 nodes and performs as much as 20 times faster than previous simulators with equivalent accuracy, handling as many as 25 nodes in real-time. We show how an event queue can enable efficient instruction-level simulation of microcontroller programs and allow the hidden parallelism in finegrained sensor network simulations to be extracted, once two core synchronization problems are identified and solved. Avrora's ability to measure detailed time-critical phenomena can shed new light on design Issues for large-scale sensor networks.","","0-7803-9201-9","10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440978","","Timing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks;Operating systems;Sea measurements;Scalability;Discrete event simulation;Microcontrollers;Monitoring;Hardware","","270","","17","IEEE","13 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technique uses a cutting plotter traditionally used in the sign industry for cutting graphics in adhesive vinyl films. A cutting plotter with an addressable resolution of 10 /spl mu/m was used to cut microstructures in various films with thicknesses ranging from 25 to 1000 /spl mu/m. Positive features down to 35 /spl mu/m and negative features down to 18 /spl mu/m were cut in a 25 /spl mu/m thick material. Higher aspect ratios of 5.2 for positive features and 8 for negative features were possible in a 360 /spl mu/m thick material. A simple model correlating material properties to minimum feature size is introduced. Multilayered microstructures cut from pressure sensitive and thermal activated adhesive films were laminated in less than 30 min without photolithographic processes or chemicals. Potential applications of these microstructures are explored including: shadow masking, electroplating, micromolds for PDMS, and multilayered three-dimensional (3-D) channels.

Six visual features are selected to design a decoupled control scheme when the object is parallel to the image plane.

A linear rank-based approach is used to assign fitness values to the individuals. The solution with the least constraint violation is archived as the elite solution in the population. In the second phase, the simultaneous optimization of the objective function and the satisfaction of the constraints are treated as a biobjective optimization problem. We elaborate on how the constrained optimization problem requires a balance of exploration and exploitation under different problem scenarios and come to the conclusion that a nondominated ranking between the individuals will help the algorithm explore further, while the elitist scheme will facilitate in exploitation. We analyze the proposed algorithm under different problem scenarios using Test Case Generator-2 and demonstrate the proposed algorithm's capability to perform well independent of various problem characteristics.

A new hybrid style full adder circuit is also presented. The sum and carry generation circuits of the proposed full adder are designed with hybrid logic styles. To operate at ultra-low supply voltage, the pass logic circuit that cogenerates the intermediate XOR and XNOR outputs has been improved to overcome the switching delay problem. As full adders are frequently employed in a tree structured configuration for high-performance arithmetic circuits, a cascaded simulation structure is introduced to evaluate the full adders in a realistic application environment. A systematic and elegant procedure to scale the transistor for minimal power-delay product is proposed. The circuits being studied are optimized for energy efficiency at 0.18-/spl mu/m CMOS process technology. With the proposed simulation environment, it is shown that some survival cells in stand alone operation at low voltage may fail when cascaded in a larger circuit, either due to the lack of drivability or unsatisfactory speed of operation. The proposed hybrid full adder exhibits not only the full swing logic and balanced outputs but also strong output drivability. The increase in the transistor count of its complementary CMOS output stage is compensated by its area efficient layout. Therefore, it remains one of the best contenders for designing large tree structured arithmetic circuits with reduced energy consumption while keeping the increase in area to a minimum.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2005.848806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1458785","Adders;CMOS digital integrated circuits;digital arithmetic;logic devices","Adders;Arithmetic;CMOS logic circuits;Logic circuits;Circuit simulation;Hybrid power systems;Logic design;Voltage;Switching circuits;Delay","","266","1","22","IEEE","27 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The HMM-based approach is shown to be capable of higher classification accuracy than previous methods based upon multilayer perceptrons. The method does not require segmentation of the myoelectric signal data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. The computational complexity of the HMM in its operational mode is low, making it suitable for a real-time implementation. The low computational overhead associated with training the HMM also enables the possibility of adaptive classifier training while in use.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2004.836492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369595","Classification;electromyography;hidden Markov model;myoelectric signals;prostheses","Prosthetics;Hidden Markov models;Wrist;Signal processing;Pattern recognition;Nonhomogeneous media;Stochastic processes;Biomedical engineering;Biomedical electrodes;Extremities","Action Potentials;Algorithms;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electromyography;Humans;Markov Chains;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Muscle, Skeletal;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Prostheses and Implants;Prosthesis Design;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","265","1","9","IEEE","20 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, questions of where how many, and what types of heterogeneous resources to deploy remain largely unexplored. We focus on energy and link heterogeneity in ad hoc sensor networks and consider resource-aware MAC and routing protocols to utilize those resources. Using analysis, simulation, and real testbed measurements, we evaluate the impact of number and placement of heterogeneous resources on performance in networks of different sizes and densities. While we prove that optimal deployment is very hard in general, we also show that only a modest number of reliable, long-range backhaul links and line-powered nodes are required to have a significant impact. Properly deployed, heterogeneity can triple the average delivery rate and provide a 5-fold increase in the lifetime (respectively) of a large batten-powered network of simple sensors.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498318","","Intelligent networks;Mechanical sensors;Testing;Analytical models;Hardware;Costs;Fabrication;Application software;Power engineering computing;Research and development","","265","","20","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ground plane size is 50 mm/spl times/80 mm, which is about the size of a typical PC Wireless card. Detailed simulation and experimental investigations are conducted to understand their behavior and optimize for broadband operation. It is shown that, the variation in the slot shape, from straight to L and T shapes, helps in generating additional resonances, which when coupled to the original resonances of the slot, further increases impedance bandwidths. The bent shapes of the L and T slots reduce their height and provide more space on the ground plane for electronics. A mirror image dual L-slot antenna, placed at two adjacent corners of the ground plane, is also investigated and optimized for the polarization diversity. They provide an impedance bandwidth of 87%, with near orthogonal radiation characteristics. The measured impedance bandwidths (S/sub 11/=-10 dB) of up to 60%, 84%, and 80% are achieved for these straight, L and inverted T slots respectively, by suitably selecting their design parameters.

It is also known that this result does not generalize to arbitrary networks. There are several examples in the literature of solvable networks with no scalar linear solution over any finite field. However, each example has a linear solution for some vector dimension greater than one. It has been conjectured that every solvable network has a linear solution over some finite-field alphabet and some vector dimension. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture. We also show that if a network has no linear solution over any finite field, then it has no linear solution over any finite commutative ring with identity. Our counterexample network has no linear solution even in the more general algebraic context of modules, which includes as special cases all finite rings and Abelian groups. Furthermore, we show that the network coding capacity of this network is strictly greater than the maximum linear coding capacity over any finite field (exactly 10% greater), so the network is not even asymptotically linearly solvable. It follows that, even for more general versions of linearity such as convolutional coding, filter-bank coding, or linear time sharing, the network has no linear solution.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.851744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1468297","Asymptotics;flows;linear coding;network information theory;routing","Intelligent networks;Galois fields;Vectors;Information theory;Routing;Modules (abstract algebra);Network coding;Linearity;Convolutional codes;Nonlinear filters","","263","4","18","IEEE","18 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The document preprocessing mechanism will generate the meaningful terms based on the news corpus and the Chinese news dictionary defined by the domain expert. Then, the meaningful terms will be classified according to the events of the news by the term classifier. The fuzzy inference mechanism will generate the membership degrees for each fuzzy concept of the fuzzy ontology. Every fuzzy concept has a set of membership degrees associated with various events of the domain ontology. In addition, a news agent based on the fuzzy ontology is also developed for news summarization.

However, the PM of the parallel shape array has nonnegligible drawbacks such as 1) requirement of pair matching between the 2-D azimuth and elevation angle estimation which is an exhaustive search and 2) estimation failure problems when elevation angles are between 70/spl deg/ and 90/spl deg/. The purpose of this paper is to show a way to remove these problems in the PM without additional computational loads. This paper will employ one or two L-shape arrays because the parallel shape used in the PM may cause the aforesaid problems. Simulation results verify that the PM with one or two L-shape configurations can remove these problems and improve the performance of the PM significantly, e.g., almost 5 dB in signal to noise ratio for the parameters used in this paper.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2005.846804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1427919","Antenna array;direction-of-arrival angle (DOA) estimation;propagator method (PM);Smart antenna","Direction of arrival estimation;Matrix decomposition;Shape;Azimuth;Signal processing algorithms;Mobile communication;Multiple signal classification;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Singular value decomposition;Array signal processing","","261","","16","IEEE","9 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main advantages of these modulation strategies are the low switching frequencies of the devices, the good output voltage spectra, and the low electromagnetic interference. However, when these techniques are applied to the three-level neutral-point (NP)-clamped inverter, low-frequency oscillations appear in the NP voltage for some operating conditions. As a result, the value of the dc-link capacitors must be increased in order to attenuate such oscillations. In this paper, these amplitudes are quantified for two modulation strategies that use nearest vectors to the reference vector. Owing to the nondimensional variables used in the analysis, the information provided will help for the calculation of the dc-link capacitors in a given specific application.

However, apart for the presence of critical nonlinear inversion steps, particularly crucial in abrupt topography scenarios, it does not allow one to separate different scattering mechanisms in the elevation (height) direction within the ground pixel. Overlay of scattering at different elevations in the same azimuth-range resolution cell can be due either to the penetration of the radiation below the surface or to perspective ambiguities caused by the side-looking geometry. Multibaseline three-dimensional (3-D) SAR focusing allows overcoming such a limitation and has thus raised great interest in the recent research. First results with real data have been only obtained in the laboratory and with airborne systems, or with limited time-span and spatial-coverage spaceborne data. This work presents a novel approach for the tomographic processing of European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS) real data for extended scenes and long time span. Besides facing problems common to the airborne case, such as the nonuniformly spaced passes, this processing requires tackling additional difficulties specific to the spaceborne case, in particular a space-varying phase calibration of the data due to atmospheric variations and possible scene deformations occurring for years-long temporal spans. First results are presented that confirm the capability of ERS multipass tomography to resolve multiple targets within the same azimuth-range cell and to map the 3-D scattering properties of the illuminated scene.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.843567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1411976","Multibaseline;multipass;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);three-dimensional (3-D) focusing;tomography","Layout;Spaceborne radar;Radar scattering;Tomography;Synthetic aperture radar;Interferometry;Surface topography;Geometry;Laboratories;Remote sensing","","260","1","36","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A smooth torque is obtained by tracking a modified current reference which is periodic over one-sixth of the electrical time period in the synchronous reference frame. An accurate tracking involves, however, very high current loop bandwidth, which is usually not achievable with conventional linear controllers. In order to improve current tracking in the presence of periodic reference signals and disturbances, the paper proposes the application of repetitive techniques to the current control in a field-oriented PMSM drive, where the q-axis current reference has been modified to achieve constant torque.

Second, they must select judiciously from among available techniques to reduce this impact in order to meet their reliability targets with minimum overhead. To provide a foundation for these efforts, this paper gives a broad overview of the soft error problem from an architectural perspective.

Unlike the /spl mu/-law companding scheme, which enlarges only small signals so that increases the average power, the schemes based on exponential companding technique adjust both large and small signals and can keep the average power at the same level. By transforming the original OFDM signals into uniformly distributed signals (with a specific degree), the exponential companding schemes can effectively reduce PAPR for different modulation formats and sub-carrier sizes. Moreover, many PAPR reduction schemes, such as /spl mu/-law companding scheme, cause spectrum side-lobes generation, but the exponential companding schemes cause less spectrum side-lobes. Computer simulations, which consider a baseband OFDM system with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and a Solid State Power Amplifier (SSPA), show that the proposed exponential companding schemes can offer better PAPR reduction, Bit Error Rate (BER), and phase error performance than the /spl mu/-law companding scheme.","1557-9611","","10.1109/TBC.2005.847626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1433083","Non-linear companding transform;Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM);Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR);Solid State Power Amplifier (SSPA)","Peak to average power ratio;OFDM;AWGN;Bit error rate;Modulation;Computer simulation;Baseband;Additive white noise;Solid state circuits;Power amplifiers","","259","4","20","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the results of most wavelet-based methods of image fusion have a spatial resolution that is less than that obtained via the Brovey, intensity-hue-saturation, and principal components analysis methods of image fusion. We introduce an improved method of image fusion which is based on the amelioration de la resolution spatiale par injection de structures (ARSIS) concept using the curvelet transform, because the curvelet transform represents edges better than wavelets.

We present an optoacoustic vascular imaging system that records these transients on the skin surface with an ultrasound transducer array and displays the images online. With a single laser pulse a complete optoacoustic B-mode image can be acquired. The optoacoustic system exploits the high intrinsic optical contrast of blood and provides high-contrast images without the need for contrast agents. The high spatial resolution of the system is determined by the acoustic propagation and is limited to the submillimeter range by our 7.5-MHz linear array transducer. A Q-switched alexandrite laser emitting short near-infrared laser pulses at a wavelength of 760 nm allows an imaging depth of a few centimeters.

"Separating reflection components of textured surfaces using a single image","R. T. Tan; K.

To our knowledge, all methods that use a single input image require explicit color segmentation to deal with multicolored surfaces. Unfortunately, for complex textured images, current color segmentation algorithms are still problematic to segment correctly. Consequently, a method without explicit color segmentation becomes indispensable and This work presents such a method. The method is based solely on colors, particularly chromaticity, without requiring any geometrical information. One of the basic ideas is to iteratively compare the intensity logarithmic differentiation of an input image and its specular-free image. A specular-free image is an image that has exactly the same geometrical profile as the diffuse component of the input image and that can be generated by shifting each pixel's intensity and maximum chromaticity nonlinearly. Unlike existing methods using a single image, all processes in the proposed method are done locally, involving a maximum of only two neighboring pixels. This local operation is useful for handling textured objects with complex multicolored scenes. Evaluations by comparison with the results of polarizing filters demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1374865","Index Terms- Reflection components separation;specular reflection;diffuse reflection;dichromatic reflection model;chromaticity;specular-to-diffuse mechanism;specular-free image.","Surface texture;Optical reflection;Image segmentation;Optical polarization;Pixel;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Physical optics;Solid modeling;Power distribution","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Color;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","256","16","32","IEEE","3 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recent advancements in ultrasound instrumentation and portable ultrasound devices necessitate the need of more robust despeckling techniques for enhanced ultrasound medical imaging for both routine clinical practice and teleconsultation. The objective of this work was to carry out a comparative evaluation of despeckle filtering based on texture analysis, image quality evaluation metrics, and visual evaluation by medical experts in the assessment of 440 (220 asymptomatic and 220 symptomatic) ultrasound images of the carotid artery bifurcation. In this paper a total of 10 despeckle filters were evaluated based on local statistics, median filtering, pixel homogeneity, geometric filtering, homomorphic filtering, anisotropic diffusion, nonlinear coherence diffusion, and wavelet filtering. The results of this study suggest that the first order statistics filter lsmv, gave the best performance, followed by the geometric filter gf4d, and the homogeneous mask area filter lsminsc. These filters improved the class separation between the asymptomatic and the symptomatic classes based on the statistics of the extracted texture features, gave only a marginal improvement in the classification success rate, and improved the visual assessment carried out by the two experts. More specifically, filters lsmv or gf4d can be used for despeckling asymptomatic images in which the expert is interested mainly in the plaque composition and texture analysis; and filters lsmv, gf4d, or lsminsc can be used for the despeckling of symptomatic images in which the expert is interested in identifying the degree of stenosis and the plaque borders. The proper selection of a despeckle filter is very important in the enhancement of ultrasonic imaging of the carotid artery. Further work is needed to evaluate at a larger scale and in clinical practice the performance of the proposed despeckle filters in the automated segmentation, texture analysis, and classification of carotid ultrasound imaging.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561621","","Ultrasonic imaging;Filtering;Carotid arteries;Filters;Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Statistics;Biomedical imaging;Speckle;Degradation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Carotid Arteries;Carotid Artery Diseases;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Observer Variation;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","256","","53","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, a g/sub m/-boosted common-gate LNA loosens the link between noise factor (i.e., noise match) and input matching (i.e., power match ); consequently, both noise factor and bias current are simultaneously reduced. A transformer-coupled CGLNA is described. Suggested by the functional and topological similarities between amplifiers and oscillators, differential Colpitts VCO and QVCO circuits are presented that relax the start-up requirements and improve both close-in and far-out phase noise compared to conventional Colpitts configurations.

The main drawback of this structure deals with its control. Boost inverter consists of Boost dc-dc converters that have to be controlled in a variable-operation point condition. The sliding mode control has been proposed as an option. However, it does not directly control the inductance averaged-current. This paper proposes a control strategy for the Boost inverter in which each Boost is controlled by means of a double-loop regulation scheme that consists of a new inductor current control inner loop and an also new output voltage control outer loop. These loops include compensations in order to cope with the Boost variable operation point condition and to achieve a high robustness to both input voltage and output current disturbances. As shown by simulation and prototype experimental results, the proposed control strategy achieves a very high reliable performance, even in difficult transient situations such as nonlinear loads, abrupt load changes, short circuits, etc., which sliding mode control cannot cope with.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.843000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407999","Control systems;dc–ac power conversion;inverters;power conversion;power electronics;power generation;power system control","Inverters;Sliding mode control;Voltage control;AC generators;DC generators;DC-DC power converters;Inductance;Inductors;Current control;Robustness","","256","","16","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two major components in our approach are scene modeling and highlight detection. Scene modeling is achieved by normalized cut algorithm and temporal graph analysis, while highlight detection is accomplished by motion attention modeling. In our proposed approach, a video is represented as a complete undirected graph and the normalized cut algorithm is carried out to globally and optimally partition the graph into video clusters. The resulting clusters form a directed temporal graph and a shortest path algorithm is proposed to efficiently detect video scenes. The attention values are then computed and attached to the scenes, clusters, shots, and subshots in a temporal graph. As a result, the temporal graph can inherently describe the evolution and perceptual importance of a video. In our application, video summaries that emphasize both content balance and perceptual quality can be generated directly from a temporal graph that embeds both the structure and attention information.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2004.841694","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1391003","Attention model;normalized cut;scene modeling;video summarization","Layout;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Motion detection;Motion analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Councils;Computer science;Asia;Entropy","","255","5","23","IEEE","7 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, providing the illusion of continuous connectivity requires selecting the right moment to handoff and the right base station to transfer to. Unfortunately, 802.11-based networks only attempt a handoff when a client's service degrades to a point where connectivity is threatened. Worse, the overhead of scanning for nearby base stations is routinely over 250 ms - during which incoming packets are dropped - far longer than what can be tolerated by highly interactive applications such as voice telephony. In this paper we describe SyncScan, a low-cost technique for continuously tracking nearby base stations by synchronizing short listening periods at the client with periodic transmissions from each base station. We have implemented this SyncScan algorithm using commodity 802.11 hardware and we demonstrate that it allows better handoff decisions and over an order of magnitude improvement in handoff delay. Finally, our approach only requires trivial implementation changes, is incrementally deployable and is completely backward compatible with existing 802.11 standards.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1497933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1497933","","Base stations;Computer science;Degradation;Costs;Delay;Network topology;Monitoring;Femtocell networks;Telephony;Hardware","","255","23","17","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This result is independent of the number of receive antennas and the channel gain matrix, and is valid at all signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We investigate the tightness of this bound in a time-varying channel (assuming perfect channel knowledge at receivers and transmitters) where the channel experiences uncorrelated Rayleigh fading and in some situations we find that the dirty paper gain is upper-bounded by the ratio of transmit-to-receive antennas.

In addition to the cognitive aspects of the network, a specification language is needed to translate the user's end-to-end goals into a form understandable by the cognitive process.

Assuming that the manipulator links are infinitely stiff, the enhanced stiffness model contains: 1) the passive and active stiffness of the joints and 2) the active stiffness created by the change in the manipulator configuration, and by external force vector acting upon the manipulator end point. The stiffness formulation not accounting for the latter is known as conventional stiffness formulation, which is obviously not complete and is valid only when: 1) the manipulator is in an unloaded quasistatic configuration and 2) the manipulator Jacobian matrix is constant throughout the workspace. The experimental system considered in this study is a Motoman SK 120 robot manipulator with a closed-chain mechanism. While the deflection of the manipulator end point under a range of external forces is provided by a high precision laser measurement system, a wrist force/torque sensor measures the external forces. Based on the experimental data and the enhanced stiffness model, the joint stiffness values are first identified. These stiffness values are then used to prove that conventional stiffness modeling is incomplete. Finally, they are employed to characterize stiffness properties of the robot manipulator. It has been found that although the component of the stiffness matrix differentiating the enhanced stiffness model from the conventional one is not always positive definite, the resulting stiffness matrix can still be positive definite. This follows that stability of the stiffness matrix is not influenced by this stiffness component. This study contributes to the previously reported work from the point of view of using the enhanced stiffness model for stiffness identification, verification and characterization, and of new experimental results proving that the conventional stiffness matrix is not complete and is valid under certain assumptions.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2004.842347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1492472","Compliance/force control;manipulator kinematic;stiffness identification;stiffness modeling","Manipulators;Force measurement;Robot sensing systems;Torque measurement;Jacobian matrices;Laser modes;Wrist;Force sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems","","254","1","25","IEEE","8 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given an integer k, the weight of a point is defined as the sum of the distances separating it from its k nearest-neighbors. Outlier are those points scoring the largest values of weight. The algorithm HilOut makes use of the notion of space-filling curve to linearize the data set, and it consists of two phases. The first phase provides an approximate solution, within a rough factor, after the execution of at most d + 1 sorts and scans of the data set, with temporal cost quadratic in d and linear in N and in k, where d is the number of dimensions of the data set and N is the number of points in the data set. During this phase, the algorithm isolates points candidate to be outliers and reduces this set at each iteration. If the size of this set becomes n, then the algorithm stops reporting the exact solution. The second phase calculates the exact solution with a final scan examining further the candidate outliers that remained after the first phase. Experimental results show that the algorithm always stops, reporting the exact solution, during the first phase after much less than d + 1 steps. We present both an in-memory and disk-based implementation of the HilOut algorithm and a thorough scaling analysis for real and synthetic data sets showing that the algorithm scales well in both cases.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377172","Index Terms- Outlier mining;space-filling curves.","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Credit cards;Costs;Degradation;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Telecommunication services;Medical tests;Medical treatment","","253","1","32","IEEE","10 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The assignable energy functions are characterized by a set of partial differential equations that must be solved to determine the control law. We prove in this paper that for a class of mechanical systems with underactuation degree one the partial differential equations can be explicitly solved. Furthermore, we introduce a suitable parametrization of assignable energy functions that provides the designer with a handle to address transient performance and robustness issues. Finally, we develop a speed estimator that allows the implementation of position-feedback controllers. The new result is applied to obtain an (almost) globally stabilizing scheme for the vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with strong input coupling, and a controller for the pendulum in a cart that can swing-up the pendulum from any position in the upper half plane and stop the cart at any desired location.

In this paper, we propose a protocol in which energy is conserved by amortizing the energy cost of communication over multiple packets. In addition, we allow sensors to control the amount of buffered packets since storage space is limited. To achieve this, a two-radio architecture is used which allows a sensor to ""wakeup"" a neighbor with a busy tone and send its packets for that destination. However, this process is expensive because all neighbors must awake and listen to the primary channel to determine who is the intended destination. Therefore, triggered wakeups on the primary channel are proposed to avoid using the more costly wakeup procedure. We present a protocol for efficiently determining how large the period for these wakeups should be such that energy consumption is reduced.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2005.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413182","Index Terms- Sensor networks;power management.","Media Access Protocol;Energy consumption;Access protocols;Switches;Buffer storage;Hardware;Costs;Communication system control;Energy management;Wireless sensor networks","","253","2","24","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Though a number of techniques, such as encryption and electronic signatures, are currently available to protect data when transmitted across sites, a truly comprehensive approach for data protection must also include mechanisms for enforcing access control policies based on data contents, subject qualifications and characteristics, and other relevant contextual information, such as time. It is well understood today that the semantics of data must be taken into account in order to specify effective access control policies. Also, techniques for data integrity and availability specifically tailored to database systems must be adopted. In this respect, over the years, the database security community has developed a number of different techniques and approaches to assure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, despite such advances, the database security area faces several new challenges. Factors such as the evolution of security concerns, the ""disintermediation"" of access to data, new computing paradigms and applications, such as grid-based computing and on-demand business, have introduced both new security requirements and new contexts in which to apply and possibly extend current approaches. In this paper, we first survey the most relevant concepts underlying the notion of database security and summarize the most well-known techniques. We focus on access control systems, on which a large body of research has been devoted, and describe the key access control models, namely, the discretionary and mandatory access control models, and the role-based access control (RBAC) model. We also discuss security for advanced data management systems, and cover topics such as access control for XML. We then discuss current challenges for database security and some preliminary approaches that address some of these challenges.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2005.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1416861","Index Terms- Data confindentiality;data privacy;relational and object databases;XML.","Databases;Data security;Access control;Information security;Protection;Grid computing;Information systems;Productivity;Cryptography;Qualifications","","252","2","98","IEEE","11 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using constructive geometric arguments, a coordinate-free formula containing a small number of Cayley-Menger determinants is derived. This formulation accommodates a more thorough investigation of the effects caused by all possible sources of error, including round-off errors, for the first time in this context. New formulas for the variance and bias of the unknown robot location estimation, due to station location and range measurements errors, are derived and analyzed. They are proved to be more tractable compared with previous ones, because all their terms have geometric meaning, allowing a simple analysis of their asymptotic behavior near singularities.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2004.833793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1391018","Cayley–Menger determinants;error analysis;numerical conditioning;robot localization;trilateration","Robot localization;Equations;Robot kinematics;Roundoff errors;Measurement errors;Analysis of variance;Error analysis;Position measurement;Crystallography;Computer graphics","","251","5","23","IEEE","7 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Special attention is given to polyethylene and the manner in which this semi-crystalline polymer yields under mechanical stress by microvoid, crack and craze development in the amorphous phase between the lamellar crystallites. The nature of the forces induced by an electrical field is considered and it is shown that a significant component of tensile stress is generated in a direction orthogonal to the field and can become large as breakdown is approached. This suggests a correlation between the responses of the polymer to mechanical and electrical stresses and consequently the importance of morphology in determining the latter. The likely effect of field-induced morphological change on charge transport and electrode processes is described and its underlying contribution to possible aging markers for polyethylene, such as high field conduction, electroluminescence, space charge and charge packets is considered.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2005.1522189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1522189","","Aging;Electric breakdown;Polyethylene;Polymers;Tensile stress;Dielectric breakdown;Solids;Amorphous materials;Crystallization;Morphology","","251","","91","IEEE","24 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna geometric parameters are extracted to be optimized by PSO, and a fitness function is evaluated by FDTD simulations to represent the performance of each candidate design. The optimization process is implemented on parallel clusters to reduce the computational time introduced by full-wave analysis. Two examples are investigated in the paper: first, the design of rectangular patch antennas is presented as a test of the parallel PSO/FDTD algorithm. The optimizer is then applied to design E-shaped patch antennas. It is observed that by using different fitness functions, both dual-frequency and wide-band antennas with desired performance are obtained by the optimization. The optimized E-shaped patch antennas are analyzed, fabricated, and measured to validate the robustness of the algorithm. The measured less than - 18 dB return loss (for dual-frequency antenna) and 30.5% bandwidth (for wide-band antenna) exhibit the prospect of the parallel PSO/FDTD algorithm in practical patch antenna designs.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2005.858842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1528712","Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD);parallel computation;particle swarm optimization;patch antenna","Time domain analysis;Particle swarm optimization;Finite difference methods;Broadband antennas;Patch antennas;Algorithm design and analysis;Design optimization;Antenna measurements;Computational modeling;Solid modeling","","251","","20","IEEE","7 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Analyzing Web content has therefore become increasingly important to the intelligence and security agencies that monitor these groups. Authorship analysis can assist this activity by automatically extracting linguistic features from online messages and evaluating stylistic details for patterns of terrorist communication. However, authorship analysis techniques are rooted in work with literary texts, which differ significantly from online communication. To explore these problems, we modified an existing framework for analyzing online authorship and applied it to Arabic and English Web forum messages associated with known extremist groups. We developed a special multilingual model - the set of algorithms and related features - to identify Arabic messages, gearing this model toward the language's unique characteristics. Furthermore, we incorporated a complex message extraction component to allow the use of a more comprehensive set of features tailored specifically toward online messages.

The challenge addressed here is how to fuse those hysteresis models with available robust control techniques to have the basic requirement of stability of the system. The purpose of the note is to show such a possibility by using the Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) hysteresis model. An adaptive variable structure control approach, serving as an illustration, is fused with the PI model without necessarily constructing a hysteresis inverse.

We developed a wireless sensor array and deployed it in July 2004 at Volcan Tingurahua, an active volcano in central Ecuador. The network collected infrasonic (low-frequency acoustic) signals at 102 Hz, transmitting data over a 9 km wireless link to a remote base station. During the deployment, we collected over 54 hours of continuous data which included at least 9 large explosions. Nodes were time-synchronized using a separate GPS receiver, and our data was later correlated with that acquired at a nearby wired sensor array. In addition to continuous sampling, we have developed a distributed event detector that automatically triggers data transmission when a well-correlated signal is received by multiple nodes. We evaluate this approach in terms of reduced energy and bandwidth usage, as well as accuracy of infrasonic signal detection.","","0-7803-8801-1","10.1109/EWSN.2005.1462003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1462003","","Wireless sensor networks;Sensor arrays;Acoustic sensors;Remote monitoring;Volcanoes;Base stations;Explosions;Global Positioning System;Sampling methods;Event detection","","250","3","26","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is a natural question about a fundamental object connected to many fields such as data compression, Kolmogorov complexity, pattern identification, and addition chains. Due to the problem's inherent complexity, our objective is to find an approximation algorithm which finds a small grammar for the input string. We focus attention on the approximation ratio of the algorithm (and implicitly, the worst case behavior) to establish provable performance guarantees and to address shortcomings in the classical measure of redundancy in the literature. Our first results are concern the hardness of approximating the smallest grammar problem. Most notably, we show that every efficient algorithm for the smallest grammar problem has approximation ratio at least 8569/8568 unless P=NP. We then bound approximation ratios for several of the best known grammar-based compression algorithms, including LZ78, B ISECTION, SEQUENTIAL, LONGEST MATCH, GREEDY, and RE-PAIR. Among these, the best upper bound we show is O(n/sup 1/2/). We finish by presenting two novel algorithms with exponentially better ratios of O(log/sup 3/n) and O(log(n/m/sup */)), where m/sup */ is the size of the smallest grammar for that input.

The main assumption adopted in the model is that the current control loops, which are much faster than the electromechanic transients under study, do not have a significant influence on the transient stability of the power system and may be considered instantaneous. The proposed DFIG model is a set of algebraic equations which are solved using an iterative procedure. A method is also proposed to calculate the DFIG initial conditions. A detailed variable-speed windmill model has been developed using the proposed DFIG model. This windmill model has been integrated in a transient stability simulation program in order to demonstrate its feasibility. Several simulations have been performed using a base case which includes a small grid, a wind farm represented by a single windmill, and different operation points. The evolution of several electric variables during the simulations is shown and discussed.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2005.845523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432853","Doubly fed induction generator;dynamic simulation;induction generator;transient stability;wind energy","Induction generators;Transient analysis;Stability analysis;Power system modeling;Power system transients;Power system stability;Current control;Power system control;Power systems;Equations","","249","","18","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Algebraic connectivity of a graph is the second smallest eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix and a measure of speed of solving consensus problems in networks. We demonstrate that it is possible to dramatically increase the algebraic connectivity of a regular complex network by 1000 times or more without adding new links or nodes to the network. This implies that a consensus problem can be solved incredibly fast on certain small-world networks giving rise to a network design algorithm for ultra fast information networks. Our study relies on a procedure called ""random rewiring"" due to Watts & Strogatz (Nature, 1998). Extensive numerical results are provided to support our claims and conjectures. We prove that the mean of the bulk Laplacian spectrum of a complex network remains invariant under random rewiring. The same property only asymptotically holds for scale-free networks. A relationship between increasing the algebraic connectivity of complex networks and robustness to link and node failures is also shown. This is an alternative approach to the use of percolation theory for analysis of network robustness. We also show some connections between our conjectures and certain open problems in the theory of random matrices.","2378-5861","0-7803-9099-7","10.1109/ACC.2005.1470321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1470321","","Intelligent networks;Complex networks;Laplace equations;Robustness;Power engineering and energy;Oscillators;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Control systems;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","249","","44","","1 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a new real-time fault estimation module that estimates the actuator effectiveness is developed. The actuator fault diagnosis is based on the estimation of the state vector. Under some conditions, the stochastic system is transformed into two separate subsystems. One of them is not affected by actuator faults, so a reduced order Kalman filter can be used to estimate its states. The other, whose states are measurable, is affected by the faults. Then, the output of the nominal controller is reconfigured to compensate for the loss of actuator effectiveness in the system.

Based on the analysis, we propose a comprehensive, efficient video text detection, localization, and extraction method, which emphasizes the multilingual capability over the whole processing. The proposed method is also robust to various background complexities and text appearances. The text detection is carried out by edge detection, local thresholding, and hysteresis edge recovery. The coarse-to-fine localization scheme is then performed to identify text regions accurately. The text extraction consists of adaptive thresholding, dam point labeling, and inward filling.

The techniques and limits of IL are discussed with particular attention to the smallest scales achievable. With immersion techniques, the smallest pattern size for a single exposure is a half-pitch of /spl lambda//4n where /spl lambda/ is the optical wavelength and n is the refractive index of the immersion material. Currently with a 193-nm excimer laser source and H/sub 2/O immersion, this limiting dimension is /spl sim/34 nm. With nonlinear spatial frequency multiplication techniques, this limit is extended by factors of 1/2, 1/3, etc.-extending well into the nanoscale regime. IL provides an inexpensive, large-area capability as a result of its parallelism. Multiple exposures, multiple beams, and mix-and-match with other lithographies extend the range of applicability. Imaging IL provides an approach to arbitrary structures with comparable resolution. Numerous application areas, including nanoscale epitaxial growth for semiconductor heterostructures; nanofluidics for biological separations; nanomagnetics for increased storage density; nanophotonics including distributed feedback and distributed Bragg reflectors, two- and three-dimensional photonic crystals, metamaterials, and negative refractive index materials for enhanced optical interactions are briefly reviewed.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2005.853538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512492","Epitaxy;interference;lithography;metamaterials;nanofluidics;nanomagnetics;nanophotonics;nanoscience;nanotechnology;negative-index materials","Optical interferometry;Interferometric lithography;Nanotechnology;Nanobioscience;Biomedical optical imaging;Nonlinear optics;Optical feedback;Optical refraction;Optical variables control;Optical beams","","248","122","76","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventionally, high bandwidth for resolution was achieved with a short pulse, which results in a tradeoff between resolution and penetration. Coded excitation extends the bounds of this tradeoff by increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) through appropriate coding on transmit and decoding on receive. Although used for about 50 years in radar, coded excitation was successfully introduced into commercial ultrasound scanners only within the last 5 years. This delay is at least partly due to practical implementation issues particular to diagnostic ultrasound, which are the focus of this paper. After reviewing the basics of biphase and chirp coding, we present simulation results to quantify tradeoffs between penetration and resolution under frequency-dependent attenuation, dynamic focusing, and nonlinear propagation. Next, we compare chirp and Golay code performance with respect to image quality and system requirements, then we show clinical images that illustrate the current applications of coded excitation in B-mode, harmonic, and flow imaging.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1406543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1406543","","Ultrasonic imaging;Signal resolution;Image quality;Focusing;Chirp;Image resolution;Bandwidth;Signal to noise ratio;Decoding;Radar","Computer Simulation;Hemorheology;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Transducers;Ultrasonography","246","11","31","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then show the existence of a controlled symmetry for general bipeds under the action of SO(3) taking into account not only the kinetic energy but also the potential energy and impact dynamics.

Yet, if game characters could learn through interacting with the player, behavior could improve as the game is played, keeping it interesting. This paper introduces the real-time Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (rtNEAT) method for evolving increasingly complex artificial neural networks in real time, as a game is being played. The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible an entirely new genre of video games in which the player trains a team of agents through a series of customized exercises. To demonstrate this concept, the Neuroevolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game was built based on rtNEAT. In NERO, the player trains a team of virtual robots for combat against other players' teams. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and demonstrates that rtNEAT makes possible video games like NERO where agents evolve and adapt in real time.

Since distinct reserve services can in fact be strongly coupled, and the heuristics required to bridge the various sequential markets can ultimately lead to loss of social welfare, simultaneous energy/reserves market-clearing procedures have been proposed and are in use. However, they generally schedule reserve services subject to exogenous rules and parameters that do not relate to actual operating conditions. The weaknesses of the current approaches warrant the investigation of alternatives. In that regard, we present a different methodology to the simultaneous market clearing of energy and reserve services. This approach avoids the pitfalls of the sequential procedures, while at the same time its basis for scheduling reserve services does no longer rely on some rules of thumb. The salient feature of the proposed approach is that, under marginal pricing, it yields a single price for all reserve types scheduled at a bus, unlike the current approaches. We show that this common price is given by the nodal marginal cost of security. We present two specific implementations of a simultaneous security-constrained market-clearing procedure, one deterministic and one probabilistic. An example of joint market clearing of energy with reserves required for primary and tertiary regulation illustrates how their strong coupling affects their schedule and prices.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2005.857492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1519727","Electricity markets;energy and security pricing;marginal pricing;regulation;reserve;security-constrained market clearing;transmission constraints","Pricing;Job shop scheduling;Electricity supply industry;Security;Power generation;Bridges;Thumb;Costs;Couplings;Power engineering and energy","","246","","42","IEEE","17 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, the training process and the network approximation properties can be investigated via linear algebra. Four algorithms are developed to achieve exact or approximate matching of input-output and/or gradient-based training sets.

Gridding is simple and robust and has parameters, the grid oversampling ratio and the kernel width, that can be used to trade accuracy for computational memory and time reductions. We have found that significant reductions in computation memory and time can be obtained while maintaining high accuracy by using a minimal oversampling ratio, from 1.125 to 1.375, instead of the typically employed grid oversampling ratio of two. When using a minimal oversampling ratio, appropriate design of the convolution kernel is important for maintaining high accuracy. We derive a simple equation for choosing the optimal Kaiser-Bessel convolution kernel for a given oversampling ratio and kernel width. As well, we evaluate the effect of presampling the kernel, a common technique used to reduce the computation time, and find that using linear interpolation between samples adds negligible error with far less samples than is necessary with nearest-neighbor interpolation. We also develop a new method for choosing the optimal presampled kernel. Using a minimal oversampling ratio and presampled kernel, we are able to perform a three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction in one-eighth the time and requiring one-third the computer memory versus using an oversampling ratio of two and a Kaiser-Bessel convolution kernel, while maintaining the same level of accuracy.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2005.848376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435541","Convolution interpolation;gridding;kernel function;three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction","Kernel;Image reconstruction;Convolution;Interpolation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic resonance;Fourier transforms;Grid computing;Sampling methods;Robustness","Algorithms;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sample Size;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","245","6","20","IEEE","31 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Interestingly, synchrony has often been observed in networks of biological agents (e.g., synchronously flashing fireflies, or spiking of neurons). In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired network synchronization protocol for large scale sensor networks that emulates the simple strategies adopted by the biological agents. The strategy synchronizes pulsing devices that are led to emit their pulses periodically and simultaneously. The convergence to synchrony of our strategy follows from the theory of Mirollo and Strogatz, 1990, while the scalability is evident from the many examples existing in the natural world. When the nodes are within a single broadcast range, our key observation is that the dependence of the synchronization time on the number of nodes N is subject to a phase transition: for values of N beyond a specific threshold, the synchronization is nearly immediate; while for smaller N, the synchronization time decreases smoothly with respect to N. Interestingly, a tradeoff is observed between the total energy consumption and the time necessary to reach synchrony. We obtain an optimum operating point at the local minimum of the energy consumption curve that is associated to the phase transition phenomenon mentioned before. The proposed synchronization protocol is directly applied to the cooperative reach-back communications problem. The main advantages of the proposed method are its scalability and low complexity.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.845418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425651","Communication systems;distributed algorithms;distributed feedback oscillators;sensor networks;synchronization","Protocols;Large-scale systems;Wireless sensor networks;Biological systems;Biosensors;Oscillators;Sensor systems;Sensor fusion;Convergence;Scalability","","245","9","24","IEEE","2 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Distributed resampling algorithms with proportional allocation (RPA) and nonproportional allocation (RNA) of particles are considered. The components of the filter architectures are the processing elements (PEs), a central unit (CU), and an interconnection network. One of the main advantages of the new resampling algorithms is that communication through the interconnection network is reduced and made deterministic, which results in simpler network structure and increased sampling frequency. Particle filter performances are estimated for the bearings-only tracking applications. In the architectural part of the analysis, the area and speed of the particle filter implementation are estimated for a different number of particles and a different level of parallelism with field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation.

We solve the registration problem by minimizing a pixelwise mean-square distance measure between the target image and the warped source. The problem is further constrained by way of a vector-spline regularization which provides some control over two independent quantities that are intrinsic to the deformation: its divergence, and its curl. Our algorithm is also able to handle soft landmark constraints, which is particularly useful when parts of the images contain very little information or when its repartition is uneven. We provide an optimal analytical solution in the case when only landmarks and smoothness considerations are taken into account.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that motor learning could be accelerated by transiently amplifying the environmental dynamics. A novel dynamic environment was created during treadmill stepping by applying a perpendicular viscous force field to the leg through a robotic device. The environmental dynamics were amplified by an amount determined by a computational learning model fit on a per-subject basis. On average, subjects significantly reduced the time required to predict the applied force field by approximately 26% when the field was transiently amplified. However, this reduction was not as great as that predicted by the model, likely due to nonstationarities in the learning parameters. We conclude that motor learning of a novel dynamic environment can be accelerated by exploiting the error-based learning mechanism of internal model formation, but that nonlinearities in adaptive response may limit the feasible acceleration. These results support an approach to movement training devices that amplify rather than reduce movement errors, and provide a computational framework for both implementing the approach and understanding its limitations.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2004.843173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1406019","Adaptive control;locomotion;motor systems","Robots;Acceleration;Nervous system;Testing;Life estimation;Leg;Legged locomotion;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Learning systems","Adaptation, Physiological;Adult;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Humans;Learning;Locomotion;Male;Models, Biological;Motor Skills;Physical Stimulation;Physical Therapy Modalities;Robotics;Therapy, Computer-Assisted","244","","29","IEEE","14 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two classes of identification schemes are proposed and compared, one based on the hysteresis output, the other based on the time-difference of the output. Conditions for parameter convergence are presented in terms of the input to the Preisach operator. An adaptive inverse control scheme is developed by updating the Preisach operator (and thus its inverse) with the output-based identification method. The asymptotic tracking property of this scheme is established, and for periodic reference trajectories, the parameter convergence behavior is characterized. Practical issues in the implementation of the adaptive identification and inverse control methods are also investigated.

First, we briefly discuss a ""kinematic"" swarm model in n-dimensional space introduced in an earlier paper. In that model, the interindividual interactions are based on artificial potential functions, and the motion of the individuals is along the negative gradient of the combined potential. After that, we consider a general model for vehicle dynamics of each agent (swarm member), and use sliding-mode control theory to force their motion to obey the dynamics of the kinematic model. In this context, the results for the initial model serve as a ""proof of concept"" for multiagent coordination and control (swarm aggregation), whereas the present results serve as a possible implementation method for engineering swarms with given vehicle dynamics.

However, this feature results in extremely high computational complexity when brute force rate distortion optimization (RDO) algorithm is used. This paper proposes a fast intermode decision algorithm to decide the best mode in intercoding. It makes use of the spatial homogeneity and the temporal stationarity characteristics of video objects. Specifically, spatial homogeneity of a MB is decided based on the MB's edge intensity, and temporal stationarity is decided by the difference of the current MB and it colocated counterpart in the reference frame. Based on the homogeneity and stationarity of the video objects, only a small number of intermodes are selected in the RDO process. The experimental results show that the fast intermode decision algorithm is able to reduce on the average 30% encoding time, with a negligible peak signal-to-noise ratio loss of 0.03 dB or, equivalently, a bit rate increment of 0.6%.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2005.848304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1458838","Video coding;H.264;AVC;RDO;homogeneity;stationarity;inter mode","Automatic voltage control;Video coding;Motion estimation;Costs;Computational complexity;Rate-distortion;PSNR;MPEG 4 Standard;Bit rate;IEC standards","","243","11","13","IEEE","27 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we study a public-key cryptosystem based on such polynomials, which provides both encryption and digital signature. The cryptosystem works on real numbers and is quite efficient. Unfortunately, from our analysis, it comes up that it is not secure. We describe an attack which permits to recover the corresponding plaintext from a given ciphertext. The same attack can be applied to produce forgeries if the cryptosystem is used for signing messages. Then, we point out that also other primitives, a Diffie-Hellman like key agreement scheme and an authentication scheme, designed along the same lines of the cryptosystem, are not secure due to the aforementioned attack.

It is shown that the stability region undergoes a phase transition from a concave region to a convex polyhedral region as the MPR capability improves. It is also shown that after this phase transition, slotted ALOHA is optimal i.e., the ALOHA stability region coincides with the MAC capacity region. Further, it is observed that there is no need for transmission control when ALOHA is optimal i.e., ALOHA with transmission probability one is optimal. Next, these results are extended to a symmetric N>2 user ALOHA system. Finally, a complete characterization of average delay in capture channels for the two-user system is given.

However, the quality and degree of security enhancement has not been closely examined in the literature. This paper examines the degree and types of security that may be provided by O-CDMA encoding. A quantitative analysis of data confidentiality is presented for O-CDMA encoding techniques that use both time spreading and wavelength hopping. The probability of successful data interception is calculated as a function of several parameters, including signal-to-noise ratio and fraction of total available system capacity. For reasonable choices of system and encoding parameters, it is shown that increasing code complexity can increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for an eavesdropper to ""break"" the encoding by only a few dB, while the processing of fewer than 100 bits by an eavesdropper can reduce the SNR required to break the encoding by up to 12 dB. The overall degree of confidentiality obtainable through O-CDMA encoding is also compared with that obtainable through standard cryptography. time-spreading/wavelength-hopping in particular, and O-CDMA in general, are found to provide considerably less data confidentiality than cryptography, and the confidentiality provided is found to be highly dependent on system design and implementation parameters.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2004.838844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402545","Code division multiaccess (CDMA);communication system security;optical communication","Multiaccess communication;Encoding;Communication system security;Data security;Cryptography;Signal to noise ratio;Protection;Jamming;Optical receivers;Data analysis","","240","1","30","IEEE","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A multimedia system may consist of various devices (PCs, laptops, PDAs, smart phones, etc.) interconnected via heterogeneous wireline and wireless networks. In such systems, multimedia content originally authored and compressed with a certain format may need bit rate adjustment and format conversion in order to allow access by receiving devices with diverse capabilities (display, memory, processing, decoder). Thus, a transcoding mechanism is required to make the content adaptive to the capabilities of diverse networks and client devices. A video transcoder can perform several additional functions. For example, if the bandwidth required for a particular video is fluctuating due to congestion or other causes, a transcoder can provide fine and dynamic adjustments in the bit rate of the video bitstream in the compressed domain without imposing additional functional requirements in the decoder. In addition, a video transcoder can change the coding parameters of the compressed video, adjust spatial and temporal resolution, and modify the video content and/or the coding standard used. This paper provides an overview of several video transcoding techniques and some of the related research issues. We introduce some of the basic concepts of video transcoding, and then review and contrast various approaches while highlighting critical research issues.

To evaluate and rank bioinformatics visualizations based on real-world data analysis scenarios, we developed a more relevant evaluation method that focuses on data insight. This paper presents several characteristics of insight that enabled us to recognize and quantify it in open-ended user tests. Using these characteristics, we evaluated five microarray visualization tools on the amount and types of insight they provide and the time it takes to acquire it. The results of the study guide biologists in selecting a visualization tool based on the type of their microarray data, visualization designers on the key role of user interaction techniques, and evaluators on a new approach for evaluating the effectiveness of visualizations for providing insight.

Pattan",NA; NA,IEEE Microwave Magazine,"8 Aug 2005","2005","6","2","54","62","The millimeter wave spectrum at 30-300 GHz is of increasing interest to service providers and systems designers because of the wide bandwidths available for carrying communications at this frequency range. Such wide bandwidths are valuable in supporting applications such as high speed data transmission and video distribution. Planning for millimeter wave spectrum use must take into account the propagation characteristics of radio signals at this frequency range. While signals at lower frequency bands can propagate for many miles and penetrate more easily through buildings, millimeter wave signals can travel only a few miles or less and do not penetrate solid materials very well. However, these characteristics of millimeter wave propagation are not necessarily disadvantageous. Millimeter waves can permit more densely packed communications links, thus providing very efficient spectrum utilization, and they can increase security of communication transmissions. This article reviews characteristics of millimeter wave propagation, including free space propagation and the effects of various physical factors on propagation.","1557-9581","","10.1109/MMW.2005.1491267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1491267","","Millimeter wave propagation;Radio spectrum management;Millimeter wave technology;Propagation losses;Millimeter wave communication;Frequency;Attenuation;Atmosphere;Electromagnetic wave absorption;Water","","238","","8","IEEE","8 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, the high-performance and low-power CMOS process, which has been developed over the last two decades, has traditionally assisted successful circuit implementation of binary logic. Consequently, in spite of its large potential multivalued logic design is seldom a circuit designer's choice. This paper presents a novel method of multiple-valued logic design using carbon-nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs). The geometry-dependent threshold voltage of CNFETs has been effectively used to design a ternary logic family. We have developed a SPICE-compatible model of ballistic CNFETs that can account for varying geometries and operating conditions. SPICE simulations have been performed on the proposed logic gates, and the transfer characteristics as well as transient behavior have been extensively studied. Finally, a comparison in terms of power and performance of the ternary logic family vis-a/spl grave/-vis traditional complementary field-effect transistor binary logic family has been presented.","1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2004.842068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405993","","Carbon nanotubes;Logic design;Multivalued logic;CMOS logic circuits;Digital systems;CMOS process;CNTFETs;Threshold voltage;Solid modeling;Geometry","","238","3","21","IEEE","14 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the minimum antenna area constraint makes it a contradiction to simultaneously obtain both unambiguous wide-area and high azimuth resolution. To overcome this limitation, a technique has been suggested that combines a broad illumination source with multiple receiving channels. Then, the coherent combination of the recorded multichannel signals will allow for the unambiguous SAR mapping of a wide ground area with fine azimuth resolution. This letter first gives an overview of current research work carried out about the generation of wide-swath and high-resolution SAR images from multichannel small spaceborne SAR systems, and then a space-time adaptive processing (STAP) approach combined with conventional SAR imaging algorithms is presented, which could be of help to overcome the existing difficulties in data processing. The main idea of the approach is to use a STAP-based method to properly overcome the aliasing affect caused by the lower pulse repetition frequency and thereby retrieve the unambiguous azimuth wide (full) spectrum signal from the received signal. Following this operation, conventional SAR data processing tools can be applied to fully focus the SAR images. The performance of the approach is also discussed in this letter. The approach has the advantages of simplicity, robustness, and high efficiency.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2004.840610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381354","Array signal processing;Doppler ambiguity;high resolution;spaceborne radar;space-time adaptive processing (STAP);synthetic aperture radar (SAR);wide area","Spaceborne radar;Azimuth;Signal resolution;Data processing;Synthetic aperture radar;Surveillance;Lighting;Signal mapping;Radar polarimetry;Frequency","","238","4","16","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We give a novel linear programming formulation for the joint problems of determining the movement of the sink and the sojourn time at different points in the network that induce the maximum network lifetime. Differently from previous solutions, our objective function maximizes the overall network lifetime (here defined as the time till the first node ""dies"" because of energy depletion) rather than minimizing the energy consumption at the nodes. For wireless sensor networks with up to 256 nodes our model produces sink movement patterns and sojourn times leading to a network lifetime up to almost five times that obtained with a static sink. Simulation results are performed to determine the distribution of the residual energy at the nodes over time. These results confirm that energy consumption varies with the current sink location, being the nodes more drained those in the proximity of the sink. Furthermore, the proposed solution for computing the sink movement results in a fair balancing of the energy depletion among the network nodes.","1530-1605","0-7695-2268-8","10.1109/HICSS.2005.259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385828","","Wireless sensor networks;Routing;Electronic mail;Energy consumption;Mobile communication;Energy efficiency;Ad hoc networks;Access protocols;Mechanical sensors;Industrial engineering","","238","","17","IEEE","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transversal dimension of this waveguide can be arbitrarily smaller than half of a wavelength in the filling material, provided that the transversal permeability is negative. This peculiar behavior may be used for fabrication of miniaturized rectangular waveguides. Several experimental miniaturized waveguides loaded with double ring resonators in 7 GHz frequency band have been designed, fabricated and tested. The measured results revealed backward-wave passband located below the cutoff frequency. Furthermore, it was experimentally shown that the increase of the physical length of the waveguide caused the decrease of the electrical length.

This paper presents a substructure-based classification algorithm that decouples the substructure discovery process from the classification model construction and uses frequent subgraph discovery algorithms to find all topological and geometric substructures present in the data set. The advantage of this approach is that during classification model construction, all relevant substructures are available allowing the classifier to intelligently select the most discriminating ones. The computational scalability is ensured by the use of highly efficient frequent subgraph discovery algorithms coupled with aggressive feature selection. Experimental evaluation on eight different classification problems shows that our approach is computationally scalable and, on average, outperforms existing schemes by 7 percent to 35 percent.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1458698","Index Terms- Classification;chemical compounds;virtual screening;graphs;SVM.","Chemical compounds;Pharmaceuticals;Drugs;Filtering;Libraries;Classification algorithms;Biological system modeling;Solid modeling;Computational intelligence;Scalability","","236","2","85","IEEE","27 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We describe a hardware implementation of unbounded transactional memory, called UTM, which exploits the common case for performance without sacrificing correctness on transactions whose footprint can be nearly as large as virtual memory. We performed a cycle-accurate simulation of a simplified architecture, called LTM. LTM is based on UTM but is easier to implement, because it does not change the memory subsystem outside of the processor. LTM allows nearly unbounded transactions, whose footprint is limited only by physical memory size and whose duration by the length of a timeslice. We assess UTM and LTM through microbenchmarking and by automatically converting the SPECjvm98 Java benchmarks and the Linux 2.4.19 kernel to use transactions instead of locks. We use both cycle-accurate simulation and instrumentation to understand benchmark behavior. Our studies show that the common case is small transactions that commit, even when contention is high, but that some applications contain very large transactions. For example, although 99.9% of transactions in the Linux study touch 54 cache lines or fewer, some transactions touch over 8000 cache lines. Our studies also indicate that hardware support is required, because some applications spend over half their time in critical regions. Finally, they suggest that hardware support for transactions can make Java programs run faster than when run using locks and can increase the concurrency of the Linux kernel by as much as a factor of 4 with no additional programming work.","2378-203X","0-7695-2275-0","10.1109/HPCA.2005.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385954","","Hardware;Turing machines;Linux;Java;Kernel;Yarn;Protocols;Transaction databases;Computer science;Artificial intelligence","","236","39","40","IEEE","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transmit power level affects signal quality and, thus, impacts the physical layer, determines the neighboring nodes that can hear the packet and, thus, the network layer affects interference which causes congestion and, thus, affects the transport layer. It is also key to several performance measures such as throughput, delay, and energy consumption. The challenge is to determine where in the architecture the power control problem is to be situated, to determine the appropriate power level by studying its impact on several performance issues, to provide a solution which deals properly with the multiple effects of transmit power control, and finally, to provide a software architecture for realizing the solution. We distill some basic principles on power control, which inform the subsequent design process. We then detail the design of a sequence of increasingly complex protocols, which address the multidimensional ramifications of the power control problem.

Upper bounds are derived from cut-set arguments, and lower bounds follow from an argument involving uncoded transmission. It is shown that in cases of interest, upper and lower bounds coincide in the limit as the number of relays tends to infinity. Hence, this paper provides a new example where a simple cut-set upper bound is achievable, and one more example where uncoded transmission achieves optimal performance. The findings are illustrated by geometric interpretations. The techniques developed in this paper are then applied to a sensor network situation. This is a network joint source-channel coding problem, and it is well known that the source-channel separation theorem does not extend to this case. The present paper extends this insight by providing an example where separating source from channel coding does not only lead to suboptimal performance-it leads to an exponential penalty in performance scaling behavior (as a function of the number of nodes). Finally, the techniques developed in this paper are extended to include certain models of ad hoc wireless networks, where a capacity scaling law can be established: When all nodes act purely as relays for a single source-destination pair, capacity grows with the logarithm of the number of nodes.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.842566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1397921","Capacity;CEO problem;joint source–channel coding;network;relay;sensor network;separation theorem;uncoded transmission","Upper bound;H infinity control;Degradation;Communication systems;Digital relays;Channel coding;Broadcasting;Engineering profession;Information theory","","235","1","34","IEEE","28 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Shell cohesiveness was changed by varying phospholipid and emulsifier composition, and shell microstructure was controlled by postproduction processing. Individual microbubbles with initial resting diameters between 1 and 10 /spl mu/m were isolated and recorded during pulsing with brightfield and fluorescence video microscopy. Microbubble destruction occurred through two modes: acoustic dissolution at 400 and 600 kPa and fragmentation at 800 kPa peak negative pressure. Lipid composition significantly impacted the acoustic dissolution rate, fragmentation propensity, and mechanism of excess lipid shedding. Less cohesive shells resulted in micron-scale or smaller particles of excess lipid material that shed either spontaneously or on the next pulse. Conversely, more cohesive shells resulted in the buildup of shell-associated lipid strands and globular aggregates of several microns in size; the latter showed a significant increase in total shell surface area and lability. Lipid-coated microbubbles were observed to reach a stable size over many pulses at intermediate acoustic pressures. Observations of shell microstructure between pulses allowed interpretation of the state of the shell during oscillation. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for therapeutic and diagnostic applications involving lipid-coated microbubbles as ultrasound contrast agents and drug/gene delivery vehicles.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561668","","Lipidomics;Ultrasonic imaging;Acoustic pulses;Microstructure;Process control;Fluorescence;Microscopy;Aggregates;Drugs;Vehicles","Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Contrast Media;Contrast Media;Contrast Media;Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation;Lipids;Lipids;Lipids;Liposomes;Liposomes;Liposomes;Microbubbles;Particle Size;Radiation Dosage;Sonication","235","8","31","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the resonators have been demonstrated operating in the first three radial contour modes, allowing a significant frequency increase without scaling the device, and a 193 MHz resonator has been shown operating at atmospheric pressure with a Q of 8,880, evidence that vacuum packaging is not necessary for many applications.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements of fire radiative energy (FRE) release rates R/sub fre/ range from less than 10 to more than 1700 MW per pixel at 1-km resolution. To account for the effect of such a wide range of fire strengths/sizes on smoke emission rates, we have developed direct linear relationships between the MODIS-measured R/sub fre/ and smoke aerosol emission rates R/sub sa/ (in kilograms per second), derived by analyzing MODIS measurements of aerosol spatial distribution around the fires with National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research wind fields. We applied the technique to several regions around the world and derived a FRE-based smoke emission coefficient, C/sub e/ (in kilograms per megajoule), which can be simply multiplied by R/sub fre/ to calculate R/sub sa/. This new coefficient C/sub e/ is an excellent remote sensing parameter expressing the emission strength of different ecosystems and regions. Analysis of all 2002 MODIS data from Terra and Aqua satellites yielded C/sub e/ values of 0.02-0.06 kg/MJ for boreal regions, 0.04-0.08 kg/MJ for both tropical forests and savanna regions, and 0.08-0.1 kg/MJ for Western Russian regions. These results are probably overestimated by about 50% because of uncertainties in some of the data, parameters, and assumptions involved in the computations. This 50% overestimation is comparable to uncertainties in traditional emission factors. However, our satellite method shows great promise for accuracy improvement, as better knowledge is gained about the sources of the uncertainties.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.857328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1522624","Aerosol;biomass burning;fire radiative energy (FRE);Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);particulate matter;smoke emission","MODIS;Fires;Energy measurement;Satellites;Uncertainty;Aerosols;Pixel;Energy resolution;Image resolution;Atmospheric measurements","","234","","46","IEEE","24 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Media richness or media naturalness? The evolution of our biological communication apparatus and its influence on our behavior toward E-communication tools","N. Kock","Department of MIS and Decision Science, Texas A and M International University, Laredo, TX, USA",IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication,"31 May 2005","2005","48","2","117","130","E-communication in businesses has been the target of intense research. The theoretical hypotheses that have informed the media richness hypothesis have been influential in some circles and have also been strongly attacked by social theorists. It is argued in this paper that this theoretical polarization involving advocates of the media richness hypothesis and social theorists is due to two problems. The first is that there is a wealth of empirical evidence that provides direct support for the notion that human beings prefer the face-to-face medium for a variety of business tasks that involve communication, which seems to provide support for the media richness hypothesis. The second problem is that the media richness hypothesis is built on a vacuum, as no underlying explanation was ever presented by media richness theorists for our predisposition toward rich (or face-to-face) media. The main goal of this paper is to offer a solution to these problems by providing an alternative to the media richness hypothesis, referred to here as media naturalness hypothesis, developed based on Darwin's theory of evolution. The media naturalness hypothesis argues that, other things being equal, a decrease in the degree of naturalness of a communication medium (or its degree of similarity to the face-to-face medium) leads to the following effects in connection with a communication interaction: (a) increased cognitive effort, (b) increased communication ambiguity, and (c) decreased physiological arousal. Like the media richness hypothesis, the media naturalness hypothesis has important implications for the selection, use, and deployment of e-communication tools in organizations. However, unlike the media richness hypothesis, the media naturalness hypothesis is compatible with social theories of behavior toward e-communication tools. Among other things, this paper shows that the media naturalness hypothesis (unlike its media richness counterpart) is compatible with the notion that, regardless of the obstacles posed by low naturalness media, individuals using those media to perform collaborative tasks may achieve the same or better task-related outcomes than individuals using media with higher degrees of naturalness.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2005.849649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435624","Computer mediated communication;electronic communication;evolution theory;media;media richness theory;social influence model","Evolution (biology);Business communication;Humans;Internet;Polarization;Face;Collaboration;Web sites;Explosions;Laboratories","","233","","90","IEEE","31 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although linear combiners are the most frequently used combining rules, many important issues related to their operation for pattern classification tasks lack a theoretical basis. After a critical review of the framework developed in works by Turner and Ghosh [1996], [1999] on which our analysis is based, we focus on the simplest and most widely used implementation of linear combiners, which consists of assigning a nonnegative weight to each individual classifier. Moreover, we consider the ideal performance of this combining rule, i.e., that achievable when the optimal values of the weights are used. We do not consider the problem of weights estimation, which has been addressed in the literature. Our theoretical analysis shows how the performance of linear combiners, in terms of misclassification probability, depends on the performance of individual classifiers, and on the correlation between their outputs. In particular, we evaluate the ideal performance improvement that can be achieved using the weighted average over the simple average combining rule and investigate in what way it depends on the individual classifiers. Experimental results on real data sets show that the behavior of linear combiners agrees with the predictions of our analytical model. Finally, we discuss the contribution to the state of the art and the practical relevance of our theoretical and experimental analysis of linear combiners for multiple classifier systems.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424457","Index Terms- Multiple classifier systems;linear combiners;classifier fusion;pattern classification.","Pattern classification;Performance analysis;Analytical models;Bagging;Closed-form solution;Estimation error;Training data","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Linear Models;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sensitivity and Specificity","233","","34","IEEE","5 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In wired networks, nodes can monitor the medium to see how much bandwidth is being used. However, in ad hoc networks, communication from one node may consume the bandwidth of neighboring nodes. Therefore, the bandwidth consumption of flows and the available resources to a node are not local concepts, but related to the neighboring nodes in carrier-sensing range. Current solutions do not address how to perform admission control in such an environment so that the admitted flows in the network do not exceed network capacity. In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient admission control framework - contention-aware admission control protocol (CACP) - to support QoS in ad hoc networks.

Two second-order optical sidebands are obtained at the output of the notch filter. A millimeter-wave signal that has four times the frequency of the microwave drive signal is generated by beating the two second-order optical sidebands at a photodetector. Since no tunable optical filter is used, the system is easy to implement. A system using an LiNbO/sub 3/ intensity modulator and a fiber Bragg grating filter is built.

By increasing the number of phases it is also possible to increase the power /torque per rms ampere for the same volume machine. This paper, therefore, presents a simple and straightforward approach to develop an indirect field-oriented control (FOC) scheme for a six-phase induction machine with an arbitrary displacement between the two three-phase winding sets. The two current-controlled pulsewidth-modulation three-phase voltage-source inverter independently feeds the two sets of three-phase stator windings. The scheme is based on simple two-axis (d-q) model of the six-phase induction machine, and can be easily extended to any number of phases, which are multiples of three. The unbalanced current sharing between the two three-phase stator-winding sets observed in earlier schemes is automatically eliminated, and the practical implementation of the scheme is simple. Necessary experimental and simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed indirect FOC scheme.

Memory access times, however, have improved by less than 10% per year. The resulting gap between logic and memory performance has forced microprocessor designs toward complex and power-hungry architectures that support out-of-order and speculative execution. Moreover, processors have been designed with increasingly large cache hierarchies to hide main memory latency. This article examines how 3D IC technology can improve interactions between the processor and memory. Our work examines the performance of a single-core, single-threaded processor under representative work loads. We have shown that reducing memory latency by bringing main memory on chip gives us near-perfect performance. Three-dimensional IC technology can provide the much needed bandwidth without the cost, design complexity, and power issues associated with a large number of off-chip pins.

Its low latency makes it very suitable for common tasks, such as Web browsing, but insecure against traffic-analysis attacks by a global passive adversary. We present new traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams and therefore greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Furthermore, we show that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator Our attack is feasible for the adversary anticipated by the Tor designers. Our theoretical attacks are backed up by experiments performed on the deployed, albeit experimental, Tor network. Our techniques should also be applicable to any low latency anonymous network. These attacks highlight the relationship between the field of traffic-analysis and more traditional computer security issues, such as covert channel analysis. Our research also highlights that the inability to directly observe network links does not prevent an attacker from performing traffic-analysis: the adversary can use the anonymising network as an oracle to infer the traffic load on remote nodes in order to perform traffic-analysis.","2375-1207","0-7695-2339-0","10.1109/SP.2005.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425067","","Telecommunication traffic;Delay;Relays;Timing;Laboratories;Internet;Computer security;Communication networks;ISDN;Java","","233","4","42","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud cover, which curtails retrievals, and the presence of ephemeral and seasonal snow limit the snow-free data to approximately half the global land surfaces on an annual equal-angle basis. This precludes the MOD43B3 albedo products from being used in some remote sensing and ground-based applications, climate models, and global change research projects. An ecosystem-dependent temporal interpolation technique is described that has been developed to fill missing or seasonally snow-covered data in the official MOD43B3 albedo product. The method imposes pixel-level and local regional ecosystem-dependent phenological behavior onto retrieved pixel temporal data in such a way as to maintain pixel-level spatial and spectral detail and integrity. The phenological curves are derived from statistics based on the MODIS MOD12Q1 IGBP land cover classification product geolocated with the MOD43B3 data. The resulting snow-free value-added products provide the scientific community with spatially and temporally complete global white- and black-sky surface albedo maps and statistics.

A simple lossless clamp circuit can effectively clamp the switch turn-off voltage spike and totally recover the leakage energy.

The utility function measures the number of reliable bits transmitted by the user per joule of energy consumed. Focusing on linear receivers, the Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. It is shown that the equilibrium is one where the powers are signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio-balanced with the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector as the receiver. In addition, this framework is used to study power-control games for the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE detector; and the receivers' performance is compared in terms of the utilities achieved at equilibrium (in bits/joule). The optimal cooperative solution is also discussed and compared with the noncooperative approach. Extensions of the results to the case of multiple receive antennas are also presented.

In this application, the cells are unmarked (i.e., no fluorescent probe is used) and are observed under classical phase-contrast microscopy. By introducing an adaptive combination of several kernels, we address several problems such as variations in size and shape of the tracked objects (e.g., those occurring in the case of cell membrane extensions), the presence of incomplete (or noncontrasted) object boundaries, partially overlapping objects and object splitting (in the case of cell divisions or mitoses). Comparing the tracking results automatically obtained to those generated manually by a human expert, we tested the stability of the different algorithm parameters and their effects on the tracking results.

Such materials are capable of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy, but developing piezoelectric generators is challenging because of their poor source characteristics (high voltage, low current, high impedance) and relatively low power output. In the past these challenges have limited the development and application of piezoelectric generators, but the recent advent of extremely low power electrical and mechanical devices (e.g., MEMS) make such generators attractive. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of piezoelectric power generation that is verified with simulation and experimental results.

Also, the antenna gain within the operating band is measured and studied, and a 2-dB gain bandwidth of at least 1 GHz is achieved.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2005.848518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1438497","Bandwidth enhancement;microstrip-line-fed antennas;printed slot antennas","Bandwidth;Slot antennas;Microstrip antennas;Antenna measurements;Impedance measurement;Gain measurement;Antenna feeds;Polarization;Resonance;Geometry","","230","","7","IEEE","6 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The measured low frequency permittivity resulted in accordance with several classical dielectric mixing rules. The use of this material as elastomeric dielectric for planar actuators enabled a reduction of the driving electric fields, so that a transverse strain of 11% at 10 V//spl mu/m and a transverse stress of 16.5 kPa at 9 V//spl mu/m were obtained. These levels of strain and stress were respectively more than eight and four times higher than the corresponding values generated with the pure polymer matrix for analogous electrical stimuli.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2005.1511110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1511110","","Titanium;Powders;Ceramics;Dielectric materials;Polymers;Transmission line matrix methods;Capacitive sensors;Stress;Dielectric constant;Dielectric measurements","","230","2","67","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the object performs an action in 3D, the points on the outer boundary of the object are projected as 2D (x, y) contour in the image plane. A sequence of such 2D contours with respect to time generates a spatiotemporal volume (STV) in (x, y, t), which can be treated as 3D object in the (x, y, t) space. We analyze STV by using the differential geometric surface properties to identify action descriptors capturing both spatial and temporal properties. A set of action descriptors is called an action sketch. The first step in our approach is to generate STV by solving the point correspondence problem between consecutive frames. The correspondences are determined using a two-step graph theoretical approach. After the STV is generated, actions descriptors are computed by analyzing the differential geometric properties of STV. Finally, using these descriptors, we perform action recognition, which is also formulated as graph theoretical problem. Several experimental results are presented to demonstrate our approach.","1063-6919","0-7695-2372-2","10.1109/CVPR.2005.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467373","","Shape;Legged locomotion;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Humans;Computer vision;Hidden Markov models;Data mining;Trajectory;Computer science;Surface treatment","","230","3","13","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many researchers have attempted to study the relationship between the space charge and the breakdown; however, it has not been clarified yet. Although the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) method has been widely used to observe space charge profiles, previous works have not shown clear evidence of the influence of the space charge on the breakdown. Therefore, we have developed a new PEA system with an interval of 0.5 ms to observe the space charge distribution continuously under the ultra-high electric field. Using this system, we observed the space charge dynamics in the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at and around the breakdown. We also investigated the dependence of the applied electric field on space charge behavior. From the results, it is found that the injected charge packet moved faster and deeper under a relatively lower electric field rather than that under a higher electric field. Furthermore, we found that the maximum electric field in each specimen was almost the same when the breakdown happened in a specimen.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2005.1453444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453444","","Space charge;Polyethylene;Electric breakdown;Current measurement;Charge measurement;Dielectric measurements;Time measurement;Voltage;Acoustic pulses;Dielectric breakdown","","230","","18","IEEE","20 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To distinguish the polarity of the rotor magnet, the magnetic saturation effect can be used. The Taylor series can be used to describe the nonlinear magnetic saturation relationship between the current and the flux linkage in the d-axis rotor reference frame. The second-order term produces the second harmonic component of the carrier frequency, and the sign of its coefficient identifies the polarity of the rotor magnet being tracked.

The shift measurement can be done nonambiguously on the macro scale at an accuracy depending on the range resolution of the system or on the micro scale by employing interferometric methods. The latter suffers from phase cycle ambiguities and requires phase unwrapping. Modern wideband high-resolution SAR systems boast resolutions as small as a few tens of a wavelength. If sufficiently many samples are used for macro-scale shift estimation, the accuracy can be increased to a small fraction of a resolution cell and even in the order of a wavelength. Then, accurate absolute ranging becomes precise enough to support phase unwrapping or even make it obsolete. This letter establishes a few fundamental equations on the accuracy bounds of shift estimation accuracy for several algorithms: coherent speckle correlation, incoherent speckle correlation, split-band interferometry, a multifrequency approach, and correlation of point scatterers in clutter. It is shown that the performance of split-band interferometry is close to the Crame/spl acute/r-Rao bound for a broad variety of bandwidth ratios. Based on these findings, Delta-k systems are proposed to best take advantage of the available radar bandwidth.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2004.843203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420294","CramÉr–Rao bound (CRB);Delta-k interferometry;differential delay estimation;image correlation;speckle tracking;split-bandwidth interferometry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image coregistration","Interferometry;Wideband;Speckle;Bandwidth;Motion estimation;Synthetic aperture radar;Digital elevation models;Equations;Radar scattering;Clutter","","228","1","16","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a technique for early prediction of system defect density using a set of relative code churn measures that relate the amount of churn to other variables such as component size and the temporal extent of churn. Using statistical regression models, we show that while absolute measures of code chum are poor predictors of defect density, our set of relative measures of code churn is highly predictive of defect density. A case study performed on Windows Server 2003 indicates the validity of the relative code churn measures as early indicators of system defect density.

Limiting the harmonic distortion is essential to the power quality, but other requirements also contribute to a more safe grid-operation, especially in dispersed power generation networks. For instance, the knowledge of the utility impedance at the fundamental frequency can be used to detect a utility failure. A PV-inverter with this feature can anticipate a possible network problem and decouple it in time. This paper describes the digital implementation of a PV-inverter with different advanced, robust control strategies and an embedded online technique to determine the utility grid impedance. By injecting an interharmonic current and measuring the voltage response it is possible to estimate the grid impedance at the fundamental frequency. The presented technique, which is implemented with the existing sensors and the CPU of the PV-inverter, provides a fast and low cost approach for online impedance measurement, which may be used for detection of islanding operation. Practical tests on an existing PV-inverter validate the control methods, the impedance measurement, and the islanding detection.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.857506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1528622","Digital signal processors (DSPs);discrete Fourier transform (DFT);fixed-point arithmetic;grid impedance measurement;power system monitoring","Digital control;Impedance measurement;Photovoltaic systems;Frequency estimation;Solar power generation;Harmonic distortion;Power quality;Distributed power generation;Robust control;Current measurement","","227","5","29","IEEE","7 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Luminance is defined with full spatial resolution while chrominance contains subsampled opponent colors. Moreover, luminance and chrominance follow a particular arrangement in the Fourier domain, allowing for demosaicing by spatial frequency filtering. This model shows that visual artifacts after demosaicing are due to aliasing between luminance and chrominance and could be solved using a preprocessing filter. This approach also gives new insights for the representation of single-color per spatial location images and enables formal and controllable procedures to design demosaicing algorithms that perform well compared to concurrent approaches, as demonstrated by experiments.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2004.841200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407973","Color;demosaicing;Fourier analysis;linear filtering","Humans;Visual system;Cameras;Nonlinear filters;Laboratories;Color;Sensor arrays;Lattices;Retina;Image reconstruction","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biomimetics;Color;Colorimetry;Computer Graphics;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Vision","226","19","43","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Only one magnetic component is required in this converter. Efficiency is higher in high line input, so this converter is a preferable candidate for power products with the requirement of hold up time. For design convenience, relationship between dc gain and switching frequency, load resistance is deduced. Its open load characteristic and short load characteristic are exposed to provide theory basis for no load operation and over current protection. Design consideration of four dead times is presented to assure that voltage stress for main switches is within half of input voltage and ZVS for each main switch is achieved.

However, this transformation is not necessarily done with the ultimate data exploitation task in mind-for example, target detection or ground cover classification. Indeed, theoretically speaking it is possible that a lossy operation such as dimension reduction might have a negative impact on detection performance. This notion is investigated experimentally using real-world hyperspectral imaging data. The popular principal components transform [aka. principal components analysis (PCA)] is used to explore the impact that dimension reduction has on adaptive detection of difficult targets in both the reflective and emissive regimes. Using seven state-of-the-art algorithms, it is shown that in many cases PCA can have a minimal impact on the detection statistic value for a target that is spectrally similar to the background against which it is sought.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2005.846011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420303","Adaptive detection;dimension reduction;hyperspectral imaging (HSI)","Principal component analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Military computing;Discrete transforms;Object detection;Statistics;Detectors;Matched filters;Image sensors","","225","","22","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The combined strategy is shown to yield data rates that are arbitrarily close to the optimal operating point achieved when all network controllers are coordinated and have perfect knowledge of future events.

We consider uncertain or ill-defined nonaffine nonlinear systems and employ a neural network (NN) with flexible structure, i.e., an online variation of the number of neurons. The NN approximates and adaptively cancels an unknown plant nonlinearity. A control law and adaptive laws for the weights in the hidden layer and output layer of the NN are established so that the whole closed-loop system is stable in the sense of Lyapunov. Moreover, the tracking error is guaranteed to be uniformly asymptotically stable (UAS) rather than uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) with the aid of an additional robustifying control term. The proposed control algorithm is relatively simple and requires no restrictive conditions on the design constants for the stability. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is shown through the simulation of a simple nonaffine nonlinear system.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2004.841786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402502","Neural network (NN);nonaffine nonlinear system;robust adaptive control","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Neural networks;Adaptive systems;Flexible structures;Neurons;Error correction","Adaptation, Physiological;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics","224","","24","IEEE","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our formulation provides answers to three open questions:(l) whether the invariant local features are suitable for scene (rather than object) classification; (2) whether unsupennsed latent space models can be used for feature extraction in the classification task; and (3) whether the latent space formulation can discover visual co-occurrence patterns, motivating novel approaches for image organization and segmentation. Using a 9500-image dataset, our approach is validated on each of these issues. First, we show with extensive experiments on binary and multi-class scene classification tasks, that a bag-of-visterm representation, derived from local invariant descriptors, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Second, we show that probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) generates a compact scene representation, discriminative for accurate classification, and significantly more robust when less training data are available. Third, we have exploited the ability of PLSA to automatically extract visually meaningful aspects, to propose new algorithms for aspect-based image ranking and context-sensitive image segmentation.","2380-7504","0-7695-2334-X","10.1109/ICCV.2005.152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541347","","Layout;Image segmentation;Robustness;Image retrieval;Computer vision;Feature extraction;Data mining;Object recognition;Training data;Content based retrieval","","224","5","20","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, as the regulated areas are extended, they are difficult and time consuming to monitor by means of traditional reconnaissance methods such as planes and patrol vessels. On the contrary, satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides a powerful surveillance capability allowing the observation of broad expanses, independently from weather effects and from the day and night cycle. Unfortunately, the automatic interpretation of SAR images is often complicated, even though undetected targets are sometimes visible by eye. Attending to these particular circumstances, a novel approach for ship detection is proposed based on the analysis of SAR images by means of the discrete wavelet transform. The exposed method takes advantage of the difference of statistical behavior among the ships and the surrounding sea, interpreting the information through the wavelet coefficients in order to provide a more reliable detection. The analysis of the detection performance over both simulated and real images confirms the robustness of the proposed algorithm.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2005.845033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420305","Multiresolution analysis;ship detection;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery;wavelet transform","Marine vehicles;Wavelet transforms;Image analysis;Discrete wavelet transforms;Monitoring;Reconnaissance;Synthetic aperture radar;Surveillance;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet coefficients","","224","","6","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the past few years have shown a sharp increase in ADC performance, we have shown that performance and power dissipation depend greatly on the ADC structure and the target applications. With the progression of wideband radio systems like UWB and OFDM comes a growing demand to provide faster sampling rates and higher resolutions with lower power dissipation.

The predictor generation engine for intra prediction and the transform engine for mode decision are critical because the operations require a lot of memory access and occupy 80% of the computation time of the entire intra compression process. A low cost general purpose processor cannot process these operations in real time. In this paper, we proposed two solutions for platform-based design of H.264/AVC intra frame coder. One solution is a software implementation targeted at low-end applications. Context-based decimation of unlikely candidates, subsampling of matching operations, bit-width truncation to reduce the computations, and interleaved full-search/partial-search strategy to stop the error propagation and to maintain the image quality, are proposed and combined as our fast algorithm. Experimental results show that our method can reduce 60% of the computation used for intra prediction and mode decision while keeping the peak signal-to-noise ratio degradation less than 0.3 dB. The other solution is a hardware accelerator targeted at high-end applications. After comprehensive analysis of instructions and exploration of parallelism, we proposed our system architecture with four-parallel intra prediction and mode decision to enhance the processing capability. Hadamard-based mode decision is modified as discrete cosine transform-based version to reduce 40% of memory access. Two-stage macroblock pipelining is also proposed to double the processing speed and hardware utilization. The other features of our design are reconfigurable predictor generator supporting all of the 13 intra prediction modes, parallel multitransform and inverse transform engine, and CAVLC bitstream engine. A prototype chip is fabricated with TSMC 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS 1P5M technology.

The effective underlap significantly relaxes the fin-thickness requirement for control of short-channel effects (SCEs) via a bias-dependent effective channel length (L/sub eff/), which is long in weak inversion and approaches the gate length in strong inversion. Dependence of L/sub eff/ on the S/D doping profile defines a design tradeoff regarding SCEs and S/D series resistance that can be optimized, depending on the fin width, via engineering of the doping profile in the S/D fin-extensions. The noted optimization is exemplified via a well-tempered FinFET design with an 18-nm gate length, showing further that designs with effective underlap yield minimal parasitic capacitance and reduce leakage components such as gate-induced drain leakage current.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2004.841333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1372708","Effective channel length;FinFETs;nanoscale CMOS devices;source/drain extensions;underlap","MOSFETs;Leakage currents;Semiconductor device modeling","","223","4","21","IEEE","27 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we present a sequential finite element model of E distribution in tissue which considers local changes in tissue conductivity due to permeabilization. These changes affect the pattern of the field distribution during the high voltage pulse application. The presented model consists of a sequence of static models (steps), which describe E distribution at discrete time intervals during tissue permeabilization and in this way present the dynamics of electropermeabilization. The tissue conductivity for each static model in a sequence is determined based on E distribution from the previous step by considering a sigmoid dependency between specific conductivity and E intensity. Such a dependency was determined by parameter estimation on a set of current measurements, obtained by in vivo experiments. Another set of measurements was used for model validation. All experiments were performed on rabbit liver tissue with inserted needle electrodes. Model validation was carried out in four different ways: 1) by comparing reversibly permeabilized tissue computed by the model and the reversibly permeabilized area of tissue as obtained in the experiments; 2) by comparing the area of irreversibly permeabilized tissue computed by the model and the area where tissue necrosis was observed in experiments; 3) through the comparison of total current at the end of pulse and computed current in the last step of sequential electropermeabilization model; 4) by comparing total current during the first pulse and current computed in consecutive steps of a modeling sequence. The presented permeabilization model presents the first approach of describing the course of permeabilization on tissue level. Despite some approximations (ohmic tissue behavior) the model can predict the permeabilized volume of tissue, when exposed to electrical treatment. Therefore, the most important contribution and novelty of the model is its potentiality to be used as a tool for determining parameters for effective tissue permeabilization.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.845212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420703","Electrochemotherapy;electro gene transfer;electropermeabilization;modeling;validation","Finite element methods;Biological system modeling;Conductivity;Biological tissues;Biomembranes;Permeability;Biological cells;Voltage;Parameter estimation;Current measurement","Animals;Cell Membrane Permeability;Cell Membrane Permeability;Computer Simulation;Electric Conductivity;Electric Stimulation;Electromagnetic Fields;Electroporation;Finite Element Analysis;Liver;Liver;Models, Biological;Rabbits","222","30","46","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The accuracy of a traffic-simulation system depends highly on the quality of the traffic-flow model at its core, with the two main critical components being the car-following and lane-changing models. This paper presents findings from a comparative evaluation of car-following behavior in a number of traffic simulators [advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks (AIMSUN), parallel microscopic simulation (PARAMICS), and Verkehr in Stadten-simulation (VISSIM)]. The car-following algorithms used in these simulators have been developed from a variety of theoretical backgrounds and are reported to have been calibrated on a number of different data sets. Very few independent studies have attempted to evaluate the performance of the underlying algorithms based on the same data set. The results reported in this study are based on a car-following experiment that used instrumented vehicles to record the speed and relative distance between follower and leader vehicles on a one-lane road. The experiment was replicated in each tool and the simulated car-following behavior was compared to the field data using a number of error tests. The results showed lower error values for the Gipps-based models implemented in AIMSUN and similar error values for the psychophysical spacing models used in VISSIM and PARAMICS. A qualitative ""drift and goal-seeking behavior"" test, which essentially shows how the distance headway between leader and follower vehicles should oscillate around a stable distance, also confirmed the findings.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2005.853705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1504791","Car-following models;microscopic traffic simulation","Microscopy;Traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Road vehicles;Testing;Intelligent systems;Vehicle dynamics;Analytical models;Instruments;Psychology","","222","","38","IEEE","6 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed algorithms are obtained as an application of the sum-product algorithm to the factor graph representing the joint a posteriori probability mass function of the information bits given the channel output. In order to overcome the problems due to the presence in the factor graph of continuous random variables, we apply the method of canonical distributions . Several choices of canonical distributions have been considered in the literature. Well-known approaches consist of discretizing continuous variables or treating them as jointly Gaussian, thus obtaining a Kalman estimator. Our first new approach, based on the Fourier series expansion of the phase probability density function, yields better complexity/performance tradeoff with respect to the usual discretized-phase method. Our second new approach, based on the Tikhonov canonical distribution, yields near-optimal performance at very low complexity and is shown to be much more robust than the Kalman method to the placement of pilot symbols in the coded frame. We present numerical results for binary LDPC codes and LDPC-coded modulation, with particular reference to some phase-noise models and coded-modulation formats standardized in the next-generation satellite Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB-S2).

We assume that the probability densities associated with the image pixel intensities within each region are completely unknown a priori, and we formulate the problem based on nonparametric density estimates. Due to the nonparametric structure, our method does not require the image regions to have a particular type of probability distribution and does not require the extraction and use of a particular statistic. We solve the information-theoretic optimization problem by deriving the associated gradient flows and applying curve evolution techniques. We use level-set methods to implement the resulting evolution. The experimental results based on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed technique can solve a variety of challenging image segmentation problems. Furthermore, our method, which does not require any training, performs as good as methods based on training.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.854442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510684","Curve evolution;image segmentation;information theory;level-set methods;nonparametric density estimation","Statistical analysis;Image segmentation;Information theory;Parametric statistics;Laboratories;Pixel;Mutual information;Probability distribution;Statistical distributions;Pattern recognition","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Information Theory;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","222","2","44","IEEE","19 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally, they are divided into conventional push-type endoscopes and more recently developed wireless capsule-type endoscopes. The conventional endoscopes cannot reach the small intestines and generate pain and discomfort to patients due to the stiffness of their body. Such disadvantages do not exist in wireless capsule-type endoscopes. However, commercialized capsule-type endoscopes move passively by peristaltic waves (and the gravity), which makes it impossible for doctors to diagnose the areas of his or her interest more thoroughly and actively. To address this problem of passivity, a locomotive mechanism is proposed for wireless capsule-type endoscopes. Prototypes with micro brushless dc motors, ionic polymer metal composite actuator, and shape memory alloy (SMA) wires are designed and fabricated for preliminary tests. Based on the tests, spring-type SMA actuators are selected to be microactuators for capsule endoscopes. Thus, two-way linear actuators using a pair of SMA springs are developed based on a static analysis on them. Moreover, a simple and effective clamping device is developed based on biomimetic approach. A prototype endoscope with four pairs of SMA springs and four clampers was developed. It has 13 mm in diameter and 33 mm in total length, with a hollow space of 7.6 mm in diameter to house other parts that are needed for endoscopy such as a camera, an RF module, sensors, e.g., for endoscopic ultrasound, and a battery. A sequential control of the four actuators improves the efficiency of locomotion up to four times. To validate the performance of the proposed locomotive mechanism, a series of experiments were carried out including in-vitro tests. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed locomotion mechanism is effective to be used for micro capsule-type endoscopes.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2004.842222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1395870","Capsule-type endoscopes;clampers;sequential control;shape memory alloy (SMA);two-way SMA springs","Fabrication;Endoscopes;Shape memory alloys;Actuators;Testing;Prototypes;Springs;Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Gastrointestinal tract","","222","18","15","IEEE","22 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the girth of a QC-LDPC code is upper-bounded by a certain number which is determined by the positions of circulant permutation matrices.

The underlying idea is that global nonlinear data structures are locally linear and local structures can be linearly aligned. Input vectors are projected into each local feature space by linear transformations found to yield locally linearly transformed classes that maximize the between-class covariance while minimizing the within-class covariance. In face recognition, linear discriminant analysis (LIDA) has been widely adopted owing to its efficiency, but it does not capture nonlinear manifolds of faces which exhibit pose variations. Conventional nonlinear classification methods based on kernels such as generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) and support vector machine (SVM) have been developed to overcome the shortcomings of the linear method, but they have the drawback of high computational cost of classification and overfitting. Our method is for multiclass nonlinear discrimination and it is computationally highly efficient as compared to GDA. The method does not suffer from overfitting by virtue of the linear base structure of the solution. A novel gradient-based learning algorithm is proposed for finding the optimal set of local linear bases. The optimization does not exhibit a local-maxima problem. The transformation functions facilitate robust face recognition in a low-dimensional subspace, under pose variations, using a single model image. The classification results are given for both synthetic and real face data.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388259","Index Terms- Linear discriminant analysis;generalized discriminant analysis;support vector machine;dimensionality reduction;face recognition;feature extraction;pose invariance;subspace representation.","Linear discriminant analysis;Face recognition;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Image analysis;Data structures;Manifolds;Kernel;Computational efficiency;Robustness","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Discriminant Analysis;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Linear Models;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Statistical Distributions","221","1","34","IEEE","31 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We therefore propose a new iterative method for performing KPCA, the kernel Hebbian algorithm, which iteratively estimates the kernel principal components with only linear order memory complexity. In our experiments, we compute models for complex image classes such as faces and natural images which require a large number of training examples. The resulting image models are tested in single-frame super-resolution and denoising applications. The KPCA model is not specifically tailored to these tasks; in fact, the same model can be used in super-resolution with variable input resolution, or denoising with unknown noise characteristics, in spite of this, both super-resolution and denoising performance are comparable to existing methods.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1471703","Index Terms- Principal component analysis;kernel methods;image models;image enhancement;unsupervised learning.","Kernel;Principal component analysis;Noise reduction;Iterative algorithms;Image coding;Image resolution;Image analysis;Image processing;Unsupervised learning;Independent component analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis","221","","51","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Alternatively, a no-regret learning implementation is proposed for both scenarios and it is shown to have similar performance with the potential game when cooperation is enforced, but with a higher variability across users. The no-regret learning formulation is particularly useful to accommodate selfish users. Non-cooperative learning games have the advantage of a very low overhead for information exchange in the network.

Statistical means of clusters provide shapes to be clustered at the next higher level, thus building a hierarchy of shapes. Using finite-dimensional approximations of spaces tangent to the shape space at sample means, we (implicitly) impose probability models on the shape space, and results are illustrated via random sampling and classification (hypothesis testing).

The methods we considered were: support vector machine (SVM), kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD), relevance vector machine (RVM), and committee machines (ensemble averaging and AdaBoost), of which most have been developed recently in statistical learning theory. We formulated differentiation of malignant from benign MCs as a supervised learning problem, and applied these learning methods to develop the classification algorithm. As input, these methods used image features automatically extracted from clustered MCs. We tested these methods using a database of 697 clinical mammograms from 386 cases, which included a wide spectrum of difficult-to-classify cases. We analyzed the distribution of the cases in this database using the multidimensional scaling technique, which reveals that in the feature space the malignant cases are not trivially separable from the benign ones. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate and to compare classification performance by the different methods. In addition, we also investigated how to combine information from multiple-view mammograms of the same case so that the best decision can be made by a classifier. In our experiments, the kernel-based methods (i.e., SVM, KFD, and RVM) yielded the best performance (A/sub z/=0.85, SVM), significantly outperforming a well-established, clinically-proven CADx approach that is based on neural network (A/sub z/=0.80).","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2004.842457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1397824","Clustered microcalcifications;computer-aided diagnosis;kernel methods;mammography;relevance vector machine;support vector machine","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Image databases;Spatial databases;Computer aided diagnosis;Breast cancer;Kernel;Statistical learning;Supervised learning;Learning systems","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Calcinosis;Calcinosis;Female;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Precancerous Conditions;Precancerous Conditions;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Severity of Illness Index","220","1","42","IEEE","28 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The significant parameters of a lightning flash are: peak current, waveshape and velocity of the return stroke, the total flash charge and /spl int/I/sup 2/dt. Negative first strokes have traditionally been considered to produce the worst stress on the system insulation. The subsequent negative strokes have significantly lower peak current but shorter wavefronts. This may stress the system insulation more. The positive strokes have about the same median current value as the negative first strokes and longer fronts, thus producing less stress. However, their duration is longer than that of the negative strokes. Therefore, the system insulation may be damaged because of the lower volt-time characteristic for long-duration waves. The positive strokes may also cause more thermal damage because of their significantly higher charge and /spl int/I/sup 2/dt. The relationship between the return-stroke velocity and the current peak is a significant parameter in estimating lightning-induced voltages and also in estimating the peak current from the radiated electromagnetic fields of the lightning channel. For better accuracy, the current and the velocity should be measured simultaneously. Better methods to measure the stroke current need to be developed. Correlation coefficient between various lightning parameters is another important parameter which will affect the analysis significantly. Lightning characteristics should be classified according to geographical regions and seasons instead of assuming these characteristics to be globally uniform.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2004.835039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375114","Lightning parameters;lightning statistics","Statistics;Electromagnetic fields;Velocity measurement;Current measurement","","219","","37","IEEE","14 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

HRV is calculated from the variations in the beat-to-beat (RR) interval timing of the cardiac cycle which are inherently irregularly spaced in time. In order to produce an evenly sampled time series prior to FFT-based spectral estimation, linear or cubic spline resampling is usually employed. In this paper, by using a realistic artificial RR interval generator, interpolation and resampling is shown to result in consistent over-estimations of the power spectral density (PSD) compared with the theoretical solution. The Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, a more appropriate spectral estimation technique for unevenly sampled time series that uses only the original data, is shown to provide a superior PSD estimate. Ectopy removal or replacement is shown to be essential regardless of the spectral estimation technique. Resampling and phantom beat replacement is shown to decrease the accuracy of PSD estimation, even at low levels of ectopy or artefact. A linear relationship between the frequency of ectopy/artefact and the error (mean and variance) of the PSD estimate is demonstrated. Comparisons of PSD estimation techniques performed on real RR interval data during minimally active segments (sleep) demonstrate that the LS periodogram provides a less noisy spectral estimate of HRV.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.844028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1408120","Beat replacement;fast Fourier transform;heart rate variability;interpolation;irregular sampling;Lomb periodogram;resampling;sleep;uneven sampling","Heart rate variability;Frequency estimation;Fast Fourier transforms;Timing;Spline;Power generation;Interpolation;Imaging phantoms;Sleep;Active noise reduction","Adult;Algorithms;Biological Clocks;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Sample Size;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sleep","219","1","36","IEEE","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the medium and low speed range, the SRG phase current is regulated using pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) control of the magnetizing voltage. For high speeds the generator is controlled using a single pulse mode. In order to interface the SRG to the grid (or ac load) a voltage-source PWM inverter is used.

"A cluster-based approach for detecting man-made objects and changes in imagery","M. J. Carlotto","General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Inc., Rosslyn, VA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"24 Jan 2005","2005","43","2","374","387","A new unified approach to object and change detection is presented that involves clustering and analyzing the distribution of pixel values within clusters over one or more images. Cluster-based anomaly detection (CBAD) can detect man-made objects that are: (1) present in a single multiband image; (2) appear or disappear between two images acquired at different times; or (3) manifest themselves as spectral differences between two sets of bands acquired at the same time. Based on a Gaussian mixture model, CBAD offers an alternative to compute-intensive, sliding-window algorithms like Reed and Yu's RX-algorithm for single-image object detection. It assumes that background pixel values within clusters can be modeled as Gaussian distributions about mean values that vary cluster-to-cluster and that anomalies (man-made objects) have values that deviate significantly from the distribution of the cluster. This model is valid in situations where the frequency of occurrence of man-made objects is low compared to the background so that they do not form distinct clusters, but are instead split up among multiple background clusters. CBAD estimates background statistics over clusters, not sliding windows, and so can detect objects of any size or shape. This provides the flexibility of filtering detections at the object level. Examples show the ability to detect small compact objects such as vehicles as well as large, spatially extended features (e.g., built-up and bomb-damaged areas). Unlike previous approaches to change detection, which compare pixels, vectors, features, or objects, cluster-based change detection involves no direct comparison of images. In fact, it is identical to the object detection algorithm, different only in the way it is applied. Preliminary results show cluster-based change detection is less sensitive to image misregistration errors than global change detection. The same cluster-based algorithm can also be used for cross-spectral anomaly detection. An example showing the detection of thermal anomalies in Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery is provided.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.841481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386509","Change detection;Gaussian processes;image analysis;image representations;image sequence analysis;object detection;pattern clustering methods;vector quantization","Object detection;Clustering algorithms;Pixel;Change detection algorithms;Image analysis;Gaussian distribution;Frequency;Statistical distributions;Shape;Filtering","","218","2","37","IEEE","24 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method proposes a minimal sensor configuration with one sensor module mounted on each segment. The model is based on estimating the acceleration of the joint center of rotation by placing a pair of virtual sensors on the adjacent segments at the center of rotation. In the proposed technique, joint angles are found without the need for integration, so absolute angles can be obtained which are free from any source of drift. The model considers anatomical aspects and is personalized for each subject prior to each measurement. The method was validated by measuring knee flexion-extension angles of eight subjects, walking at three different speeds, and comparing the results with a reference motion measurement system. The results are very close to those of the reference system presenting very small errors (rms=1.3, mean=0.2, SD=1.1 deg) and excellent correlation coefficients (0.997). The algorithm is able to provide joint angles in real-time, and ready for use in gait analysis. Technically, the system is portable, easily mountable, and can be used for long term monitoring without hindrance to natural activities.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.851475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1463337","Accelerometer and gyroscope;ambulatory system;biomechanics;gait analysis;joint angle","Accelerometers;Gyroscopes;Goniometers;Joints;Motion measurement;Acceleration;Velocity measurement;Knee;Legged locomotion;Algorithm design and analysis","Acceleration;Adult;Aged;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Humans;Knee Joint;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Movement;Range of Motion, Articular;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Transducers","218","3","20","IEEE","11 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic idea is to find a spatio-temporal deformation field that effectively compensates for the motion by minimizing a difference with respect to a reference frame. The key feature of our method is the use of a semi-local spatio-temporal parametric model for the deformation using splines, and the reformulation of the registration task as a global optimization problem. The scale of the spline model controls the smoothness of the displacement field. Our algorithm uses a multiresolution optimization strategy to obtain a higher speed and robustness. We evaluated the accuracy of our algorithm using a synthetic sequence generated with an ultrasound simulation package, together with a realistic cardiac motion model. We compared our new global multiframe approach with a previous method based on pairwise registration of consecutive frames to demonstrate the benefits of introducing temporal consistency. Finally, we applied the algorithm to the regional analysis of the left ventricle.

Thus, we eliminate the processing constraints of static sensor nodes and the need for static reference beacons. Our mathematical contribution is the use of a robust extended Kalman filter (REKF)-based state estimator to solve the localization.

In this work we present an RFID authentication protocol that enforces user privacy and protects against tag cloning. We designed our protocol with both tag-to-reader and reader-to-tag authentication in mind; unless both types of authentication are applied, any protocol can be shown to be prone to either cloning or privacy attacks. Our scheme is based on the use of a secret shared between tag and database that is refreshed to avoid tag tracing. However, this is done in such a way so that efficiency of identification is not sacrificed. Additionally, our protocol is very simple and it can be implemented easily with the use of standard cryptographic hash functions. In analyzing our protocol, we identify several attacks that can be applied to RFID protocols and we demonstrate the security of our scheme. Furthermore, we show how forward privacy is guaranteed; messages seen today will still be valid in the future, even after the tag has been compromised.","","0-7695-2369-2","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607559","","Radiofrequency identification;Protection;Cloning;Privacy;Authentication;Cryptographic protocols;RFID tags;Cryptography;Productivity;Databases","","216","4","16","IEEE","20 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An excessive number of active nodes lead to higher energy consumption and it places more demand on the limited network bandwidth. We present an efficient technique for the selection of active sensor nodes in dense sensor networks. The active node selection procedure is aimed at providing the highest possible coverage of the sensor field, i.e., the surveillance area. It also assures network connectivity for routing and information dissemination. We first show that the coverage-centric active nodes selection problem is NP-complete. We then present a distributed approach based on the concept of a connected dominating set (CDS). We prove that the set of active nodes selected by our approach provides full coverage and connectivity.

Second, when the fault is not time piecewise continuously differentiable but bounded (like actuator noise) or s~th time derivative of fault is not null but bounded too, a high gain observer is derived to attenuate the fault impact in estimation errors.

The proposed approach applies the Benders decomposition for separating the unit commitment (UC) in the master problem from the network security check in subproblems. The master problem applies the augmented Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method and dynamic programming (DP) to solve UC. The subproblem checks ac network security constraints for the UC solution to determine whether a converged and secure ac power flow can be obtained. If any network violations arise, corresponding Benders cuts will be formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC.

In this work, a new automatic satellite image registration approach is proposed. This technique exploits the invariant relations between regions of a reference and a sensed image, respectively. It involves an edge-based selection of the most distinctive control points (CPs) in the reference image. The search for the corresponding CPs in the sensed image is based on local similarity detection by means of template matching according to a combined invariants-based similarity measure. The final warping of the images according to the selected CPs is performed by using the thin-plate spline interpolation. The procedure is fully automatic and computationally efficient. The proposed algorithm for this technique has been successfully applied to register multitemporal SPOT and synthetic aperture radar images from urban and agricultural areas.

Performance is affected by both temperature and supply voltage because of the temperature and voltage dependence of circuit delay. Furthermore, as semiconductor technology scales down, leakage power's exponential dependence on temperature and supply voltage becomes significant. Therefore, future design studies call for temperature and voltage aware performance and power modeling. In this paper, we study microarchitecture-level temperature and voltage aware performance and power modeling. We present a leakage power model with temperature and voltage scaling, and show that leakage and total energy vary by 38% and 24%, respectively, between 65/spl deg/C and 110/spl deg/C. We study thermal runaway induced by the interdependence between temperature and leakage power, and demonstrate that without temperature-aware modeling, underestimation of leakage power may lead to the failure of thermal controls, and overestimation of leakage power may result in excessive performance penalties of up to 5.24%. All of these studies underscore the necessity of temperature-aware power modeling. Furthermore, we study optimal voltage scaling for best performance with dynamic power and thermal management under different packaging options. We show that dynamic power and thermal management allows designs to target at the common-case thermal scenario among benchmarks and improves performance by 6.59% compared to designs targeted at the worst case thermal scenario without dynamic power and thermal management. Additionally, the optimal V/sub dd/ for the best performance may not be the largest V/sub dd/ allowed by the given packaging platform, and that advanced cooling techniques can improve throughput significantly.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2005.850860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1458931","Floorplan;leakage power;microarchitecture;temperature;thermal management","Voltage;Microarchitecture;Thermal management;Temperature dependence;Energy management;Packaging;Power system modeling;Handheld computers;Circuits;Delay","","216","7","39","IEEE","27 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the rapid growth of wireless technologies, current spectrum scarcity has become a serious problem as more and more wireless applications compete for very little spectrum. On the other hand, the licensed spectrum allocated to applications such as television, cellular telephony and public safety show very little usage over time at different geographical locations. This has, therefore, seriously impaired the evolution of newer technologies because of current regulatory constraints on the operation in licensed spectrum, such as TV bands, and is being addressed by FCC through recent rule makings. With the goal of ubiquitous communication in mind, we look into spectrum agile radios as a new technology enabled by such emerging regulatory rulings and study its advantages over conventional radios. Initially, we provide a simple mathematical modeling to understand the utilization that is achievable by spectrum agile radios. Next, we investigate several issues related to spectrum sensing, as it is one of the key pillars to realize spectrum agile radios. Through sensing, the spectrum agile radio identifies the so-called ""white-spaces"" in the spectrum and then decides whether to occupy those white spaces opportunistically to transmit data. We also discuss the concept of interference temperature introduced by the FCC, and propose a spectrum-aware sensor network as a way to address it Finally, we extend this spectrum-aware sensor networks to introduce a new sensing architecture to identify and locate white spaces in the spectrum","","1-4244-0013-9","10.1109/DYSPAN.2005.1542631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542631","","White spaces;Temperature sensors;TV;FCC;Resource management;Wireless sensor networks;Telephony;Safety;Mathematical model;Interference","","216","1","17","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In one case, a weak turbulence (clear-air) scenario is considered, for which the received signal intensity may be modeled as a log-normal random process. In the other case, we consider a negative exponentially distributed received signal intensity. To arrive at the desired results, it is assumed that the system uses a binary PPM (BPPM) modulation scheme. Furthermore, it is assumed that the receiver thermal noise is nonnegligible, and that the average signal intensity is large enough to justify a Gaussian approximation at the receiver.

Instead of time synchronization between just the sender and receiver or within a local group of sensor nodes, some applications require the sensor nodes to maintain a similar time within a certain tolerance throughout the lifetime of the network. The Time-Diffusion Synchronization Protocol (TDP) is proposed as a network-wide time synchronization protocol. It allows the sensor network to reach an equilibrium time and maintains a small time deviation tolerance from the equilibrium time.

A histogram is a zeroth-order spatiogram, while second-order spatiograms contain spatial means and covariances for each histogram bin. This spatial information still allows quite general transformations, as in a histogram, but captures a richer description of the target to increase robustness in tracking. We show how to use spatiograms in kernel-based trackers, deriving a mean shift procedure in which individual pixels vote not only for the amount of shift but also for its direction. Experiments show improved tracking results compared with histograms, using both mean shift and exhaustive local search.","1063-6919","0-7695-2372-2","10.1109/CVPR.2005.330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467574","","Histograms;Robustness;Target tracking;Hafnium;US Department of Transportation;Voting;Indexing;Shape;Pixel;Probability distribution","","213","11","11","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By effectively using levels of granularity, granular computing provides a systematic, natural way to analyze, understand, represent, and solve real world problems.

Therefore, this study aims to develop a cuff-less and noninvasive technique for measuring BP by pulse transit time.

Considering that preventive maintenance, and repair affect both available production time, and the probability of machine failure, we are surprised that this inter-dependency seems to be overlooked in the literature. We propose an integrated model that coordinates preventive maintenance planning decisions with single-machine scheduling decisions so that the total expected weighted completion time of jobs is minimized. Note that the machine of interest is subject to minimal repair upon failure, and can be renewed by preventive maintenance. We investigate the value of integrating production scheduling with preventive maintenance planning by conducting an extensive experimental study using small scheduling problems. We compare the performance of the integrated solution with the solutions obtained from solving the preventive maintenance planning, and job scheduling problems independently. For the problems studied, integrating the two decision-making processes resulted in an average improvement of approximately 2% and occasional improvements of as much as 20%. Depending on the nature of the manufacturing system, an average savings of 2% may be significant. Certainly, savings in this range indicate that integrated preventive maintenance planning, and production scheduling should be focused on critical (bottleneck) machines. Because we use total enumeration to solve the integrated model for small problems, we propose a heuristic approach for solving larger problems. Our analysis is based on minimizing total weighted completion time; thus, both the scheduling, and maintenance problems favor processing shorter jobs in the beginning of the schedule. Given that due-date-based objectives, such as minimizing total weighted job tardiness, present more apparent trade-offs & conflicts between preventive maintenance planning, and job scheduling, we believe that integrated preventive maintenance planning & production scheduling is a worthwhile area of study.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2005.845967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435724","Minimal repair;optimization;preventive maintenance;production scheduling;renewal;Weibull distribution","Preventive maintenance;Production planning;Single machine scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Manufacturing systems;Probability distribution;Process planning;Operations research;Decision making;Job production systems","","213","","28","IEEE","31 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing compression algorithms are not applicable for sensor nodes because of their limited resource.

Current collaborative filtering (CF) techniques such as correlation and SVD based methods provide good accuracy, but are computationally expensive and can be deployed only in static off-line settings. However, a number of practical scenarios require dynamic real-time collaborative filtering that can allow new users, items and ratings to enter the system at a rapid rate. In this paper, we consider a novel CF approach based on a proposed weighted co-clustering algorithm (Banerjee et al., 2004) that involves simultaneous clustering of users and items. We design incremental and parallel versions of the co-clustering algorithm and use it to build an efficient real-time CF framework. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach provides an accuracy comparable to that of the correlation and matrix factorization based approaches at a much lower computational cost.","2374-8486","0-7695-2278-5","10.1109/ICDM.2005.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565742","","Recommender systems;Clustering algorithms;Real time systems;Computer science;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Information filtering;Information filters;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational efficiency;Internet","","212","4","11","IEEE","3 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, a suitable data-transmission format must be used to allow an efficient implementation of the equalizer in the frequency domain, by means of the discrete Fourier transform. Two design methods are considered. In the first method, hard detected data are used as input of the feedback, and filters are designed according to the correlation between detected and transmitted data. In the second method, the feedback signal is directly designed from soft detection of the equalized signal at the previous iteration. Estimators of the parameters involved in the IBDFE design are also derived. From performance simulations on a wireless dispersive fading channel, we observed that the IBDFE outperforms existing DFEs. Moreover, the IBDFE exhibits a reduction of the computational complexity when compared against existing schemes, both in signal processing and in filter design.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2005.858666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532483","Decision-feedback equalizer (DFE);discrete Fourier transform (DFT);frequency domain;hard detection;iterative equalizer;soft detection","Frequency domain analysis;Decision feedback equalizers;Filters;Computational complexity;Dispersion;Signal design;Discrete Fourier transforms;Design methodology;Parameter estimation;Computational modeling","","212","1","18","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been used widely in many applications involving high-dimensional data, such as image and text classification. An intrinsic limitation of classical LDA is the so-called singularity problems; that is, it fails when all scatter matrices are singular. Many LDA extensions were proposed in the past to overcome the singularity problems. Among these extensions, PCA+LDA, a two-stage method, received relatively more attention. In PCA+LDA, the LDA stage is preceded by an intermediate dimension reduction stage using principal component analysis (PCA). Most previous LDA extensions are computationally expensive, and not scalable, due to the use of singular value decomposition or generalized singular value decomposition. In this paper, we propose a two-stage LDA method, namely LDA/QR, which aims to overcome the singularity problems of classical LDA, while achieving efficiency and scalability simultaneously. The key difference between LDA/QR and PCA+LDA lies in the first stage, where LDA/QR applies QR decomposition to a small matrix involving the class centroids, while PCA+LDA applies PCA to the total scatter matrix involving all training data points. We further justify the proposed algorithm by showing the relationship among LDA/QR and previous LDA methods. Extensive experiments on face images and text documents are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432722","Linear discriminant analysis;dimension reduction;QR decomposition;classification.","Linear discriminant analysis;Scattering;Matrix decomposition;Singular value decomposition;Principal component analysis;Text categorization;Feature extraction;Scalability;Training data;Face recognition","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Discriminant Analysis;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Linear Models;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","211","1","34","IEEE","5 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analysis of electricity price time series reflects a switching nature, related to discrete changes in competitors' strategies, which can be represented by a set of dynamic models sequenced together by a Markov chain. An input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM) is proposed for analyzing and forecasting electricity spot prices. The model provides both good predictions in terms of accuracy as well as dynamic information about the market. In this way, different market states are identified and characterized by their more relevant explanatory variables. Moreover, a conditional probability transition matrix governs the probabilities of remaining in the same state, or changing to another, whenever a new market session is opened.

The operators dynamically compete for customers as well as portions of available spectrum. The operators are charged by the SPS for the amount of bandwidth they use in their services. Through demand responsive pricing, the operators try to come up with convincing service offers for the customers, while trying to maximize their profits. We first consider a single-user system as an illustrative example. We formulate the competition between the operators as a non-cooperative game and propose an SPS-based iterative bidding scheme that results in Nash equilibrium of the game. Numerical results suggest that, competition increases the user's (customer's) acceptance probability of the offered service, while reducing the profits achieved by the operators. It is also observed that as the cost of unit bandwidth increases relative to the cost of unit infrastructure (fixed cost), the operator with superior technology (higher fixed cost) becomes more competitive. We then extend the framework to a multiuser setting where the operators are competing for a number of users at once. We propose an SPS-based bandwidth allocation scheme in which the SPS optimally allocates bandwidth portions for each user-operator session to maximize its overall expected revenue resulting from the operator payments. Comparison of the performance of this scheme to one in which the bandwidth is equally shared between the user-operator pairs reveals that such an SPS-based scheme improves the user acceptance probabilities and the bandwidth utilization in multiuser systems","","1-4244-0013-9","10.1109/DYSPAN.2005.1542626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542626","","Receivers;Cognitive radio;Leak detection;Radio frequency;Local oscillators;Chromium;Radio transmitters;TV;Interference;Uncertainty","","211","4","10","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We found that subjects' personality profiles influence personal spatial zones in human-robot interaction experiments. We tested two hypotheses: first, we predicted that approach distances preferred by humans when interacting with a robot would be comparable to those preferred when humans interact socially with each other. Our experiments involving humans interacting with a mobile robot confirm this hypothesis. However, surprisingly, a large minority of subjects in the experiments took up positions which were significantly closer, suggesting that they were not treating the robot as a ""social entity"". We then tested the hypothesis that common personality factors exist which could be used to predict subjects' likely approach distance preferences. The subjects' personalities were assessed using several traits from the three-factor Eysenck personality model. Further analysis of the data identified four new factors, different from Eysenck's model, tentatively labeled ""proactiveness"", ""social reluctance"", ""timidity"" and ""nervousness"". When testing for correlations between approach distances and personality data, ""proactiveness"" correlates with social distance, i.e. subjects that score higher on this factor come less close to the robot.

Our sleep scheduling ensures that coverage rotates such that each point in the environment is sensed within some finite interval of time, called the detection delay. The framework is optimized for rare event detection and allows favorable compromises to be achieved between event detection delay and lifetime without sacrificing (eventual) coverage for each point. We compare different sleep scheduling policies in terms of average detection delay, and show that ours is closest to the detection delay lower bound for stationary event surveillance. We also explain the inherent relationship between detection delay, which applies to persistent events, and detection probability, which applies to temporary events. Finally, a connectivity maintenance protocol is proposed to minimize the delay of multi-hop delivery to a base-station. The resulting sleep schedule achieves the lowest overall target surveillance delay given constraints on energy consumption.","","0-7803-9201-9","10.1109/IPSN.2005.1440887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440887","","Sleep;Intelligent networks;Event detection;Surveillance;Protocols;Delay effects;Processor scheduling;Energy consumption;Batteries","","210","1","13","IEEE","13 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we give a detailed analysis of a cone-based distributed topology-control (CBTC) algorithm. This algorithm does not assume that nodes have GPS information available; rather it depends only on directional information. Roughly speaking, the basic idea of the algorithm is that a node u transmits with the minimum power p/sub u,/spl alpha// required to ensure that in every cone of degree /spl alpha/ around u, there is some node that u can reach with power p/sub u,/spl alpha//. We show that taking /spl alpha/=5/spl pi//6 is a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee that network connectivity is preserved. More precisely, if there is a path from s to t when every node communicates at maximum power then, if /spl alpha//spl les/5/spl pi//6, there is still a path in the smallest symmetric graph G/sub /spl alpha// containing all edges (u,v) such that u can communicate with v using power p/sub u,/spl alpha//. On the other hand, if /spl alpha/>5/spl pi//6, connectivity is not necessarily preserved. We also propose a set of optimizations that further reduce power consumption and prove that they retain network connectivity.

Typically, in shape from defocus, the task of extracting geometry also requires deblurring the given images. A common approach to bypass this task relies on approximating the scene locally by a plane parallel to the image (the so-called equifocal assumption). We show that this approximation is indeed not necessary, as one can estimate 3D geometry while avoiding deblurring without strong assumptions on the scene. Solving the problem of shape from defocus requires modeling how light interacts with the optics before reaching the imaging surface. This interaction is described by the so-called point spread function (PSF). When the form of the PSF is known, we propose an optimal method to infer 3D geometry from defocused images that involves computing orthogonal operators which are regularized via functional singular value decomposition. When the form of the PSF is unknown, we propose a simple and efficient method that first learns a set of projection operators from blurred images and then uses these operators to estimate the 3D geometry of the scene from novel blurred images. Our experiments on both real and synthetic images show that the performance of the algorithm is relatively insensitive to the form of the PSF Our general approach is to minimize the Euclidean norm of the difference between the estimated images and the observed images. The method is geometric in that we reduce the minimization to performing projections onto linear subspaces, by using inner product structures on both infinite and finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Both proposed algorithms involve only simple matrix-vector multiplications which can be implemented in real-time.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388266","Index Terms- Shape from defocus;depth from defocus;blind deconvolution;image processing;deblurring;shape;3D reconstruction;shape estimation;image restoration;learning subspaces.","Shape;Layout;Image reconstruction;Optical imaging;Geometrical optics;Focusing;Computational geometry;Singular value decomposition;Minimization methods;Hilbert space","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Subtraction Technique","208","9","41","IEEE","31 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model computes the probability distribution of lead time in a stochastic, resource-constrained project network where iterations take place among sequential, parallel, and overlapped tasks.

We use a simulation-based analysis to account for many realistic aspects of design process behavior which were not possible in previous analytical models.

Unlike the traditional wavelet-based watermarking schemes where the watermark bits are embedded directly on the wavelet coefficients, the proposed scheme is based on bit embedding on the singular value (luminance) of the blocks within wavelet subband of the original image. To improve the fidelity and the perceptual quality of the watermarked image and to enhance the security of watermarking, we model the adaptive quantization parameters based on the statistics of blocks within subbands. The scheme is robust against JPEG compression but extremely sensitive to malicious manipulation such as filtering and random noising. Watermark detection is efficient and blind in the sense only the quantization parameters but not the original image are required. The quantization parameters adaptive to blocks are vector quantized to reduce the watermarking overhead.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2004.836745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377363","Fragile watermarking;singular value decomposition (SVD);statistic modeling;wavelet","Watermarking;Wavelet domain;Singular value decomposition;Quantization;Authentication;Wavelet coefficients;Security;Statistics;Robustness;Transform coding","","208","","14","IEEE","10 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper studies continuous and discontinuous pulse-width modulation for this inverter. Detailed analysis of discontinuous modulation shows that the average switching frequency is not directly proportional to the carrier or sampling frequency, since additional switching transitions occur between different regions of discontinuity. At typical switching frequencies for high power applications (up to 2 kHz) these additional transitions contribute significantly to the inverter's total losses, so that a proper comparison of the harmonic performance can only be carried out under constant loss conditions with varying carrier frequency. This comparison is performed for a typical industrial medium voltage inverter. The paper then considers the major issues of neutral-point voltage balancing and loss distribution within the inverter, for the identified optimal modulation schemes.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2004.839831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377395","Discontinuous modulation;pulse-width modulation (PWM);three-level inverter","Pulse width modulation inverters;Pulse inverters;Pulse modulation;Switching frequency;Pulse width modulation;Medium voltage;Harmonic distortion;Topology;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Thyristors","","208","1","18","IEEE","10 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The vector field is given by the product of a function of the input rate and linear dynamics. If the input rate function is positively homogeneous, then the resulting input-output map of the model is rate independent, yielding persistent nontrivial input-output closed curve (that is, hysteresis) at arbitrarily low input frequency. If the input rate function is not positively homogeneous, the input-output map is rate dependent and can be approximated by a rate-independent model for low frequency inputs. Sufficient conditions for convergence to a limiting input-output map are developed for rate-independent and rate-dependent models.

Unfortunately, even though the theory of noise in SC circuits is discussed in the literature, it is very intricate. The numerical calculation of noise in switched circuits is very tedious, and requires highly sophisticated and not widely available software. The purpose of this paper is twofold. It provides a tutorial description of the physical phenomena taking place in an SC circuit while it processes noise (Sections II-III). It also proposes some specialized but highly efficient algorithms for estimating the resulting sampled noise in SC circuits, which need only simple calculations (Sections IV-VI ). A practical design procedure, which follows directly from the estimate, is also described. The accuracy of the proposed estimation algorithms is verified by simulation using SpectreRF.

Some conventional phenomenological models that have been used for much more than two decades without referring to space charges can be exploited to account for electrical field and activation energy modification due to space charge.

The noise is the sum of the contribution of interferences from all other nodes, weighted by a coefficient /spl gamma/, and of a background noise. We find that there is a critical value of /spl gamma/ above which the network is made of disconnected clusters of nodes. We also prove that if /spl gamma/ is nonzero but small enough, there exist node spatial densities for which the network contains a large (theoretically infinite) cluster of nodes, enabling distant nodes to communicate in multiple hops. Since small values of /spl gamma/ cannot be achieved without efficient CDMA codes, we investigate the use of a very simple TDMA scheme, where nodes can emit only every nth time slot. We show that it achieves connectivity similar to the previous system with a parameter /spl gamma//n.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2005.845546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424049","Ad hoc networks;CDMA;connectivity;interferences;percolation;TDMA","Interference;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Multiaccess communication;Context modeling;Attenuation;Background noise;Time division multiple access;Large-scale systems;Bidirectional control","","207","1","21","IEEE","25 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To prolong the operational lifetime of these devices, an embedded video encoding system should be able to adjust its computational complexity and energy consumption as demanded by the situation and its environment. To analyze, control, and optimize the rate-distortion (R-D) behavior of the wireless video communication system under the energy constraint, we develop a power-rate-distortion (P-R-D) analysis framework, which extends the traditional R-D analysis by including another dimension, the power consumption. Specifically, in this paper, we analyze the encoding mechanism of typical video coding systems, and develop a parametric video encoding architecture which is fully scalable in computational complexity. Using dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), an energy consumption management technology recently developed in CMOS circuits design, the complexity scalability can be translated into the energy consumption scalability of the video encoder. We investigate the R-D behavior of the complexity control parameters and establish an analytic P-R-D model. Both theoretically and experimentally, we show that, using this P-R-D model, the video coding system is able to automatically adjust its complexity control parameters to match the available energy supply of the mobile device while maximizing the picture quality. The P-R-D model provides a theoretical guideline for system design and performance optimization in mobile video communication under energy constraints.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2005.846433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425529","Energy consumption;rate-distortion (R-D) analysis;wireless video;complexity scalability","Wireless communication;Energy consumption;Video coding;Encoding;Mobile communication;Computational complexity;Communication system control;Scalability;Automatic control;Semiconductor device modeling","","207","5","25","IEEE","2 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A scene can be defined as a subdivision of a play in which either the setting is fixed, or when it presents continuous action in one place. We exploit this fact and propose a novel approach for clustering shots into scenes by transforming this task into a graph partitioning problem. This is achieved by constructing a weighted undirected graph called a shot similarity graph (SSG), where each node represents a shot and the edges between the shots are weighted by their similarity based on color and motion information. The SSG is then split into subgraphs by applying the normalized cuts for graph partitioning. The partitions so obtained represent individual scenes in the video. When clustering the shots, we consider the global similarities of shots rather than the individual shot pairs. We also propose a method to describe the content of each scene by selecting one representative image from the video as a scene key-frame. Recently, DVDs have become available with a chapter selection option where each chapter is represented by one image. Our algorithm automates this objective which is useful for applications such as video-on-demand, digital libraries, and the Internet.

Based on the localization of the training images, two strategies of learning the SOM topological space are proposed, namely to train a single SOM map for all the samples and to train a separate SOM map for each class, respectively. A soft k nearest neighbor (soft k-NN) ensemble method, which can effectively exploit the outputs of the SOM topological space, is also proposed to identify the unlabeled subjects.

Two of the more popular are the random waypoint and the random direction models. The random waypoint model is physically appealing but difficult to understand. Although the random direction model is less appealing physically, it is much easier to understand. User speeds are easily calculated, unlike for the waypoint model, and, as we observe, user positions and directions are uniformly distributed. The contribution of this paper is to establish this last property for a rich class of random direction models that allow future movements to depend on past movements. To this end, we consider finite oneand two-dimensional spaces. We consider two variations, the random direction model with wrap around and with reflection. We establish a simple relationship between these two models and, for both, show that positions and directions are uniformly distributed for a class of Markov movement models regardless of initial position. In addition, we establish a sample path property for both models, namely that any piecewise linear movement applied to a user preserves the uniform distribution of position and direction provided that users were initially uniformly throughout the space with equal likelihood of being pointed in any direction.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498468","","Reflection;Piecewise linear techniques;Space exploration;Electronic mail;Analytical models;Wireless networks;Space stations","","206","","12","IEEE","22 Aug 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This traditional characterization is unable to assess the impact of prominent channel features since, for a majority of channels, the slope equals the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas. Furthermore, a characterization based solely on the slope captures only the scaling but it has no notion of the power required for a certain capacity. This paper advocates a more refined characterization whereby, as a function of SNR|/sub dB/, the high-SNR capacity is expanded as an affine function where the impact of channel features such as antenna correlation, unfaded components, etc., resides in the zero-order term or power offset. The power offset, for which we find insightful closed-form expressions, is shown to play a chief role for SNR levels of practical interest.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.858937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542408","Antenna correlation;channel capacity;coherent communication;fading channels;high-;multiantenna arrays;Ricean channels","Mutual information;Receiving antennas;Antenna accessories;Closed-form solution;Channel capacity;Fading;Signal to noise ratio;Instruments;Information theory","","206","2","57","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This presegmentation based approach fails for images with large portions of semitransparent foreground where the trimap is difficult to create even manually. In this paper, we combine the segmentation and matting problem together and propose a unified optimization approach based on belief propagation.

In this paper, we consider a two-dimensional breast model based on magnetic resonance imaging data, and examine the focusing abilities of a TR mirror comprised of an array of receivers with a single ultra-wideband pulse excitation. In order to resolve small 3-mm-diameter tumors, a very short duration pulse is necessary, and this requirement may restrict the applicability of the system due to hardware limitations. We propose a way to overcome this obstacle based on the observation that the amplitude and phase information of the tumor response is sufficient to achieve focusing. The robustness of the TR algorithm with respect to breast inhomogeneities is demonstrated, and the good performance of the method suggests it is a promising technique for microwave breast cancer detection.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2005.850444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1463350","Finite difference time domain (FDTD);microwave imaging;time reversal (TR)","Finite difference methods;Microwave theory and techniques;Breast cancer;Cancer detection;Focusing;Breast neoplasms;Time domain analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Mirrors;Ultra wideband technology","","205","","28","IEEE","11 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current clustering algorithms usually utilize two techniques, selecting cluster heads with more residual energy and rotating cluster heads periodically, to distribute the energy consumption among nodes in each cluster and extend the network lifetime. However, they rarely consider the hot spots problem in multihop wireless sensor networks. When cluster heads cooperate with each other to forward their data to the base station, the cluster heads closer to the base station are burdened with heavy relay traffic and tend to die early, leaving areas of the network uncovered and causing network partition. To address the problem, we propose an energy-efficient unequal clustering (EEUC) mechanism for periodical data gathering in wireless sensor networks. It partitions the nodes into clusters of unequal size, and clusters closer to the base station have smaller sizes than those farther away from the base station. Thus cluster heads closer to the base station can preserve some energy for the inter-cluster data forwarding. We also propose an energy-aware multihop routing protocol for the inter-cluster communication. Simulation results show that our unequal clustering mechanism balances the energy consumption well among all sensor nodes and achieves an obvious improvement on the network lifetime.","2155-6814","0-7803-9465-8","10.1109/MAHSS.2005.1542849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542849","","Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Spread spectrum communication;Base stations;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Energy consumption;Relays;Telecommunication traffic;Clustering algorithms;Routing protocols","","205","1","14","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, the activity images are first reconstructed from PET sinogram frames at each measurement time, and then the kinetic parameters are estimated by fitting a model to the reconstructed time-activity response of each voxel. However, this ""indirect"" approach to kinetic parameter estimation tends to reduce signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because of the requirement that the sinogram data be divided into individual time frames. In 1985, Carson and Lange proposed, but did not implement, a method based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for direct parametric reconstruction. The approach is ""direct"" because it estimates the optimal kinetic parameters directly from the sinogram data, without an intermediate reconstruction step. However, direct voxel-wise parametric reconstruction remained a challenge due to the unsolved complexities of inversion and spatial regularization. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate a new and efficient method for direct voxel-wise reconstruction of kinetic parameter images using all frames of the PET data. The direct parametric image reconstruction is formulated in a Bayesian framework, and uses the parametric iterative coordinate descent (PICD) algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem. The PICD algorithm is computationally efficient and is implemented with spatial regularization in the domain of the physiologically relevant parameters. Our experimental simulations of a rat head imaged in a working small animal scanner indicate that direct parametric reconstruction can substantially reduce root-mean-squared error (RMSE) in the estimation of kinetic parameters, as compared to indirect methods, without appreciably increasing computation.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2005.845317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425670","Dynamic PET;iterative reconstruction;kinetic modeling;regularization;tomography","Image reconstruction;Kinetic theory;Positron emission tomography;Parameter estimation;Iterative algorithms;Time measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Bayesian methods;Computational modeling;Head","Algorithms;Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Fluorodeoxyglucose F18;Fluorodeoxyglucose F18;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Kinetics;Metabolic Clearance Rate;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Phantoms, Imaging;Positron-Emission Tomography;Positron-Emission Tomography;Radiopharmaceuticals;Radiopharmaceuticals;Rats;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tissue Distribution","205","11","66","IEEE","2 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new cost function is proposed for the unconstrained generalized predictive controller (GPC), where reference tracking is decoupled from the rejection of predictable periodic motions. Cardiac motions are more complex, since they are the combination of two periodic nonharmonic components. An adaptive disturbance predictor is proposed which outputs future predicted disturbance values.

Such systems can suffer significant line voltage distortion due to notches caused by power device switching and/or low frequency harmonic content, which can easily corrupt the output of a conventional zero crossing detector. This paper presents a method of filtering the incoming grid voltage using a recursive discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The filter provides a high degree of noise immunity but does produce a phase shift between the incoming grid voltage and the filtered output voltage when the DFT time window does not match the grid period. Two methods of compensating this phase shift are presented, based on tracking the drift in the phase predicted by the recursive DFT. The first method makes a deadbeat adjustment to the time window (thereby changing the sampling rate) while the second approach calculates the phase error based on the linear phase response of the DFT. These compensation algorithms can correct for discrepancies of at least 25% between the DFT time window and the system period, and can track grid frequencies with slew rates as high as 40 Hz/s with negligible phase shift (<2/spl deg/) between the grid voltage input and the filtered output waveforms.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.850944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461471","Converter synchronization;discrete Fourier transform (DFT);finite impulse response (FIR) filter;sample rate;weak grid","Discrete Fourier transforms;Power harmonic filters;Frequency synchronization;Matched filters;Power supplies;Frequency control;Zero voltage switching;Harmonic distortion;Power system harmonics;Detectors","","204","","12","IEEE","5 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A consequence of this is greatly increased converter currents, which may lead to converter failure.

We trace back the problem of mechanization of BPM to an ontological one, i.e. the lack of machine-accessible semantics, and argue that the modeling constructs of semantic Web services frameworks, especially WSMO, are a natural fit to creating such a representation. As a consequence, we propose to combine SWS and BPM and create one consolidated technology, which we call semantic business process management (SBPM)","","0-7695-2430-3","10.1109/ICEBE.2005.110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1552942","","Semantic Web;Business process re-engineering;Business communication;Knowledge management;Space technology;Technology management;Disaster management;Systems engineering and theory;Web services;Ontologies","","204","5","24","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In traditional passive RFID systems, ambient high-power readers interrogate battery-free devices, called tags, that modulate the interrogating signal to communicate a unique identifier to the reader. The WISP project aims to augment RFID tags with sensors so that tags can also send sensed data to the readers. We call these augmented tags wisps. Basing wisps on RFID has some immediate advantages. RFID tags communicate to ambient readers over distances of up to eight meters. Solutions compatible with RFID standards might therefore find quicker acceptance and see faster improvement than other solutions.","1558-2590","","10.1109/MPRV.2005.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1401841","sensor networks;wireless communications;wireless sensors;power supply;RFID","Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;Radiofrequency identification;Costs;Condition monitoring;Radio frequency;RFID tags;Conducting materials;Manufacturing;Energy measurement","","204","5","14","IEEE","7 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Previous work has shown that the transcendental equations characterizing the harmonic content can be converted to polynomial equations which are then solved using the method of resultants from elimination theory. A difficulty with this approach is that when there are several dc sources, the degrees of the polynomials are quite large making the computational burden of their resultant polynomials (as required by elimination theory) quite high. Here, it is shown that the theory of symmetric polynomials can be exploited to reduce the degree of the polynomial equations that must be solved which in turn greatly reduces the computational burden. In contrast to results reported in the literature that use iterative numerical techniques to solve these equations, the approach here produces all possible solutions.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2004.839556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1397757","Multilevel inverter;resultants;symmetric polynomials","Polynomials;Pulse width modulation inverters;Equations;Voltage;Power electronics;Photovoltaic cells;Power grids;Fuel cells;Switches;Frequency","","204","","34","IEEE","28 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The IEEE 802.11n will provide both physical layer and MAC enhancements. In this article we introduce some PHY proposals and study the fundamental issue of MAC inefficiency. We propose several MAC enhancements via various frame aggregation mechanisms that overcome the theoretical throughput limit and reach higher throughput. We classify frame aggregation mechanisms into many different and orthogonal aspects, such as distributed vs. centrally controlled, ad hoc vs. infrastructure, uplink vs. downlink, single-destination vs. multi-destination, PHY-level vs. MAC-level, single-rate vs. multirate, immediate ACK vs. delayed ACK, and no spacing vs. SIFS spacing.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2005.1561948","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561948","","Throughput;Wireless LAN;Local area networks;Physical layer;Centralized control;Standardization;Measurement standards;Media Access Protocol;Quality of service;Streaming media","","203","16","10","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We contrast TREEMINER with a pattern matching tree mining algorithm (PATTERNMATCHER), and we also compare it with TREEMINERD, which counts only distinct occurrences of a pattern. We conduct detailed experiments to test the performance and scalability of these methods.

"A generalization of blind source separation algorithms for convolutive mixtures based on second-order statistics","H. Buchner; R. Aichner; W. Kellermann","Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany; Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany; Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany",IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing,"20 Dec 2004","2005","13","1","120","134","We present a general broadband approach to blind source separation (BSS) for convolutive mixtures based on second-order statistics. This avoids several known limitations of the conventional narrowband approximation, such as the internal permutation problem. In contrast to traditional narrowband approaches, the new framework simultaneously exploits the nonwhiteness property and nonstationarity property of the source signals. Using a novel matrix formulation, we rigorously derive the corresponding time-domain and frequency-domain broadband algorithms by generalizing a known cost-function which inherently allows joint optimization for several time-lags of the correlations. Based on the broadband approach time-domain, constraints are obtained which provide a deeper understanding of the internal permutation problem in traditional narrowband frequency-domain BSS. For both the time-domain and the frequency-domain versions, we discuss links to well-known, and also, to novel algorithms that constitute special cases. Moreover, using the so-called generalized coherence, links between the time-domain and the frequency-domain algorithms can be established, showing that our cost function leads to an update equation with an inherent normalization ensuring a robust adaptation behavior. The concept is applicable to offline, online, and block-online algorithms by introducing a general weighting function allowing for tracking of time-varying real acoustic environments.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2004.838775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1369317","Adaptive filtering;blind source separation (BSS);convolutive mixtures;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems;second-order statistics","Blind source separation;Statistics;Source separation;Narrowband;MIMO;Time domain analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Filtering;Sensor systems;Signal processing","","203","12","43","IEEE","20 Dec 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0<ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of ""random"" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0<ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that ""most"" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.871582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1614066","Adaptive sampling;almost-spherical sections of Banach spaces;Basis Pursuit;eigenvalues of random matrices;Gel'fand;information-based complexity;integrated sensing and processing;minimum;optimal recovery;Quotient-of-a-Subspace theorem;sparse solution of linear equations","Compressed sensing;Image reconstruction;Pixel;Vectors;Digital images;Image coding;Transform coding;Size measurement;Signal processing;Data mining","","21156","238","47","IEEE","3 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consider a discrete-time signal f/spl isin/C/sup N/ and a randomly chosen set of frequencies /spl Omega/. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set /spl Omega/? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=/spl sigma//sub /spl tau//spl isin/T/f(/spl tau/)/spl delta/(t-/spl tau/) obeying |T|/spl les/C/sub M//spl middot/(log N)/sup -1/ /spl middot/ |/spl Omega/| for some constant C/sub M/>0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N/sup -M/), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/ minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C/sub M/ which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|/spl middot/logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N/sup -M/) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|/spl middot/logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.862083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580791","Convex optimization;duality in optimization;free probability;image reconstruction;linear programming;random matrices;sparsity;total-variation minimization;trigonometric expansions;uncertainty principle","Robustness;Uncertainty;Signal reconstruction;Frequency;Image reconstruction;Mathematics;Biomedical imaging;Sampling methods;Linear programming;Signal processing","","11687","186","31","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"K-SVD: An algorithm for designing overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representation","M. Aharon; M. Elad; A. Bruckstein","Department of Computer Science, Israel Institute of Technology-Technion, Haifa, Israel; Department of Computer Science, Israel Institute of Technology-Technion, Haifa, Israel; Department of Computer Science, Israel Institute of Technology-Technion, Haifa, Israel",IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,"16 Oct 2006","2006","54","11","4311","4322","In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new method-the K-SVD algorithm-generalizing the K-means clustering process. K-SVD is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-SVD algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or matching pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and in applications on real image data","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.881199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1710377","Atom decomposition;basis pursuit;codebook;dictionary;FOCUSS;gain-shape VQ;matching pursuit;sparse representation;training;vector quantization","Algorithm design and analysis;Dictionaries;Matching pursuit algorithms;Pursuit algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Prototypes;Inverse problems;Feature extraction;Signal design","","7610","76","47","IEEE","16 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two cases of flocking in free-space and presence of multiple obstacles are considered. We present three flocking algorithms: two for free-flocking and one for constrained flocking. A comprehensive analysis of the first two algorithms is provided. We demonstrate the first algorithm embodies all three rules of Reynolds. This is a formal approach to extraction of interaction rules that lead to the emergence of collective behavior. We show that the first algorithm generically leads to regular fragmentation, whereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking. A systematic method is provided for construction of cost functions (or collective potentials) for flocking. These collective potentials penalize deviation from a class of lattice-shape objects called /spl alpha/-lattices. We use a multi-species framework for construction of collective potentials that consist of flock-members, or /spl alpha/-agents, and virtual agents associated with /spl alpha/-agents called /spl beta/- and /spl gamma/-agents. We show that migration of flocks can be performed using a peer-to-peer network of agents, i.e., ""flocks need no leaders."" A ""universal"" definition of flocking for particle systems with similarities to Lyapunov stability is given. Several simulation results are provided that demonstrate performing 2-D and 3-D flocking, split/rejoin maneuver, and squeezing maneuver for hundreds of agents using the proposed algorithms.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2005.864190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605401","Consensus theory;distributed control;dynamic graphs;mobile sensor networks;networked autonomous vehicles;self-assembly of networks;self-organizing systems;swarms","Heuristic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Vehicle dynamics;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Self-assembly;Cost function;Peer to peer computing;Lyapunov method;Distributed control;Biosensors","","4071","1","53","IEEE","13 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself, or training on a corpus of high-quality image database.

These ants deposit pheromone on the ground in order to mark some favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. Ant colony optimization exploits a similar mechanism for solving optimization problems.

The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Image QA algorithms generally interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a ""reference"" or ""perfect"" image in some perceptual space. Such ""full-reference"" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by signal fidelity measures. In this paper, we approach the image QA problem as an information fidelity problem. Specifically, we propose to quantify the loss of image information to the distortion process and explore the relationship between image information and visual quality. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of ""natural"" images and videos that are meant for ""human consumption."" Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of such natural signals. Using these models, we previously presented an information fidelity criterion for image QA that related image quality with the amount of information shared between a reference and a distorted image. In this paper, we propose an image information measure that quantifies the information that is present in the reference image and how much of this reference information can be extracted from the distorted image. Combining these two quantities, we propose a visual information fidelity measure for image QA. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images and show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art image QA algorithms by a sizeable margin in our simulations. The code and the data from the subjective study are available at the LIVE website.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.859378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576816","Image information;image quality assessment (QA);information fidelity;natural scene statistics (NSS)","Distortion measurement;Image quality;Humans;Quality assessment;Algorithm design and analysis;Predictive models;Psychology;Visual system;Video sharing;Statistics","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biomimetics;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","2981","32","39","IEEE","16 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the proposed solutions require distributed space-time coding algorithms, the careful design of which is left for future investigation if there is more than one cooperative relay. We propose a novel scheme that alleviates these problems and provides diversity gains on the order of the number of relays in the network. Our scheme first selects the best relay from a set of M available relays and then uses this ""best"" relay for cooperation between the source and the destination. We develop and analyze a distributed method to select the best relay that requires no topology information and is based on local measurements of the instantaneous channel conditions. This method also requires no explicit communication among the relays. The success (or failure) to select the best available path depends on the statistics of the wireless channel, and a methodology to evaluate performance for any kind of wireless channel statistics, is provided. Information theoretic analysis of outage probability shows that our scheme achieves the same diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as achieved by more complex protocols, where coordination and distributed space-time coding for M relay nodes is required, such as those proposed by Laneman and Wornell (2003). The simplicity of the technique allows for immediate implementation in existing radio hardware and its adoption could provide for improved flexibility, reliability, and efficiency in future 4G wireless systems.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.862417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603719","Coherence time;fading channel;network cooperative diversity;outage probability;wireless networks","Diversity methods;Relays;Information analysis;Statistical distributions;Antenna arrays;Fading;Algorithm design and analysis;Network topology;Probability;Protocols","","2497","14","28","IEEE","6 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, as observed in most neural network implementations, tuning all the parameters of the networks may cause learning complicated and inefficient, and it may be difficult to train networks with nondifferential activation functions such as threshold networks. Unlike conventional neural network theories, this paper proves in an incremental constructive method that in order to let SLFNs work as universal approximators, one may simply randomly choose hidden nodes and then only need to adjust the output weights linking the hidden layer and the output layer. In such SLFNs implementations, the activation functions for additive nodes can be any bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous functions $g:R\rightarrow R$ and the activation functions for RBF nodes can be any integrable piecewise continuous functions $g:R\rightarrow R$ and $\int_{R}g(x)dx\neq 0$. The proposed incremental method is efficient not only for SFLNs with continuous (including nondifferentiable) activation functions but also for SLFNs with piecewise continuous (such as threshold) activation functions. Compared to other popular methods such a new network is fully automatic and users need not intervene the learning process by manually tuning control parameters.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2006.875977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1650244","Ensemble;feedforward network;incremental extreme learning machine;radial basis function;random hidden nodes;support vector machine;threshold network;universal approximation","Support vector machines;Additives;Process control;Feedforward neural networks;Tuning","Algorithms;Learning;Neural Networks, Computer;Statistics as Topic","2093","","53","IEEE","15 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same.

The process of consulting ""several experts"" before making a final decision is perhaps second nature to us; yet, the extensive benefits of such a process in automated decision making applications have only recently been discovered by computational intelligence community. Also known under various other names, such as multiple classifier systems, committee of classifiers, or mixture of experts, ensemble based systems have shown to produce favorable results compared to those of single-expert systems for a broad range of applications and under a variety of scenarios. Design, implementation and application of such systems are the main topics of this article. Specifically, this paper reviews conditions under which ensemble based systems may be more beneficial than their single classifier counterparts, algorithms for generating individual components of the ensemble systems, and various procedures through which the individual classifiers can be combined. We discuss popular ensemble based algorithms, such as bagging, boosting, AdaBoost, stacked generalization, and hierarchical mixture of experts; as well as commonly used combination rules, including algebraic combination of outputs, voting based techniques, behavior knowledge space, and decision templates.

It can embed more data than many of the existing reversible data hiding algorithms. It is proved analytically and shown experimentally that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the marked image generated by this method versus the original image is guaranteed to be above 48 dB.

The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods.

This model accounts for all dynamic characteristics of the battery, from nonlinear open-circuit voltage, current-, temperature-, cycle number-, and storage time-dependent capacity to transient response. A simplified model neglecting the effects of self-discharge, cycle number, and temperature, which are nonconsequential in low-power Li-ion-supplied applications, is validated with experimental data on NiMH and polymer Li-ion batteries. Less than 0.4% runtime error and 30-mV maximum error voltage show that the proposed model predicts both the battery runtime and I-V performance accurately.

In retrospect, we believe that requiring a person to use T2 FS mathematics represents a barrier to the use of an IT2 FLS. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is unnecessary to take the route from general T2 FS to IT2 FS, and that all of the results that are needed to implement an IT2 FLS can be obtained using T1 FS mathematics.

The topology of such networks changes continuously as new nodes join and old nodes leave the network. Algorithms for such networks need to be robust against changes in topology. Additionally, nodes in sensor networks operate under limited computational, communication, and energy resources. These constraints have motivated the design of ""gossip"" algorithms: schemes which distribute the computational burden and in which a node communicates with a randomly chosen neighbor. We analyze the averaging problem under the gossip constraint for an arbitrary network graph, and find that the averaging time of a gossip algorithm depends on the second largest eigenvalue of a doubly stochastic matrix characterizing the algorithm. Designing the fastest gossip algorithm corresponds to minimizing this eigenvalue, which is a semidefinite program (SDP). In general, SDPs cannot be solved in a distributed fashion; however, exploiting problem structure, we propose a distributed subgradient method that solves the optimization problem over the network. The relation of averaging time to the second largest eigenvalue naturally relates it to the mixing time of a random walk with transition probabilities derived from the gossip algorithm. We use this connection to study the performance and scaling of gossip algorithms on two popular networks: Wireless Sensor Networks, which are modeled as Geometric Random Graphs, and the Internet graph under the so-called Preferential Connectivity (PC) model.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.874516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638541","Distributed averaging;gossip;random walk;scaling laws;sensor networks;semidefinite programming","Peer to peer computing;Algorithm design and analysis;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Network topology;Solid modeling;Ad hoc networks;Distributed algorithms;Robustness","","1674","","48","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we show that a zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) strategy, while generally suboptimal, can achieve the same asymptotic sum capacity as that of DPC, as the number of users goes to infinity. In proving this asymptotic result, we provide an algorithm for determining which users should be active under ZFBF. These users are semiorthogonal to one another and can be grouped for simultaneous transmission to enhance the throughput of scheduling algorithms. Based on the user grouping, we propose and compare two fair scheduling schemes in round-robin ZFBF and proportional-fair ZFBF. We provide numerical results to confirm the optimality of ZFBF and to compare the performance of ZFBF and proposed fair scheduling schemes with that of various MIMO BC strategies.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.862421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603708","Broadcast channel;dirty paper coding (DPC);downlink scheduling;fair scheduling;imperfect channel state information (CSI);multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO);multiple-input/multiple-output capacity;multiuser diversity;proportional fair;zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF)","Broadcasting;Array signal processing;Base stations;MIMO;Receiving antennas;Throughput;Transmitting antennas;H infinity control;Downlink;Time division multiple access","","1562","34","33","IEEE","6 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We exploit the less stringent design condition of the NSFB to design filters that lead to a NSCT with better frequency selectivity and regularity when compared to the contourlet transform. We propose a design framework based on the mapping approach, that allows for a fast implementation based on a lifting or ladder structure, and only uses one-dimensional filtering in some cases.

At present, there is no closed-form solution to the PHD recursion. This paper shows that under linear, Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process, the posterior intensity at any time step is a Gaussian mixture. More importantly, closed-form recursions for propagating the means, covariances, and weights of the constituent Gaussian components of the posterior intensity are derived.

However, in general, the problem of finding sparse representations must be unstable in the presence of noise. This paper establishes the possibility of stable recovery under a combination of sufficient sparsity and favorable structure of the overcomplete system. Considering an ideal underlying signal that has a sufficiently sparse representation, it is assumed that only a noisy version of it can be observed. Assuming further that the overcomplete system is incoherent, it is shown that the optimally sparse approximation to the noisy data differs from the optimally sparse decomposition of the ideal noiseless signal by at most a constant multiple of the noise level. As this optimal-sparsity method requires heavy (combinatorial) computational effort, approximation algorithms are considered. It is shown that similar stability is also available using the basis and the matching pursuit algorithms. Furthermore, it is shown that these methods result in sparse approximation of the noisy data that contains only terms also appearing in the unique sparsest representation of the ideal noiseless sparse signal.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.860430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564423","Basis pursuit;greedy approximation;incoherent dictionary;Kruskal rank;matching pursuit;overcomplete representation;sparse representation;stability;stepwise regression;superresolution","Signal processing;Matching pursuit algorithms;Dictionaries;Vectors;Noise level;Signal processing algorithms;Stability;Signal representations;Linear algebra;Noise generators","","1534","23","43","IEEE","27 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To support this, we first introduce a set of test problem criteria, which are in turn supported by a set of definitions.

All principal components are retained in order to preserve the variability information in the data. Thus, K axis rotations take place to form the new features for a base classifier. The idea of the rotation approach is to encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within the ensemble. Diversity is promoted through the feature extraction for each base classifier. Decision trees were chosen here because they are sensitive to rotation of the feature axes, hence the name ""forest.” Accuracy is sought by keeping all principal components and also using the whole data set to train each base classifier. Using WEKA, we examined the Rotation Forest ensemble on a random selection of 33 benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and compared it with Bagging, AdaBoost, and Random Forest. The results were favorable to Rotation Forest and prompted an investigation into diversity-accuracy landscape of the ensemble models. Diversity-error diagrams revealed that Rotation Forest ensembles construct individual classifiers which are more accurate than these in AdaBoost and Random Forest, and more diverse than these in Bagging, sometimes more accurate as well.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1677518","Classifier ensembles;AdaBoost;bagging;random forest;feature extraction;PCA;kappa-error diagrams.","Bagging;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Decision trees;Voting;Computer Society;Training data;Classification tree analysis;Machine learning;Pattern recognition","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","1491","9","47","IEEE","21 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Attention will be focused on stability analysis and controller design based on the so-called Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy models or fuzzy dynamic models. Perspectives of model based fuzzy control in future are also discussed.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.883415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1707754","Adaptive control;control theory;fuzzy control;fuzzy models;fuzzy systems;Lyapunov functions;robustness;stability;stabilization;Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy models","Fuzzy control;Fuzzy logic;Control systems;Fuzzy systems;Industrial control;Stability analysis;Robust stability;Service robots;Medical control systems;Fuzzy sets","","1420","","184","IEEE","9 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we show with two simple attacks that a \kappa-anonymized dataset has some subtle, but severe privacy problems. First, we show that an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that \kappa-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks and we propose a novel and powerful privacy definition called \ell-diversity.

In cloudy areas of the Earth, the problem is compounded, and researchers are fortunate to get two to three clear images per year. At the same time, the coarse resolution of sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) limits the sensors' ability to quantify biophysical processes in heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, the authors present a new spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) algorithm to blend Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance. Using this approach, high-frequency temporal information from MODIS and high-resolution spatial information from Landsat can be blended for applications that require high resolution in both time and space. The MODIS daily 500-m surface reflectance and the 16-day repeat cycle Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 30-m surface reflectance are used to produce a synthetic ""daily"" surface reflectance product at ETM+ spatial resolution. The authors present results both with simulated (model) data and actual Landsat/MODIS acquisitions. In general, the STARFM accurately predicts surface reflectance at an effective resolution close to that of the ETM+. However, the performance depends on the characteristic patch size of the landscape and degrades somewhat when used on extremely heterogeneous fine-grained landscapes","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.872081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1661809","Data fusion;image enhancement;image processing;Landsat;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);remote sensing;surface reflectance","Satellites;Remote sensing;Reflectivity;MODIS;Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Image sensors;Biosensors;Earth;Radiometry","","1332","2","9","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this correspondence, a system where each receiver has perfect channel knowledge, but the transmitter only receives quantized information regarding the channel instantiation is analyzed. The well-known zero-forcing transmission technique is considered, and simple expressions for the throughput degradation due to finite-rate feedback are derived. A key finding is that the feedback rate per mobile must be increased linearly with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (in decibels) in order to achieve the full multiplexing gain. This is in sharp contrast to point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which it is not necessary to increase the feedback rate as a function of the SNR","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.883550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1715541","Broadcast channel;finite rate feedback;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems;multiplexing gain","MIMO;Broadcasting;Feedback;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Transmitters;Downlink;Channel state information;Information analysis;Throughput","","1320","52","51","IEEE","23 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The optimization problem is numerically difficult to solve when the problem does not have a convexity structure. This paper makes progress toward solving optimization problems of this type by showing that under a certain condition called the time-sharing condition, the duality gap of the optimization problem is always zero, regardless of the convexity of the objective function. Further, we show that the time-sharing condition is satisfied for practical multiuser spectrum optimization problems in multicarrier systems in the limit as the number of carriers goes to infinity. This result leads to efficient numerical algorithms that solve the nonconvex problem in the dual domain. We show that the recently proposed optimal spectrum balancing algorithm for digital subscriber lines can be interpreted as a dual algorithm. This new interpretation gives rise to more efficient dual update methods. It also suggests ways in which the dual objective may be evaluated approximately, further improving the numerical efficiency of the algorithm. We propose a low-complexity iterative spectrum balancing algorithm based on these ideas, and show that the new algorithm achieves near-optimal performance in many practical situations.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2006.877962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1658226","Digital subscriber lines (DSLs);discrete multitone (DMT);duality theory;dynamic spectrum management (DSM);iterative spectrum balancing (ISB);nonconvex optimization;optimal spectrum balancing (OSB);orthogonal frequency-division multiplex (OFDM)","Optimization methods;Iterative algorithms;Constraint optimization;DSL;Design optimization;Communication systems;Time sharing computer systems;OFDM modulation;Discrete Fourier transforms;H infinity control","","1310","18","30","IEEE","17 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, for realization of integration with CMOS very large scale integration (VLSI), silicon photonics must be compatible with the economics of silicon manufacturing and must operate within thermal constraints of VLSI chips.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the statistical MIMO is being proposed for radar. The fundamental difference between statistical MIMO and other radar array systems is that the latter seek to maximize the coherent processing gain, while statistical MIMO radar capitalizes on the diversity of target scattering to improve radar performance. Coherent processing is made possible by highly correlated signals at the receiver array, whereas in statistical MIMO radar, the signals received by the array elements are uncorrelated. Radar targets generally consist of many small elemental scatterers that are fused by the radar waveform and the processing at the receiver, to result in echoes with fluctuating amplitude and phase. It is well known that in conventional radar, slow fluctuations of the target radar cross section (RCS) result in target fades that degrade radar performance. By spacing the antenna elements at the transmitter and at the receiver such that the target angular spread is manifested, the MIMO radar can exploit the spatial diversity of target scatterers opening the way to a variety of new techniques that can improve radar performance. This paper focuses on the application of the target spatial diversity to improve detection performance. The optimal detector in the Neyman–Pearson sense is developed and analyzed for the statistical MIMO radar. It is shown that the optimal detector consists of noncoherent processing of the receiver sensors' outputs and that for cases of practical interest, detection performance is superior to that obtained through coherent processing. An optimal detector invariant to the signal and noise levels is also developed and analyzed. In this case as well, statistical MIMO radar provides great improvements over other types of array radars.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.862813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597550","Array processing;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);radar","Radar detection;Radar cross section;MIMO;Radar scattering;Radar antennas;Detectors;Signal processing;Proposals;Performance gain;Radar signal processing","","1254","3","35","IEEE","21 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The emphasis is primarily on electronically interfaced DG (EI-DG) units. DG controls and power management strategies are based on locally measured signals without communications. Based on the reactive power controls adopted, three power management strategies are identified and investigated. These strategies are based on 1) voltage-droop characteristic, 2) voltage regulation, and 3) load reactive power compensation. The real power of each DG unit is controlled based on a frequency-droop characteristic and a complimentary frequency restoration strategy. A systematic approach to develop a small-signal dynamic model of a multiple-DG microgrid, including real and reactive power management strategies, is also presented. The microgrid eigen structure, based on the developed model, is used to 1) investigate the microgrid dynamic behavior, 2) select control parameters of DG units, and 3) incorporate power management strategies in the DG controllers. The model is also used to investigate sensitivity of the design to changes of parameters and operating point and to optimize performance of the microgrid system.

An alternative solution, which is gaining widespread popularity, is to employ digital baseband predistortion ahead of the amplifier to compensate for the nonlinearity effects, hence allowing it to run closer to its maximum output power while maintaining low spectral regrowth. Recent improvements to the technique have included memory effects in the predistortion model, which are essential as the bandwidth increases. In this paper, we relate the general Volterra representation to the classical Wiener, Hammerstein, Wiener–Hammerstein, and parallel Wiener structures, and go on to describe some state-of-the-art predistortion models based on memory polynomials. We then propose a new generalized memory polynomial that achieves the best performance to date, as demonstrated herein with experimental results obtained from a testbed using an actual 30-W, 2-GHz power amplifier.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.879264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1703853","Memory polynomial;power amplifiers;predistortion;spectral regrowth;Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS);wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA)","Polynomials;Predistortion;Radio frequency;Power amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Broadband amplifiers;Multiaccess communication;Power system modeling;RF signals;3G mobile communication","","1192","57","30","IEEE","18 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Gabor wavelet is capable of tuning to specific frequencies, thus allowing noise filtering and vessel enhancement in a single step. We use a Bayesian classifier with class-conditional probability density functions (likelihoods) described as Gaussian mixtures, yielding a fast classification, while being able to model complex decision surfaces. The probability distributions are estimated based on a training set of labeled pixels obtained from manual segmentations.

Unlike the usual ""blind"" isotropic broadcasting scenario, the availability of CSI allows transmit optimization. A minimum transmission power criterion is adopted, subject to prescribed minimum received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at each of the intended receivers. A related max-min SNR ""fair"" problem formulation is also considered subject to a transmitted power constraint. It is proven that both problems are NP-hard; however, suitable reformulation allows the successful application of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. SDR yields an approximate solution plus a bound on the optimum value of the associated cost/reward. SDR is motivated from a Lagrangian duality perspective, and its performance is assessed via pertinent simulations for the case of Rayleigh fading wireless channels. We find that SDR typically yields solutions that are within 3-4 dB of the optimum, which is often good enough in practice. In several scenarios, SDR generates exact solutions that meet the associated bound on the optimum value. This is illustrated using measured very-high-bit-rate Digital Subscriber line (VDSL) channel data, and far-field beamforming for a uniform linear transmit antenna array.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.872578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634819","Broadcasting;convex optimization;downlink beamforming;minimization of total radiation power;multicasting;semidefinite programming;semidefinite relaxation (SDR);very-high-bit-rate Digital Subscriber line (VDSL) precoding","Array signal processing;Linear antenna arrays;Downlink;Channel state information;Transmitters;Availability;Signal to noise ratio;Cost function;Lagrangian functions;Rayleigh channels","","1071","8","16","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the required sensitivity is very demanding since any individual radio might face a deep fade. We propose light-weight cooperation in sensing based on hard decisions to mitigate the sensitivity requirements on individual radios. We show that the ""link budget"" that system designers have to reserve for fading is a significant function of the required probability of detection. Even a few cooperating users (~10-20) facing independent fades are enough to achieve practical threshold levels by drastically reducing individual detection requirements. Hard decisions perform almost as well as soft decisions in achieving these gains. Cooperative gains in a environment where shadowing is correlated, is limited by the cooperation footprint (area in which users cooperate). In essence, a few independent users are more robust than many correlated users. Unfortunately, cooperative gain is very sensitive to adversarial/failing Cognitive Radios. Radios that fail in a known way (always report the presence/absence of a Primary user) can be compensated for by censoring them. On the other hand, radios that fail in unmodeled ways or may be malicious, introduce a bound on achievable sensitivity reductions. As a rule of thumb, if we believe that 1/N users can fail in an unknown way, then the cooperation gains are limited to what is possible with N trusted users.","1938-1883","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.254957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024390","","Cognitive radio;Radio spectrum management;Shadow mapping;Frequency measurement;Computer science;Face detection;Fading;Performance gain;Robustness;Thumb","","1006","20","18","IEEE","11 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All three of these ingredients feature in the echo-location system of a bat, which may be viewed as a physical realization (albeit in neurobiological terms) of cognitive radar. Radar is a remote-sensing system that is widely used for surveillance, tracking, and imaging applications, for both civilian and military needs.

Both oversampling and undersampling are considered. These techniques modify the distribution of the training data such that the costs of the examples are conveyed explicitly by the appearances of the examples. Threshold-moving tries to move the output threshold toward inexpensive classes such that examples with higher costs become harder to be misclassified. Moreover, hard-ensemble and soft-ensemble, i.e., the combination of above techniques via hard or soft voting schemes, are also tested. Twenty-one UCl data sets with three types of cost matrices and a real-world cost-sensitive data set are used in the empirical study. The results suggest that cost-sensitive learning with multiclass tasks is more difficult than with two-class tasks, and a higher degree of class imbalance may increase the difficulty. It also reveals that almost all the techniques are effective on two-class tasks, while most are ineffective and even may cause negative effect on multiclass tasks. Overall, threshold-moving and soft-ensemble are relatively good choices in training cost-sensitive neural networks. The empirical study also suggests that some methods that have been believed to be effective in addressing the class imbalance problem may, in fact, only be effective on learning with imbalanced two-class data sets.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1549828","Index Terms- Machine learning;data mining;neural networks;cost-sensitive learning;class imbalance learning;sampling;threshold-moving;ensemble learning.","Neural networks;Costs;Machine learning;Learning systems;Data mining;Decision trees;Sampling methods;Testing;Training data;Voting","","976","2","39","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents the implementation of a real-time classification system for the types of human movement associated with the data acquired from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer unit. The major advance proposed by the system is to perform the vast majority of signal processing onboard the wearable unit using embedded intelligence. In this way, the system distinguishes between periods of activity and rest, recognizes the postural orientation of the wearer, detects events such as walking and falls, and provides an estimation of metabolic energy expenditure.

In common active array systems, the transmitted signal is usually coherent between the different elements of the array. This configuration does not allow array processing in the transmit mode. However, space-time coding of the transmitted signals allows to digitally steer the beam pattern in the transmit in addition to the received signal. The ability to steer the transmitted beam pattern, helps to avoid beam shape loss. We show that the configuration with spatially orthogonal signal transmission is equivalent to additional virtual sensors which extend the array aperture with virtual spatial tapering. These virtual sensors can be used to form narrower beams with lower sidelobes and, therefore, provide higher performance in target detection, angular estimation accuracy, and angular resolution. The generalized likelihood ratio test for target detection and the maximum likelihood and Cramer-Rao bound for target direction estimation are derived for an arbitrary signal coherence matrix.

To identify the camera from a given image, we consider the reference pattern noise as a spread-spectrum watermark, whose presence in the image is established by using a correlation detector.

SC-FDMA has similar throughput performance and essentially the same overall complexity as OFDMA. A principal advantage of SC-FDMA is the peak-to-average power ratio (PARR), which is lower than that of OFDMA. SC FDMA is currently a strong candidate for the uplink multiple access scheme in the long term evolution of cellular systems under consideration by the third generation partnership project (3GPP). In this paper, we give an overview of SC-FDMA. We also analyze the effects of subcarrier mapping on throughput and PARR. Among the possible subcarrier mapping approaches, we find that localized FDMA (LFDMA) with channel-dependent scheduling (CDS) results in higher throughput than interleaved FDMA (JFDMA).

There is an increasing interest in this subject since, on one hand, emerging broadband wireless access networks and standards spanning from universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) to fixed access picocellular networks and including wireless local area network (WLAN), World Interoperability for Microwave Access, Inc. (WIMAX), local multipoint distribution service (LMDS), etc., require an increase in capacity by reducing the coverage area. An enabling technology to obtain this objective is based on radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems where signal processing is carried at a central office to where signals are carried from inexpensive remote antenna units (RAUs). On the other hand, microwave photonic filters can find applications in specialized fields such as radar and photonic beamsteering of phased-arrayed antennas, where dynamical reconfiguration is an added value.

The possible wide range of grid impedance values (distributed generation is suited for remote areas with radial distribution plants) challenge the stability and the effectiveness of the LCL-filter-based current controlled system. It has been found out and it will be demonstrated in this paper that the use of active damping helps to stabilise the system in respect to many different kinds of resonances.

The novelty consists in generating the orthogonal voltage system using a structure based on second order generalized integrator (SOGI).

The template object is represented by multiple image fragments or patches. The patches are arbitrary and are not based on an object model (in contrast with traditional use of modelbased parts e.g. limbs and torso in human tracking). Every patch votes on the possible positions and scales of the object in the current frame, by comparing its histogram with the corresponding image patch histogram. We then minimize a robust statistic in order to combine the vote maps of the multiple patches. A key tool enabling the application of our algorithm to tracking is the integral histogram data structure [18]. Its use allows to extract histograms of multiple rectangular regions in the image in a very efficient manner. Our algorithm overcomes several difficulties which cannot be handled by traditional histogram-based algorithms [8, 6]. First, by robustly combining multiple patch votes, we are able to handle partial occlusions or pose change. Second, the geometric relations between the template patches allow us to take into account the spatial distribution of the pixel intensities - information which is lost in traditional histogram-based algorithms. Third, as noted by [18], tracking large targets has the same computational cost as tracking small targets. We present extensive experimental results on challenging sequences, which demonstrate the robust tracking achieved by our algorithm (even with the use of only gray-scale (noncolor) information).","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640835","","Robustness;Histograms;Voting;Target tracking;Video sequences;Torso;Humans;Statistics;Data structures;Data mining","","873","11","26","IEEE","5 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Suppose that one forms a short linear combination of elementary signals drawn from a large, fixed collection. Given an observation of the linear combination that has been contaminated with additive noise, the goal is to identify which elementary signals participated and to approximate their coefficients. Although many algorithms have been proposed, there is little theory which guarantees that these algorithms can accurately and efficiently solve the problem. This paper studies a method called convex relaxation, which attempts to recover the ideal sparse signal by solving a convex program. This approach is powerful because the optimization can be completed in polynomial time with standard scientific software. The paper provides general conditions which ensure that convex relaxation succeeds. As evidence of the broad impact of these results, the paper describes how convex relaxation can be used for several concrete signal recovery problems.

In opportunistic networks, mobile nodes are enabled to communicate with each other even if a route connecting them never exists. Furthermore, nodes are not supposed to possess or acquire any knowledge about the network topology, which (instead) is necessary in traditional MANET routing protocols. Routes are built dynamically, while messages are en route between the sender and the destination(s), and any possible node can opportunistically be used as next hop, provided it is likely to bring the message closer to the final destination. These requirements make opportunistic networks a challenging and promising research field. In this article we survey the most interesting case studies related to opportunistic networking and discuss and organize a taxonomy for the main routing and forwarding approaches in this challenging environment.

It is shown in this paper that by appropriate sampling of the constraints one obtains a standard convex optimization problem (the scenario problem) whose solution is approximately feasible for the original (usually infinite) set of constraints, i.e., the measure of the set of original constraints that are violated by the scenario solution rapidly decreases to zero as the number of samples is increased. We provide an explicit and efficient bound on the number of samples required to attain a-priori specified levels of probabilistic guarantee of robustness.

It is therefore important to take a critical look at key aspects of these systems, one of which is lane-position tracking. It is for these driver-assistance objectives that motivate the development of the novel ""video-based lane estimation and tracking"" (VioLET) system. The system is designed using steerable filters for robust and accurate lane-marking detection. Steerable filters provide an efficient method for detecting circular-reflector markings, solid-line markings, and segmented-line markings under varying lighting and road conditions. They help in providing robustness to complex shadowing, lighting changes from overpasses and tunnels, and road-surface variations. They are efficient for lane-marking extraction because by computing only three separable convolutions, we can extract a wide variety of lane markings. Curvature detection is made more robust by incorporating both visual cues (lane markings and lane texture) and vehicle-state information. The experiment design and evaluation of the VioLET system is shown using multiple quantitative metrics over a wide variety of test conditions on a large test path using a unique instrumented vehicle. A justification for the choice of metrics based on a previous study with human-factors applications as well as extensive ground-truth testing from different times of day, road conditions, weather, and driving scenarios is also presented. In order to design the VioLET system, an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of the current state of the art in lane-detection research was first performed.

First, we discuss the problem of on-road vehicle detection using optical sensors followed by a brief review of intelligent vehicle research worldwide. Then, we discuss active and passive sensors to set the stage for vision-based vehicle detection. Methods aiming to quickly hypothesize the location of vehicles in an image as well as to verify the hypothesized locations are reviewed next.

In the second, the worst case SINR is maximized subject to a power constraint. It is shown that both problems can be solved using standard conic optimization packages. In addition, conditions are developed for the optimal precoder for both of these problems, and two simple fixed-point iterations are proposed to find the solutions that satisfy these conditions. The relation to the well-known uplink-downlink duality in the context of joint transmit beamforming and power control is also explored. The proposed precoder design is general, and as a special case, it solves the transmit rank-one beamforming problem.

We use a two-stage protocol, where in one stage the transmitter sends information and in the other, the relays encode their received signals into a ""distributed"" linear dispersion (LD) code, and then transmit the coded signals to the receive node. We show that for high SNR, the pairwise error probability (PEP) behaves as (logP/P)min{TH}, with T the coherence interval, that is, the number of symbol periods during which the channels keep constant, R the number of relay nodes, and P the total transmit power. Thus, apart from the log P factor, the system has the same diversity as a multiple-antenna system with R transmit antennas, which is the same as assuming that the R relays can fully cooperate and have full knowledge of the transmitted signal. We further show that for a network with a large number of relays and a fixed total transmit power across the entire network, the optimal power allocation is for the transmitter to expend half the power and for the relays to collectively expend the other half. We also show that at low and high SNR, the coding gain is the same as that of a multiple-antenna system with R antennas.

The intersection between the capture region and the base of support determines which strategy the robot should adopt to successfully stop in a given situation. Computing the capture region for a humanoid, in general, is very difficult. However, with simple models of walking, computation of the capture region is simplified. We extend the well-known linear inverted pendulum model to include a flywheel body and show how to compute exact solutions of the capture region for this model. Adding rotational inertia enables the humanoid to control its centroidal angular momentum, much like the way human beings do, significantly enlarging the capture region. We present simulations of a simple planar biped that can recover balance after a push by stepping to the capture region and using internal angular momentum. Ongoing work involves applying the solution from the simple model as an approximate solution to more complex simulations of bipedal walking, including a 3D biped with distributed mass.","2164-0580","1-4244-0199-2","10.1109/ICHR.2006.321385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4115602","","Biological system modeling;Legged locomotion;Humans;Humanoid robots;Flywheels;Computational modeling;Closed-form solution;Acceleration;Foot;Cognition","","770","11","18","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By sensing and adapting to its environment, such a device is able to fill voids in the wireless spectrum and can dramatically increase spectral efficiency. In this paper, the cognitive radio channel is defined as a two-sender, two-receiver interference channel in which sender 2 obtains the encoded message sender 1 plans to transmit. We consider two cases: in the genie-aided cognitive radio channel, sender 2 is noncausally presented the data to be transmitted by sender 1 while in the causal cognitive radio channel, the data is obtained causally. The cognitive radio at sender 2 may then choose to transmit simultaneously over the same channel, as opposed to waiting for an idle channel as is traditional for a cognitive radio. Our main result is the development of an achievable region which combines Gel'fand-Pinkser coding with an achievable region construction for the interference channel. In the additive Gaussian noise case, this resembles dirty-paper coding, a technique used in the computation of the capacity of the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel. Numerical evaluation of the region in the Gaussian noise case is performed, and compared to an inner bound, the interference channel, and an outer bound, a modified Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel. Results are also extended to the case in which the message is causally obtained.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.872971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624625","Cognitive radio channel;dirty-paper coding;Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel;Gel'fand–Pinsker coding;interference channel;wireless communication","Cognitive radio;Frequency;MIMO;Interference channels;Wireless sensor networks;Radio broadcasting;Gaussian noise;Wireless communication;Software radio;FCC","","763","8","26","IEEE","24 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to compute this score quickly, on huge, disk-resident, real graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good relevance score between two nodes in a weighted graph, and it has been successfully used in numerous settings, like automatic captioning of images, generalizations to the ""connection subgraphs"", personalized PageRank, and many more. However, the straightforward implementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs, requiring either quadratic space and cubic pre-computation time, or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared by many real graphs: (a) linear correlations and (b) block- wise, community-like structure. We exploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation, and the community structure by graph partitioning, followed by the Sherman- Morrison lemma for matrix inversion. Experimental results on the Corel image and the DBLP dabasets demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant savings over the straightforward implementations: they can save several orders of magnitude in pre-computation and storage cost, and they achieve up to 150x speed up with 90%+ quality preservation.","2374-8486","978-0-7695-2701-7","10.1109/ICDM.2006.70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053087","","Costs;Sparse matrices;Delay;Image storage;Niobium;Time factors;Heart;Linearity;Error analysis;Design optimization","","758","5","29","IEEE","8 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Utility-Based Cache Partitioning: A Low-Overhead, High-Performance, Runtime Mechanism to Partition Shared Caches","M. K. Qureshi; Y. N. Patt","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, USA",2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06),"26 Dec 2006","2006","","","423","432","This paper investigates the problem of partitioning a shared cache between multiple concurrently executing applications. The commonly used LRU policy implicitly partitions a shared cache on a demand basis, giving more cache resources to the application that has a high demand and fewer cache resources to the application that has a low demand. However, a higher demand for cache resources does not always correlate with a higher performance from additional cache resources. It is beneficial for performance to invest cache resources in the application that benefits more from the cache resources rather than in the application that has more demand for the cache resources. This paper proposes utility-based cache partitioning (UCP), a low-overhead, runtime mechanism that partitions a shared cache between multiple applications depending on the reduction in cache misses that each application is likely to obtain for a given amount of cache resources. The proposed mechanism monitors each application at runtime using a novel, cost-effective, hardware circuit that requires less than 2kB of storage. The information collected by the monitoring circuits is used by a partitioning algorithm to decide the amount of cache resources allocated to each application. Our evaluation, with 20 multiprogrammed workloads, shows that UCP improves performance of a dual-core system by up to 23% and on average 11% over LRU-based cache partitioning","2379-3155","0-7695-2732-9","10.1109/MICRO.2006.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041865","","Runtime;Application software;Circuits;Yarn;Hardware;Monitoring;Partitioning algorithms;Resource management;Multicore processing","","743","31","19","IEEE","26 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we focus on the recent technique proposed by Wainwright et al. (Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J.

In the LSB matching, the choice of whether to add or subtract one from the cover image pixel is random. The new method uses the choice to set a binary function of two cover pixels to the desired value. The embedding is performed using a pair of pixels as a unit, where the LSB of the first pixel carries one bit of information, and a function of the two pixel values carries another bit of information. Therefore, the modified method allows embedding the same payload as LSB matching but with fewer changes to the cover image. The experimental results of the proposed method show better performance than traditional LSB matching in terms of distortion and resistance against existing steganalysis.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2006.870357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1618698","Information hiding;steganography","Pixel;Steganography;Histograms;Payloads;Gray-scale;Terminology;Detectors;Information technology;Calibration;Signal processing algorithms","","725","","6","IEEE","10 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Success requires the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the BCI system, which translates that activity into device control commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve the adaptation of the BCI system to the user. In the literature, many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have been reported to give impressive results when applied to BCI data in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their relative value for actual online use. BCI data competitions have been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative methods.

This work further concludes that the problem of age-progression on face recognition (FR) is not unique to the algorithm used in this work.","","0-7695-2503-2","10.1109/FGR.2006.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613043","","Image databases;Face recognition;Morphology;Facial animation;Aging;Cranial;Biometrics;Skin;Computer science;Humans","","683","4","13","IEEE","24 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Questions such as ""Is she really who she claims to be?,"" ""Is this person authorized to use this facility?,"" or ""Is he in the watchlist posted by the government?"" are routinely being posed in a variety of scenarios ranging from issuing a driver's license to gaining entry into a country. The need for reliable user authentication techniques has increased in the wake of heightened concerns about security and rapid advancements in networking, communication, and mobility. Biometrics, described as the science of recognizing an individual based on his or her physical or behavioral traits, is beginning to gain acceptance as a legitimate method for determining an individual's identity. Biometric systems have now been deployed in various commercial, civilian, and forensic applications as a means of establishing identity. In this paper, we provide an overview of biometrics and discuss some of the salient research issues that need to be addressed for making biometric technology an effective tool for providing information security. The primary contribution of this overview includes: 1) examining applications where biometric scan solve issues pertaining to information security; 2) enumerating the fundamental challenges encountered by biometric systems in real-world applications; and 3) discussing solutions to address the problems of scalability and security in large-scale authentication systems.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2006.873653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634356","Biometrics;cryptosystems;digital rights management;grand challenge;information security;multibiometrics","Biometrics;Information security;Authentication;Government;Licenses;Telecommunication network reliability;Communication system security;Forensics;Scalability;Large-scale systems","","678","6","82","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An overview is then provided to establish that the MAC and routing protocols from traditional Mobile Ad Hoc networks arc not directly applicable for CCA and similar safety-critical applications. Specific constraints and future research directions are then identified for packet routing protocols used to support such applications in the DSRC environment. In order to further explain the interactions between CCA and its underlying networking protocols, we present an example of the safety performance of CCA using simulated vehicle crash experiments. The results from these experiments arc also used to demonstrate the need for network data prioritization for safety-critical applications such as CCA.

In this paper, we propose some new (linear and nonlinear) feature extractors based on maximum margin criterion (MMC). Geometrically, feature extractors based on MMC maximize the (average) margin between classes after dimensionality reduction. It is shown that MMC can represent class separability better than PCA. As a connection to LDA, we may also derive LDA from MMC by incorporating some constraints. By using some other constraints, we establish a new linear feature extractor that does not suffer from the small sample size problem, which is known to cause serious stability problems for LDA.

However, LPP is nonorthogonal, and this makes it difficult to reconstruct the data. The orthogonal locality preserving projection (OLPP) method produces orthogonal basis functions and can have more locality preserving power than LPP.

However, the performance of SVM-based relevance feedback is often poor when the number of labeled positive feedback samples is small. This is mainly due to three reasons: 1) an SVM classifier is unstable on a small-sized training set, 2) SVM's optimal hyperplane may be biased when the positive feedback samples are much less than the negative feedback samples, and 3) overfitting happens because the number of feature dimensions is much higher than the size of the training set. In this paper, we develop a mechanism to overcome these problems. To address the first two problems, we propose an asymmetric bagging-based SVM (AB-SVM). For the third problem, we combine the random subspace method and SVM for relevance feedback, which is named random subspace SVM (RS-SVM). Finally, by integrating AB-SVM and RS-SVM, an asymmetric bagging and random subspace SVM (ABRS-SVM) is built to solve these three problems and further improve the relevance feedback performance.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634340","Classifier committee learning;content-based image retrieval;relevance feedback;asymmetric bagging;random subspace;support vector machines.","Bagging;Image retrieval;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Negative feedback;Content based retrieval;Radio frequency;Machine learning;Algorithm design and analysis;Pattern classification","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Feedback;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated","650","25","34","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Relations are given between items, and a hierarchy is defined on the items as well. We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4015425","Network visualization;edge bundling;edge aggregation;edge concentration;curves;graph visualization;tree visualization;node-link diagrams;hierarchies;treemaps.","Data visualization;Tree graphs;Wires;Cables;Spline;Software systems;Social network services;Displays;Tree data structures","","649","18","33","IEEE","20 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, some known results of SMV are generalized to MMV. Some of these new results take advantages of additional information in the formulation of MMV. We consider the uniqueness under both an lscr0-norm-like criterion and an lscr1-norm-like criterion. The consequent equivalence between the lscr0-norm approach and the lscr1-norm approach indicates a computationally efficient way of finding the sparsest representation in a redundant dictionary. For greedy algorithms, it is proven that under certain conditions, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) can find the sparsest representation of an MMV with computational efficiency, just like in SMV.

Accurate and fast detection of this voltage component under grid faults is essential to keep the control over the power exchange with the grid avoiding to trip the converter protections and allowing the ride-through of the transient fault. In this paper, the systematic use of well known techniques conducts to a new positive-sequence voltage detection system which exhibits a fast, precise, and frequency-adaptive response under faulty grid conditions. Three fundamental functional blocks make up the proposed detector, these are: i) the quadrature-signals generator (QSG), ii) the positive-sequence calculator (PSC), and iii) the phase-locked loop (PLL). A key innovation of the proposed system is the use of a dual second order generalized integrator (DSOGI) to implement the QSG. For this reason, the proposed positive-sequence detector is called DSOGI-PLL. A detailed study of the DSOGI-PLL and verification by simulation are performed in this paper. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that the DSOGI-PLL is a very suitable technique for characterizing the positive-sequence voltage under grid faults.","2377-6617","0-7803-9716-9","10.1109/pesc.2006.1712059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1712059","","Phase locked loops;Harmonic analysis;Wind power generation;Resonant frequency;Detectors;Transient analysis","","613","","14","IEEE","25 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(±0.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(±0.48%) at 30 training images.","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1641014","","Nearest neighbor searches;Shape;Humans;Support vector machines;Prototypes;Support vector machine classification;Computer vision;Pattern recognition;Computer science;Sampling methods","","612","12","42","IEEE","9 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the observations were obtained in areas downwind of the source regions. In this paper, the newly developed satellite aerosol algorithm called ""Deep Blue"" was employed to characterize the properties of aerosols over source regions using radiance measurements from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Based upon the Aringngstroumlm exponent derived from the Deep Blue algorithm, it was demonstrated that this new algorithm is able to distinguish dust plumes from fine-mode pollution particles even in complex aerosol environments such as the one over Beijing. Furthermore, these results were validated by comparing them with observations from AERONET sites in China and Mongolia during spring 2001. These comparisons show that the values of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical thickness from Deep Blue are generally within 20%-30% of those measured by sunphotometers. The analyses also indicate that the roles of mineral dust and anthropogenic particles are comparable in contributing to the overall aerosol distributions during spring in northern China, while fine-mode particles are dominant over southern China. The spring season in East Asia consists of one of the most complex environments in terms of frequent cloudiness and wide ranges of aerosol loadings and types.

Fundamental principles of photonic signal processing, including sampling, tuning, and noise, are discussed. Structures that can extend the performance of photonic signal processors are presented, including methods for improving the filter shape characteristics of interference mitigation filters, techniques to increase the stopband attenuation of bandpass filters, and methods to achieve large free spectral range. Several photonic signal processors, including high-resolution microwave filters, widely tunable filters, arbitrary waveform generators, and fast signal correlators, are discussed. Techniques to solve the fundamental noise problem in photonic signal processors are described, and coherence-free structures for few-tap notch filters are discussed. Finally, a new concept for realizing multiple-tap coherence-free processor filters, based on a new frequency-shifting technique, is presented.

Finally, traffic flow forecasting is performed under the criterion of minimum mean square error (mmse). The approach departs from many existing traffic flow forecasting models in that it explicitly includes information from adjacent road links to analyze the trends of the current link statistically. Furthermore, it also encompasses the issue of traffic flow forecasting when incomplete data exist.

The QoS provisioning is performed in two quality domains, namely, timeliness and reliability. Multiple QoS levels are provided in the timeliness domain by guaranteeing multiple packet delivery speed options. In the reliability domain, various reliability requirements are supported by probabilistic multipath forwarding. These mechanisms for QoS provisioning are realized in a localized way without global network information by employing localized geographic packet forwarding augmented with dynamic compensation, which compensates for local decision inaccuracies as a packet travels towards its destination. This way, MMSPEED can guarantee end-to-end requirements in a localized way, which is desirable for scalability and adaptability to large scale dynamic sensor networks. Simulation results show that MMSPEED provides QoS differentiation in both reliability and timeliness domains and, as a result, significantly improves the effective capacity of a sensor network in terms of number of flows that meet both reliability and timeliness requirements up to 50 percent (12 flows versus 18 flows).","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2006.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624344","System design;simulations;sensor networks;service differentiation;QoS;real-time;reliability;localized routing protocol.","Wireless application protocol;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Quality of service;Temperature sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Routing protocols;Temperature distribution;Large-scale systems;Temperature control","","588","1","33","IEEE","24 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy around zero speed range are achieved by signal injection, exploiting the anisotropic properties of the machine.

The proposed method only utilizes the estimated stator flux so as to remove the difficulties associated with rotor flux estimation. The principles of this method are described in detail in this paper. The only machine parameter required by the proposed DPC method is the stator resistance whose impact on the system performance is found to be negligible.

Modern studies can include multiple labels defined on multiple images yet most evaluation schemes report one overlap per labelled region, simply averaged over multiple images. In this paper, common overlap measures are generalized to measure the total overlap of ensembles of labels defined on multiple test images and account for fractional labels using fuzzy set theory. This framework allows a single “figure-of-merit” to be reported which summarises the results of a complex experiment by image pair, by label or overall. A complementary measure of error, the overlap distance, is defined which captures the spatial extent of the nonoverlapping part and is related to the Hausdorff distance computed on grey level images.

The system minimizes the energy requirement of the vehicle and can work with different primary power sources like fuel cells, microturbines, zinc-air batteries, or other power supplies with a poor ability to recover energy from a regenerative braking, or with a scarce power capacity for a fast acceleration. The experimental HEV uses lead-acid batteries, an ultracapacitor (UCAP) bank, and a brushless dc motor with nominal power of 32 kW, and a peak power of 53 kW. The digital signal processor (DSP) control system measures and stores the following parameters: primary-source voltage, car speed, instantaneous currents in both terminals (primary source and UCAP), and actual voltage of the UCAP. When UCAPs were installed on the vehicle, the increase in range was around 5.3% in city tests. However, when optimal control with NN was used, this figure increased to 8.9%. The car used for this experiment is a Chevrolet light utility vehicle (LUV) truck, similar in shape and size to Chevrolet S-10, which was converted to an electric vehicle (EV) at the Universidad Catolica de Chile. Numerous experimental tests under different conditions are compared and discussed.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.870880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1614145","Energy management;energy storage;neural networks (NNs);vehicles","Hybrid electric vehicles;Supercapacitors;Neural networks;System testing;Battery powered vehicles;Fuel cell vehicles;Fuel cells;Power supplies;Acceleration;Brushless DC motors","","577","1","15","IEEE","3 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This solution is a combination of the well-known PNG law and the feedback of the impact time error, which is the difference between the impact time by PNG and the prescribed impact time. The new guidance law called ITCG (Impact-Time-Control Guidance) can be used to guide multiple missiles to hit a stationary target simultaneously at a desirable impact time.

We begin by overviewing important results in the area of opportunistic (channel-aware) scheduling for cellular (single-hop) networks, where easily implementable myopic policies are shown to optimize system performance. We then describe key lessons learned and the main obstacles in extending the work to general resource allocation problems for multihop wireless networks. Towards this end, we show that a clean-slate optimization-based approach to the multihop resource allocation problem naturally results in a ""loosely coupled"" cross-layer solution. That is, the algorithms obtained map to different layers [transport, network, and medium access control/physical (MAC/PHY)] of the protocol stack, and are coupled through a limited amount of information being passed back and forth. It turns out that the optimal scheduling component at the MAC layer is very complex, and thus needs simpler (potentially imperfect) distributed solutions. We demonstrate how to use imperfect scheduling in the cross-layer framework and describe recently developed distributed algorithms along these lines. We conclude by describing a set of open research problems.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2006.879351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1665000","Cellular networks;congestion control;cross-layer optimization;imperfect schedule;multihop wireless networks;opportunistic scheduling","Tutorial;Wireless networks;Resource management;Optimal scheduling;Media Access Protocol;Cellular networks;System performance;Spread spectrum communication;Physical layer;Transport protocols","","571","6","66","IEEE","31 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, it is imperative that automotive electrical power systems will obviously undergo a drastic change in the next 10-20 years. Currently, the situation in the automotive industry is such that the demands for higher fuel economy and more electric power are driving advanced vehicular power system voltages to higher levels. For example, the projected increase in total power demand is estimated to be about three to four times that of the current value. This means that the total future power demand of a typical advanced vehicle could roughly reach a value as high as 10 kW. In order to satisfy this huge vehicular load, the approach is to integrate power electronics intensive solutions within advanced vehicular power systems. In view of this fact, this paper aims at reviewing the present situation as well as projected future research and development work of advanced vehicular electrical power systems including those of electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell vehicles (EVs, HEVs, and FCVs).

This paper explores the control of active and reactive power flow through the analysis of the output impedance of the inverters and its impact on the power sharing. As a result, adaptive virtual output impedance is proposed in order to achieve a proper reactive power sharing, regardless of the line-impedance unbalances. A soft-start operation is also included, avoiding the initial current peak, which results in a seamless hot-swap operation. Active power sharing is achieved by adjusting the frequency in load transient situations only, owing to which the proposed method obtains a constant steady-state frequency and amplitude. As opposed to the conventional droop method, the transient response can be modified by acting on the main control parameters. Linear and nonlinear loads can be properly shared due to the addition of a current harmonic loop in the control strategy. Experimental results are presented from a two-6-kVA parallel-connected inverter system, showing the feasibility of the proposed approach.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.882015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705637","Distributed generation (DG);droop control method;microgrids;nonlinear loads","Inverters;Frequency;Reactive power control;Impedance;Cogeneration;Phase locked loops;Communication system control;Voltage control;Reactive power;Steady-state","","563","3","32","IEEE","2 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To obtain zero steady-state error at the fundamental frequency (i.e., unity power factor), the use of a standard integrator in a rotating frame is as effective as the use of a resonant controller in a stationary frame. However, the grid voltage harmonics influence the current controller and generate current harmonics unless several integrators in multiple rotating frames or resonant compensators in a stationary frame are adopted. In this letter, a hybrid system consisting of a proportional integral (PI) controller plus a generic hth harmonic resonant controller implemented in a frame rotating at the n th harmonic frequency is discussed in detail. The hth  harmonic controller is able to decrease both the (h - n)th  and (h + n)th harmonics, while the PI controller is able to decrease other harmonics if the synchronization phase signal adopted for the frame transformation is unfiltered. It is demonstrated that the use of a PI and sixth harmonic resonant compensator is effective for both positive and negative sequence fifth and seventh harmonics; hence, four harmonics are compensated with the proportional integral-resonant (PI-RES) controller implemented in a synchronous frame.

The error between annual GPP computed from NASA's Data Assimilation Office's (DAO) and tower-based meteorology is 28%, indicating that NASA's DAO global meteorology plays an important role in the accuracy of the GPP algorithm. Approximately 62% of MOD15-based estimates of LAI were within the estimates based on field optical measurements, although remaining values overestimated site values. Land cover presented the fewest errors, with most errors within the forest classes, reducing potential error. Tower-based and MODIS estimates of annual GPP compare favorably for most biomes, although MODIS GPP overestimates tower-based calculations by 20%-30%. Seasonally, summer estimates of MODIS GPP are closest to tower data, and spring estimates are the worst, most likely the result of the relatively rapid onset of leaf-out. The results of this study indicate, however, that the current MODIS GPP algorithm shows reasonable spatial patterns and temporal variability across a diverse range of biomes and climate regimes. So, while continued efforts are needed to isolate particular problems in specific biomes, we are optimistic about the general quality of these data, and continuation of the MOD17 GPP product will likely provide a key component of global terrestrial ecosystem analysis, providing continuous weekly measurements of global vegetation production","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.853936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1645290","AmeriFlux;gross primary production (GPP);Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);remote sensing;Terra","Remote sensing;Productivity;MODIS;Poles and towers;Meteorology;Spectroradiometers;Production;Data assimilation;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical sensors","","548","","72","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most previous multiple-instance learning (MIL) algorithms are developed based on the assumption that a bag is positive if and only if at least one of its instances is positive. Although the assumption works well in a drug activity prediction problem, it is rather restrictive for other applications, especially those in the computer vision area. We propose a learning method, MILES (Multiple-Instance Learning via Embedded instance Selection), which converts the multiple-instance learning problem to a standard supervised learning problem that does not impose the assumption relating instance labels to bag labels. MILES maps each bag into a feature space defined by the instances in the training bags via an instance similarity measure. This feature mapping often provides a large number of redundant or irrelevant features. Hence, 1-norm SVM is applied to select important features as well as construct classifiers simultaneously. We have performed extensive experiments. In comparison with other methods, MILES demonstrates competitive classification accuracy, high computation efficiency, and robustness to labeling uncertainty.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717454","Multiple-instance learning;feature subset selection;1-norm support vector machine;image categorization;object recognition;drug activity prediction.","Drugs;Application software;Computer vision;Learning systems;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Robustness;Labeling;Uncertainty","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","536","8","65","IEEE","30 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, relevance vector machine (RVM) regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6/spl deg/ are obtained for a variety of walking motions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542030","Index Terms- Computer vision;human motion estimation;machine learning;multivariate regression.","Humans;Image sequences;Labeling;Shape;Support vector machines;Kernel;Learning systems;Biological system modeling;Robustness;Image segmentation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Joints;Joints;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Posture;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","535","17","32","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fundamental frequency models have been presented but these models are often complex with significant numerical overhead as the power converter block consisting of power control, rotor side and grid side converter control and DC link are often simulated in detail. This paper develops a simple DFIG wind turbine model in which the power converter is simulated as a controlled voltage source, regulating the rotor current to meet the command of real and reactive power production. This model has the form of traditional generator model and hence is easy to integrate into the power system simulation tool such as PSS/E. As an example, the interaction between the Arklow Bank Wind Farm and the Irish National Grid was simulated using the proposed model. The model performance and accuracy was also compared with the detailed model developed by DIgSILENT.

There are several low complexity and low-power features incorporated in the proposed algorithms and the VLSI architecture. The proposed hard-output KSE decoder and the soft-output MKSE decoder is implemented for 4/spl times/4 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) MIMO detection in a 0.35-/spl mu/m and a 0.13-/spl mu/m CMOS technology, respectively.

Such trends are accelerated by the introduction of novel materials and nontraditional transistor geometries, including ultrathin body, FinFET, or nanowire devices, which impede heat conduction. Thermal analysis is complicated by subcontinuum phenomena including ballistic electron transport, which reshapes the heat generation region compared with classical diffusion theory predictions.

More precisely, the analysis aims at optimizing the product of the number of simultaneously successful transmissions per unit of space (spatial reuse) by the average range of each transmission. The optimization is obtained via an averaging over all Poisson configurations for the location of interfering mobiles, where an exact evaluation of signal over noise ratio is possible. The main mathematical tools stem from stochastic geometry and are spatial versions of the so-called additive and max shot noise processes. The resulting medium access control (MAC) protocol exhibits some interesting properties. First, it can be implemented in a decentralized way provided some local geographic information is available to the mobiles. In addition, its transport capacity is proportional to the square root of the density of mobiles which is the upper bound of Gupta and Kumar.

However, there usually is time to train the system, which we would show to be very useful. Assuming that several registered images of the target object are available, we developed a keypoint-based approach that is effective in this context by formulating wide-baseline matching of keypoints extracted from the input images to those found in the model images as a classification problem. This shifts much of the computational burden to a training phase, without sacrificing recognition performance. As a result, the resulting algorithm is robust, accurate, and fast-enough for frame-rate performance. This reduction in runtime computational complexity is our first contribution. Our second contribution is to show that, in this context, a simple and fast keypoint detector suffices to support detection and tracking even under large perspective and scale variations. While earlier methods require a detector that can be expected to produce very repeatable results, in general, which usually is very time-consuming, we simply find the most repeatable object keypoints for the specific target object during the training phase. We have incorporated these ideas into a real-time system that detects planar, nonplanar, and deformable objects. It then estimates the pose of the rigid ones and the deformations of the others.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1661548","Image processing and computer vision;object recognition;tracking;statistical;classifier design and evaluation;edge and feature detection.","Robustness;Phase estimation;Classification tree analysis;Computer vision;Pattern recognition;Deformable models;Processor scheduling;Phase detection;Statistical learning;Runtime","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","518","52","31","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Strained-Si hole mobility data are analyzed using six band k/spl middot/p calculations for stresses of technological importance: uniaxial longitudinal compressive and biaxial stress on [001] and [110] wafers. The calculations and experimental data show that low in-plane and large out-of-plane conductivity effective masses and a high density of states in the top band are all important for large hole mobility enhancement.

We derive a mixing result for PageRank vectors similar to that for random walks, and show that the ordering of the vertices produced by a PageRank vector reveals a cut with small conductance. In particular, we show that for any set C with conductance Phi and volume k, a PageRank vector with a certain starting distribution can be used to produce a set with conductance (O(radic(Phi log k)). We present an improved algorithm for computing approximate PageRank vectors, which allows us to find such a set in time proportional to its size.

They also provide for microchip architecture and may facilitate the integration of heterogeneous materials, devices, and signals. However, before these advantages can be realized, key technology challenges of 3D ICs must be addressed. More specifically, the processes required to build circuits with multiple layers of active devices must be compatible with current state-of-the-art silicon processing technology. These processes must also show manufacturability, i.e., reliability, good yield, maturity, and reasonable cost. To meet these requirements, IBM has introduced a scheme for building 3D ICs based on the layer transfer of functional circuits, and many process and design innovations have been implemented. This paper reviews the process steps and design aspects that were developed at IBM to enable the formation of stacked device layers. Details regarding an optimized layer transfer process are presented, including the descriptions of 1) a glass substrate process to enable through-wafer alignment; 2) oxide fusion bonding and wafer bow compensation methods for improved alignment tolerance during bonding; 3) and a single-damascene patterning and metallization method for the creation of high-aspect-ratio (6:1 < AR < 11:1) contacts between two stacked device layers. This process provides the shortest distance between the stacked layers (<2 µm), the highest interconnection density (>108 vias/cm2), and extremely aggressive wafer-to-wafer alignment (submicron) capability.","0018-8646","","10.1147/rd.504.0491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5388751","","","","511","31","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

This paper demonstrates that similar performance gains can be obtained in wireless relay networks employing terminals with MIMO capability. We consider a setup where a designated source terminal communicates with a designated destination terminal, both equipped with M antennas, assisted by K single-antenna or multiple-antenna relay terminals using a half-duplex protocol. Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI) at the destination and the relay terminals and no CSI at the source, we show that the corresponding network capacity scales as C = (M/2) log(K) + O(1) for fixed M, arbitrary (but fixed) number of (transmit and receive) antennas N at each of the relay terminals, and K rarr infin. We propose a protocol that assigns each relay terminal to one of the multiplexed data streams forwarded in a ""doubly coherent"" fashion (through matched filtering) to the destination terminal. It is shown that this protocol achieves the cut-set upper bound on network capacity for fixed M and K rarr infin (up to an O(1)-term) by employing independent stream decoding at the destination terminal. Our protocol performs inter-stream interference cancellation in a completely decentralized fashion, thereby orthogonalizing the effective MIMO channel between source and destination terminals. Finally, we discuss the case where the relay terminals do not have CSI and show that simple amplify-and-forward relaying, asymptotically in K, for fixed M and fixed N ges 1, turns the relay network into a point-to-point MIMO link with high-SNR capacity C = (M/2) log(SNR) + O(1), demonstrating that the use of relays as active scatterers can recover spatial multiplexing gain in poor scattering environments","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2006.1638664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638664","","MIMO;Relays;Protocols;Scattering;Telecommunication network reliability;Performance gain;Channel state information;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Matched filters","","505","2","47","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The criteria used by the PCA-DR and the MNF-DR are data variance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which are designed to measure data second-order statistics. This paper presents an independent component analysis (ICA) approach to DR, to be called ICA-DR which uses mutual information as a criterion to measure data statistical independency that exceeds second-order statistics. As a result, the ICA-DR can capture information that cannot be retained or preserved by second-order statistics-based DR techniques. In order for the ICA-DR to perform effectively, the virtual dimensionality (VD) is introduced to estimate number of dimensions needed to be retained as opposed to the energy percentage that has been used by the PCA-DR and MNF-DR to determine energies contributed by signal sources and noise. Since there is no prioritization among components generated by the ICA-DR due to the use of random initial projection vectors, we further develop criteria and algorithms to measure the significance of information contained in each of ICA-generated components for component prioritization. Finally, a comparative study and analysis is conducted among the three DR techniques, PCA-DR, MNF-DR, and ICA-DR in two applications, endmember extraction and data compression where the proposed ICA-DR has been shown to provide advantages over the PCA-DR and MNF-DR.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.863297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634722","Dimensionality reduction (DR);ICA-DR/MNF-DR;independent component analysis (ICA);maximum noise fraction (MNF);PCA-DR;principal components analysis (PCA);virtual dimensionality (VD)","Image analysis;Independent component analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Principal component analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Noise reduction;Signal design;Statistics;Mutual information;Statistical analysis","","501","","25","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, niched Pareto genetic algorithm, and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) have been developed and successfully applied to an environmental/economic electric power dispatch problem. A new procedure for quality measure is proposed in this paper in order to evaluate different techniques. A feasibility check procedure has been developed and superimposed on MOEA to restrict the search to the feasible region of the problem space. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is also imposed to provide the power system operator with a representative and manageable Pareto-optimal set. Moreover, an approach based on fuzzy set theory is developed to extract one of the Pareto-optimal solutions as the best compromise one. These multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have been individually examined and applied to the standard IEEE 30-bus six-generator test system. Several optimization runs have been carried out on different cases of problem complexity. The results of MOEA have been compared to those reported in the literature. The results confirm the potential and effectiveness of MOEA compared to the traditional multiobjective optimization techniques.

These methods process sentences in a very high-dimensional space and are consequently inefficient, require human input, and are not adaptable to some application domains. This paper focuses directly on computing the similarity between very short texts of sentence length. It presents an algorithm that takes account of semantic information and word order information implied in the sentences. The semantic similarity of two sentences is calculated using information from a structured lexical database and from corpus statistics. The use of a lexical database enables our method to model human common sense knowledge and the incorporation of corpus statistics allows our method to be adaptable to different domains. The proposed method can be used in a variety of applications that involve text knowledge representation and discovery. Experiments on two sets of selected sentence pairs demonstrate that the proposed method provides a similarity measure that shows a significant correlation to human intuition","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644735","Sentence similarity;semantic nets;corpus;natural language processing;word similarity.","Statistics;Humans;Text mining;Web pages;Databases;Knowledge representation;Natural languages;Image retrieval;Area measurement;Natural language processing","","498","11","39","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We formulate this problem as one of minimizing the closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to constraints on the controller structure. We define the notion of quadratic invariance of a constraint set with respect to a system, and show that if the constraint set has this property, then the constrained minimum-norm problem may be solved via convex programming. We also show that quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the constraint set to be preserved under feedback. These results are developed in a very general framework, and are shown to hold in both continuous and discrete time, for both stable and unstable systems, and for any norm. This notion unifies many previous results identifying specific tractable decentralized control problems, and delineates the largest known class of convex problems in decentralized control. As an example, we show that optimal stabilizing controllers may be efficiently computed in the case where distributed controllers can communicate faster than their dynamics propagate. We also show that symmetric synthesis is included in this classification, and provide a test for sparsity constraints to be quadratically invariant, and thus amenable to convex synthesis.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2005.860365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593901","Convex optimization;decentralized control;delayed control;extended linear spaces;networked control","Distributed control;Control systems;Optimal control;Automatic control;Feedback;Network synthesis;Space vehicles;Error correction;Quadratic programming;Distributed computing","","496","1","31","IEEE","13 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The causes are varied, e.g., mismatching losses, partial shadows, variations in current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of PV modules due to manufacturing processes, differences in the orientations and inclinations of solar surfaces, and temperature effects. These losses can be decreased by means of suitable electronics. This paper presents the intelligent PV module concept, a low-cost high-efficiency dc-dc converter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) functions, control, and power line communications (PLC). In addition, this paper analyses the alternatives for the architecture of grid-connected PV systems: centralized, string, and modular topologies. The proposed system, i.e., the intelligent PV module, fits within this last group. Its principles of operation, as well as the topology of boost dc-dc converter, are analyzed. Besides, a comparison of MPPT methods is performed, which shows the best results for the incremental conductance method. Regarding communications, PLC in every PV module and its feasibility for grid-connected PV plants are considered and analyzed in this paper.

In its simplest form, the frequency diverse array applies a linear phase progression across the aperture. This linear phase progression induces an electronic beam scan, as in a conventional phased array. When an additional linear frequency shift is applied across the elements, a new term is generated which results in a scan angle that varies with range in the far-field. This provides more flexible beam scan options, as well as providing resistance to point interference such as multipath. More general implementations provide greater degrees of freedom for space-time-frequency-phase-polarization control, permitting novel concepts for simultaneous multi-mission operation, such as performing synthetic aperture radar and ground moving target indication at the same time.","2375-5318","0-7803-9496-8","10.1109/RADAR.2006.1631800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631800","","Frequency diversity;Radar;Phased arrays;Laboratories;Educational institutions;Interference;Aperture antennas;Antenna arrays;Linear antenna arrays;Pattern analysis","","490","1","3","IEEE","30 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method solves the surface segmentation problem by transforming it into computing a minimum s{\hbox{-}} t cut in a derived arc-weighted directed graph. The proposed algorithm has a low-order polynomial time complexity and is computationally efficient.

TSVMs exploit specific iterative algorithms which gradually search a reliable separating hyperplane (in the kernel space) with a transductive process that incorporates both labeled and unlabeled samples in the training phase. Based on an analysis of the properties of the TSVMs presented in the literature, a novel modified TSVM classifier designed for addressing ill-posed remote-sensing problems is proposed. In particular, the proposed technique: 1) is based on a novel transductive procedure that exploits a weighting strategy for unlabeled patterns, based on a time-dependent criterion; 2) is able to mitigate the effects of suboptimal model selection (which is unavoidable in the presence of small-size training sets); and 3) can address multiclass cases.

Using the controller passivity concept, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii technique, and Parseval's identity, we can passify the combination of the delayed communication and control blocks altogether robustly, as long as the delays are finite constants and an upper bound for the round-trip delay is known. Having explicit position feedback through the delayed P-action, the proposed framework enforces master-slave position coordination, which is often compromised in the conventional scattering-based teleoperation.

The recessed-gate structure is very attractive for realizing normally off high-voltage AlGaN/GaN HEMTs because the gate threshold voltage can be controlled by the etching depth of the recess without significant increase in on-resistance characteristics. With this structure the threshold voltage can be increased with the reduction of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density only under the gate electrode without reduction of 2DEG density in the other channel regions such as the channel between drain and gate. The threshold-voltage increase was experimentally demonstrated. The threshold voltage of fabricated recessed-gate device increased to -0.14 V while the threshold voltage without the recessed-gate structure was about -4 V. The specific on-resistance of the device was maintained as low as 4 m/spl Omega//spl middot/cm/sup 2/ and the breakdown voltage was 435 V. The on-resistance and the breakdown voltage tradeoff characteristics were the same as those of normally on devices. From the viewpoint of device design, the on-resistance for the normally off device was modeled using the relationship between the AlGaN layer thickness under the gate electrode and the 2DEG density. It is found that the MIS gate structure and the recess etching without the offset region between recess edge and gate electrode will further improve the on-resistance. The simulation results show the possibility of the on-resistance below 1 m/spl Omega//spl middot/cm/sup 2/ for normally off AlGaN/GaN HEMTs operating at several hundred volts with threshold voltage up to +1 V.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2005.862708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580874","GaN;high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs);high voltage;recessed gate","Power MODFETs;Power semiconductor devices;Aluminum compounds;Gallium compounds","","474","95","20","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We pose the problem of finding the best vertex positional configuration in the presence of an additional proximity constraint, in the sense that, the second smallest eigenvalue of the corresponding graph Laplacian is maximized. In many recent applications of algebraic graph theory in systems and control, the second smallest eigenvalue of Laplacian has emerged as a critical parameter that influences the stability and robustness properties of dynamic systems that operate over an information network. Our motivation in the present work is to ""assign"" this Laplacian eigenvalue when relative positions of various elements dictate the interconnection of the underlying weighted graph. In this venue, one would then be able to ""synthesize"" information graphs that have desirable system theoretic properties.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2005.861710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576862","Euclidean distance matrix;graph Laplacian;networked dynamic systems;semidefinite programming","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Laplace equations;Robust stability;Dynamic programming;Constraint theory;Graph theory;Control systems;Robust control;Wireless networks","","474","3","20","IEEE","16 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among the numerous techniques that were developed, the optimal Wiener filter can be considered as one of the most fundamental noise reduction approaches, which has been delineated in different forms and adopted in various applications. Although it is not a secret that the Wiener filter may cause some detrimental effects to the speech signal (appreciable or even significant degradation in quality or intelligibility), few efforts have been reported to show the inherent relationship between noise reduction and speech distortion. By defining a speech-distortion index to measure the degree to which the speech signal is deformed and two noise-reduction factors to quantify the amount of noise being attenuated, this paper studies the quantitative performance behavior of the Wiener filter in the context of noise reduction. We show that in the single-channel case the a posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (defined after the Wiener filter) is greater than or equal to the a priori SNR (defined before the Wiener filter), indicating that the Wiener filter is always able to achieve noise reduction. However, the amount of noise reduction is in general proportional to the amount of speech degradation. This may seem discouraging as we always expect an algorithm to have maximal noise reduction without much speech distortion. Fortunately, we show that speech distortion can be better managed in three different ways. If we have some a priori knowledge (such as the linear prediction coefficients) of the clean speech signal, this a priori knowledge can be exploited to achieve noise reduction while maintaining a low level of speech distortion. When no a priori knowledge is available, we can still achieve a better control of noise reduction and speech distortion by properly manipulating the Wiener filter, resulting in a suboptimal Wiener filter. In case that we have multiple microphone sensors, the multiple observations of the speech signal can be used to reduce noise with less or even no speech distortion.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TSA.2005.860851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1643650","Microphone arrays;noise reduction;speech distortion;Wiener filter","Noise reduction;Wiener filter;Speech enhancement;Acoustic distortion;Working environment noise;Acoustic noise;Signal to noise ratio;Degradation;Microphones;Automatic speech recognition","","472","27","56","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using this method, the Vth of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs can be continuously shifted from -4 V in a conventional depletion-mode (D-mode) AlGaN/GaN HEMT to 0.9 V in an enhancement-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMT. It was found that the plasma-induced damages result in a mobility degradation of two-dimensional electron gas. The damages can be repaired and the mobility can be recovered by a post-gate annealing step at 400 degC. At the same time, the shift in Vth shows a good thermal stability and is not affected by the post-gate annealing. The enhancement-mode HEMTs show a performance (transconductance, cutoff frequencies) comparable to the D-mode HEMTs. Experimental results confirm that the threshold-voltage shift originates from the incorporation of F ions in the AlGaN barrier. In addition, the fluoride-based plasma treatment was also found to be effective in lowering the gate-leakage current, in both forward and reverse bias regions.

Automatic determination of the most visually relevant areas would be useful in many applications such as image and video coding, watermarking, video browsing, and quality assessment. Many research groups are currently investigating computational modeling of the visual attention system. The first published computational models have been based on some basic and well-understood human visual system (HVS) properties. These models feature a single perceptual layer that simulates only one aspect of the visual system. More recent models integrate complex features of the HVS and simulate hierarchical perceptual representation of the visual input. The bottom-up mechanism is the most occurring feature found in modern models. This mechanism refers to involuntary attention (i.e., salient spatial visual features that effortlessly or involuntary attract our attention). This paper presents a coherent computational approach to the modeling of the bottom-up visual attention. This model is mainly based on the current understanding of the HVS behavior. Contrast sensitivity functions, perceptual decomposition, visual masking, and center-surround interactions are some of the features implemented in this model. The performances of this algorithm are assessed by using natural images and experimental measurements from an eye-tracking system. Two adequate well-known metrics (correlation coefficient and Kullbacl-Leibler divergence) are used to validate this model. A further metric is also defined. The results from this model are finally compared to those from a reference bottom-up model.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.86","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1608042","Computationally modeled human vision;bottom-up visual attention;coherent modeling;eye tracking experiments.","Computational modeling;Humans;Visual system;Layout;Feature extraction;Information filtering;Information filters;Video coding;Watermarking;Quality assessment","Artificial Intelligence;Attention;Color Perception;Computer Simulation;Fixation, Ocular;Humans;Models, Neurological;Pattern Recognition, Visual;Visual Fields","467","19","44","IEEE","20 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fact that wind power penetration continues to increase has motivated a need to develop more widely applicable methodologies for evaluating the actual benefits of adding wind turbines to conventional generating systems. Reliability evaluation of generating systems with wind energy sources is a complex process. It requires an accurate wind speed forecasting technique for the wind farm site. The method requires historical wind speed data collected over many years for the wind farm location to determine the necessary parameters of the wind speed models for the particular site. The evaluation process should also accurately model the intermittent nature of power output from the wind farm. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation or a multistate wind farm representation approach is often used. This paper presents a simplified method for reliability evaluation of power systems with wind power. The development of a common wind speed model applicable to multiple wind farm locations is presented and illustrated with an example. The method is further simplified by determining the minimum multistate representation for a wind farm generation model in reliability evaluation. The paper presents a six-step common wind speed model applicable to multiple geographic locations and adequate for reliability evaluation of power systems containing significant wind penetration. Case studies on a test system are presented using wind data from Canadian geographic locations.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2006.874233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634602","Generation system;reliability evaluation;time-series model;wind power","Wind power generation;Power system reliability;Power system modeling;Wind farms;Wind energy generation;Wind speed;Power generation;Wind energy;Wind turbines;Renewable energy resources","","465","","10","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Corneal reflections are produced by light sources that illuminate the eye and the centers of the pupil and corneal reflections are estimated in video images from one or more cameras. The general theory covers the full range of possible system configurations. Using one camera and one light source, the POG can be estimated only if the head is completely stationary. Using one camera and multiple light sources, the POG can be estimated with free head movements, following the completion of a multiple-point calibration procedure. When multiple cameras and multiple light sources are used, the POG can be estimated following a simple one-point calibration procedure. Experimental and simulation results suggest that the main sources of gaze estimation errors are the discrepancy between the shape of real corneas and the spherical corneal shape assumed in the general theory, and the noise in the estimation of the centers of the pupil and corneal reflections. A detailed example of a system that uses the general theory to estimate the POG on a computer screen is presented.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.863952","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634506","Model;point of regard;pupil center and corneal reflection(s);remote gaze estimation;system configurations;video based gaze estimation","Optical reflection;Light sources;Cameras;Head;Calibration;Shape;Estimation error;Cornea;Multi-stage noise shaping;Acoustic reflection","Computer Simulation;Cornea;Cornea;Corneal Topography;Eye Movements;Fixation, Ocular;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Iris;Models, Biological;Ophthalmoscopy;Photometry;Pupil;Video Recording","465","64","31","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that in this 2D representation, it is possible to relight all the image pixels in the same way, effectively deriving a 2D image representation which is additionally shadow-free. Finally, we show how to recover a 3D, full color shadow-free image representation by first (with the help of the 2D representation) identifying shadow edges.

MCSA is a method for motor diagnosis with stator-current signals. The proposed system diagnoses induction motors having four types of faults such as breakage of rotor bars and end rings, short-circuit of stator windings, bearing cracks, and air-gap eccentricity. Although MCSA is one of the most powerful online methods for diagnosing motor faults, it has some shortcomings, which degrade performance and accuracy of a motor-diagnosis system. Therefore, advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms are proposed. They are composed of an optimal-slip-estimation algorithm, a proper-sample-selection algorithm, and a frequency auto search algorithm for achieving MCSA efficiently. The proposed system is able to ascertain four kinds of motor faults and diagnose the fault status of an induction motor.

In doing so, we first define EVM with normalization so that the definition stands for multi-modulation systems, viz. binary phas shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) etc. We also compare among the different performance metrics and show that EVM can be equivalently useful as signal to noise ratio and bit error rate.

Although many approaches for data extraction from Web pages have been developed, there has been limited effort to compare such tools. Unfortunately, in only a few cases can the results generated by distinct tools be directly compared since the addressed extraction tasks are different. This paper surveys the major Web data extraction approaches and compares them in three dimensions: the task domain, the automation degree, and the techniques used. The criteria of the first dimension explain why an IE system fails to handle some Web sites of particular structures. The criteria of the second dimension classify IE systems based on the techniques used. The criteria of the third dimension measure the degree of automation for IE systems.

These and other benefits accrue using a low-thermal-budget CMOS manufacturing process requiring two fewer masks than conventional bulk CMOS. The SB-CMOS manufacturing process enables integration of critical new materials such as high-k gate insulators and strained silicon substrates. SB MOSFET technology state of the art is also reviewed, and shown to be focused on barrier-height-lowering techniques that use interfacial layers between the metal S/Ds and the channel region.

This work investigated a penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) approach to address this problem in two dimensions, where the WLS considers first- and second-order noise moments and the penalty models signal spatial correlations. Three different implementations were studied for the PWLS minimization. One utilizes a Markov random field (MRF) Gibbs functional to consider spatial correlations among nearby detector bins and projection views in sinogram space and minimizes the PWLS cost function by iterative Gauss-Seidel algorithm. Another employs Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform to de-correlate data signals among nearby views and minimizes the PWLS adaptively to each KL component by analytical calculation, where the spatial correlation among nearby bins is modeled by the same Gibbs functional. The third one models the spatial correlations among image pixels in image domain also by a MRF Gibbs functional and minimizes the PWLS by iterative successive over-relaxation algorithm. In these three implementations, a quadratic functional regularization was chosen for the MRF model. Phantom experiments showed a comparable performance of these three PWLS-based methods in terms of suppressing noise-induced streak artifacts and preserving resolution in the reconstructed images. Computer simulations concurred with the phantom experiments in terms of noise-resolution tradeoff and detectability in low contrast environment.

As inputs our models use the numerical forecasts of wind speed and direction provided by atmospheric modeling system SKIRON for four nearby positions up to 30 km away from the wind turbine cluster. Three types of local recurrent neural networks are employed as forecasting models, namely, the infinite impulse response multilayer perceptron (IIR-MLP), the local activation feedback multilayer network (LAF-MLN), and the diagonal recurrent neural network (RNN). These networks contain internal feedback paths, with the neuron connections implemented by means of IIR synaptic filters. Two novel and optimal on-line learning schemes are suggested for the update of the recurrent network's weights based on the recursive prediction error algorithm. The methods assure continuous stability of the network during the learning phase and exhibit improved performance compared to the conventional dynamic back propagation. Extensive experimentation is carried out where the three recurrent networks are additionally compared to two static models, a finite-impulse response NN (FIR-NN) and a conventional static-MLP network.

Then, a whole system matrix was derived by processing the responses in projection space. Such responses included both geometrical and detection physics components of the system matrix.

Each species is grouped around a dominating particle called the species seed. At each iteration step, species seeds are identified from the entire population, and then adopted as neighborhood bests for these individual species groups separately. Species are formed adaptively at each step based on the feedback obtained from the multimodal fitness landscape. Over successive iterations, species are able to simultaneously optimize toward multiple optima, regardless of whether they are global or local optima.

This paper describes the basic theory of stabilizer codes over finite fields. The relation between stabilizer codes and general quantum codes is clarified by introducing a Galois theory for these objects. A characterization of nonbinary stabilizer codes over$bf F_q$in terms of classical codes over$ bf F_q^2$is provided that generalizes the well-known notion of additive codes over$ bf F_4$of the binary case. This paper also derives lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance of stabilizer codes, gives several code constructions, and derives numerous families of stabilizer codes, including quantum Hamming codes, quadratic residue codes, quantum Melas codes, quantum Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, and quantum character codes.

Statistically meaningful results are obtained by analyzing performance variances caused by varying training and test sets. Furthermore, we investigate how classification performance and training sample size are correlated. Sample size is adjusted by increasing the number of manually labeled training data or by employing automatic bootstrapping or cascade techniques.

Spherical shells of homogenous, isotropic negative permittivity (ENG) material are designed to create electrically small resonant systems for several antennas: an infinitesimal electric dipole, a very short center-fed cylindrical electric dipole, and a very short coaxially-fed electric monopole over an infinite ground plane. Analytical and numerical models demonstrate that a properly designed ENG shell provides a distributed inductive element resonantly matched to these highly capacitive electrically small antennas, i.e., an ENG shell can be designed to produce an electrically small system with a zero input reactance and an input resistance that is matched to a specified source resistance leading to overall efficiencies approaching unity. Losses and dispersion characteristics of the ENG materials are also included in the analytical models. Finite element numerical models of the various antenna-ENG shell systems are developed and used to predict their input impedances. These electrically small antenna-ENG shell systems with idealized dispersionless ENG material properties are shown to be very efficient and to have fractional bandwidths above the values associated with the Chu limit for the quality factor without any degradation in the radiation patterns of the antennas. Introducing dispersion and losses into the analytical models, the resulting bandwidths are shown to be reduced significantly, but remain slightly above (below) the corresponding Chu-based value for an energy-based limiting (Drude) dispersion model of the permittivity of the ENG shell.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2006.877179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1650411","antenna theory;Chu limit;complex media;electrically small antennas;electromagnetic theory;metamaterials","Dipole antennas;Analytical models;Permittivity;Bandwidth;Metamaterials;Dispersion","","435","","46","IEEE","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The differential evolution (DE) algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm that uses a rather greedy and less stochastic approach to problem solving than do classical evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, and evolution strategies. DE also incorporates an efficient way of self-adapting mutation using small populations. The potentialities of DE are its simple structure, easy use, convergence property, quality of solution, and robustness. This paper proposes a new approach for solving economic load dispatch problems with valve-point effect. The proposed method combines the DE algorithm with the generator of chaos sequences and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) technique to optimize the performance of economic dispatch problems. The DE with chaos sequences is the global optimizer, and the SQP is used to fine-tune the DE run in a sequential manner. The combined methodology and its variants are validated for two test systems consisting of 13 and 40 thermal units whose incremental fuel cost function takes into account the valve-point loading effects. The proposed combined method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in solving load dispatch problems with the valve-point effect.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1626407","Chaotic sequences;differential evolution (DE);economic dispatch;evolutionary algorithms;optimization;power generation;valve-point effect","Chaos;Quadratic programming;Power generation economics;Fuel economy;Evolutionary computation;Optimization methods;Power system economics;Power systems;Stochastic processes;Problem-solving","","434","","33","IEEE","1 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a new transmission approach, called spatial modulation, that entirely avoids ICI and requires no synchronization between the transmitting antennas while maintaining high spectral efficiency is presented. A block of information bits is mapped into a constellation point in the signal and the spatial domain, i.e. into the location of a particular antenna. The receiver estimates the transmitted signal and the transmit antenna number and uses the two information to de-map the block of information bits. For this purpose, a novel transmit antenna number detection algorithm called iterative-maximum ratio combining (i-MRC) is presented. Spatial modulation is used to transmit different number of information bits and i-MRC is used to estimate both the transmitted signal and the transmit antenna number. The results are compared to ideal V-BLAST (vertical-Bell Lab layered space-time) and to MRC. Spatial modulation outperforms MRC. The (bit-error-ratio) BER performance and the achieved spectral efficiency is comparable to V-BLAST. However, spatial modulation results in a vast reduction in receiver complexity.","","1-4244-0462-2","10.1109/CHINACOM.2006.344658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4149911","","Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;MIMO;Binary phase shift keying;Quadrature phase shift keying;Interchannel interference;Constellation diagram;Detection algorithms;Quality of service;Quadrature amplitude modulation","","432","3","13","IEEE","10 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that clustering in embedding spaces is equivalent to compressing operators. The objective of data partitioning and clustering is to coarse-grain the random walk on the data while at the same time preserving a diffusion operator for the intrinsic geometry or connectivity of the data set up to some accuracy.

In comparison with conventional conditions, the proposed condition is not only suitable for designing fuzzy state feedback controllers but also convenient for fuzzy static output feedback controller design. The latter design work is quite hard for T-S fuzzy control systems. Based on the LMI-based conditions derived, one can easily synthesize controllers for stabilizing T-S fuzzy control systems.

As nodes of BASN are expected to be interconnected on or in the human body, the body itself can form an inherently secure communication pathway that is unavailable to all other kinds of wireless networks. This article explores the use of this conduit in the security mechanism of BASN; that is, by a biometrics approach that uses an intrinsic characteristic of the human body as the authentication identity or the means of securing the distribution of a cipher key to secure inter-BASN communications. The method was tested on 99 subjects with 838 segments of simultaneous recordings of electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram. By using the interpulse interval (IPI) as the biometric trait, the system achieved a minimum half total error rate of 2.58 percent when the IPIs measured from signals, which were sampled at 1000 Hz, were coded into 128-bit binary sequences. The study opens up a few key issues for future investigation, including compensation schemes for the asynchrony of different channels, coding schemes, and other suitable biometric traits.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2006.1632652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632652","","Wireless sensor networks;Biometrics;Communication system security;Biosensors;Telemedicine;Humans;Wireless networks;Authentication;Testing;Error analysis","","426","38","13","IEEE","15 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This concept motivates us to represent the linguistic information by means of 2-tuples, which are composed by two proportional linguistic terms. For clarity and generality, we first study proportional 2-tuples under ordinal contexts. Then, under linguistic contexts and based on canonical characteristic values (CCVs) of linguistic labels, we define many aggregation operators to handle proportional 2-tuple linguistic information in a computational stage for CW without any loss of information. Our approach for this proportional 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model deals with linguistic labels, which do not have to be symmetrically distributed around a medium label and without the traditional requirement of having ""equal distance"" between them. Moreover, this new model not only provides a space to allow a ""continuous"" interpolation of a sequence of ordered linguistic labels, but also provides an opportunity to describe the initial linguistic information by members of a ""continuous"" linguistic scale domain which does not necessarily require the ordered linguistic terms of a linguistic variable being equidistant. Meanwhile, under the assumption of equally informative (which is defined by a condition based on the concept of CCV), we show that our model reduces to Herrera and Mart/spl inodot//spl acute/nez's (translational) 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.876337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638459","Computing with words (CW);linguistic modeling;linguistic variables;ordinal modeling;weighted linguistic aggregation","Interpolation;Fuzzy reasoning;Humans;Computational modeling;Industrial engineering;Engineering management","","419","","32","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To better understand how developers gain this understanding and how software development environments might be involved, a study was performed in which developers were given an unfamiliar program and asked to work on two debugging tasks and three enhancement tasks for 70 minutes. The study found that developers interleaved three activities. They began by searching for relevant code both manually and using search tools; however, they based their searches on limited and misrepresentative cues in the code, environment, and executing program, often leading to failed searches. When developers found relevant code, they followed its incoming and outgoing dependencies, often returning to it and navigating its other dependencies; while doing so, however, Eclipse's navigational tools caused significant overhead. Developers collected code and other information that they believed would be necessary to edit, duplicate, or otherwise refer to later by encoding it in the interactive state of Eclipse's package explorer, file tabs, and scroll bars. However, developers lost track of relevant code as these interfaces were used for other tasks, and developers were forced to find it again. These issues caused developers to spend, on average, 35 percent of their time performing the mechanics of navigation within and between source files. These observations suggest a new model of program understanding grounded in theories of information foraging and suggest ideas for tools that help developers seek, relate, and collect information in a more effective and explicit manner.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2006.116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016573","Program investigation;program understanding;program comprehension;empirical software engineering;information foraging;information scent.","Software maintenance;Programming;Navigation;Software engineering;Software tools;Performance gain;Debugging;Encoding;Packaging;Bars","","419","1","51","IEEE","30 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While most previous methods end up with producing smaller size stabilized videos, our completion method can produce full-frame videos by naturally filling in missing image parts by locally aligning image data of neighboring frames. To achieve this, motion inpainting is proposed to enforce spatial and temporal consistency of the completion in both static and dynamic image areas. In addition, image quality in the stabilized video is enhanced with a new practical deblurring algorithm. Instead of estimating point spread functions, our method transfers and interpolates sharper image pixels of neighboring frames to increase the sharpness of the frame. The proposed video completion and deblurring methods enabled us to develop a complete video stabilizer which can naturally keep the original image quality in the stabilized videos. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by extensive experiments over a wide variety of videos.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634345","Video analysis;video stabilization;video completion;motion inpainting;sharpning and deblurring;video enhancement.","Cameras;Pixel;Image quality;Layout;Motion estimation;Robustness;Filling;Image motion analysis;Motion analysis;Video sequences","Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Motion;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Paintings;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;Video Recording","417","32","44","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to terminate this algorithm a recently developed concept, virtual dimensionality (VD), is implemented as a stopping rule to determine the number of vertices required for the algorithm to generate. The SGA improves one commonly used EEA, the N-finder algorithm (N-FINDR) developed by Winter, by including a process of growing simplexes one vertex at a time until it reaches a desired number of vertices estimated by the VD, which results in a tremendous reduction of computational complexity.

A repeatable binary string, which we call a biometric key, is generated reliably from genuine iris codes. A well-known difficulty has been how to cope with the 10 to 20 percent of error bits within an iris code and derive an error-free key. To solve this problem, we carefully studied the error patterns within iris codes and devised a two-layer error correction technique that combines Hadamard and Reed-Solomon codes. The key is generated from a subject's iris image with the aid of auxiliary error-correction data, which do not reveal the key and can be saved in a tamper-resistant token, such as a smart card. The reproduction of the key depends on two factors: the iris biometric and the token. The attacker has to procure both of them to compromise the key. We evaluated our technique using iris samples from 70 different eyes, with 10 samples from each eye. We found that an error-free key can be reproduced reliably from genuine iris codes with a 99.5 percent success rate. We can generate up to 140 bits of biometric key, more than enough for 128-bit AES. The extraction of a repeatable binary string from biometrics opens new possible applications, where a strong binding is required between a person and cryptographic operations. For example, it is possible to identify individuals without maintaining a central database of biometric templates, to which privacy objections might be raised.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2006.138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668036","Biometrics;iris code;Hadamard code;Reed-Solomon code.","","","416","23","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The gap between average and peak power actually widens with increased levels of core integration. As such, if per-core control of power levels (modes) is possible, a global power manager should be able to dynamically set the modes suitably. This would be done in tune with the workload characteristics, in order to always maintain a chip-level power that is below the specified budget. Furthermore, this should be possible without significant degradation of chip-level throughput performance. We analyze and validate this concept in detail in this paper. We assume a per-core DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) knob to be available to such a conceptual global power manager. We evaluate several different policies for global multi-core power management. In this analysis, we consider various different objectives such as prioritization and optimized throughput. Overall, our results show that in the context of a workload comprised of SPEC benchmark threads, our best architected policies can come within 1% of the performance of an ideal oracle, while meeting a given chip-level power budget.

At the receiver, a phase-diversity homodyne detection scheme is employed without locking the phase of the local oscillator (LO). To handle the carrier phase drift, the carrier phase is estimated with digital signal processing (DSP) on the homodyne-detected signal. Such a scheme presents the following major advantages over the conventional optical differential detection. First, its bit error rate (BER) performance is better than that of differential detection. This higher sensitivity can extend the reach of unrepeated transmission systems and reduce crosstalk between multiwavelength channels. Second, the optoelectronic conversion process is linear, so that the whole optical signal information can be postprocessed in the electrical domain. Third, this scheme is applicable to multilevel modulation formats such as M-array PSK and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The performance of the receiver is evaluated through various simulations and experiments. As a result, an unrepeated transmission over 210 km with a 20-Gb/s optical QPSK signal is achieved. Moreover, in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) environment, coherent detection allows the filtering of a desired wavelength channel to reside entirely in the electrical domain, taking advantage of the sharp cutoff characteristics of electrical filters. The experiments show the feasibility to transmit polarization-multiplexed 40-Gb/s QPSK signals over 200 km with channel spacing of 16 GHz, leading to a spectral efficiency as high as 2.5 b/s/Hz.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2005.860477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589027","Optical fiber communication;phase modulation","Optical detectors;Phase detection;Phase shift keying;Phase estimation;Optical receivers;Optical filters;Optical crosstalk;Optical sensors;Optical signal processing;Quadrature phase shift keying","","414","44","8","IEEE","6 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to conventional computing, the latter task is nontrivial because the state space of an n-qubit register is not finite and contains exponential superpositions of classical bitstrings. The proposed circuits are asymptotically optimal for respective tasks and improve earlier published results by at least a factor of 2. The circuits for generic quantum computation constructed by the algorithms are the most efficient known today in terms of the number of most expensive gates [quantum controlled-NOTs (CNOTs)]. They are based on an analog of the Shannon decomposition of Boolean functions and a new circuit block, called quantum multiplexor (QMUX), which generalizes several known constructions. A theoretical lower bound implies that the circuits cannot be improved by more than a factor of 2. It is additionally shown how to accommodate the severe architectural limitation of using only nearest neighbor gates, which is representative of current implementation technologies. This increases the number of gates by almost an order of magnitude, but preserves the asymptotic optimality of gate counts.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2005.855930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629135","Application specific integrated circuits;circuit analysis;circuit optimization;circuit synthesis;circuit topology;design automation;logic design;matrix decompositions;quantum effect semiconductor devices;quantum theory","Circuit synthesis;Quantum computing;Design automation;Optimized production technology;Registers;Electronic design automation and methodology;Circuit testing;Automatic testing;State-space methods;Boolean functions","","413","9","38","IEEE","8 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The contourlet expansion is composed of basis images oriented at various directions in multiple scales, with flexible aspect ratios. Given this rich set of basis images, the contourlet transform effectively captures smooth contours that are the dominant feature in natural images. We begin with a detailed study on the statistics of the contourlet coefficients of natural images: using histograms to estimate the marginal and joint distributions and mutual information to measure the dependencies between coefficients. This study reveals the highly non-Gaussian marginal statistics and strong interlocation, interscale, and interdirection dependencies of contourlet coefficients. We also find that conditioned on the magnitudes of their generalized neighborhood coefficients, contourlet coefficients can be approximately modeled as Gaussian random variables. Based on these findings, we model contourlet coefficients using a hidden Markov tree (HMT) model with Gaussian mixtures that can capture all interscale, interdirection, and interlocation dependencies. We present experimental results using this model in image denoising and texture retrieval applications. In denoising, the contourlet HMT outperforms other wavelet methods in terms of visual quality, especially around edges. In texture retrieval, it shows improvements in performance for various oriented textures.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.873450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632214","Contourlets;image modeling;multidirection;multiscale;multiscale geometric analysis;statistical models;wavelets","Hidden Markov models;Wavelet transforms;Statistical distributions;Filter bank;Histograms;Mutual information;Random variables;Image denoising;Image retrieval;Noise reduction","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical","413","2","35","IEEE","15 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electroporation is the generation of a destabilizing electric potential across biological membranes that causes the formation of nanoscale defects in the lipid bilayer. In IRE, these defects are permanent and lead to cell death. This paper builds on our earlier theoretical work and demonstrates that IRE can become an effective method for nonthermal tissue ablation requiring no drugs. To test the capability of IRE pulses to ablate tissue in a controlled fashion, we subjected the livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats to a single 20-ms-long square pulse of 1000 V/cm, which calculations had predicted would cause nonthermal IRE. Three hours after the pulse, treated areas in perfusion-fixed livers exhibited microvascular occlusion, endothelial cell necrosis, and diapedeses, resulting in ischemic damage to parenchyma and massive pooling of erythrocytes in sinusoids. However, large blood vessel architecture was preserved. Hepatocytes displayed blurred cell borders, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, variable pyknosis and vacuolar degeneration. Mathematical analysis indicates that this damage was primarily nonthermal in nature and that sharp borders between affected and unaffected regions corresponded to electric fields of 300-500 V/cm.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.873745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1643410","Bioheat equation;cancer therapy;electro-permeabilization;finite element analysis;microvascular occlusion","In vivo;Liver;Minimally invasive surgery;Electric potential;Biomembranes;Nanobioscience;Lipidomics;Drugs;Testing;Rats","Animals;Catheter Ablation;Computer Simulation;Electroporation;Hepatectomy;Liver;Liver;Male;Models, Biological;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Treatment Outcome","412","128","43","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a novel 3D model-based algorithm which performs this task automatically and efficiently. A 3D model of an object is automatically constructed offline from its multiple unordered range images (views). These views are converted into multidimensional table representations (which we refer to as tensors). Correspondences are automatically established between these views by simultaneously matching the tensors of a view with those of the remaining views using a hash table-based voting scheme. This results in a graph of relative transformations used to register the views before they are integrated into a seamless 3D model. These models and their tensor representations constitute the model library. During online recognition, a tensor from the scene is simultaneously matched with those in the library by casting votes. Similarity measures are calculated for the model tensors which receive the most votes. The model with the highest similarity is transformed to the scene and, if it aligns accurately with an object in the scene, that object is declared as recognized and is segmented. This process is repeated until the scene is completely segmented. Experiments were performed on real and synthetic data comprised of 55 models and 610 scenes and an overall recognition rate of 95 percent was achieved.

In addition, the impact on losses of different DG technologies, such as combined heat and power, wind power, photovoltaic, and fuel-cells, is analyzed. Results show that energy losses variation, as a function of the DG penetration level, presents a characteristic U-shape trajectory. Moreover, when DG units are more dispersed along network feeders, higher losses reduction can be expected.

In contrast to state-of-the-art stochastic MIMO channel models, the spatial correlation properties of the channel are not divided into separate contributions from transmitter and receiver. Instead, the joint correlation properties are modeled by describing the average coupling between the eigenmodes of the two link ends. The necessary and sufficient condition for the proposed model to hold is that the eigenbasis at the receiver is independent of the transmit weights, and vice versa. The authors discuss the mathematical elements of the model, which can be easily extracted from measurements, from a radio propagation point of view and explain the underlying assumption of the model in physical terms. The validation of the proposed model by means of measured data obtained from two completely different measurement campaigns reveals its ability to better predict capacity and spatial channel structure than other popular stochastic channel models.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2006.1576533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576533","","Stochastic processes;MIMO;Receivers;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Radio transmitters;Sufficient conditions;Data mining;Radio propagation;Channel capacity","","405","4","25","IEEE","16 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the assumptions that all users have the same number of receive antennas and utilize all receive antennas when scheduled for transmission, the number of simultaneously supportable users with BD is limited by the ratio of the number of base station transmit antennas to the number of user receive antennas. In a downlink MIMO system with a large number of users, the base station may select a subset of users to serve in order to maximize the total throughput. The brute-force search for the optimal user set, however, is computationally prohibitive. We propose two low-complexity suboptimal user selection algorithms for multiuser MIMO systems with BD. Both algorithms aim to select a subset of users such that the total throughput is nearly maximized. The first user selection algorithm greedily maximizes the total throughput, whereas the criterion of the second algorithm is based on the channel energy. We show that both algorithms have linear complexity in the total number of users and achieve around 95% of the total throughput of the complete search method in simulations.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.879269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1677932","Downlink;Frobenius norm;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);multiuser;sum capacity","MIMO;Receiving antennas;Throughput;Downlink;Broadcasting;Covariance matrix;Base stations;Transmitting antennas;Channel capacity;Null space","","402","46","21","IEEE","21 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show how to solve the latter problem in a variety of scenarios, including the important common scenario of sender-driven streaming with feedback over a best-effort network, which we couch in the framework of Markov decision processes. We derive a fast practical algorithm for nearly optimal streaming in this scenario, and we derive a general purpose iterative descent algorithm for locally optimal streaming in arbitrary scenarios. Experimental results show that systems based on our algorithms have steady-state gains of 2-6 dB or more over systems that are not rate-distortion optimized.

This paper proposes a residual test (RT) that can simultaneously determine the number of line-of-sight (LOS) BS and identify them. Then, localization can proceed with only those LOS BS. The RT works on the principle that when all measurements are LOS, the normalized residuals have a central Chi-Square distribution, versus a noncentral distribution when there is NLOS. The residuals are the squared differences between the estimates and the true position. Normalization by their variances gives a unity variance to the resultant random variables. In simulation studies, for the chosen geometry and NLOS and measurement noise errors, the RT can determine the correct number of LOS-BS over 90% of the time. For four or more BS, where there are at least three LOS-BS, the estimator has variances that are near the Cramer--Rao lower bound.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2005.861207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583910","Mobile positioning;non-line-of-sight (NLOS);time-of-arrival (ToA)","Base stations;Testing;Geometry;Random variables;Solid modeling;Noise measurement;Time measurement;Error correction;Mobile handsets;Global Positioning System","","399","11","27","IEEE","30 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the tracking algorithm, foreground pixels are clustered using a fast accurate fuzzy k-means algorithm. Growing and prediction of the cluster centroids of foreground pixels ensure that each cluster centroid is associated with a moving object in the scene. In the algorithm for learning motion patterns, trajectories are clustered hierarchically using spatial and temporal information and then each motion pattern is represented with a chain of Gaussian distributions. Based on the learned statistical motion patterns, statistical methods are used to detect anomalies and predict behaviors. Our system is tested using image sequences acquired, respectively, from a crowded real traffic scene and a model traffic scene.

These attacks can easily be accomplished by an adversary by either bypassing MAC-layer protocols or emitting a radio signal targeted at jamming a particular channel. In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2006.1637931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1637931","","Jamming;Media Access Protocol;Wireless communication;Switches;Wireless sensor networks;Signal generators;Packet switching;Resumes;Energy conservation;Power supplies","","394","3","11","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is shown that the addressed stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with mixed delays are globally asymptotically stable in the mean square if two LMIs are feasible, where the feasibility of LMIs can be readily checked by the Matlab LMI toolbox. It is also pointed out that the main results comprise some existing results as special cases. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed global stability criteria.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2006.872355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629105","Cohen–Grossberg neural networks;discrete delays;distributed delays;global asymptotic stability;linear matrix inequality (LMI);Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional;stochastic systems","Stability analysis;Stochastic processes;Neural networks;Delay effects;Asymptotic stability;Cellular neural networks;Linear matrix inequalities;Hopfield neural networks;Sufficient conditions;Convergence","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Stochastic Processes;Systems Theory;Time Factors","394","1","26","IEEE","8 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, our interests are on a recent breed of hybrid evolutionary algorithms typically known as adaptive memetic algorithms (MAs). One unique feature of adaptive MAs is the choice of local search methods or memes and recent studies have shown that this choice significantly affects the performances of problem searches. In this paper, we present a classification of memes adaptation in adaptive MAs on the basis of the mechanism used and the level of historical knowledge on the memes employed. Then the asymptotic convergence properties of the adaptive MAs considered are analyzed according to the classification. Subsequently, empirical studies on representatives of adaptive MAs for different type-level meme adaptations using continuous benchmark problems indicate that global-level adaptive MAs exhibit better search performances. Finally we conclude with some promising research directions in the area.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.856143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580625","Adaptation;evolutionary algorithm;memetic algorithm;optimization","Evolutionary computation;Algorithm design and analysis;Search methods;Convergence;Stochastic processes;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Information technology;Australia;Large-scale systems","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Feedback;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Theoretical;Systems Theory","393","","43","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It linearly constrains a desired target signature while minimizing interfering effects caused by other unknown signatures. This paper explores this idea for band selection and develops a new approach to band selection, referred to as constrained band selection (CBS) for hyperspectral imagery. It interprets a band image as a desired target signature vector while considering other band images as unknown signature vectors. As a result, the proposed CBS using the concept of the CEM to linearly constrain a band image, while also minimizing band correlation or dependence provided by other band images, is referred to as CEM-CBS. Four different criteria referred to as Band Correlation Minimization (BCM), Band Correlation Constraint (BCC), Band Dependence Constraint (BDC), and Band Dependence Minimization (BDM) are derived for CEM-CBS.. Since dimensionality resulting from conversion of a band image to a vector may be huge, the CEM-CBS is further reinterpreted as linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV)-based CBS by constraining a band image as a matrix where the same four criteria, BCM, BCC, BDC, and BDM, can be also used for LCMV-CBS. In order to determine the number of bands required to select p, a recently developed concept, called virtual dimensionality, is used to estimate the p. Once the p is determined, a set of p desired bands can be selected by the CEM/LCMV-CBS. Finally, experiments are conducted to substantiate the proposed CEM/LCMV-CBS four criteria, BCM, BCC, BDC, and BDM, in comparison with variance-based band selection, information divergence-based band selection, and uniform band selection.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.864389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634721","Band correlation constraint (BCC);band correlation minimization (BCM);band dependence constraint (BDC);band dependence minimization (BDM);constrained band selection (CBS);constrained energy minimization (CEM);linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV);virtual dimensionality (VD)","Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Remote sensing;Signal processing;Image processing;Laboratories;Computer science;Principal component analysis;Object detection;Image converters","","393","","15","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Flyback-Type Single-Phase Utility Interactive Inverter With Power Pulsation Decoupling on the DC Input for an AC Photovoltaic Module System","T. Shimizu; K. Wada; N.

Many kinds of inverter circuits and their control schemes for photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems have been studied. A conventional system employs a PV array in which many PV modules are connected in series to obtain sufficient dc input voltage for generating ac utility line voltage from an inverter circuit. However, the total power generated from the PV array is sometimes decreased remarkably when only a few modules are partially covered by shadows, thereby decreasing inherent current generation, and preventing the generation current from attaining its maximum value on the array. To overcome this drawback, an ac module strategy has been proposed. In this system, a low-power dc-ac utility interactive inverter is individually mounted on each PV module and operates so as to generate the maximum power from its corresponding PV module. Especially in the case of a single-phase utility interactive inverter, an electrolytic capacitor of large capacitance has been connected on the dc input bus in order to decouple the power pulsation caused by single-phase power generation to the utility line. However, especially during the summer season, the ac module inverters have to operate under a very high atmospheric temperature, and hence the lifetime of the inverter is shortened, because the electrolytic capacitor has a drastically shortened life when used in a high-temperature environment. Of course, we may be able to use film capacitors instead of the electrolytic capacitors if we can pay for the extreme large volume of the inverter. However, this is not a realistic solution for ac module systems. This paper proposes a novel flyback-type utility interactive inverter circuit topology suitable for ac module systems when its lifetime under high atmospheric temperature is taken into account. A most distinctive feature of the proposed system is that the decoupling of power pulsation is executed by an additional circuit that enables employment of film capacitors with small capacitance not only for the dc input line but also for the decoupling circuit, and hence the additional circuit is expected to extend the lifetime of the inverter. The proposed inverter circuit also enables realization of small volume, lightweight, and stable ac current injection into the utility line. A control method suitable for the proposed inverter is also proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed inverter is verified thorough P-SIM simulation and experiments on a 100-W prototype","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2006.880247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1687975","AC module;flyback inverter;photovoltaic (PV) power generation;utility interactive inverter","Inverters;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Circuits;Capacitors;Power generation;Voltage;Capacitance;Temperature;Control systems","","390","37","17","IEEE","6 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A computationally simple, yet effective, approach of colorization is presented in this paper. The method is fast and it can be conveniently used ""on the fly,"" permitting the user to interactively get the desired results promptly after providing a reduced set of chrominance scribbles.

In this paper, first, a deterministic learning mechanism is presented, by which an appropriately designed adaptive neural controller is capable of learning closed-loop system dynamics during tracking control to a periodic reference orbit. Among various neural network (NN) architectures, the localized radial basis function (RBF) network is employed. A property of persistence of excitation (PE) for RBF networks is established, and a partial PE condition of closed-loop signals, i.e., the PE condition of a regression subvector constructed out of the RBFs along a periodic state trajectory, is proven to be satisfied. Accurate NN approximation for closed-loop system dynamics is achieved in a local region along the periodic state trajectory, and a learning ability is implemented during a closed-loop feedback control process. Second, based on the deterministic learning mechanism, a neural learning control scheme is proposed which can effectively recall and reuse the learned knowledge to achieve closed-loop stability and improved control performance. The significance of this paper is that the presented deterministic learning mechanism and the neural learning control scheme provide elementary components toward the development of a biologically-plausible learning and control methodology.

Furthermore, the existing tools do not detect copy-paste related bugs. In this paper, we propose a tool, CP-Miner, that uses data mining techniques to efficiently identify copy-pasted code in large software suites and detects copy-paste bugs.

Moreover, CP-Miner has detected many new bugs in popular operating systems, 49 in Linux and 31 in FreeBSD, most of which have since been confirmed by the corresponding developers and have been rectified in the following releases. In addition, we have found some interesting characteristics of copy-paste in operating system code.

The center pixel will then be considered as ""uncorrupted,"" provided that it belongs to the ""uncorrupted"" pixel group, or ""corrupted."" For that, two boundaries that discriminate these three groups require to be accurately determined for yielding a very high noise detection accuracy-in our case, achieving zero miss-detection rate while maintaining a fairly low false-alarm rate, even up to 70% noise corruption. Four noise models are considered for performance evaluation. Extensive simulation results conducted on both monochrome and color images under a wide range (from 10% to 90%) of noise corruption clearly show that our proposed switching median filter substantially outperforms all existing median-based filters, in terms of suppressing impulse noise while preserving image details, and yet, the proposed BDND is algorithmically simple, suitable for real-time implementation and application.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.871129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632204","Image denoising;impulse noise detection;nonlinear filter;switching median filter","Nonlinear filters;Degradation;Noise reduction;Colored noise;Image quality;Noise robustness;Samarium;Information filtering;Information filters;Pixel","Algorithms;Artifacts;Discriminant Analysis;Filtration;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","381","1","18","IEEE","15 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have developed a manufacturing process that guarantees unaffected electrical behavior of the individual materials when composed to an antenna. Thus, the conductive textiles possess a sheet resistance of less than 1Omega/squarein order to keep losses at a minimum. The process also satisfies our requirements in terms of accuracy meeting the Bluetooth specifications.

However, the fractional-slot configuration presents a high content of MMF harmonics that may cause an unbalanced saturation and thus an unbearable torque ripple. A method to design fractional-slot machines is illustrated in this paper, including double-layer and single-layer windings.

As a powerful mathematical tool for analyzing singularities and edges, the wavelet transform is employed to detect and estimate the local spectral irregular structure, which carries important information on the frequency locations and power spectral densities of the subbands. Along this line, a couple of wideband spectrum sensing techniques are developed based on the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus and the multi-scale wavelet products.

Model predictive control, also known as receding horizon control, is a general control scheme specifically designed to deal with such constrained dynamical systems, with the potential ability to react efficiently to a wide range of situations. Apart from the question of computation time which needs to be taken care of carefully (these schemes can be highly computation intensive), the initial question of which optimal control problems should be considered to be solved online in order to lead to the desired walking movements is still unanswered. A key idea for answering to this problem can be found in the ZMP preview control scheme. After presenting here this scheme with a point of view slightly different from the original one, we focus on the problem of compensating strong perturbations of the dynamics of the robot and propose a new linear model predictive control scheme which is an improvement of the original ZMP preview control scheme.","2164-0580","1-4244-0199-2","10.1109/ICHR.2006.321375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4115592","","Trajectory;Predictive models;Predictive control;Legged locomotion;Humanoid robots;Motion control;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Optimal control;Force control;Control systems","","365","","16","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These networks have no fixed infrastructure and instead rely on the vehicles themselves to provide network functionality. However, due to mobility constraints, driver behavior, and high mobility, VANETs exhibit characteristics that are dramatically different from many generic MANETs. This article provides a comprehensive study of challenges in these networks, which we concentrate on the problems and proposed solutions. Then we outline current state of the research and future perspectives.

Civilian applications include monitoring forest fires, oil fields, and pipelines and tracking wildlife. Applications to homeland security include border patrol and monitoring the perimeter of nuclear power plants. Military applications are numerous. The current approach to these applications is to use a single manned vehicle for surveillance. However, manned vehicles are typically large and expensive. In addition, hazardous environments and operator fatigue can potentially threaten the life of the pilot. Therefore, there is a critical need for automating aerial surveillance using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This paper gives an overview of a cooperative control strategy for aerial surveillance that has been successfully flight tested on small (48-in wingspan) UAVs. Our approach to cooperative control problems can be summarized in four steps: 1) the definition of a cooperation constraint and cooperation objective; 2) the definition of a coordination variable as the minimal amount of information needed to effect cooperation; 3) the design of a centralized cooperation strategy; and 4) the use of consensus schemes to transform the centralized strategy into a decentralized algorithm.

This change will require new access networks that support high-speed (> 100 Mb/s), symmetric, and guaranteed bandwidths for future video services with high-definition TV quality. To satisfy the required bandwidth over a 20-km transmission distance, single-mode optical fiber is currently the only practical choice. To minimize the cost of implementing an FTTP solution, a passive optical network (PON) that uses a point-to-multipoint architecture is generally considered to be the best approach. There are several multiple-access techniques to share a single PON architecture, and the authors addressed several of these approaches such as time-division multiple access, wavelength-division multiple access, subcarrier multiple access, and code-division multiple access. Among these multiple techniques, they focus on time-division multiplexing (TDM)-PON and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)-PON, which will be the most promising candidates for practical future systems. A TDM-PON shares a single-transmission channel with multiple subscribers in time domain. Then, there exists tight coupling between subscribers. A WDM-PON provides point-to-point optical connectivity using a dedicated pair of wavelengths per user. While a TDM-PON appears to be a satisfactory solution for current bandwidth demands, the combination of future data-rate projections and traffic patterns coupled with recent advances in WDM technology may result in WDM-PON becoming the preferred solution for a future proof fiber-based access network","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2006.885779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4063414","Fiber to the home (FTTH);fiber to the premise (FTTP);optical access network;passive optical network (PON)","Passive optical networks;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Wavelength division multiplexing;High definition video;HDTV;Optical fibers;Costs;Multiaccess communication;WDM networks","","361","3","44","IEEE","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To enhance security in ad hoc networks, it is important to evaluate trustworthiness of other nodes without centralized authorities. In this paper, we present an information theoretic framework to quantitatively measure trust and model trust propagation in ad hoc networks. In the proposed framework, trust is a measure of uncertainty with its value represented by entropy. We develop four Axioms that address the basic understanding of trust and the rules for trust propagation. Based on these axioms, we present two trust models: entropy-based model and probability-based model, which satisfy all the axioms. Techniques of trust establishment and trust update are presented to obtain trust values from observation. The proposed trust evaluation method and trust models are employed in ad hoc networks for secure ad hoc routing and malicious node detection. A distributed scheme is designed to acquire, maintain, and update trust records associated with the behaviors of nodes' forwarding packets and the behaviors of making recommendations about other nodes. Simulations show that the proposed trust evaluation system can significantly improve the network throughput as well as effectively detect malicious behaviors in ad hoc networks.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.861389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589110","Ad hoc networks;security;trust modeling and evaluation","Ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Public key;Student members;Information security;Measurement uncertainty;Entropy;Throughput","","358","5","39","IEEE","6 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trust relations are based on evidence created by the previous interactions of entities within a protocol. In this work, we are focusing on the evaluation of trust evidence in ad hoc networks. Because of the dynamic nature of ad hoc networks, trust evidence may be uncertain and incomplete. Also, no preestablished infrastructure can be assumed. The evaluation process is modeled as a path problem on a directed graph, where nodes represent entities, and edges represent trust relations. We give intuitive requirements and discuss design issues for any trust evaluation algorithm. Using the theory of semirings, we show how two nodes can establish an indirect trust relation without previous direct interaction. We show that our semiring framework is flexible enough to express other trust models, most notably PGP's Web of Trust.

Some new properties are proved too, e.g., relations to the statistical sufficiency and deficiency. The generalized Taylor expansion also shows very easily that all$f$-divergences are average statistical informations (differences between prior and posterior Bayes errors) mutually differing only in the weights imposed on various prior distributions. The statistical information introduced by De Groot and the classical information of Shannon are shown to be extremal cases corresponding to$alpha =0$and$alpha =1$in the class of the so-called Arimoto$alpha $-informations introduced in this paper for$0≪ alpha ≪ 1$by means of the Arimoto$alpha $-entropies.

We assume time-division duplex (TDD) operation, so the base station derives its channel estimate from taurp pilot symbols which the terminals transmit on the reverse link. A coherence interval of T symbols is expended as follows: taurp reverse pilot symbols, one symbol for computations, and (T-l-taurp) forward QAM symbols for each terminal For a given coherence interval, number of base station antennas, and forward- and reverse-SINR's we determine the optimum number of terminals to serve simultaneously and the optimum number of reverse pilot symbols to employ by choosing these parameters to maximize a lower bound on the net sum-throughput. The lower bound rigorously accounts for channel estimation error, and is valid for all SINR's. Surprisingly it is always advantageous to increase the number of base station antennas, even when the reverse SINR is low and the channel estimate poor: greater numbers of antennas enable us to climb out of the noise and to serve more terminals. Even within short coherence intervals (T= 10 symbols) and with low SINR's (-10.0 dB reverse, 0.0 dB forward) given large numbers of base station antennas (M ges 16 ) it is both feasible and advantageous to learn the channel and to serve a multiplicity of terminals simultaneously as well.","1058-6393","1-4244-0784-2","10.1109/ACSSC.2006.354768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4176578","","MIMO;Base stations;Broadcasting;Signal to noise ratio;Linear antenna arrays;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Receiving antennas;Throughput;Downlink;Channel estimation","","352","10","8","IEEE","7 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Genetics;Kernel;Minimization methods","","352","1","48","IEEE","30 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The performance of these models was compared in terms of their accuracy, generalization ability, and noise tolerance limits. The results showed that MLPs and SVM were both able to determine the presence of devices based on their harmonic signatures with high accuracy.

The sources of estimation error in the SDP formulation are identified. The SDP solution usually has a rank higher than the underlying physical space which, when projected onto the lower dimensional space, generally results in high estimation error. We describe two improvements to ameliorate such a difficulty. First, we propose a regularization term in the objective function that can help to reduce the rank of the SDP solution. Second, we use the points estimated from the SDP solution as the initial iterate for a gradient-descent method to further refine the estimated points. A lower bound obtained from the optimal SDP objective value can be used to check the solution quality. Experimental results are presented to validate our methods and show that they outperform existing SDP methods. Note to Practitioners—Wireless sensor networks consist of a large number of inexpensive wireless sensors deployed in a geographical area with the ability to communicate with their neighbors within a limited radio range. Wireless sensor networks are finding increasing applicability to a range of monitoring applications in civil and military scenarios, such as biodiversity and geographical monitoring, smart homes, industrial control, surveillance, and traffic monitoring. It is often very useful in the applications of sensor networks to know the locations of the sensors. Global positioning systems suffer from many drawbacks in this scenario, such as high cost, line-of-sight issues, etc. Therefore, there is a need to develop robust and efficient algorithms that can estimate or “localize” sensor positions in a network by using only the mutual distance measures (received signal strength, time of arrival) that the wireless sensors receive from their neighbors. This paper describes an algorithm that solves the sensor network localization problem using advanced optimization techniques. We also study the effect of using very noisy measurements and propose robust methods to deal with high noise. Finally, simulation results for the algorithms are presented to demonstrate their performance in terms of computational effort and accuracy.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2006.877401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1707954","Dimensionality reduction;graph realization;position estimation;semidefinite programming","Distance measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Biosensors;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Estimation error;Biodiversity;Smart homes;Industrial control","","344","4","35","IEEE","9 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, new write-ability metrics derived from the same N-curve are introduced and compared with the traditional write-trip point definition. Analytical models of all these metrics are developed. It is demonstrated that the new metrics provide additional information in terms of current, which allows designing a more robust and stable cell. By taking into account this current information, Vdd scaling is no longer a limiting factor for the read stability of the cell. Finally, these metrics are used to investigate the impact of the intra-die variability on the stability of the cell by using a statistically-aware circuit optimization approach and the results are compared with the worst-case or corner-based design","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2006.883344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717680","Intra-die;N-curve;read stability and write-ability of the SRAM cell;statistically-aware design optimization","Stability analysis;Random access memory;Circuit stability;CMOS technology;Analytical models;Design optimization;Voltage;Robustness;Circuit optimization;System-on-a-chip","","343","7","24","IEEE","30 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such implementations necessitate large-scale capture and storage of biometric data, which raises serious issues in terms of data privacy and (if such data is compromised) identity theft. These problems stem from the essential permanence of biometric data, which (unlike secret passwords or physical tokens) cannot be refreshed or reissued if compromised. Our previously presented biometric-hash framework prescribes the integration of external (password or token-derived) randomness with user-specific biometrics, resulting in bitstring outputs with security characteristics (i.e., noninvertibility) comparable to cryptographic ciphers or hashes. The resultant BioHashes are hence cancellable, i.e., straightforwardly revoked and reissued (via refreshed password or reissued token) if compromised.

One common practice is to seed faults in subject software, either manually or by using a program that generates all possible mutants based on a set of mutation operators. The latter allows the systematic, repeatable seeding of large numbers of faults, thus facilitating the statistical analysis of fault detection effectiveness of test suites; however, we do not know whether empirical results obtained this way lead to valid, representative conclusions. Focusing on four common control and data flow criteria (block, decision, C-use, and P-use), this paper investigates this important issue based on a middle size industrial program with a comprehensive pool of test cases and known faults. Based on the data available thus far, the results are very consistent across the investigated criteria as they show that the use of mutation operators is yielding trustworthy results: generated mutants can be used to predict the detection effectiveness of real faults. Applying such a mutation analysis, we then investigate the relative cost and effectiveness of the above-mentioned criteria by revisiting fundamental questions regarding the relationships between fault detection, test suite size, and control/data flow coverage. Although such questions have been partially investigated in previous studies, we can use a large number of mutants, which helps decrease the impact of random variation in our analysis and allows us to use a different analysis approach. Our results are then; compared with published studies, plausible reasons for the differences are provided, and the research leads us to suggest a way to tune the mutation analysis process to possible differences in fault detection probabilities in a specific environment","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2006.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1703390","Testing and debugging;testing strategies;test coverage of code;experimental design.","Genetic mutations;Fault detection;Software testing;Size control;Failure analysis;Statistical analysis;System testing;Industrial control;Costs;Debugging","","340","1","33","IEEE","18 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a closer look reveals that early signs of scaling limits were seen in high-performance devices in recent technology nodes. To obtain the projected performance gain of 30% per generation, device designers have been forced to relax the device subthreshold leakage continuously from one to several nA/µm for the 250-nm node to hundreds of nA/µm for the 65-nm node. Consequently, passive power density is now a significant portion of the power budget of a high-speed microprocessor. In this paper we discuss device and material options to improve device performance when conventional scaling is power-constrained. These options can be separated into three categories: improved short-channel behavior, improved current drive, and improved switching behavior. In the first category fall advanced dielectrics and multi-gate devices. The second category comprises mobility-enhancing measures through stress and substrate material alternatives. The third category focuses mainly on scaling of SOI body thickness to reduce capacitance. We do not provide details of the fabrication of these different device options or the manufacturing challenges that must be met. Rather, we discuss the fundamental scaling issues related to the various device options.

General expressions are derived that show that the method is universal with respect to the component filters, i.e., in steady-state, it performs at least as well as the best component filter. Furthermore, when the correlation between the a priori errors of the components is low enough, their combination is able to outperform both of them.

However, energy consumption continues to remain a barrier challenge in many sensor network applications that require long lifetimes. Battery-operated sensor nodes have limited energy storage capability due to small form-factors, or operate in environments that rule out frequent energy replenishment, resulting in a mismatch between the available energy budget for system operation and the required energy budget to obtain desired lifetimes. This article surveys several techniques that show promise in addressing and alleviating this energy consumption challenge. In addition to describing recent advances in energy-aware platforms for information processing and communication protocols for sensor collaboration, the article also looks at emerging, hitherto largely unexplored techniques, such as the use of environmental energy harvesting and the optimization of the energy consumed during sensing.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2006.1632657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632657","","Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;Sensor systems;Energy consumption;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Surveillance;Middleware;Energy efficiency;Access protocols;Object detection","","339","4","19","IEEE","15 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Despite various optimizations of flooding, many routing messages are propagated unnecessarily. We propose a gossiping-based approach, where each node forwards a message with some probability, to reduce the overhead of the routing protocols. Gossiping exhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions, the gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node gets the message; in the remaining executions, a substantial fraction of the nodes gets the message. The fraction of executions in which most nodes get the message depends on the gossiping probability and the topology of the network. In the networks we have considered, using gossiping probability between 0.6 and 0.8 suffices to ensure that almost every node gets the message in almost every execution. For large networks, this simple gossiping protocol uses up to 35% fewer messages than flooding, with improved performance. Gossiping can also be combined with various optimizations of flooding to yield further benefits. Simulations show that adding gossiping to AODV results in significant performance improvement, even in networks as small as 150 nodes. Our results suggest that the improvement should be even more significant in larger networks","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2006.876186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642729","Ad hoc networks;gossiping;percolation theory;phase transition;routing","Routing protocols;Floods;Ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Computer science;Global Positioning System;Network topology;Spread spectrum communication;Power supplies;Wireless sensor networks","","338","27","30","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we address the problem of vulnerable Web applications by means of static source code analysis. More precisely, we use flow-sensitive, interprocedural and context-sensitive dataflow analysis to discover vulnerable points in a program. In addition, alias and literal analysis are employed to improve the correctness and precision of the results.

Due to the increasing power capability of the available generation systems, a three-level three-phase neutral-point-clamped voltage-source inverter is selected as the heart of the interfacing system. A multivariable control law is used for the regulator because of the intrinsic multivariable structure of the system. A current source (playing the role of a generic renewable energy source) is connected to the grid using a three-level inverter in order to verify the good performance of the proposed approach. Large- and small-signal d-q state-space averaged models of the system are obtained and used to calculate the multivariable controller based on the linear quadratic regulator technique. This controller simultaneously regulates the dc-link voltage (to operate at the maximum power point of the renewable energy source), the mains power factor (the power is delivered to the grid at unity power factor), and the dc-link neutral-point voltage balance. With the model and regulator presented, a specific switching strategy to control the dc-link neutral-point voltage is not required. The proposed controller can be used for any application, since its nature makes possible the control of any system variable. The good performance of the presented interfacing solution in both steady-state and transient operation is verified through simulation and experimentation using a 1-kW neutral-point-clamped voltage-source-inverter prototype, where a PC-embedded digital signal processor board is used for the controller implementation","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.882021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705641","Distributed power generation;grid interface;multilevel conversion;multivariable control;photovoltaic power system;three-level inverter;wind power system","Renewable energy resources;Inverters;Control systems;Regulators;Voltage control;Power system modeling;Reactive power;Power generation;Heart;Steady-state","","337","3","29","IEEE","2 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work focuses on the recognition of activities that are characterized by a hand motion and an accompanying sound. Suitable activities can be found in assembly and maintenance work. Here, we provide an initial exploration into the problem domain of continuous activity recognition using on-body sensing. We use a mock ""wood workshop” assembly task to ground our investigation. We describe a method for the continuous recognition of activities (sawing, hammering, filing, drilling, grinding, sanding, opening a drawer, tightening a vise, and turning a screwdriver) using microphones and three-axis accelerometers mounted at two positions on the user's arms. Potentially ""interesting” activities are segmented from continuous streams of data using an analysis of the sound intensity detected at the two different locations. Activity classification is then performed on these detected segments using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on the sound channel and hidden Markov models (HMMs) on the acceleration data. Four different methods at classifier fusion are compared for improving these classifications. Using user-dependent training, we obtain continuous average recall and precision rates (for positive activities) of 78 percent and 74 percent, respectively. Using user-independent training (leave-one-out across five users), we obtain recall rates of 66 percent and precision rates of 63 percent.

A major problem is spatially-varying reduction of contrast by stray radiance (airlight), which is scattered by the haze particles towards the camera. Recent computer vision methods have shown that images can be compensated for haze, and even yield a depth map of the scene. A key step in such a scene recovery is subtraction of the airlight. In particular, this can be achieved by analyzing polarization-filtered images. However, the recovery requires parameters of the airlight. These parameters were estimated in past studies by measuring pixels in sky areas. This paper derives an approach for blindly recovering the parameter needed for separating the airlight from the measurements, thus recovering contrast, with neither user interaction nor existence of the sky in the frame. This eases the interaction and conditions needed for image dehazing, which also requires compensation for attenuation. The approach has proved successful in experiments, some of which are shown here.","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640996","","Independent component analysis;Layout;Image analysis;Particle scattering;Computer vision;Polarization;Parameter estimation;Light scattering;Degradation;Reflection","","333","5","35","IEEE","9 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There has been increasing interest in the development of computational models inspired by several immunological principles. In particular, some are building models mimicking the mechanisms in the biological immune system (BIS) to better understand its natural processes and simulate its dynamical behavior in the presence of antigens/pathogens. Most of the AIS models, however, emphasize designing artifacts - computational algorithms, techniques using simplified models of various immunological processes and functionalities. Like other biologically-inspired techniques, such as artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, and cellular automata, AISs also try to extract ideas from the BIS in order to develop computational tools for solving science and engineering problems.

As a consequence, many of the network protocols designed for radio channels are either not applicable, or have extremely low efficiency over underwater acoustic channels. These facts necessitate a dedicated design of protocols for an underwater acoustic network. A medium access control (MAC) protocol suitable for an underwater acoustic network is proposed and analyzed. The protocol is based on a channel access discipline called floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA) which combines both carrier sensing (CS) and a dialogue between the source and receiver prior to data transmission. During the initial dialogue, control packets are exchanged between the source node and the intended destination node to avoid multiple transmissions at the same time. Special attention is paid to the networks that are not fully connected, in which nodes can be hidden from each other. The new protocol uses time slotting and is thus called slotted FAMA. Time slotting eliminates the need for excessively long control packets, thus providing savings in energy. Protocol performance in throughput and delay is assessed through simulation of a mobile ad hoc underwater network, showing the existence of optimal power level to be used for a given user density.","","978-1-4244-0137-6","10.1109/OCEANSAP.2006.4393832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4393832","","Media Access Protocol;Underwater acoustics;Access protocols;Multiaccess communication;Propagation delay;Educational institutions;Packet radio networks;Bit rate;Data communication;Throughput","","332","4","8","IEEE","4 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main requirements for trackers are high accuracy and little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a ""video see through"" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. In this paper, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634325","Augmented reality;virtual visual servoing;robust estimators;real-time;model-based tracking;model-free tracking.","Augmented reality;Visual servoing;Robustness;Layout;Delay;Costs;Real time systems;Machine vision;Cameras;Robust control","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Systems;Feedback;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","332","14","55","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effects of noise, bandwidth, stationary echoes, kernel size, downsampling, interpolation, and quadrature demodulation on the accuracy of the time delay estimates are measured in terms of bias and jitter. Particular attention is given to the accuracy and resolution of the displacement measurements and to the computational efficiency of the algorithms. In most cases, Loupas' two-dimensional (2-D) autocorrelator performs as well as the gold standard, normalized cross correlation. However, Loupas' algorithm's calculation time is significantly faster, and it is particularly suited to operate on the signal data format most commonly used in ultrasound scanners.

Coded cooperation is a mechanism where cooperation is combined with-and operates through-channel coding, as opposed to the repetition-based methods. This work develops expressions for outage probability of coded cooperation. In this work, each node acts as both a data source as well as a relay, i.e., only active (transmitting) nodes are available to assist other nodes, and each node operates under overall (source + relay) power and bandwidth constraints. Outage expressions confirm that full diversity is achieved by coded cooperation. This shows that despite superficial similarities, coded cooperation is distinct from decode-and-forward, which has been shown to have diversity one. The outage probability expressions developed in this work characterize coded performance at various rates. Furthermore, outage probabilities yield bounds that are arguably more insightful than the bit-error rate (BER) results previously available for coded cooperation. Numerical comparisons shed light on the relative merits of coded cooperation and various repetition-based methods, under various inter-user and uplink channel conditions.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.862084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580784","Channel coding;coded cooperation;diversity;outage probability;space–time coding;transmit diversity;user cooperation;wireless communications","Relays;Decoding;Mobile communication;Bandwidth;Bit error rate;Diversity methods;Multiaccess communication;Switches;Wireless communication;Transmitters","","328","4","26","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is helpful in music understanding, music retrieval, and some other music-related applications. In this paper, a hierarchical framework is presented to automate the task of mood detection from acoustic music data, by following some music psychological theories in western cultures. The hierarchical framework has the advantage of emphasizing the most suitable features in different detection tasks. Three feature sets, including intensity, timbre, and rhythm are extracted to represent the characteristics of a music clip. The intensity feature set is represented by the energy in each subband, the timbre feature set is composed of the spectral shape features and spectral contrast features, and the rhythm feature set indicates three aspects that are closely related with an individual's mood response, including rhythm strength, rhythm regularity, and tempo. Furthermore, since mood is usually changeable in an entire piece of classical music, the approach to mood detection is extended to mood tracking for a music piece, by dividing the music into several independent segments, each of which contains a homogeneous emotional expression. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the proposed algorithms produce satisfactory results. On our testing database composed of 800 representative music clips, the average accuracy of mood detection achieves up to 86.3%. We can also on average recall 84.1% of the mood boundaries from nine testing music pieces.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TSA.2005.860344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561259","Affective computing;hierarchical framework;mood detection;mood tracking;music emotion;music information retrieval;music mood","Mood;Multiple signal classification;Rhythm;Acoustic signal detection;Timbre;Testing;Music information retrieval;Psychology;Computer vision;Data mining","","327","12","44","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from traditional methods that can classify vehicles to only cars and noncars, the proposed method has a good ability to categorize vehicles into more specific classes by introducing a new ""linearity"" feature in vehicle representation. In addition, the proposed system can well tackle the problem of vehicle occlusions caused by shadows, which often lead to the failure of further vehicle counting and classification. This problem is solved by a novel line-based shadow algorithm that uses a set of lines to eliminate all unwanted shadows. The used lines are devised from the information of lane-dividing lines. Therefore, an automatic scheme to detect lane-dividing lines is also proposed. The found lane-dividing lines can also provide important information for feature normalization, which can make the vehicle size more invariant, and thus much enhance the accuracy of vehicle classification. Once all features are extracted, an optimal classifier is then designed to robustly categorize vehicles into different classes. When recognizing a vehicle, the designed classifier can collect different evidences from its trajectories and the database to make an optimal decision for vehicle classification. Since more evidences are used, more robustness of classification can be achieved. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more robust, accurate, and powerful than other traditional methods, which utilize only the vehicle size and a single frame for vehicle classification.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2006.874722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1637673","Linearity feature;occlusions;shadow elimination;traffic surveillance;vehicle classification","Surveillance;Vehicles;Robustness;Parameter estimation;Video sequences;Cameras;Linearity;Feature extraction;Data mining;Spatial databases","","326","7","30","IEEE","30 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper examines the Bunch clustering system which, unlike other software clustering tools, uses search techniques to perform clustering. Bunch produces a subsystem decomposition by partitioning a graph of the entities (e.g., classes) and relations (e.g., function calls) in the source code. Bunch uses a fitness function to evaluate the quality of graph partitions and uses search algorithms to find a satisfactory solution. This paper presents a case study to demonstrate how Bunch can be used to create views of the structure of significant software systems.

Among various modulation techniques for a multilevel inverter, the space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) is widely used. However, the implementation of the SVPWM for a multilevel inverter is complicated. The complexity is due to the difficulty in determining the location of the reference vector, the calculation of on-times, and the determination and selection of switching states. This paper proposes a general SVPWM algorithm for multilevel inverters based on standard two-level SVPWM. Since the proposed multilevel SVPWM method uses two-level modulation to calculate the on-times, the computation of on-times for an n-level inverter becomes easier. The proposed method uses a simple mapping to achieve the SVPWM for a multilevel inverter.

The effectiveness of passive islanding detection methods (IDMs) is usually demonstrated by means of nondetection zones (NDZs) represented in a power mismatch space (/spl Delta/P versus /spl Delta/Q). Active frequency drifting IDMs have been shown to provide improved performance but their theoretical NDZ cannot be described in the /spl Delta/P versus /spl Delta/Q space for a general RLC load. This paper shows that a load parameter space based on the values of the quality factor and resonant frequency of the local load (Q/sub f/ versus f/sub 0/) can be used in these cases. It employs a single curve to represent the NDZ of frequency drifting IDMs for any RLC loads. Equations that represent NDZs of three common active IDMs in the Q/sub f/ versus f/sub 0/ load parameter space are derived and it is shown that the slip mode frequency shift and the Sandia frequency shift IDMs can be designed to guarantee islanding detection for equivalent RLC loads with a quality factor smaller than a design value.

Time-lapse microscopy imaging serves as an important method to measure the cycle progression of individual cells in a large population. Since manual analysis is unreasonably time consuming for the large volumes of time-lapse image data, automated image analysis is proposed. Existing approaches dealing with time-lapse image data are rather limited and often give inaccurate analysis results, especially in segmenting and tracking individual cells in a cell population. In this paper, we present a new approach to segment and track cell nuclei in time-lapse fluorescence image sequence. First, we propose a novel marker-controlled watershed based on mathematical morphology, which can effectively segment clustered cells with less oversegmentation. To further segment undersegmented cells or to merge oversegmented cells, context information among neighboring frames is employed, which is proved to be an effective strategy. Then, we design a tracking method based on modified mean shift algorithm, in which several kernels with adaptive scale, shape, and direction are designed. Finally, we combine mean-shift and Kalman filter to achieve a more robust cell nuclei tracking method than existing ones. Experimental results show that our method can obtain 98.8% segmentation accuracy, 97.4% cell division tracking accuracy, and 97.6% cell tracking accuracy.

Due to the spatial correlation between sensor nodes subject to observed events, it may not be necessary for every sensor node to transmit its data. This paper shows how the spatial correlation can be exploited on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort which exploits spatial correlation in WSN on the MAC layer. A theoretical framework is developed for transmission regulation of sensor nodes under a distortion constraint. It is shown that a sensor node can act as a representative node for several other sensor nodes observing the correlated data. Based on the theoretical framework, a distributed, spatial Correlation-based Collaborative Medium Access Control (CC-MAC) protocol is then designed which has two components: Event MAC (E-MAC) and Network MAC (N-MAC). E-MAC filters out the correlation in sensor records while N-MAC prioritizes the transmission of route-thru packets. Simulation results show that CC-MAC achieves high performance in terms energy, packet drop rate, and latency.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2006.872544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1621110","CC-MAC;energy efficiency;medium access control;spatial correlation;wireless sensor networks","Collaboration;Media Access Protocol;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Access protocols;Intelligent sensors;Access control;Constraint theory;Filters","","320","","22","IEEE","18 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the necessity to capture, record, process, and display an enormous amount of optical data for producing high-quality 3-D images, the developed 3-D imaging techniques were forced to compromise their performances (e.g., gave up the continuous parallax, restricting to a fixed viewing point) or to use special devices and technology (such as coherent illuminations, special spectacles) which is inconvenient for most practical implementation. Today's rapid progress of digital capture and display technology opened the possibility to proceed toward noncompromising, easy-to-use 3-D imaging techniques. This technology progress prompted the revival of the integral imaging (II)technique based on a technique proposed almost one century ago. II is a type of multiview 3-D imaging system that uses an array of diffractive or refractive elements to capture the 3-D optical data. It has attracted great attention recently, since it produces autostereoscopic images without special illumination requirements. However, with a conventional II system it is not possible to produce 3-D images that have both high resolution, large depth-of-field, and large viewing angle. This paper provides an overview of the approaches and techniques developed during the last decade to overcome these limitations. By combining these techniques with upcoming technology it is to be expected that II-based 3-D imaging systems will reach practical applicability in various fields.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2006.870696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605205","Computer-generated integral imaging (CGII);computational integral imaging (CII);integral imaging (II);three-dimensional (3-D) imaging","Optical imaging;Optical refraction;Optical sensors;Lighting;High-resolution imaging;Optical arrays;Data visualization;Three dimensional displays;Optical devices;Optical recording","","319","7","84","IEEE","13 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, this method produces a set of basis and encoding vectors that are not only capable of representing the original data, but they also extract highly focalized patterns, which generally lend themselves to improved interpretability. The properties of this new method are illustrated with several data sets. Comparisons to previously published methods show that the new nsNMF method has some advantages in keeping faithfulness to the data in the achieving a high degree of sparseness for both the estimated basis and the encoding vectors and in better interpretability of the factors.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580485","Index Terms- nonnegative matrix factorization;constrained optimization;datamining;mining methods and algorithms;pattern analysis;feature extraction or construction;sparse;structured;and very large systems.","Encoding;Matrix decomposition;Sparse matrices;Vectors;Data mining;Feature extraction;Independent component analysis;Design optimization;Cost function;Constraint optimization","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Face;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sensitivity and Specificity;Software","319","1","37","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the presented solution involves two main steps: first of all, for each arc connecting neighboring pixels on the interferometric azimuth/range grid, the unwrapped phase gradients are estimated via the MCF technique applied in the temporal/perpendicular baseline plane. Following this step, these estimates are used as a starting point for the spatial-unwrapping operation implemented again via the MCF approach but carried out in the azimuth/range plane.

This method is general and can be applied under the assumption that there exists repetitive patterns in a local neighborhood of a point. By introducing spatial adaptivity, we extend the work earlier described by Buades et al. which can be considered as an extension of bilateral filtering to image patches.

A straightforward application of state estimation theory treats phasor measurements of currents and voltages as additional measurements to be appended to traditional measurements now being used in most energy management system (EMS) state estimators. The resulting state estimator is once again nonlinear and requires significant modifications to existing EMS software. This paper proposes an alternative approach, which leaves the traditional state estimation software in place, and discusses a novel method of incorporating the phasor measurements and the results of the traditional state estimator in a postprocessing linear estimator.

This generalization gives a lower bound on the fraction of output nodes of degree 2 of a Raptor code if the error probability of the belief-propagation decoder converges to zero. Using information-theoretic arguments, we will show that if a sequence of output degree distributions is to achieve the capacity of the underlying channel, then the fraction of nodes of degree 2 in these degree distributions has to converge to a certain quantity depending on the channel. For the class of erasure channels this quantity is independent of the erasure probability of the channel, but for many other classes of BIMSCs, this fraction depends on the particular channel chosen. This result has implications on the ""universality"" of Raptor codes for classes other than the class of erasure channels, in a sense that will be made more precise in the paper.

Because of measurement noise, the nonlinear localization equations become inconsistent; and the hyperbolae or circles no longer intersect at a single point. It is now necessary to find an emitter position estimate that minimizes its deviations from the true position. Methods that first linearize the equations and then perform gradient searches for the minimum suffer from initial condition sensitivity and convergence difficulty. Starting from the maximum likelihood (ML) function, this paper derives a closed-form approximate solution to the ML equations. When there are three sensors on a straight line, it also gives an exact ML estimate. Simulation experiments have demonstrated that these algorithms are near optimal, attaining the theoretical lower bound for different geometries, and are superior to two other closed form linear estimators.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2005.861162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1583909","Approximate maximum likelihood (AML);maximum likelihood (ML);mobile station;TDOA localization;TOA localization","Maximum likelihood estimation;Sea measurements;Nonlinear equations;Time difference of arrival;Transmitters;Position measurement;Time measurement;Noise measurement;Solid modeling;Geometry","","307","1","12","IEEE","30 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As data sets are constantly growing in size, this increasingly leads to I/O bottlenecks. When the rate at which data is produced exceeds the available I/O bandwidth, the simulation stalls and the CPUs are idle. Data compression can alleviate this problem by using some CPU cycles to reduce the amount of data needed to be transfered. Most compression schemes, however, are designed to operate offline and seek to maximize compression, not throughput. Furthermore, they often require quantizing floating-point values onto a uniform integer grid, which disqualifies their use in applications where exact values must be retained. We propose a simple scheme for lossless, online compression of floating-point data that transparently integrates into the I/O of many applications. A plug-in scheme for data-dependent prediction makes our scheme applicable to a wide variety of data used in visualization, such as unstructured meshes, point sets, images, and voxel grids. We achieve state-of-the-art compression rates and speeds, the latter in part due to an improved entropy coder. We demonstrate that this significantly accelerates I/O throughput in real simulation runs.

Using backstepping and Lyapunov synthesis, the stable tracking controller is first designed for the full-state feedback case. Subsequently, the output feedback problem is tackled by employing a high-gain observer to estimate the unmeasurable states required by the stable tracking controller. Under the proposed control, semiglobal uniform boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed for both full-state and output feedback cases.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2006.872507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1645126","Function approximation;fuzzy systems;marine vehicle control;neural networks;nonlinear systems;output feedback;tracking","Oceans;Sea surface;Output feedback;Trajectory;Uncertainty;Backstepping;Signal synthesis;State feedback;Observers;State estimation","","306","","20","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these algorithms typically suffer from large numbers of false alarms due to the assumptions that the local background is Gaussian and homogeneous. In practice, these assumptions are often violated, especially when the neighborhood of a pixel contains multiple types of terrain. To remove these assumptions, a novel anomaly detector that incorporates a nonparametric background model based on the SVDD is derived. Expanding on prior SVDD work, a geometric interpretation of the SVDD is used to propose a decision rule that utilizes a new test statistic and shares some of the properties of constant false-alarm rate detectors. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the authors report results that demonstrate the improved performance and reduction in the false-alarm rate when using the SVDD-based detector on wide-area airborne mine detection (WAAMD) and hyperspectral digital imagery collection experiment (HYDICE) imagery","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.873019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1661816","Hyperspectral;support vector data description;target detection","Hyperspectral imaging;Detectors;Hyperspectral sensors;Testing;Object detection;Image converters;Reflectivity;Layout;Shape;Kernel","","306","6","20","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the nature of the underlying graph algorithm, this approach has the ability to also recognize patterns that are modified from their standard representation. Moreover, the approach exploits the fact that patterns reside in one or more inheritance hierarchies, reducing the size of the graphs to which the algorithm is applied.

Prototype medical devices made from SMP loaded with nickel zinc ferrite ferromagnetic particles were actuated in air by applying an alternating magnetic field to induce heating. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was performed on both the particle-loaded and neat SMP materials to assess the impact of the ferrite particles on the mechanical properties of the samples. Calorimetry was used to quantify the rate of heat generation as a function of particle size and volumetric loading of ferrite particles in the SMP.

Dual-frequency operation is achieved by loading a slot antenna with two lumped variable capacitors (varactors) placed in proper locations along the slot. Loading the slot antenna with lumped capacitors shifts down the resonant frequencies of the first and second resonances of the antenna. However, these frequency shifts depend not only on the values of the capacitors, but also on their locations along the slot antenna. Here, it is shown that by choosing the locations of the varactors appropriately, it is possible to obtain a dual-band antenna whose first and second resonant frequencies can be controlled individually. In other words, the frequency of either the first or the second band can be fixed, while the other one is electronically tuned. Using such a design, an electronically tunable dual-band antenna is designed and fabricated using two identical varactors having a capacitance range of 0.5-2.25 pF. The antenna is shown to have a frequency ratio (f/sub R/=f/sub 2//f/sub 1/) ranging from 1.3 to 2.67. An important feature of this antenna is its consistent radiation pattern, polarization, and polarization purity at both bands and across its entire tunable frequency range.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2005.863412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589409","Multifrequency antennas;multiple band antennas;reconfigurable antennas;slot antennas","Dual band;Slot antennas;Loaded antennas;Capacitors;Varactors;Resonant frequency;Polarization;Resonance;Capacitance;Antenna radiation patterns","","303","5","24","IEEE","6 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These algorithms, when coupled with existing decentralized schemes for constructing network codes, yield a fully decentralized approach for achieving minimum-cost multicast.

Due to mobility and resource constraints of ad hoc networks, cooperative caching techniques designed for wired networks may not be applicable to ad hoc networks. In this paper, we design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques to efficiently support data access in ad hoc networks. We first propose two schemes: CacheData, which caches the data, and CachePath, which caches the data path. After analyzing the performance of those two schemes, we propose a hybrid approach (HybridCache), which can further improve the performance by taking advantage of CacheData and CachePath while avoiding their weaknesses. Cache replacement policies are also studied to further improve the performance.

While classical capacity is not enough, another sense of capacity (parametrized by reliability) called ""anytime capacity"" is necessary for the stabilization of an unstable process. The required rate is given by the log of the unstable system gain and the required reliability comes from the sense of stability desired. A consequence of this necessity result is a sequential generalization of the Schalkwijk-Kailath scheme for communication over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. In cases of sufficiently rich information patterns between the encoder and decoder, adequate anytime capacity is also shown to be sufficient for there to exist a stabilizing controller. These sufficiency results are then generalized to cases with noisy observations, delayed control actions, and without any explicit feedback between the observer and the controller. Both necessary and sufficient conditions are extended to continuous time systems as well. We close with comments discussing a hierarchy of difficulty for communication problems and how these results establish where stabilization problems sit in that hierarchy","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.878169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1661825","Anytime decoding;control over noisy channels;error exponents;feedback;real-time information theory;reliability functions;sequential coding","Linear systems;Additive white noise;Gaussian noise;AWGN;Communication system control;Communication channels;Feedback loop;Stability;Decoding;Delay","","301","","51","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In image sequences, a dynamic model is used to guide the search and approximate the optimal filtering equations. A dynamic model is given by transition probabilities between regions in parameter space and is learned from training data obtained by capturing articulated motion. The algorithm is evaluated on a number of image sequences, which include hand motion with self-occlusion in front of a cluttered background.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1661541","Probabilistic algorithms;video analysis;tracking.","Bayesian methods;Particle tracking;Image sequences;Particle filters;State-space methods;Filtering;Video sequences;Parameter estimation;Robustness;Target tracking","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Computer Simulation;Hand;Hand;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Video Recording","301","8","46","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A new intensity-hue-saturation fusion approach to image fusion with a tradeoff parameter","Myungjin Choi","Satellite Technology Research Center, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea",IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,"5 Jun 2006","2006","44","6","1672","1682","A useful technique in various applications of remote sensing involves the fusion of panchromatic and multispectral satellite images. Recently, Tu et al. introduced a fast intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) fusion method. Aside from its fast computing capability for fusing images, this method can extend traditional three-order transformations to an arbitrary order. It can also quickly merge massive volumes of data by requiring only resampled multispectral data. However, fast IHS fusion also distorts color in the same way as fusion processes such as the IHS fusion technique. To overcome this problem, the minimization problem for a fast IHS method was considered and the method proposed by Gonza/spl acute/lez-Aud/spl inodot//spl acute/cana et al. is presented as a solution. However, the method is not efficient enough to quickly merge massive volumes of data from satellite images. The author therefore uses a tradeoff parameter in a new approach to image fusion based on fast IHS fusion. This approach enables fast, easy implementation. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the spatial and spectral resolution of the image to be fused can be easily controlled with the aid of the tradeoff parameter. Therefore, with an appropriate tradeoff parameter, the new approach provides a satisfactory result, both visually and quantitatively.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.869923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634730","IKONOS image;image fusion;intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) method;Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image;multiresolution analysis;wavelet transform","Image fusion;Discrete wavelet transforms;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Remote sensing;Image resolution;Color;Wavelet analysis;Multiresolution analysis;Minimization methods","","300","1","25","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The conventional method has problems in that it is impossible to quickly acquire the generation power at the maximum power (MP) point in low solar radiation (irradiation) regions. It is found theoretically and experimentally that the maximum output power and the optimal current, which give this maximum, have a linear relation at a constant temperature. Furthermore, it is also shown that linearity exists between the short-circuit current and the optimal current. MPPT control rules are created based on the findings from solar arrays that can respond at high speeds to variations in irradiation. The proposed MPPT control method sets the output current track on the line that gives the relation between the MP and the optimal current so as to acquire the MP that can be generated at that time by dividing the power and current characteristics into two fields. The method is based on the generated power being a binary function of the output current. Considering the experimental fact that linearity is maintained only at low irradiation below half the maximum irradiation, the proportionality coefficient (voltage coefficient) is compensated for only in regions with more than half the rated optimal current, which correspond to the maximum irradiation. At high irradiation, the voltage coefficient needed to perform the proposed MPPT control is acquired through the hill-climbing method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments under various weather conditions","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.878328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667903","Current control;irradiation;maximum power point tracking (MPPT);photovoltaic (PV);PV power generation","Control systems;Power generation;Solar power generation;Optimal control;Photovoltaic systems;Linearity;Voltage;Solar radiation;Temperature;Character generation","","300","5","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, speckle noise reduction is an important prerequisite, whenever ultrasound imaging is used for tissue characterization. Among the many methods that have been proposed to perform this task, there exists a class of approaches that use a multiplicative model of speckled image formation and take advantage of the logarithmical transformation in order to convert multiplicative speckle noise into additive noise. The common assumption made in a dominant number of such studies is that the samples of the additive noise are mutually uncorrelated and obey a Gaussian distribution. The present study shows conceptually and experimentally that this assumption is oversimplified and unnatural. Moreover, it may lead to inadequate performance of the speckle reduction methods. The study introduces a simple preprocessing procedure, which modifies the acquired radio-frequency images (without affecting the anatomical information they contain), so that the noise in the log-transformation domain becomes very close in its behavior to a white Gaussian noise. As a result, the preprocessing allows filtering methods based on assuming the noise to be white and Gaussian, to perform in nearly optimal conditions. The study evaluates performances of three different, nonlinear filters - wavelet denoising, total variation filtering, and anisotropic diffusion - and demonstrates that, in all these cases, the proposed preprocessing significantly improves the quality of resultant images. Our numerical tests include a series of computer-simulated and in vivo experiments.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1588392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1588392","","Biomedical imaging;Ultrasonic imaging;Speckle;Noise reduction;Additive noise;Gaussian noise;Medical diagnostic imaging;Filtering;Image resolution;Image converters","Algorithms;Artifacts;Carotid Arteries;Echocardiography;Echocardiography;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","300","4","50","IEEE","6 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Particular emphasis is placed on the computational complexity of the methods, since the application is of particular interest in resource-constrained portable devices. Simplistic low-dimensional feature vectors are evaluated against more standard spectral features. Using discriminative training, competitive recognition accuracies are achieved with very low-order hidden Markov models (1-3 Gaussian components). Slight improvement in recognition accuracy is observed when linear data-driven feature transformations are applied to mel-cepstral features. The recognition rate of the system as a function of the test sequence length appears to converge only after about 30 to 60 s. Some degree of accuracy can be achieved even with less than 1-s test sequence lengths. The average reaction time of the human listeners was 14 s, i.e., somewhat smaller, but of the same order as that of the system.

Traditional DVS techniques require significant voltage safety margins to guarantee computational correctness at the worst case combination of process, voltage and temperature conditions, leading to a loss in energy efficiency. In Razor-based DVS, however, the supply voltage is automatically reduced to the point of first failure using the error detection and correction mechanism, thereby eliminating safety margins while still ensuring correct operation. In addition, the supply voltage can be intentionally scaled below the point of first failure of the processor to achieve an optimal tradeoff between energy savings from further voltage reduction and energy overhead from increased error detection and correction activity. We tested and measured savings due to Razor DVS for 33 different dies and obtained an average energy savings of 50% over worst case operating conditions by scaling supply voltage to achieve a 0.1% targeted error rate, at a fixed frequency of 120 MHz.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2006.870912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610623","Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS);error detection and correction;self-tuning processor;voltage safety margins","Voltage control;Delay;Error correction;Safety;Dynamic voltage scaling;Timing;Silicon;Temperature;Energy efficiency;Testing","","299","17","14","IEEE","27 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A novel spatiotemporal segmentation algorithm is employed to generate salient edgels that are robust to changes in appearance of clothing. The invariant signatures are generated by combining normalized color and salient edgel histograms. Two approaches are proposed to generate correspondences: (i) a model based approach that fits an articulated model to each individual to establish a correspondence map, and (ii) an interest point operator approach that nominates a large number of potential correspondences which are evaluated using a region growing scheme.

In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disrupting communication. We present a general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and, thus defending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implements leashes. We also discuss topology-based wormhole detection, and show that it is impossible for these approaches to detect some wormhole topologies.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.861394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589115","Ad hoc networks;computer network security;computer networks;packet leash;TIK;tunneling;wireless local area network (LAN);wormhole","Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Ad hoc networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Computer networks;NASA;Communication system security;Network topology;Computer security","","298","5","42","IEEE","6 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We represent an object window as the covariance matrix of features, therefore we manage to capture the spatial and statistical properties as well as their correlation within the same representation. The covariance matrix enables efficient fusion of different types of features and modalities, and its dimensionality is small. We incorporated a model update algorithm using the Lie group structure of the positive definite matrices. The update mechanism effectively adapts to the undergoing object deformations and appearance changes. The covariance tracking method does not make any assumption on the measurement noise and the motion of the tracked objects, and provides the global optimal solution. We show that it is capable of accurately detecting the nonrigid, moving objects in non-stationary camera sequences while achieving a promising detection rate of 97.4 percent.","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.94","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640826","","Algebra;Covariance matrix;Tracking;Object detection;Histograms;Pixel;Noise measurement;Kernel;Probability density function;Filtering","","298","5","16","IEEE","5 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The shield minimizes losses without requiring an explicit on-chip ground connection. Experimental measurements demonstrate Q-factor ranging from 25 to 35 between 15 and 40 GHz for shielded coplanar waveguide fabricated on 10 /spl Omega//spl middot/cm silicon. This is more than a factor of 2 improvement over conventional on-chip transmission lines (e.g., microstrip, CPW). A floating-shielded, differentially driven 7.4-nH inductor demonstrates a peak Q of 32, which is 35% higher than an unshielded example. Similar results are realizable for on-chip transformers. Floating-shielded bond-pads with 15% less parasitic capacitance and over 60% higher shunt equivalent resistance compared to conventional shielded bondpads are also described. Implementation of floating shields is compatible with current and projected design constraints for production deep-submicron silicon technologies without process modifications. Application examples of floating-shielded passives implemented in a 0.18-/spl mu/m SiGe-BiCMOS are presented, including a 21-26-GHz power amplifier with 23-dBm output at 20% PAE (at 22 GHz), and a 17-GHz WLAN image-reject receiver MMIC which dissipates less than 65 mW from a 2-V supply.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2006.872737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624408","Bondpads;coplanar transmission lines;floating shield;inductors;millimeter-wave integrated circuits;MMICs;on-chip interconnects;patterned ground shield;silicon;slow-wave transmission lines;substrate loss;transformers","Microwave devices;Millimeter wave integrated circuits;Silicon;Power transmission lines;Coplanar transmission lines;Inductors;Transformers;Production;CMOS technology;Coplanar waveguides","","297","11","48","IEEE","24 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Implementing these properties includes providing data version management for the simultaneous storage of both new (visible if the transaction commits) and old (retained if the transaction aborts) values. Most (hardware) TM systems leave old values ""in place"" (the target memory address) and buffer new values elsewhere until commit. This makes aborts fast, but penalizes (the much more frequent) commits. In this paper, we present a new implementation of transactional memory, log-based transactional memory (LogTM), that makes commits fast by storing old values to a per-thread log in cacheable virtual memory and storing new values in place. LogTM makes two additional contributions. First, LogTM extends a MOESI directory protocol to enable both fast conflict detection on evicted blocks and fast commit (using lazy cleanup). Second, LogTM handles aborts in (library) software with little performance penalty. Evaluations running micro- and SPLASH-2 benchmarks on a 32-way multiprocessor support our decision to optimize for commit by showing that only 1-2% of transactions abort.","2378-203X","0-7803-9368-6","10.1109/HPCA.2006.1598134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1598134","","Hardware;Proposals;Memory management;Protocols;Concurrent computing;Parallel programming;Software libraries;Software performance;Yarn;Software systems","","297","42","34","IEEE","27 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

AmbiMax addresses these problems by first performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) autonomously, and then charges supercapacitors at maximum efficiency. Furthermore, AmbiMax is modular and enables composition of multiple energy harvesting sources including solar, wind, thermal, and vibration, each with a different optimal size.

This paper describes a stream-based overlay network (SBON), a layer between a stream-processing system and the physical network that manages operator placement for stream-processing systems. Our design is based on a cost space, an abstract representation of the network and on-going streams, which permits decentralized, large-scale multi-query optimization decisions.

Supposing that the sensors use a universal decentralized quantization/estimation scheme and an uncoded quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) transmission strategy, we determine the optimal quantization and transmit power levels at local sensors so as to minimize the total transmit power, while ensuring a given mean squared error (mse) performance. The proposed power scheduling scheme suggests that the sensors with bad channels or poor observation qualities should decrease their quantization resolutions or simply become inactive in order to save power. For the remaining active sensors, their optimal quantization and transmit power levels are determined jointly by individual channel path losses, local observation noise variance, and the targeted mse performance. Numerical examples show that in inhomogeneous sensing environment, significant energy savings is possible when compared to the uniform quantization strategy.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.861898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576972","Distributed estimation;inhomogeneous quantization;power scheduling;sensor networks","Quantization;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Sensor fusion;Fusion power generation;Amplitude estimation;Amplitude modulation;Energy resolution;Propagation losses;Active noise reduction;Working environment noise","","296","","22","IEEE","16 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simple power consumption models for major components are individually identified, and the effective transmission range of a sensor node is modeled by the output power of the transmitting power amplifier, sensitivity of the receiving low noise amplifier, and RF environment. Using this basic model, conditions for minimum sensor network power consumption are derived for communication of sensor data from a source device to a destination node. Power consumption model parameters are extracted for two types of wireless sensor nodes that are widely used and commercially available. For typical hardware configurations and RF environments, it is shown that whenever single hop routing is possible it is almost always more power efficient than multi-hop routing. Further consideration of communication protocol overhead also shows that single hop routing will be more power efficient compared to multi-hop routing under realistic circumstances.

The quest to achieve a good-drivability, noise-robustness, and low-energy operations for deep submicrometer guided our research to explore hybrid-CMOS style design. Hybrid-CMOS design style utilizes various CMOS logic style circuits to build new full adders with desired performance. This provides the designer a higher degree of design freedom to target a wide range of applications, thus significantly reducing design efforts. We also classify hybrid-CMOS full adders into three broad categories based upon their structure. Using this categorization, many full-adder designs can be conceived. We will present a new full-adder design belonging to one of the proposed categories. The new full adder is based on a novel xor-xnor circuit that generates xor and xnor full-swing outputs simultaneously. This circuit outperforms its counterparts showing 5%-37% improvement in the power-delay product (PDP). A novel hybrid-CMOS output stage that exploits the simultaneous xor-xnor signals is also proposed. This output stage provides good driving capability enabling cascading of adders without the need of buffer insertion between cascaded stages. There is approximately a 40% reduction in PDP when compared to its best counterpart. During our experimentations, we found out that many of the previously reported adders suffered from the problems of low swing and high noise when operated at low supply voltages. The proposed full adder is energy efficient and outperforms several standard full adders without trading off driving capability and reliability. The new full-adder circuit successfully operates at low voltages with excellent signal integrity and driving capability. To evaluate the performance of the new full adder in a real circuit, we embedded it in a 4- and 8-b, 4-operand carry-save array adder with final carry-propagate adder.

This work focuses on one important constraint of such devices-battery life-and examines how it is impacted by the use of various security mechanisms. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of a wide range of cryptographic algorithms that form the building blocks of security mechanisms such as security protocols. We then study the energy consumption requirements of the most popular transport-layer security protocol: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). We investigate the impact of various parameters at the protocol level (such as cipher suites, authentication mechanisms, and transaction sizes, etc.) and the cryptographic algorithm level (cipher modes, strength) on the overall energy consumption for secure data transactions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of SSL. For our studies, we have developed a measurement-based experimental testbed that consists of an iPAQ PDA connected to a wireless local area network (LAN) and running Linux, a PC-based data acquisition system for real-time current measurement, the OpenSSL implementation of the SSL protocol, and parameterizable SSL client and server test programs.

The system is structured as a toolkit to allow the implementation of the following satellite applications: TV and sound broadcasting, interactivity (i.e., Internet access), and professional services, such as TV contribution links and digital satellite news gathering. It has been specified around three concepts: best transmission performance approaching the Shannon limit, total flexibility, and reasonable receiver complexity. Channel coding and modulation are based on more recent developments by the scientific community: low density parity check codes are adopted, combined with QPSK, 8PSK, 16APSK, and 32APSK modulations for the system to work properly on the nonlinear satellite channel. The framing structure allows for maximum flexibility in a versatile system and also synchronization in worst case configurations (low signal-to-noise ratios). Adaptive coding and modulation, when used in one-to-one links, then allows optimization of the transmission parameters for each individual user,dependant on path conditions. Backward-compatible modes are also available,allowing existing DVB-S integrated receivers-decoders to continue working during the transitional period.

This paper adopts the multiagent system approach to develop distributed unsupervised traffic responsive signal control models, where each agent in the system is a local traffic signal controller for one intersection in the traffic network. The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism. The second multiagent system is developed by integrating the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem in fuzzy neural networks (NN). The problem of real-time traffic signal control is especially challenging if the agents are used for an infinite horizon problem, where online learning has to take place continuously once the agent-based traffic signal controllers are implemented into the traffic network. A comprehensive simulation model of a section of the Central Business District of Singapore has been developed using PARAMICS microscopic simulation program. Simulation results show that the hybrid multiagent system provides significant improvement in traffic conditions when evaluated against an existing traffic signal control algorithm as well as the SPSA-NN-based multiagent system as the complexity of the simulation scenario increases. Using the hybrid NN-based multiagent system, the mean delay of each vehicle was reduced by 78% and the mean stoppage time, by 85% compared to the existing traffic signal control algorithm.

A core challenge in these networks is to minimize energy consumption. Prior database research has proposed to achieve this by pushing data-reducing operators like aggregation and selection down into the network. This approach has proven unpopular with early adopters of sensor network technology, who typically want to extract complete ""dumps"" of the sensor readings, i.e., to run ""SELECT *"" queries. Unfortunately, because these queries do no data reduction, they consume significant energy in current sensornet query processors. In this paper we attack the ""SELECT "" problem for sensor networks. We propose a robust approximate technique called Ken that uses replicated dynamic probabilistic models to minimize communication from sensor nodes to the network’s PC base station. In addition to data collection, we show that Ken is well suited to anomaly- and event-detection applications. A key challenge in this work is to intelligently exploit spatial correlations across sensor nodes without imposing undue sensor-to-sensor communication burdens to maintain the models. Using traces from two real-world sensor network deployments, we demonstrate that relatively simple models can provide significant communication (and hence energy) savings without undue sacrifice in result quality or frequency. Choosing optimally among even our simple models is NPhard, but our experiments show that a greedy heuristic performs nearly as well as an exhaustive algorithm.","2375-026X","0-7695-2570-9","10.1109/ICDE.2006.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1617416","","Intelligent networks;Biosensors;Energy consumption;Intelligent sensors;Batteries;Wireless sensor networks;Data mining;Biological system modeling;Databases;Robustness","","289","1","33","IEEE","24 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an overview of the Sesame framework, which provides high-level modeling and simulation methods and tools for system-level performance evaluation and exploration of heterogeneous embedded systems. More specifically, we describe Sesame's modeling methodology and trajectory. It takes a designer systematically along the path from selecting candidate architectures, using analytical modeling and multiobjective optimization, to simulating these candidate architectures with our system-level simulation environment. This simulation environment subsequently allows for architectural exploration at different levels of abstraction while maintaining high-level and architecture-independent application specifications.

Sigma-point filters use a carefully selected set of sample points to more accurately map the probability distribution than the linearization of the standard extended Kalman filter (KKF), leading to faster convergence from inaccurate initial conditions in position/attitude estimation problems. The filter formulation is based on standard inertial navigation equations. The global attitude parameterization is given by a quaternion, while a generalized three-dimensional attitude representation is used to define the local attitude error. A multiplicative quaternion-error approach is used to guarantee that quaternion normalization is maintained in the filter.

General accurate expressions for the covariance matrices of the system state-dependent noises are developed. In addition, an analysis shows how to compute these covariance matrices efficiently. An adaptive version of the filter is also developed to handle modeling errors of the dynamic system noise statistics.

The data were then converted into a voxel-based three-dimensional model that reproduced the tree precisely, including within the canopy. This precise voxel model allowed the LAD and LAI of these trees, which have extremely dense and nonrandomly distributed foliage, to be computed by direct counting of the beam-contact frequency in each layer using a point-quadrat method. Corrections for leaf inclination and nonphotosynthetic tissues reduced the estimation error. A beam incident zenith angle near 57.5deg offered a good correction for leaf inclination without knowledge of the actual leaf inclination.

A major performance bottleneck in sensor networks is energy since it is impractical to replace the batteries in embedded sensor nodes post-deployment. A significant portion of the energy expenditure is attributed to communications and, in particular, the nodes close to the sensor network gateways used for data collection typically suffer a large overhead as these nodes must relay data from the remaining network. Even with compression and in-network processing to reduce the amount of communicated data, all the processed data must still traverse these nodes to reach the gateway. We discuss a network infrastructure based on the use of controllably mobile elements to reduce the communication energy consumption at the energy constrained nodes and, thus, increase useful network lifetime. In addition, our approach yields advantages in delay-tolerant networks and sparsely deployed networks. We first show how our approach helps reduce energy consumption at battery constrained nodes. Second, we describe our system prototype, which utilizes our proposed approach to improve the energy performance. As part of the prototyping effort, we experienced several interesting design choices and trade-offs that affect system capabilities and performance. We describe many of these design challenges and discuss the algorithms developed for addressing these. In particular, we focus on network protocols and motion control strategies.

The switching functions used in switching these converters are mathematically analyzed. Equivalent circuits are derived and presented. The switching and balancing properties of these converters are mathematically analyzed. The main conclusion of the analysis is that the natural balancing of these converters are influenced by three factors namely, the harmonic content of the reference waveform, the switching frequency and the load impedance. Mathematical tools are presented that can help designers to predict if balancing problems would occur for a particular set of operating conditions. As a result of the detailed understanding of the balancing mechanism that is gained through this theory it is shown that by adding a balance booster, the load impedance can be manipulated to improve the natural balancing of the converter.

Due to severe indoor multipath conditions, these techniques often suffer from significant inaccuracy in location estimation. In this paper, we introduce a model for the error in estimated distance as measured from the estimated TOA of the direct path (DP) in a typical multipath indoor environment. The TOA estimation error has two components, (1) the errors caused by the multipath dispersion affecting any signal path and (2) the errors caused by undetected direct path (UDP) conditions. The statistical behavior of this error is also a function of the system bandwidth. The empirical data from UWB indoor measurements in an office building are used to design a model for the distance measurement error. This model relates the behavior of the two components of the TOA estimation error to the bandwidth of the system.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2006.1613745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613745","","Distance measurement;Indoor radio communication;Bandwidth;Ultra wideband technology;Time of arrival estimation;Wireless LAN;Position measurement;Velocity measurement;Current measurement;Time measurement","","284","","12","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Windpower presently is the fastest growing power generation sector in the world. However, windpower is intermittent. To be able to trade efficiently, make the best use of transmission line capability, and address concerns with system frequency in a re-regulated system, accurate very short-term forecasts are essential. The research introduces a novel approach-the application of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to forecasting a wind time series. Over the very short-term forecast interval, both windspeed and wind direction are important parameters. To be able to be gain the most from a forecast on this time scale, the turbines must be directed toward on oncoming wind.

Manufacturing scheduling is the process of selecting a process plan and assigning manufacturing resources for specific time periods to the set of manufacturing processes in the plan. It is, in fact, an optimization process by which limited manufacturing resources are allocated over time among parallel and sequential activities. Manufacturing process planning and scheduling are usually considered to be two separate and distinct phases. Traditional optimization approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints of both domains simultaneously and result in suboptimal solutions. Without considering real-time machine workloads and shop floor dynamics, process plans may become suboptimal or even invalid at the time of execution. Therefore, there is a need for the integration of manufacturing process-planning and scheduling systems for generating more realistic and effective plans. After describing the complexity of the manufacturing process-planning and scheduling problems, this paper reviews the research literature on manufacturing process planning, scheduling as well as their integration, particularly on agent-based approaches to these difficult problems.

The mechanism for bacterial deactivation undergoes a lot of speculation, particularly with regard to the role of ions and reactive gas species. Two mechanisms have been proposed: electrostatic disruption of cell membranes and lethal oxidation of membrane or cytoplasmic components. Results show that death is accompanied by cell lysis and fragmentation in Gram-negative bacteria but not Gram-positive species, although cytoplasmic leakage is generally observed. Gas discharges can be a source of charged particles, ions, reactive gas species, radicals, and radiation (ultraviolet, infrared, and visible), many of which have documented biocidal properties. The individual roles played by these in decontamination are not well understood or quantified. However, the reactions of some species with biomolecules are documented otherwise in the literature. Oxidative stress is relatively well studied, and it is likely that exposure to gas discharges in air causes extreme oxidative challenge. In this paper, a review is presented of the major reactive species generated by nonthermal plasma at atmospheric pressure and the known reactions of these with biological molecules. Understanding these mechanisms becomes increasingly important as plasma-based decontamination and sterilization devices come closer to a wide-scale application in medical, healthcare, food processing, and air purification applications. Approaches are proposed to elucidate the relative importance of reactive species.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2006.878381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1673523","Bacteria;nonthermal plasmas;reactive oxygen species (ROS);sterilization;superoxide","Atmospheric-pressure plasmas;Decontamination;Discharges;Microorganisms;Biomembranes;Plasma applications;Plasma devices;Plasma materials processing;Electrostatics;Cells (biology)","","282","2","103","IEEE","14 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the problem of detecting the changes that occurred on the ground by analyzing SAR imagery is addressed by a completely unsupervised approach, i.e., by developing an automatic thresholding technique. The image-ratioing approach to SAR change detection is adopted, and the Kittler and Illingworth minimum-error thresholding algorithm is generalized to take into account the non-Gaussian distribution of the amplitude values of SAR images.

The realism of such interactions can be dramatically improved by superimposing event-based, high-frequency transient forces over traditional position-based feedback. When scaled by impact velocity, hand-tuned pulses and decaying sinusoids produce haptic cues that resemble those experienced during real impacts. Our new method for generating appropriate transients inverts a dynamic model of the haptic device to determine the motor forces required to create prerecorded acceleration profiles at the user's fingertips. After development, the event-based haptic paradigm and the method of acceleration matching were evaluated in a carefully controlled user study. Sixteen individuals blindly tapped on nine virtual and three real samples, rating the degree to which each felt like real wood. Event-based feedback achieved significantly higher realism ratings than the traditional rendering method. The display of transient signals made virtual objects feel similar to a real sample of wood on a foam substrate, while position feedback alone received ratings similar to those of foam. This work provides an important new avenue for increasing the realism of contact in haptic interactions.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580456","Haptics;force feedback;contact transient;event-based.","Haptic interfaces;Acceleration;Force feedback;Rendering (computer graphics);Virtual environment;Displays;Frequency;Material properties;Pressing;Muscles","Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Feedback;Humans;Models, Biological;Movement;Physical Stimulation;Psychomotor Performance;Robotics;Stress, Mechanical;Touch;User-Computer Interface;Vibration","281","3","40","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These uncertainties can be seen as a by-product of the economic pressure that forces market participants to behave in an “unpredictable” manner; hence, probability distributions of locational marginal prices are calculated as a result. Instead of using computationally demanding methods, the proposed approach needs$2n$runs of the deterministic OPF for$n$uncertain variables to get the result in terms of the first three moments of the corresponding probability density functions. Another advantage of the 2PEM is that it does not require derivatives of the nonlinear function used in the computation of the probability distributions. The proposed method is tested on a simple three-bus test system and on a more realistic 129-bus test system. Results are compared against more accurate results obtained from MCS. The proposed method demonstrates a high level of accuracy for mean values when compared to the MCS; for standard deviations, the results are better in those cases when the number of uncertain variables is relatively low or when their dispersion is not large.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2006.881146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717593","Electricity markets;probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF);probability distribution;two-point estimate method (2PEM);uncertainty","Load flow;Power markets;Uncertainty;Electricity supply industry;Probability distribution;System testing;Power system planning;Power system stability;Random variables;Taylor series","","281","","23","IEEE","30 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It provides a unique commutation logic to minimize a mismatch between current in the current-fed inductor and current in the leakage inductance of the transformer when commutation takes place, significantly reducing the power rating for a voltage clamping snubber and enabling use of a simple passive clamped snubber. To minimize the mismatch, the method and control scheme utilizes the resonant tank and freewheeling path in the existing full bridge inverter at the voltage-fed side to preset the current in the leakage inductance of the transformer in a resonant manner. Zero-voltage-switching is also achieved for all the switches at the voltage-fed side inverter in boost mode operation. The proposed soft-commutating method is verified through boost mode operation of a 3-kW bidirectional isolated full bridge dc/dc converter developed for fuel cell electric vehicle applications. The tested result verified the isolated boost converter can operate at an input voltage of 8.5–15V and an output voltage of 250–420V with a peak efficiency of 93% and an average efficiency of 88% at 55-kHz switching frequency with 72$^circ$C automotive coolant.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2005.869730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603674","Automotive dc/dc converter;bidirectional dc/dc converter;full bridge;isolated boost converter;soft-commutating;soft-switching","Bridge circuits;Inductance;Snubbers;Resonance;Inverters;Voltage;Buck converters;Logic;Inductors;Clamps","","280","1","13","IEEE","6 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The device consists of a curved, cantilevered steering arm, mounted on an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA). These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate. Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace. These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error of less than 3.7/spl deg//mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176 /spl mu/m, and achieve speeds of over 200 /spl mu/m/sec with an average step size as small as 12 nm. They have been shown to operate open-loop for distances exceeding 35 cm without failure, and can be controlled through teleoperation to navigate complex paths. The devices were fabricated through a multiuser surface micromachining process, and were postprocessed to add a patterned layer of tensile chromium, which curls the steering arms upward. After sacrificial release, the devices were transferred with a vacuum microprobe to the electrical grid for testing. This grid consists of a silicon substrate coated with 13-/spl mu/m microfabricated electrodes, arranged in an interdigitated fashion with 2-/spl mu/m spaces. The electrodes are insulated by a layer of electron-beam-evaporated zirconium dioxide, so that devices placed on top of the electrodes will experience an electrostatic force in response to an applied voltage. Control waveforms are broadcast to the device through the capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response of the device body.

This paper summarizes the experience of several collaborating investigators on validation of MODIS LAI products and demonstrates the close connection between product validation and algorithm refinement activities. The validation of moderate resolution LAI products includes three steps: 1) field sampling representative of LAI spatial distribution and dynamic range within each major land cover type at the validation site; 2) development of a transfer function between field LAI measurements and high resolution satellite data to generate a reference LAI map over an extended area; and 3) comparison of MODIS LAI with aggregated reference LAI map at patch (multipixel) scale in view of geo-location and pixel shift uncertainties. The MODIS LAI validation experiences, summarized here, suggest three key factors that influence the accuracy of LAI retrievals: 1) uncertainties in input land cover data, 2) uncertainties in input surface reflectances, and 3) uncertainties from the model used to build the look-up tables accompanying the algorithm.

Grossglauser and Tse (2001) showed that when nodes are mobile it is possible to have a constant throughput scaling per source-destination pair. In most applications, delay is also a key metric of network performance. It is expected that high throughput is achieved at the cost of high delay and that one can be improved at the cost of the other. The focus of this paper is on studying this tradeoff for wireless networks in a general framework. Optimal throughput-delay scaling laws for static and mobile wireless networks are established. For static networks, it is shown that the optimal throughput-delay tradeoff is given by D(n)=Theta(nT(n)), where T(n) and D(n) are the throughput and delay scaling, respectively. For mobile networks, a simple proof of the throughput scaling of Theta(1) for the Grossglauser-Tse scheme is given and the associated delay scaling is shown to be Theta(nlogn). The optimal throughput-delay tradeoff for mobile networks is also established. To capture physical movement in the real world, a random-walk (RW) model for node mobility is assumed. It is shown that for throughput of Oscr(1/radic(nlogn)), which can also be achieved in static networks, the throughput-delay tradeoff is the same as in static networks, i.e., D(n)=Theta(nT(n)). Surprisingly, for almost any throughput of a higher order, the delay is shown to be Theta(nlogn), which is the delay for throughput of Theta(1). Our result, thus, suggests that the use of mobility to increase throughput, even slightly, in real-world networks would necessitate an abrupt and very large increase in delay.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.874379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638544","Queueing theory;random walks;scaling laws;throughput scaling;throughput–delay tradeoff;wireless networks","Intelligent networks;Throughput;Wireless networks;Interference;Delay;Costs;Network topology;Wireless sensor networks;Transmitters;Electrostatic discharge","","277","","20","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, they find that at high flow rates, where the flame should normally blow out, the NRPP allows the existence of an intermittent V-shaped flame with significant heat release, and at even higher flow rates the existence of a small dome-shaped flame confined near the electrodes that can serve as a pilot flame to reignite the combustor.

For each pixel, an adaptive neighborhood (AN) is determined by a region growing technique driven exclusively by the intensity image information. All the available intensity images of the polarimetric and interferometric terms are fused in the region growing process to ensure the validity of the stationarity assumption. Afterward, all the pixels within the obtained AN are used to yield the filtered values of the polarimetric and interferometric coherency matrices, which can be derived either by direct complex multilooking or from the locally linear minimum mean-squared error (LLMMSE) estimator. The entropy/alpha/anisotropy decomposition is then applied to the estimated polarimetric coherency matrices, and coherence optimization is performed on the estimated polarimetric and interferometric coherency matrices. Using this decomposition, unsupervised classification for land applications by an iterative algorithm based on a complex Wishart density function is also applied. The method has been tested on airborne high-resolution polarimetric interferometric synthetic aperture radar (POL-InSAR) images (Oberpfaffenhofen area-German Space Agency). For comparison purposes, the two estimation techniques (complex multilooking and LLMMSE) were tested using three different spatial supports: a fix-sized symmetric neighborhood (boxcar filter), directional nonsymmetric windows, and the proposed AN. Subjective and objective performance analysis, including coherence edge detection, receiver operating characteristics plots, and bias reduction tables, recommends the proposed algorithm as an effective POL-InSAR postprocessing technique.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.864142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634724","Coherency estimation;interferometry;multivariate region growing;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar","Parameter estimation;Matrix decomposition;Testing;Pixel;Nonlinear filters;Yield estimation;Entropy;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Iterative algorithms;Density functional theory","","276","1","49","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these situations, however, the information level of the signal is often far lower than the actual bandwidth, which prompts the question of whether more efficient schemes can be developed for measuring such signals. In this paper we propose a system that uses modulation, filtering, and sampling to produce a low-rate set of digital measurements. Our ""analog-to-information converter"" (AIC) is inspired by the theory of compressive sensing (CS), which states that a discrete signal having a sparse representation in some dictionary can be recovered from a small number of linear projections of that signal.

The network model incorporates the broadcast nature of the wireless environment by requiring each node to send the same signal on all outgoing channels. However, we assume there is no interference in reception. Such models are therefore appropriate for wireless networks where all information transmission is packetized and where some mechanism for interference avoidance is already built in. This paper looks at multicast problems over these networks. The capacity under the assumption that erasure locations on all the links of the network are provided to the destinations is obtained. It turns out that the capacity region has a nice max-flow min-cut interpretation. The definition of cut-capacity in these networks incorporates the broadcast property of the wireless medium. It is further shown that linear coding at nodes in the network suffices to achieve the capacity region.

Increasingly, fire severity has been estimated using a spectral index called the normalized burn ratio (NBR). This letter assesses the performance of the NBR against ideal requirements of a spectral index designed to measure fire severity. According to index theory, the NBR would be optimal for quantifying fire severity if the trajectory in spectral feature space caused by different levels of severity occurred perpendicular to the NBR isolines. We assess how well NBR meets this condition using reflectance data sensed before and shortly after fires in the South African savanna, Australian savanna, Russian Federation boreal forest, and South American tropical forest. Although previous studies report high correlation between fire severity measured in the field- and satellite-derived NBR, our results do not provide evidence that the performance of the NBR is optimal in describing fire severity shortly after fire occurrence. Spectral displacements due to burning occur in numerous directions relative to the NBR index isolines, suggesting that the NBR may not be primarily and consistently sensitive to fire severity. Findings suggest that the development of the next generation of methods to estimate fire severity remotely should incorporate knowledge of how fires of different severity displace the position of prefire vegetation in multispectral space.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2005.858485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576701","Fire severity;remote sensing;spectral index","Remote sensing;Fires;Reflectivity;Satellites;Vegetation mapping;Ecosystems;NASA;Soil;Fuels;Biomedical optical imaging","","273","","20","IEEE","16 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this novel and challenging mobile environment, sensors can generate a sheer amount of data, and traditional sensor network approaches for data reporting become unfeasible. This article proposes MobEyes, an efficient lightweight support for proactive urban monitoring based on the primary idea of exploiting vehicle mobility to opportunistically diffuse summaries about sensed data.

From a computer vision perspective, this task is extremely challenging because it is massively ill-posed - at each pixel we must estimate the foreground and the background colors, as well as the foreground opacity (""alpha matte"") from a single color measurement. Current approaches either restrict the estimation to a small part of the image, estimating foreground and background colors based on nearby pixels where they are known, or perform iterative nonlinear estimation by alternating foreground and background color estimation with alpha estimation. In this paper we present a closed form solution to natural image matting. We derive a cost function from local smoothness assumptions on foreground and background colors, and show that in the resulting expression it is possible to analytically eliminate the foreground and background colors to obtain a quadratic cost function in alpha. This allows us to find the globally optimal alpha matte by solving a sparse linear system of equations. Furthermore, the closed form formula allows us to predict the properties of the solution by analyzing the eigenvectors of a sparse matrix, closely related to matrices used in spectral image segmentation algorithms. We show that high quality mattes can be obtained on natural images from a surprisingly small amount of user input.","1063-6919","0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640742","","Closed-form solution;Cost function;Image color analysis;Sparse matrices;Computer vision;Pixel;Iterative methods;Linear systems;Equations;Image analysis","","272","60","17","IEEE","5 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A completely specified n-input, n-output Boolean function is called reversible if it maps each input assignment to a unique output assignment and vice versa. Logic synthesis for reversible functions differs substantially from traditional logic synthesis and is currently an active area of research. The authors present an algorithm and tool for the synthesis of reversible functions. The algorithm uses the positive-polarity Reed-Muller expansion of a reversible function to synthesize the function as a network of Toffoli gates. At each stage, candidate factors, which represent subexpressions common between the Reed-Muller expansions of multiple outputs, are explored in the order of their attractiveness. The algorithm utilizes a priority-based search tree, and heuristics are used to rapidly prune the search space. The synthesis algorithm currently targets the generalized n-bit Toffoli gate library. However, other algorithms exist that can convert an n-bit Toffoli gate into a cascade of smaller Toffoli gates. Experimental results indicate that the authors' algorithm quickly synthesizes circuits when tested on the set of all reversible functions of three variables. Furthermore, it is able to quickly synthesize all four-variable and most five-variable reversible functions that were in the test suite. The authors also present results for some benchmark functions widely discussed in literature and some new benchmarks that the authors have developed. The algorithm is shown to synthesize many, but not all, randomly generated reversible functions of as many as 16 variables with a maximum gate count of 25","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2006.871622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1715418","Quantum computing;reversible computing;reversible logic synthesis","Circuit synthesis;Logic circuits;Quantum computing;Network synthesis;Circuit testing;Boolean functions;Benchmark testing;Signal synthesis;Libraries;Computer industry","","272","3","26","IEEE","23 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The binary patterns of the n shares, however, have no visual meaning and hinder the objectives of visual cryptography. Extended visual cryptography was proposed recently to construct meaningful binary images as shares using hypergraph colourings, but the visual quality is poor. In this paper, a novel technique named halftone visual cryptography is proposed to achieve visual cryptography via halftoning. Based on the blue-noise dithering principles, the proposed method utilizes the void and cluster algorithm to encode a secret binary image into n halftone shares (images) carrying significant visual information.

This paper investigates the pose ambiguity for planar targets viewed by a perspective camera. We show that pose ambiguities—two distinct local minima of the according error function—exist even for cases with wide angle lenses and close range targets.

By this means, we achieve the necessary flexibility to simultaneously obtain quite symmetric frequency responses, controllable bandwidths, and compact dimensions. Two prototype device bandpass filters are provided to illustrate the potentiality of the proposed approach. In the first prototype, the structure is periodic (i.e., composed of identical cells) and behaves as a left-handed transmission line with controllable bandwidth. In the second prototype device, periodicity is sacrificed with an eye toward the synthesis of a standard (Chebyshev) approximation. The measured frequency responses point out low insertion losses in the passband, as well as high-frequency selectivity with small dimensions. As compared to conventional parallel coupled line filters, reduction of device length by a factor of 2.4 is demonstrated. This is the first time that planar filters with controllable bandwidth based on CSRRs are achieved.

The key idea is to exploit the asymmetric logical masking probabilities of gates, hardening gates that have the lowest logical masking probability to achieve cost-effective tradeoffs between overhead and soft error failure rate reduction. The asymmetry in the logical masking probabilities at a gate is leveraged by decoupling the physical from the logical (Boolean) aspects of soft error susceptibility of the gate. Gates are hardened to single-event upsets (SEUs) with specified worst case characteristics in increasing order of their logical masking probability, thereby maximizing the reduction in the soft error failure rate for specified overhead costs (area, power, and delay). Gate sizing for radiation hardening uses a novel gate (transistor) sizing technique that is both efficient and accurate. A full set of experimental results for process technologies ranging from 180 to 70 nm demonstrates the cost-effective tradeoffs that can be achieved. On average, the proposed technique has a radiation hardening overhead of 38.3%, 27.1%, and 3.8% in area, power, and delay for worst case SEUs across the four process technologies.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2005.853696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564311","Gate sizing;radiation hardening;soft errors","Radiation hardening;Logic;Combinational circuits;Single event transient;Costs;Delay;Circuit faults;Computer errors;Electrical fault detection;Application software","","265","4","42","IEEE","27 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The challenge is to coordinate the actions of a group of inverters so that they offer the level of power quality known to be possible from fast local control of a single inverter. The case examined here is a power park of several inverter-based DG in relatively close proximity. A basic requirement is that the inverters regulate the grid voltage and share the real and reactive power demands according to their ratings. In small girds with high proportions of nonlinear and unbalanced loads it is also important to actively control the waveform quality in terms of harmonics, transient disturbances, and balance. Further, it is important that these duties are shared equally between the units rather than having one master unit taking the lead in the voltage control function. A constraint faced in designing a sharing system is the limited bandwidth of signal communication even over distances of a few meters. A control method is proposed that separates the control tasks in the frequency domain. Power sharing and voltage regulation are controlled centrally and commands are distributed through a low-bandwidth communication link. Waveform quality functions are controlled in high bandwidth controllers distributed to each local inverter. Experimental tests on a grid of three 10-kVA inverters are used to show that the method fully exploits the inherent fast response of the inverters while also ensuring voltage balance even with extreme load imbalance. It is shown that circulating currents are avoided during steady state and transients.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.882019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705638","Distributed generation (DG);inverter;microgrid;power quality","Distributed power generation;Distributed control;Inverters;Communication system control;Voltage control;Power quality;Bandwidth;Reactive power;Proportional control;Signal design","","265","2","24","IEEE","2 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using minimal congestion feedback signals from the routers, we present a class of algorithms that can be implemented at the sources to stably and optimally split the flow between each source-destination pair.

The idea is to extend the NMF algorithm in order to extract features that enforce not only the spatial locality, but also the separability between classes in a discriminant manner. The first method employs discriminant analysis in the features derived from NMF. In this way, a two-phase discriminant feature extraction procedure is implemented, namely NMF plus Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The second method incorporates the discriminant constraints inside the NMF decomposition. Thus, a decomposition of a face to its discriminant parts is obtained and new update rules for both the weights and the basis images are derived. The introduced methods have been applied to the problem of frontal face verification using the well-known XM2VTS database.

The state of the controller is reset to guarantee the stability requirement of the Lyapunov function when the switching event occurs. Two parameter-dependent switching logics, hysteresis switching and switching with average dwell time, are examined.

Each of these algorithms is tuned to a specific type of data distribution (that which best models the problem at hand). Unfortunately, in most problems the form of each class pdf is a priori unknown, and the selection of the DA algorithm that best fits our data is done over trial-and-error. Ideally, one would like to have a single formulation which can be used for most distribution types. This can be achieved by approximating the underlying distribution of each class with a mixture of Gaussians. In this approach, the major problem to be addressed is that of determining the optimal number of Gaussians per class, i.e., the number of subclasses. In this paper, two criteria able to find the most convenient division of each class into a set of subclasses are derived. Extensive experimental results are shown using five databases. Comparisons are given against linear discriminant analysis (LDA), direct LDA (DLDA), heteroscedastic LDA (HLDA), nonparametric DA (NDA), and kernel-based LDA (K-LDA).

FVC2004 was organized by the authors of this work for the purpose of assessing the state-of-the-art in this challenging pattern recognition application and making available a new common benchmark for an unambiguous comparison of fingerprint-based biometric systems. FVC2004 is an independent, strongly supervised evaluation performed at the evaluators' site on evaluators' hardware. This allowed the test to be completely controlled and the computation times of different algorithms to be fairly compared. The experience and feedback received from previous, similar competitions (FVC2000 and FVC2002) allowed us to improve the organization and methodology of FVC2004 and to capture the attention of a significantly higher number of academic and commercial organizations (67 algorithms were submitted for FVC2004). A new, ""light"" competition category was included to estimate the loss of matching performance caused by imposing computational constraints. This paper discusses data collection and testing protocols, and includes a detailed analysis of the results. We introduce a simple but effective method for comparing algorithms at the score level, allowing us to isolate difficult cases (images) and to study error correlations and algorithm ""fusion.""

In the proposed scheme, the duty ratio to all the converter modules connected in input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is made common. This scheme does not require a dedicated input-voltage or load-current-share controller. It relies on the inherent self-correcting characteristic of the ISOP connection when the duty ratio of all the converters is the same. The proposed scheme is analyzed using the average model of a forward converter. The stability and performance of the scheme are verified through numerical simulation, both in frequency domain and in time domain. The proposed control method is also validated on an experimental prototype ISOP system comprising of two forward converters.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2006.876064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1658341","Common duty ratio;fault tolerance;input series and output parallel (ISOP);input-series connection;input-voltage sharing;load-current sharing;modular dc–dc converters","Voltage control;DC-DC power converters;Low voltage;Multichip modules;MOSFETs;Stability;Numerical simulation;Frequency domain analysis;Control systems;Prototypes","","261","16","22","IEEE","17 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes an unsupervised data driven Bayesian clustering algorithm which has detection of individual entities as its primary goal. We track simple image features and probabilistically group them into clusters representing independently moving entities. The numbers of clusters and the grouping of constituent features are determined without supervised learning or any subject-specific model. The new approach is instead, that space-time proximity and trajectory coherence through image space are used as the only probabilistic criteria for clustering. An important contribution of this work is how these criteria are used to perform a one-shot data association without iterating through combinatorial hypotheses of cluster assignments. Our proposed general detection algorithm can be augmented with subject-specific filtering, but is shown to already be effective at detecting individual entities in crowds of people, insects, and animals.

We base our approach on a highly parallelized version of the KLT tracker in order to process the video into a set of feature trajectories. While such a set of trajectories provides a substrate for motion analysis, their unequal lengths and fragmented nature present difficulties for subsequent processing. To address this, we propose a simple means of spatially and temporally conditioning the trajectories.

The only assumption is that the image projection function can be described by a Taylor series expansion whose coefficients are estimated by solving a two-step least-squares linear minimization problem. To test the proposed technique, we calibrated a panoramic camera having a field of view greater than 200 in the vertical direction, and we obtained very good results. To investigate the accuracy of the calibration, we also used the estimated omni-camera model in a structure from motion experiment. We obtained a 3D metric reconstruction of a scene from two highly distorted omnidirectional images by using image correspondences only.

To extract a feature vector from the EMG signal, we use a wavelet packet transform that is a generalized version of wavelet transform. For dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping of the features, we also propose a linear-nonlinear feature projection composed of principal components analysis (PCA) and a self-organizing feature map (SOFM). The dimensionality reduction by PCA simplifies the structure of the classifier and reduces processing time for the pattern recognition. The nonlinear mapping by SOFM transforms the PCA-reduced features into a new feature space with high class separability. Finally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is used as the classifier. Using an analysis of class separability by feature projections, we show that the recognition accuracy depends more on the class separability of the projected features than on the MLP's class separation ability. Consequently, the proposed linear-nonlinear projection method improves class separability and recognition accuracy. We implement a real-time control system for a multifunction virtual hand. Our experimental results show that all processes, including virtual hand control, are completed within 125 ms, and the proposed method is applicable to real-time myoelectric hand control without an operational time delay","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.883695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1710164","EMG;linear-nonlinear feature projection;pattern recognition;principal components analysis;self-organizing feature map;wavelet packet transform","Real time systems;Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Principal component analysis;Wavelet packets;Wavelet transforms;Feature extraction;Multilayer perceptrons;Control systems;Delay effects","Action Potentials;Artificial Intelligence;Artificial Limbs;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Electromyography;Hand;Humans;Linear Models;Models, Biological;Muscle, Skeletal;Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Prosthesis Design;Robotics;User-Computer Interface","259","","17","IEEE","16 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such a relaying technique is termed relaying with Bi-directional Amplification of Throughput (BAT-relaying). The BAT-relaying is utilizing the concept of anti-packets, defined for bi-directional traffic flows. The relay node combines the anti-packets that are destined for different nodes and broadcasts the combined packet. Two BAT-relaying techniques have been proposed previously, Decode-and-Forward (DF) BAT-relaying and Amplify-and-Forward (AF) BAT-relaying. While in DF the relay node combines the packets by an XOR operation, AF BAT-relaying utilizes the inherent packet combining provided by the multiple access channel. In an errorless channel, AF has always higher achievable throughput than DF, but in noisy channels the noise amplification can severely degrade the performance of AF. In this paper we introduce a new scheme for BAT-relaying, termed Denoise-And-Forward (DNF) BAT-Relaying. The DNF BAT-relaying also makes use of the combining provided by the multiple access channel, but it removes the noise from the combined anti-packets before broadcasting to the destinations. While in the noiseless channel DNF and AF offer the same throughput performance which is superior to DF BAT-relaying, in large regions of the lower SNR values DNF BAT-relaying has the best throughput performance of all three schemes. Due to the unconventional nature of the BAT-relaying schemes, there are many open issues for further investigation. The design of a practical DNF scheme concerns several protocol layers, including modulation and coding.","1938-1883","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4025090","","Throughput;Spread spectrum communication;Relays;Bidirectional control;Telecommunication traffic;Broadcasting;Wireless networks;Decoding;Degradation;Signal to noise ratio","","259","5","8","IEEE","11 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the scheduling component in this optimal cross-layer congestion control scheme has to solve a complex global optimization problem at each time, and is hence too computationally expensive for online implementation. In this paper, we study how the performance of cross-layer congestion control will be impacted if the network can only use an imperfect (and potentially distributed) scheduling component that is easier to implement. We study both the case when the number of users in the system is fixed and the case with dynamic arrivals and departures of the users, and we establish performance bounds of cross-layer congestion control with imperfect scheduling. Compared with a layered approach that does not design congestion control and scheduling together, our cross-layer approach has provably better performance bounds,and substantially outperforms the layered approach. The insights drawn from our analyzes also enable us to design a fully distributed cross-layer congestion control and scheduling algorithm for a restrictive interference model.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2006.872546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1621109","Congestion control;cross-layer design;imperfect scheduling;mathematical programming/optimization;multihop wireless networks;stability;stochastic processes/queueing theory","Wireless networks;Processor scheduling;Optimal control;Algorithm design and analysis;Cross layer design;Spread spectrum communication;Resource management;Control systems;Dynamic scheduling;Distributed control","","258","1","31","IEEE","18 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that improved gait recognition can be achieved after normalization of dynamics and focusing on the shape information. We normalize for gait dynamics using a generic walking model, as captured by a population hidden Markov model (pHMM) defined for a set of individuals. The states of this pHMM represent gait stances over one gait cycle and the observations are the silhouettes of the corresponding gait stances. For each sequence, we first use Viterbi decoding of the gait dynamics to arrive at one dynamics-normalized, averaged, gait cycle of fixed length. The distance between two sequences is the distance between the two corresponding dynamics-normalized gait cycles, which we quantify by the sum of the distances between the corresponding gait stances. Distances between two silhouettes from the same generic gait stance are computed in the linear discriminant analysis space so as to maximize the discrimination between persons, while minimizing the variations of the same subject under different conditions. The distance computation is constructed so that it is invariant to dilations and erosions of the silhouettes. This helps us handle variations in silhouette shape that can occur with changing imaging conditions. We present results on three different, publicly available, data sets. First, we consider the HumanID gait challenge data set, which is the largest gait benchmarking data set that is available (122 subjects), exercising five different factors, i.e., viewpoint, shoe, surface, carrying condition, and time. We significantly improve the performance across the hard experiments involving surface change and briefcase carrying conditions. Second, we also show improved performance on the UMD gait data set that exercises time variations for 55 subjects. Third, on the CMU Mobo data set, we show results for matching across different walking speeds. It is worth noting that there was no separate training for the UMD and CMU data sets.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624352","Gait recognition;biometrics;LDA;gait shape;population HMM.","Legged locomotion;Shape;Biometrics;Hidden Markov models;Linear discriminant analysis;Viterbi algorithm;Decoding;Footwear;Computer displays;Computer vision","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Gait;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Markov Chains;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","258","1","32","IEEE","24 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed current-mode control method, the inductor current is sampled only once in a switching period. A compensating ramp is used in the modulator to determine the switching instant. The slope of the compensating ramp is determined analytically from the steady-state stability condition. The proposed digital current-mode control is not predictive, therefore the trajectory of the inductor current during the switching period is not estimated in this method, and as a result the computational burden on the digital controller is significantly reduced.

The core of the technique is a new likelihood ratio test that combines matched-filter responses, confidence measures and vessel boundary measures. Matched filter responses are derived in scale-space to extract vessels of widely varying widths. A vessel confidence measure is defined as a projection of a vector formed from a normalized pixel neighborhood onto a normalized ideal vessel profile. Vessel boundary measures and associated confidences are computed at potential vessel boundaries. Combined, these responses form a six-dimensional measurement vector at each pixel. A training technique is used to develop a mapping of this vector to a likelihood ratio that measures the ""vesselness"" at each pixel. Results comparing this vesselness measure to matched filters alone and to measures based on the Hessian of intensities show substantial improvements, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The Hessian can be used in place of the matched filter to obtain similar but less-substantial improvements or to steer the matched filter by preselecting kernel orientations. Finally, the new vesselness likelihood ratio is embedded into a vessel tracing framework, resulting in an efficient and effective vessel centerline extraction algorithm","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2006.884190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016172","Likelihood ratio;matched filters;retina images;vessel extraction;vessel tracing","Retinal vessels;Matched filters;Image edge detection;Retina;Image sequence analysis;Computer science;Pathology;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical filters;Optical sensors","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Fluorescein Angiography;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Retinal Vessels;Retinoscopy;Sensitivity and Specificity","257","11","72","IEEE","30 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These constraints impose conflicting design requirements on the engineer attempting to design an arm exoskeleton. In this paper, the authors present a detailed review of the requirements and constraints that are involved in the design of a high-quality haptic arm exoskeleton.

The review is historical in the sense that it follows the evolution of ideas in observer design in the last half century.

Geometric control of the ECs allowed mu and epsi to be tailored to the application. The magnetic metamaterial exhibited enhanced mu and epsi with acceptable loss-factor levels. Models for predicting mu and epsi are presented, the benefits of employing metamaterial substrates are discussed, and the results in this antenna experiment are presented.

Recent explorations into sub-threshold operation for logic show that minimum energy operation is possible in this region. These two trends suggest a meeting point for energy-constrained applications in which SRAM operates at sub-threshold voltages compatible with the logic. Since sub-threshold voltages leave less room for large static noise margin (SNM), a thorough understanding of the impact of various design decisions and other parameters becomes critical. This paper analyzes SNM for sub-threshold bitcells in a 65-nm process for its dependency on sizing, VDD, temperature, and local and global threshold variation.

Based on a geometrical optical model (Four-Scale) and LAI algorithms previously derived for Canada-wide applications, this paper presents a new algorithm for the global retrieval of LAI where the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is considered explicitly in the algorithm and hence removing the need of doing BRDF corrections and normalizations to the input images. The core problem of integrating BRDF into the LAI algorithm is that nonlinear BRDF kernels that are used to relate spectral reflectances to LAI are also LAI dependent, and no analytical solution is found to derive directly LAI from reflectance data. This problem is solved through developing a simple iteration procedure. The relationships between LAI and reflectances of various spectral bands (red, near infrared, and shortwave infrared) are simulated with Four-Scale with a multiple scattering scheme. Based on the model simulations, the key coefficients in the BRDF kernels are fitted with Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. Spectral indices - the simple ratio and the reduced simple ratio - are used to effectively combine the spectral bands for LAI retrieval. Example regional and global LAI maps are produced. Accuracy assessment on a Canada-wide LAI map is made in comparison with a previously validated 1998 LAI map and ground measurements made in seven Landsat scenes","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.872100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1661810","Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF);Chebyshev polynomials;geometrical optical (GO) model;leaf area index (LAI);lookup table (LUT)","Image retrieval;Satellites;Optical scattering;Kernel;Infrared spectra;Earth;Ecosystems;Geometrical optics;Nonlinear optics;Solid modeling","","252","","38","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the depth-independent interaction matrix makes the unknown camera parameters appear linearly in the closed-loop dynamics so that a new algorithm is developed to estimate their values on-line. This adaptive algorithm combines the Slotine-Li method with on-line minimization of the errors between the real and estimated projections of the feature points on the image plane.

The proposed system includes a reconfigurable rectangular spiral antenna with a set of micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) switches, which are monolithically integrated and packaged onto the same substrate. The system is based on a single-arm rectangular spiral antenna, capable of changing its radiation pattern using radio frequency-MEMS (RF-MEMS) switches. The rectangular spiral and RF-MEMS switches are monolithically integrated on a conventional microwave substrate printed circuit board (/spl epsiv//sub r/=3.27 and tan/spl delta/=0.004) and quartz substrate (/spl epsiv//sub r/=3.78 and tan/spl delta/=0.0002). The spiral is made out of multiple lines, which are interconnected by RF-MEMS switches strategically located along the spiral. On activating these switches, the spiral overall arm length is changed and consequently its radiation beam direction is changed. The two proposed antennas radiate right hand circular polarization (RHCP) and left hand circular polarization (LHCP) for printed circuit board and quartz substrate respectively. The gain of the two antennas varies between 3/spl sim/6 dBi. They both satisfy the 3-dB axial ratio criterion at their operating frequency band, i.e., at 10 GHz and 6 GHz for the printed circuit board and the quartz substrate respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first truly reconfigurable printed antenna design using MEMS devices as active elements integrated in the same low loss substrate. The excellent performance of the proposed system emphasizes the importance of being able to integrate MEMS switches into the same low loss substrate for antenna applications.

The paper considers the evaluation of the error probability of an OFDM system transmitting over channels characterized by frequency selectivity and Rayleigh fading. The time variations of the channel during one OFDM symbol interval destroy the orthogonality of the different subcarriers and generate power leakage among the subcarriers, known as inter-carrier interference (ICI). For conventional modulation methods such as phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM), the bivariate probability density function (pdf) of the ICI is shown to be a weighted Gaussian mixture. The large computational complexity involved in using the weighted Gaussian mixture pdf to evaluate the error probability serves as the motivation for developing a two-dimensional Gram-Charlier representation for the bivariate pdf of the ICI. It is demonstrated that its truncated version of order 4 or 6 provides a very good approximation in the evaluation of the error probability for PSK and QAM in the presence of ICI. Based on Jakes' model for the Doppler effects, and an exponential multipath intensity profile, numerical results for the error probability are illustrated for several mobile speeds.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2006.1638663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638663","","Degradation;Error probability;Digital video broadcasting;Phase shift keying;Phase modulation;OFDM modulation;Quadrature amplitude modulation;RF signals;Land mobile radio;Rayleigh channels","","249","7","24","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It also largely reduces computational complexity compared to a global bundle adjustment. Experiments on real data were carried out to evaluate speed and robustness of the method for a sequence of about one kilometer long.

It is difficult since often the decision for an edge cannot be made purely based on low level cues such as gradient, instead we need to engage all levels of information, low, middle, and high, in order to decide where to put edges. In this paper we propose a novel supervised learning algorithm for edge and object boundary detection which we refer to as Boosted Edge Learning or BEL for short. A decision of an edge point is made independently at each location in the image; a very large aperture is used providing significant context for each decision. In the learning stage, the algorithm selects and combines a large number of features across different scales in order to learn a discriminative model using an extended version of the Probabilistic Boosting Tree classification algorithm. The learning based framework is highly adaptive and there are no parameters to tune. We show applications for edge detection in a number of specific image domains as well as on natural images.

In this paper, we discuss a SAR image-registration procedure, based on the use of external measures which allows obtaining a very accurate alignment of SAR images. The presented technique makes use of a digital elevation model and of the precise information about the acquisition flight tracks, to compute the warping functions that map the position of each pixel in the different takes, thus avoiding any approximation. The resulting algorithm is simple, robust, precise, and very efficient; as a matter of fact, it may achieve high accuracy even in critical areas, such as steep topography regions. Moreover, the availability of an analytical and exact model allows performing a detailed sensitivity analysis that can be useful in evaluating the applicability of this technique even to future high-precision satellite systems.

It aims to improve driving safety and efficiency using appropriate motion scheduling of all the encountered vehicles. Under cooperative driving control, the motion of individual vehicles could be conducted in a safe, deterministic, and smooth manner. This is particularly useful to heavy-duty vehicles since their acceleration/deceleration capacity is relatively low. Specifically in this paper, cooperative driving at blind crossings (crossings without traffic lights) is studied. A concept of safety driving patterns is proposed to represent the collision-free movements of vehicles at crossings. The solution space of all allowable movement schedules is then described by a spanning tree in terms of safety driving patterns; four trajectory planning algorithms are formulated to determine the driving plans with least execution times using schedule trees. The group communication strategy for intervehicle networks is also analyzed. Finally, simulation studies have been conducted, and results demonstrate the potentiality and usefulness of the proposed algorithms for cooperative driving at blind crossings.

In this paper, we propose a fast and robust hybrid method of super-resolution and demosaicing, based on a maximum a posteriori estimation technique by minimizing a multiterm cost function. The L/sub 1/ norm is used for measuring the difference between the projected estimate of the high-resolution image and each low-resolution image, removing outliers in the data and errors due to possibly inaccurate motion estimation. Bilateral regularization is used for spatially regularizing the luminance component, resulting in sharp edges and forcing interpolation along the edges and not across them. Simultaneously, Tikhonov regularization is used to smooth the chrominance components. Finally, an additional regularization term is used to force similar edge location and orientation in different color channels. We show that the minimization of the total cost function is relatively easy and fast. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets confirm the effectiveness of our method.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2005.860336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556633","Color enhancement;demosaicing;image restoration;robust estimation;robust regularization;super-resolution","Image resolution;Color;Spatial resolution;Cost function;Motion estimation;Image restoration;Digital cameras;Robustness;Maximum a posteriori estimation;Motion measurement","Algorithms;Color;Colorimetry;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","246","187","44","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This new technique estimates DOAs by measuring the orthogonal relation between the signal and the noise subspaces of multiple frequency components of the sources. TOPS can be used with arbitrary shaped one-dimensional (1-D) or two-dimensional (2-D) arrays. Unlike other coherent wideband methods, such as the coherent signal subspace method (CSSM) and WAVES, the new method does not require any preprocessing for initial values. The performance of those wideband techniques and incoherent MUSIC is compared with that of the new method through computer simulations. The simulations show that this new technique performs better than others in mid signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges, while coherent methods work best in low SNR and incoherent methods work best in high SNR. Thus, TOPS fills a gap between coherent and incoherent methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.872581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634797","Array signal processing;direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;signal subspace method;wideband sources","Direction of arrival estimation;Wideband;Frequency estimation;Testing;Frequency measurement;Noise measurement;Multi-stage noise shaping;Two dimensional displays;Multiple signal classification;Computer simulation","","245","2","31","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a fault-tolerant detection scheme that explicitly introduces the sensor fault probability into the optimal event detection process. We mathematically show that the optimal detection error decreases exponentially with the increase of the neighborhood size.

We restrict ourselves to the class of lattice codes and formulate the joint detection and decoding problem as a closest lattice point search (CLPS). Here, a tree search framework for solving the CLPS is adopted. In our framework, the CLPS algorithm is decomposed into the preprocessing and tree search stages. The role of the preprocessing stage is to expose the tree structure in a form matched to the search stage. We argue that the forward and feedback (matrix) filters of the minimum mean-square error decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) are instrumental for solving the joint detection and decoding problem in a single search stage. It is further shown that MMSE-DFE filtering allows for solving underdetermined linear systems and using lattice reduction methods to diminish complexity, at the expense of a marginal performance loss. For the search stage, we present a generic method, based on the branch and bound (BB) algorithm, and show that it encompasses all existing sphere decoders as special cases. The proposed generic algorithm further allows for an interesting classification of tree search decoders, sheds more light on the structural properties of all known sphere decoders, and inspires the design of more efficient decoders. In particular, an efficient decoding algorithm that resembles the well-known Fano sequential decoder is identified. The excellent performance-complexity tradeoff achieved by the proposed MMSE-DFE Fano decoder is established via simulation results and analytical arguments in several multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and intersymbol interference (ISI) scenarios.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.864418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1603763","Closest lattice point search (CLPS);Fano decoder;lattice codes;sequential decoding;sphere decoding;tree search","Decoding;Lattices;MIMO;Intersymbol interference;Gaussian channels;Tree data structures;Matrix decomposition;Filters;Decision feedback equalizers;Instruments","","245","22","55","IEEE","6 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the assumption that all the sensors have the same detection performance and the same channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we show that when the channel SNR is low, this fusion rule reduces to a statistic in the form of an equal gain combiner (EGC), which explains why EGC is a very good choice with low or medium SNR; at high-channel SNR, it is equivalent to the Chair-Varshney fusion rule.

Stability of the results across different runs is considered to be an asset of the algorithm. The cluster ensembles considered here are based on k-means clusterers. Each clusterer is assigned a random target number of clusters, k and is started from a random initialization. Here, we use 10 artificial and 10 real data sets to study ensemble stability with respect to random k, and random initialization. The data sets were chosen to have a small number of clusters (two to seven) and a moderate number of data points (up to a few hundred). Pairwise stability is defined as the adjusted Rand index between pairs of clusterers in the ensemble, averaged across all pairs. Nonpairwise stability is defined as the entropy of the consensus matrix of the ensemble. An experimental comparison with the stability of the standard k-means algorithm was carried out for k from 2 to 20. The results revealed that ensembles are generally more stable, markedly so for larger k. To establish whether stability can serve as a cluster validity index, we first looked at the relationship between stability and accuracy with respect to the number of clusters, k. We found that such a relationship strongly depends on the data set, varying from almost perfect positive correlation (0.97, for the glass data) to almost perfect negative correlation (-0.93, for the crabs data). We propose a new combined stability index to be the sum of the pairwise individual and ensemble stabilities. This index was found to correlate better with the ensemble accuracy. Following the hypothesis that a point of stability of a clustering algorithm corresponds to a structure found in the data, we used the stability measures to pick the number of clusters.

The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2005.860885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593693","Genetic algorithm (GA);neural networks (NN);Taguchi method","Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Artificial neural networks;Genetic algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Genetic mutations;Robustness;Associative memory;Costs;Performance evaluation","Algorithms;Genetics;Memory;Neural Networks (Computer);Solar Activity","243","","41","IEEE","13 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we introduce the notion of a neighborhood structure for the general point matching problem. We formulate point matching as an optimization problem to preserve local neighborhood structures during matching. Our approach has a simple graph matching interpretation, where each point is a node in the graph, and two nodes are connected by an edge if they are neighbors. The optimal match between two graphs is the one that maximizes the number of matched edges. Existing techniques are leveraged to search for an optimal solution with the shape context distance used to initialize the graph matching, followed by relaxation labeling updates for refinement. Extensive experiments show the robustness of our approach under deformation, noise in point locations, outliers, occlusion, and rotation.

Initially, SoCs will be globally asynchronous and locally synchronous (GALS). But the complexity of the numerous asynchronous/synchronous interfaces required in a GALS will eventually lead to entirely asynchronous solutions. This paper introduces the main design principles, methods, and building blocks for asynchronous VLSI systems, with an emphasis on communication and synchronization. Asynchronous circuits with the only delay assumption of isochronic forks are called quasi-delay-insensitive (QDI). QDI is used in the paper as the basis for asynchronous logic. The paper discusses asynchronous handshake protocols for communication and the notion of validity/neutrality tests, and completion tree.

One such representation that has been frequently used in the past are elevation maps which store in each cell of a discrete grid the height of the surface in the corresponding area. Whereas elevation maps provide a compact representation, they lack the ability to represent vertical structures or even multiple levels. In this paper, we propose a new representation denoted as multi-level surface maps (MLS maps). Our approach allows to store multiple surfaces in each cell of the grid. This enables a mobile robot to model environments with structures like bridges, underpasses, buildings or mines. Additionally, they allow to represent vertical structures. Throughout this paper we present algorithms for updating these maps based on sensory input, to match maps calculated from two different scans, and to solve the loop-closing problem given such maps. Experiments carried out with a real robot in an outdoor environment demonstrate that our approach is well-suited for representing large-scale outdoor environments","2153-0866","1-4244-0258-1","10.1109/IROS.2006.282632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4058725","","Terrain mapping;Mobile robots;Data structures;Path planning;Multilevel systems;Bridges;Buildings;Impedance matching;Robot sensing systems;Large-scale systems","","241","7","31","IEEE","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first challenging task of this approach is to estimate precisely the unknown mixing matrix. In this paper, an algorithm for estimating the mixing matrix that can be viewed as an extension of the DUET and the TIFROM methods is first developed. Standard clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means method) also can be used for estimating the mixing matrix if the sources are sufficiently sparse. Compared with the DUET, the TIFROM methods, and standard clustering algorithms, with the authors' proposed method, a broader class of problems can be solved, because the required key condition on sparsity of the sources can be considerably relaxed. The second task of the two-stage approach is to estimate the source matrix using a standard linear programming algorithm. Another main contribution of the work described in this paper is the development of a recoverability analysis. After extending the results in , a necessary and sufficient condition for recoverability of a source vector is obtained. Based on this condition and various types of source sparsity, several probability inequalities and probability estimates for the recoverability issue are established. Finally, simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results are presented.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.861743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576973","Blind source separation (BSS);probability;recoverability;sparse representation;wavelet packets","Blind source separation;Source separation;Sparse matrices;Clustering algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Linear programming;Signal processing;Dictionaries;Independent component analysis;Sufficient conditions","","240","10","19","IEEE","16 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem has been traditionally addressed through the maximum-likelihood framework or nonlinear least squares. These methods, even though asymptotically optimal under certain conditions, pose a difficult global optimization problem. It is shown that the associated objective function may have multiple local optima and saddle points, and hence any local search method might stagnate at a suboptimal solution. In this correspondence, we formulate the problem as a convex feasibility problem and apply a distributed version of the projection-onto-convex-sets (POCS) method. We give a closed-form expression for the projection phase, which usually constitutes the heaviest computational aspect of POCS. Conditions are given under which, when the number of samples increases to infinity or in the absence of measurement noise, the convex feasibility problem has a unique solution at the true source location. In general, the method converges to a limit point or a limit cycle in the neighborhood of the true location.

Software security has come a long way in the last few years, but we've really only just begun. I will present a detailed approach to getting past theory and putting software security into practice. The three pillars of software security are applied risk management, software security best practices (which I call touchpoints), and knowledge. By describing a manageably small set of touchpoints based around the software artifacts that you already produce, I avoid religious warfare over process and get on with the business of software security. That means you can adopt the touchpoints without radically changing the way you work. The touchpoints I will describe include: code review using static analysis tools; architectural risk analysis; penetration testing; security testing; abuse case development; and security requirements. Like the yin and the yang, software security requires a careful balance-attack and defense, exploiting and designing, breaking and building-bound into a coherent package.

Our gaze model integrates data collected from a human storyteller and a discourse structure model developed by Cassell and her colleagues for human-like conversational agents (1994). We used this model to direct the gaze of a humanoid robot, Honda's ASIMO, as he recited a Japanese fairy tale using a pre-recorded human voice. We assessed the efficacy of this gaze algorithm by manipulating the frequency of ASIMO's gaze between two participants and used pre and post questionnaires to assess whether participants evaluated the robot more positively and did better on a recall task when ASIMO looked at them more. We found that participants performed significantly better in recalling ASIMO's story when the robot looked at them more. Our results also showed significant differences in how men and women evaluated ASIMO based on the frequency of gaze they received from the robot.

However, they never received a proper formal semantics, which is the hallmark of precision and unambiguity as well as a prerequisite for efficient and safe tool automation, In this paper, we first survey FD variants. Subsequently, we generalize the various syntaxes through a generic construction called free feature diagrams (FFD). Formal semantics is defined at the FFD level, which provides unambiguous definition for ail the surveyed FD variants in one shot. All formalisation choices found a clear answer in the original FODA FD definition, which proved that although informal and scattered throughout many pages, it suffered no ambiguity problem. Our definition has several additional advantages: it is formal, concise and generic.

This paper investigates the PPI based on limited published results and proposes a fast iterative algorithm to implement the PPI, referred to as fast iterative PPI (FIPPI). It improves the PPI in several aspects. Instead of using randomly generated vectors as initial endmembers, the FIPPI produces an appropriate initial set of endmembers to speed up its process. Additionally, it estimates the number of endmembers required to be generated by a recently developed concept, virtual dimensionality (VD) which is one of the most crucial issues in the implementation of PPI. Furthermore, it is an iterative algorithm, where an iterative rule is developed to improve each of the iterations until it reaches a final set of endmembers. Most importantly, it is an unsupervised algorithm as opposed to the PPI, which requires human intervention to manually select a final set of endmembers. The experiments show that both the FIPPI and the PPI produce very close results, but the FIPPI converges very rapidly with significant savings in computation.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2005.856701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1576691","Automatic target generation process (ATGP);endmember extraction algorithm (EEA);endmember pixel;fast iterative pixel purity index (FIPPI);pixel purity index (PPI);virtual dimensionality (VD)","Iterative algorithms;Hyperspectral imaging;Indexes;Pixel;Image analysis;Humans;Hyperspectral sensors;Computer science;Availability;Visualization","","236","1","10","IEEE","16 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Redundancy within a sensor network can be exploited to reduce the communication cost incurred in execution of such queries. Any reduction in communication cost would result in an efficient use of the battery energy, which is very limited in sensors. One approach to reduce the communication cost of a query is to self-organize the network, in response to a query, into a topology that involves only a small subset of the sensors sufficient to process the query. The query is then executed using only the sensors in the constructed topology. The self-organization technique is beneficial for queries that run sufficiently long to amortize the communication cost incurred in self-organization. In this paper, we design and analyze algorithms for suchself-organization of a sensor network to reduce energy consumption. In particular, we develop the notion of a connected sensor cover and design a centralized approximation algorithm that constructs a topology involving a near-optimal connected sensor cover. We prove that the size of the constructed topology is within an O(logn) factor of the optimal size, where n is the network size. We develop a distributed self-organization version of the approximation algorithm, and propose several optimizations to reduce the communication overhead of the algorithm. We also design another distributed algorithm based on node priorities that has a further lower communication overhead, but does not provide any guarantee on the size of the connected sensor cover constructed. Finally, we evaluate the distributed algorithms using simulations and show that our approaches results in significant communication cost reductions.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2005.863478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597223","Connected sensor cover;query optimization;sensor connectivity;sensor coverage;sensor networks","Network topology;Magnetic sensors;Costs;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Batteries;Distributed algorithms;Computer networks;Temperature sensors","","235","","33","IEEE","21 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hardware utilization and throughput are also decreased because of the block/MB/frame-level reconstruction loops.

The key idea underlying ISCOD is the joint exploitation of the data blocks already cached by each client, the server's full knowledge of client-cache contents and client requests, and the fact that each client only needs to be able to derive the blocks requested by it rather than all the blocks ever transmitted or even the union of the blocks requested by the different clients. We present two-phase ISCOD algorithms: the server first creates ad-hoc error-correction sets based on its knowledge of client states; next, it uses erasure-correction codes to construct the data for transmission. Each client uses its cached data and the received supplemental data to derive its requested blocks. The result is up to a several-fold reduction in the amount of transmitted supplemental data.

This paper considers the design of optimal infinite-horizon control for context-sensitive probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs). It can also be applied to instantaneously random PBNs. The stationary policy obtained is independent of time and dependent on the current state. This paper concentrates on discounted problems with bounded cost per stage and on average-cost-per-stage problems. These formulations are used to generate stationary policies for a PBN constructed from melanoma gene-expression data. The results show that the stationary policies obtained by the two different formulations are capable of shifting the probability mass of the stationary distribution from undesirable states to desirable ones.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.873740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634840","Altering steady state;genetic network intervention;infinite-horizon control;optimal control of probabilistic Boolean networks","Optimal control;Steady-state;Cost function;Diseases;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Genetics;Malignant tumors;Medical treatment;Pathology","","234","","14","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It would be valuable to know how object-oriented design metrics and class fault-proneness are related when fault severity is taken into account. In this paper, we use logistic regression and machine learning methods to empirically investigate the usefulness of object-oriented design metrics, specifically, a subset of the Chidamber and Kemerer suite, in predicting fault-proneness when taking fault severity into account. Our results, based on a public domain NASA data set, indicate that 1) most of these design metrics are statistically related to fault-proneness of classes across fault severity, and 2) the prediction capabilities of the investigated metrics greatly depend on the severity of faults. More specifically, these design metrics are able to predict low severity faults in fault-prone classes better than high severity faults in fault-prone classes.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2006.102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717471","Object-oriented;faults;fault-proneness;metrics;prediction;cross validation.","Object oriented modeling;Predictive models;Logistics;Learning systems;NASA;Computer Society;Software systems;Fault detection;Decision making;Programming","","234","","31","IEEE","30 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The only assumptions we make about the system are well-posedness of the algebraic loop and local stability. Problems to be considered include the estimation of the domain of attraction, the reachable set under a class of bounded energy disturbances and the nonlinear L2 gain. The regional analysis is established through an effective treatment of the algebraic loop and the saturation/deadzone function. This treatment yields two forms of differential inclusions, a polytopic differential inclusion (PDI) and a norm-bounded differential inclusion (NDI) that contain the original system. Adjustable parameters are incorporated into the differential inclusions to reflect the regional property. The main idea behind the regional analysis is to ensure that the state remain inside the level set of a certain Lyapunov function where the PDI or the NDI is valid. With quadratic Lyapunov functions, conditions for stability and performances are derived as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). To obtain less conservative conditions, we use a pair of conjugate non-quadratic Lyapunov functions, the convex hull quadratic function and the max quadratic function. These functions yield bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) as conditions for stability and guaranteed performance level. The BMI conditions cover the corresponding LMI conditions as special cases, hence the BMI results are guaranteed to be as good as the LMI results. In most examples, the BMI results are significantly better than the LMI results","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2006.884942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4012326","Deadzone;domain of attraction;Lyapunov functions;nonlinear  ${\cal L}_{2}$ gain;reachable set;saturation","Lyapunov method;Control systems;Linear matrix inequalities;Actuators;Design optimization;Stability analysis;Performance analysis;Feedback;Level set;Sensor systems","","234","","55","IEEE","13 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first use a wide-baseline matching technique based on SIFT features to select the closest views in the database. Often due to a large change of viewpoint and presence of repetitive structures, a large percentage of matches (> 50%) are not correct correspondences. The subsequent motion estimation between the query view and the reference view, is then handled by a novel and efficient robust estimation technique capable of dealing with large percentage of outliers. This stage is also accompanied by a model selection step among the fundamental matrix and the homography. Once the motion between the closest reference views is estimated, the location of the query view is then obtained by triangulation of translation directions. Approximate solutions for cases when triangulation cannot be obtained reliably are also described.

We are developing a face recognition system that utilizes three-dimensional shape information to make the system more robust to arbitrary pose and lighting. For each subject, a 3D face model is constructed by integrating several 2.5D face scans which are captured from different views. 2.5D is a simplified 3D (x,y,z) surface representation that contains at most one depth value (z direction) for every point in the (x, y) plane. Two different modalities provided by the facial scan, namely, shape and texture, are utilized and integrated for face matching. The recognition engine consists of two components, surface matching and appearance-based matching. The surface matching component is based on a modified iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The candidate list from the gallery used for appearance matching is dynamically generated based on the output of the surface matching component, which reduces the complexity of the appearance-based matching stage. Three-dimensional models in the gallery are used to synthesize new appearance samples with pose and illumination variations and the synthesized face images are used in discriminant subspace analysis. The weighted sum rule is applied to combine the scores given by the two matching components. Experimental results are given for matching a database of 200 3D face models with 598 2.5D independent test scans acquired under different pose and some lighting and expression changes. These results show the feasibility of the proposed matching scheme.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542029","Index Terms- Face recognition;3D model;multimodal;surface matching;appearance-based.","Face recognition;Shape;Robustness;Engines;Iterative closest point algorithm;Iterative algorithms;Image matching;Lighting;Image analysis;Independent component analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Face;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photogrammetry;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","233","1","52","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following this line of research, the paper investigates an extension of such basic approaches, where the identification of different variants for the process is explicitly accounted for, based on the clustering of log traces. Indeed, modeling each group of similar executions with a different schema allows us to single out ""conformant"" models, which, specifically, minimize the number of modeled enactments that are extraneous to the process semantics. Therefore, a novel process mining framework is introduced and some relevant computational issues are deeply studied. As finding an exact solution to such an enhanced process mining problem is proven to require high computational costs, in most practical cases, a greedy approach is devised. This is founded on an iterative, hierarchical, refinement of the process model, where, at each step, traces sharing similar behavior patterns are clustered together and equipped with a specialized schema. The algorithm guarantees that each refinement leads to an increasingly sound mDdel, thus attaining a monotonic search. Experimental results evidence the validity of the approach with respect to both effectiveness and scalability.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644726","Process mining;data mining;workflow management;clustering;classification;association rules.","Companies;Data mining;Management information systems;Customer relationship management;Supply chain management;Enterprise resource planning;Computer Society;Computational efficiency;Clustering algorithms;Iterative algorithms","","233","2","20","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Faces are located using a spatial ratio template tracker algorithm. Optical flow of the face is subsequently determined using a real-time implementation of a robust gradient model. The expression recognition system then averages facial velocity information over identified regions of the face and cancels out rigid head motion by taking ratios of this averaged motion. The motion signatures produced are then classified using Support Vector Machines as either nonexpressive or as one of the six basic emotions.

However, all currently available systems impose substantial constraints on subject position and motion during the recognition process. These constraints are largely driven by the image acquisition process, rather than the particular pattern-matching algorithm used for the recognition process. In this paper we present results of our efforts to substantially reduce constraints on position and motion by means of a new image acquisition system based on high-resolution cameras, video synchronized strobed illumination, and specularity based image segmentation.

The technique is based on loading a slot antenna with a lumped capacitor (or varactor) at a certain location along the slot.

However, the changes in the resonant frequencies are significantly different for the first and second resonances and, hence, a dual-band antenna with considerable frequency ratio tuning range can be obtained. Based on this technique, an electronically tunable dual-band antenna with a frequency ratio in the range of 1.2-1.65 is designed and fabricated using a single varactor with a capacitance range of 0.5-2.2 pF.

However, these codes are instances of single-symbol decodable codes and it is natural to ask, if there exist codes other than STBCs form ODs and CIODs that allow single-symbol decoding? In this paper, the above question is answered in the affirmative by characterizing all linear STBCs, that allow single-symbol ML decoding (not necessarily full-diversity) over quasi-static fading channels-calling them single-symbol decodable designs (SDD). The class SDD includes ODs and CIODs as proper subclasses. Further, among the SDD, a class of those that offer full-diversity, called Full-rank SDD (FSDD) are characterized and classified. We then concentrate on square designs and derive the maximal rate for square FSDDs using a constructional proof. It follows that 1) except for N=2, square complex ODs are not maximal rate and 2) a rate one square FSDD exist only for two and four transmit antennas. For nonsquare designs, generalized coordinate-interleaved orthogonal designs (a superset of CIODs) are presented and analyzed. Finally, for rapid-fading channels an equivalent matrix channel representation is developed, which allows the results of quasi-static fading channels to be applied to rapid-fading channels. Using this representation we show that for rapid-fading channels the rate of single-symbol decodable STBCs are independent of the number of transmit antennas and inversely proportional to the block-length of the code. Significantly, the CIOD for two transmit antennas is the only STBC that is single-symbol decodable over both quasi-static and rapid-fading channels.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.872970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624641","Diversity;fast ML decoding;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);orthogonal designs;space–time block codes (STBCs)","Maximum likelihood decoding;Fading;MIMO;Block codes;Transmitting antennas;Digital modulation;Modulation coding;Convolutional codes;Councils;Conferences","","230","2","65","IEEE","24 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional electronics are based on the charge of the electron. Attempts to use the other fundamental property of an electron, its spin, have given rise to a new, rapidly evolving field, known as spintronics, an acronym for spin transport electronics that was first introduced in 1996 to designate a program of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Initially, the spintronics program involved overseeing the development of advanced magnetic memory and sensors based on spin transport electronics. It was then expanded to included Spins IN Semiconductors (SPINS), in the hope of developing a new paradigm in semiconductor electronics based on the spin degree of freedom of the electron. Studies of spin-polarized transport in bulk and low-dimensional semiconductor structures show promise for the creation of a hybrid device that would combine magnetic storage with gain—in effect, a spin memory transistor. This paper reviews some of the major developments in this field and provides a perspective of what we think will be the future of this exciting field.

The analysis of the one-dimensional (1-D) version of such a LWA excited by a line source shows that a central role in establishing the features of broadside radiation is played by the condition that the phase and attenuation constants of the leaky mode responsible for radiation are equal. When this happens, a beam with a single peak at broadside is on the verge of splitting into two distinct peaks, and maximum power density is radiated at broadside. Design formulas to achieve such an optimized condition, as well as approximate expressions for the frequency bandwidth and pattern beamwidth of the antenna and for the leaky-wave phase and attenuation constants are derived, both in the absence and in the presence of losses; in addition, an optimal-beamwidth condition (which gives the narrowest broadside beam) is derived.

As a basic example, nodes have to forward packets for each other in order to enable multihop communication. In recent years, incentive mechanisms have been proposed to give nodes incentive to cooperate, especially in packet forwarding. However, the need for these mechanisms was not formally justified. In this paper, we address the problem of whether cooperation can exist without incentive mechanisms. We propose a model,based on game theory and graph theory to investigate equilibrium conditions of packet forwarding strategies. We prove theorems about the equilibrium conditions for both cooperative and noncooperative strategies. We perform simulations to estimate the probability that the conditions for a cooperative equilibrium hold in randomly generated network scenarios.. As the problem is involved, we deliberately restrict ourselves to a static configuration. We conclude that in static ad hoc networks where the relationships between the nodes are likely to be stab le-cooperation needs to be encouraged.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2006.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610590","Ad hoc networks;cooperation;graph theory;game theory;Nash equilibrium.","Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Game theory;Network topology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Spread spectrum communication;Graph theory;Nash equilibrium;Microwave integrated circuits","","228","","27","IEEE","27 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose the use of nodal pricing that is often used in the pricing of short-term operations in transmission. As an economically efficient mechanism, nodal pricing would properly reward DG for reducing line losses through increased revenues at nodal prices and signal prospective DG where it ought to connect with the distribution network. Applying nodal pricing to a model distribution network, we show significant price differences between buses reflecting high marginal losses. Moreover, we show the contribution of a DG resource located at the end of the network to significant reductions in losses and line loading. We also show the DG resource has significantly greater revenue under nodal pricing, reflecting its contribution to reduced line losses and loading.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2006.873006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1626413","Distributed generation (DG);distribution networks;loss allocations;nodal pricing","Pricing;Reactive power;Power generation;Distributed control;Power generation economics;Costs;Electricity supply industry;Voltage;Intelligent networks;Power system economics","","227","4","4","IEEE","1 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the double-sideband signals at the transmitter output can be in quadrature by choosing a proper frequency separation to relieve the severe null point problem that occurs at high frequency. As a result,the detection accuracy is significantly improved with low transmitted power.

However, factors affecting alignment have received relatively little empirical attention. Moreover, IS strategic alignment is assumed to facilitate the performance of all organizations, regardless of type or business strategy. By using two studies of business firms and academic institutions, this paper: 1) develops and tests a model relating alignment, its antecedents, and its consequences and 2) examines differences in these relationships across organizational types and strategies. Findings indicate that alignment depends on shared domain knowledge and prior IS success, and also support the expected positive impact of alignment on organizational performance. Differences across Prospector, Analyzer, and Defender business strategies are examined. A key research contribution is the empirical demonstration that the importance of alignment, as well as the mechanisms used to attain alignment, vary by business strategy and industry. In past alignment studies, controlling for industry has not been uncommon. The findings suggest that future research studies should also control for business strategy. The article also empirically demonstrates that past implementation success influences alignment. In addition, it highlights the influence of a process variable, strategic planning, on the development of shared knowledge and, consequently, on alignment. This paper examines strategic issues related to the management of technology. Data from multiple surveys are used to test the extent to which strategic planning, shared business-IS knowledge, prior IS success, and other variables consistently enhance IS alignment. The study also provides empirical support for the popular argument that IS alignment improves organizational performance. It extends the current literature by examining the extent to which these findings hold across firm strategies and industries. The authors argue that not all firms are equally well served by allocating scarce resources to improve IS alignment.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2005.861804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580892","Academic institutions;antecedents of alignment;business strategy;information systems strategy;organizational characteristics;organizational performance;strategic alignment","Business data processing;Information systems;Strategic planning","","227","","63","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior work shows that information flow tracking (also referred to as taint analysis) is a promising technique to detect a wide range of security attacks. However, current information flow tracking systems are not very practical, because they either require program annotations, source code, non-trivial hardware extensions, or incur prohibitive runtime overheads. This paper proposes a low overhead, software-only information flow tracking system, called LIFT, which minimizes run-time overhead by exploiting dynamic binary instrumentation and optimizations/or detecting various types of security attacks without requiring any hardware changes. More specifically, LIFT aggressively eliminates unnecessary dynamic information flow tracking, coalesces information checks, and efficiently switches between target programs and instrumented information flow tracking code. We have implemented LIFT on a dynamic binary instrumentation framework on Windows. Our real-system experiments with two real-world server applications, one client application and eighteen attack benchmarks show that LIFT can effectively detect various types of security attacks. LIFT also incurs very low overhead, only 6.2% for server applications, and 3.6 times on average for seven SPEC INT2000 applications. Our dynamic optimizations are very effective in reducing the overhead by a factor of 5-12 times","2379-3155","0-7695-2732-9","10.1109/MICRO.2006.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041842","","Information security;Target tracking;Switches;Instruments;Software tools;Computer security;Hardware;Runtime;Application software;Computer crime","","225","9","42","IEEE","26 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the area of data mining, there have been increased interest in these issues since outlier detection is related to fraud detection, rare event discovery, etc., while change-point detection is related to event/trend change detection, activity monitoring, etc. Although, in most previous work, outlier detection and change point detection have not been related explicitly, this paper presents a unifying framework for dealing with both of them. In this framework, a probabilistic model of time series is incrementally learned using an online discounting learning algorithm, which can track a drifting data source adaptively by forgetting out-of-date statistics gradually. A score for any given data is calculated in terms of its deviation from the learned model, with a higher score indicating a high possibility of being an outlier. By taking an average of the scores over a window of a fixed length and sliding the window, we may obtain a new time series consisting of moving-averaged scores. Change point detection is then reduced to the issue of detecting outliers in that time series. We compare the performance of our framework with those of conventional methods to demonstrate its validity through simulation and experimental applications to incidents detection in network security.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.1599387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1599387","Time series;change point;data mining;network security;AR model.","Event detection;Data mining;Statistics;Monitoring;Change detection algorithms;Data security;Intrusion detection;Histograms","","225","9","20","IEEE","27 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the three-cell FCMI, four levels of operation are expected if the traditional ratio of the capacitor voltages is 1:2:3. However, by altering the ratio, the inverter can operate as a five-, six-, seven-, or eight-level inverter. According to previous research, the eight-level case is referred to as maximally distended (or full binary combination schema) since it utilizes all possible transistor switching states. However, this case does not have enough per-phase redundancy to ensure capacitor voltage balancing under all modes of operation. In this paper, redundancy involving all phases is used along with per-phase redundancy to improve capacitor voltage balancing. It is shown that the four- and five-level cases are suitable for motor drive operation and can maintain capacitor voltage balance under a wide range of power factors and modulation indices. The six-, seven-, and eight-level cases are suitable for reactive power transfer in applications such as static var compensation.

Yet, in the context of tracking deformable objects, it is clear that certain silhouettes (such as those of a walking person) may become more or less likely over time. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of learning dynamical statistical models for implicitly represented shapes. We show how these can be integrated as dynamical shape priors in a Bayesian framework for level set-based image sequence segmentation. We assess the effect of such shape priors ""with memory"" on the tracking of familiar deformable objects in the presence of noise and occlusion. We show comparisons between dynamical and static shape priors, between models of pure deformation and joint models of deformation and transformation, and we quantitatively evaluate the segmentation accuracy as a function of the noise level and of the camera frame rate.

The idea is to start with a set of images and make them appear as similar as possible by removing variability along the known axes of variation. This technique can be used to eliminate ""nuisance"" variables such as affine deformations from handwritten digits or unwanted bias fields from magnetic resonance images. In addition to separating and modeling the latent images - i.e., the images without the nuisance variables - we can model the nuisance variables themselves, leading to factorized generative image models. When nuisance variable distributions are shared between classes, one can share the knowledge learned in one task with another task, leading to efficient learning. We demonstrate this process by building a handwritten digit classifier from just a single example of each class. In addition to applications in handwritten character recognition, we describe in detail the application of bias removal from magnetic resonance images. Unlike previous methods, we use a separate, nonparametric model for the intensity values at each pixel. This allows us to leverage the data from the MR images of different patients to remove bias from each other. Only very weak assumptions are made about the distributions of intensity values in the images. In addition to the digit and MR applications, we discuss a number of other uses of congealing and describe experiments about the robustness and consistency of the method.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561183","Index Terms- Alignment;artifact removal;bias removal;congealing;clustering;correspondence;density estimation;entropy;maximum likelihood;medical imaging;magnetic resonance imaging;nonparametric statistics;registration;unsupervised learning.","Computer vision;Handwriting recognition;Magnetic resonance;Robustness;Statistics;Image generation;Character recognition;Entropy;Maximum likelihood estimation;Biomedical imaging","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Computer Simulation;Documentation;Handwriting;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Subtraction Technique","224","3","22","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Much past work has examined microarchitectural policies for reducing total chip power, but these techniques alone are insufficient if not aimed at mitigating individual hotspots. The industry's trend has been toward multicore architectures, which provide additional opportunities for dynamic thermal management. This paper explores various thermal management techniques that exploit the distributed nature of multicore processors. We classify these techniques in terms of core throttling policy, whether that policy is applied locally to a core or to the processor as a whole, and process migration policies. We use Turandot and a HotSpot-based thermal simulator to simulate a variety of workloads under thermal duress on a 4-core PowerPCtrade processor. Using benchmarks from the SPEC 2000 suite we characterize workloads in terms of instruction throughput as well as their effective duty cycles. Among a variety of options we find that distributed control-theoretic DVFS alone improves throughput by 2.5times under our test conditions.

In this paper, a stochastic degradation modeling framework is developed for computing and continuously updating residual life distributions of partially degraded components. The proposed degradation methodology combines population-specific degradation characteristics with component-specific sensory data acquired through condition monitoring in order to compute and continuously update remaining life distributions of partially degraded components. Two sensory updating procedures are developed and validated using real-world vibration-based degradation information acquired from rolling element thrust bearings. The results are compared with two benchmark policies and illustrate the benefits of the sensory updated degradation models proposed in this paper. Note for Practitioners-The proposed degradation-based prognostic methodology provides a comprehensive assessment of the current and future degradation states of partially degraded components by combining population-specific degradation or reliability information with real-time sensory health monitoring data. It is specifically beneficial for cases where degradation occurs in a cumulative manner and the degradation signal can be approximated by an exponential functional form. To implement this methodology, it is necessary: 1) to identify the physical phenomena associated with the evolution of the degradation process (spalling and wear herein); 2) choose the appropriate condition monitoring technology to monitor this phenomena (accelerometers); 3) identify a characteristic pattern in the sensory information to help develop a degradation signal (exponential growth); and 4) identify a failure threshold associated with the degradation signal. The first step in implementing this prognostic methodology is to obtain prior information related to stochastic parameters f the exponential model. This may require fitting some sample degradation signals with an exponential functional form and noting the values of the exponential parameters, or using subjective prior distributions. The second step is to acquire sensory information and begin updating the prior distribution. The updating frequency will dictate which expressions are used to compute the posterior distributions. Once the posterior means, variances, and correlation are computed, the truncated CDF of the residual life can be evaluated using (10) and (11). Note that the truncation is necessary to preclude negative values of the remaining life. Practitioners can implement this methodology using a simple spreadsheet. Since the residual life distributions are skewed, it is reasonable to utilize the median as a measure of the central tendency and, hence, an alternative estimate for the expected value of the remaining life","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2006.876609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1707956","Prediction methods;prognostics;reliability;stochastic processes","Degradation;Distributed computing;Condition monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Stochastic processes;Signal processing;Computer network management;Appropriate technology;Accelerometers;Fitting","","223","2","32","IEEE","9 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the popular gradient-based learning algorithms cannot be directly used to train these networks as the threshold functions are nondifferentiable. Methods available in the literature mainly focus on approximating the threshold activation functions by using sigmoid functions. In this paper, we show theoretically that the recently developed extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm can be used to train the neural networks with threshold functions directly instead of approximating them with sigmoid functions. Experimental results based on real-world benchmark regression problems demonstrate that the generalization performance obtained by ELM is better than other algorithms used in threshold networks. Also, the ELM method does not need control variables (manually tuned parameters) and is much faster.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2005.857540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605431","Extreme learning machine (ELM);gradient descent method;threshold neural networks","Neural networks;Neurons;Machine learning;Learning systems;Neural network hardware;Analog computers;Computer networks;Process control;Computational efficiency;System-on-a-chip","","223","","13","IEEE","13 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding.

A supergradient algorithm is then used in conjunction with a recently developed decentralized algorithm for eigenvector computation to maximize the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the proximity graph. A potential based control law is utilized to achieve the distances dictated by the supergradient algorithm.

The control scheme consists of a synchronous frame decoupling current controller, MTPA torque controller, and adaptive parameter estimator. The estimator is applied to the q-axis current dynamics as the d-axis inductance can be assumed to be constant without loss of accuracy. Since the q-axis current dynamics is being disturbed by the magnet's back-EMF voltage, the proposed estimator is combined with a robust active-state decoupling scheme to ensure unbiased parameter estimate. The robust decoupling scheme is realized by estimating the magnet's flux linkage by a simple adaptation algorithm based on the steepest descent method. The system's model is greatly simplified when the robust decoupling scheme is combined with the q-axis current dynamics. Relying on the simplified model, a natural adaptive observer is used to estimate the q-axis current. Unknown motor parameters are estimated by minimizing the state estimation error using an iterative gradient algorithm offered by the affine projection. The estimated parameters are used for the self-tuning control.

Automatic grading of the images is being considered by health boards so that the human grading task is reduced. Microaneurysms (MAs) are the earliest sign of this disease and so are very important for classifying whether images show signs of retinopathy. This paper describes automatic methods for MA detection and shows how image contrast normalization can improve the ability to distinguish between MAs and other dots that occur on the retina. Various methods for contrast normalization are compared. Best results were obtained with a method that uses the watershed transform to derive a region that contains no vessels or other lesions. Dots within vessels are handled successfully using a local vessel detection technique. Results are presented for detection of individual MAs and for detection of images containing MAs.

Size reduction are, therefore, achieved by introducing a few common resonator sections in the circuit. This concept has been verified by the experimental results of two diplexer circuits.

As reported earlier, our experiments demonstrate that very high information transfer rates can be achieved using the readiness potential (RP) when predicting the laterality of upcoming left- versus right-hand movements in healthy subjects. A more recent study showed that the RP similarly accompanies phantom movements in arm amputees, but the signal strength decreases with longer loss of the limb. In a complementary approach, oscillatory features are used to discriminate imagined movements (left hand versus right hand versus foot). In a recent feedback study with six healthy subjects with no or very little experience with BCI control, three subjects achieved an information transfer rate above 35 bits per minute (bpm), and further two subjects above 24 and 15 bpm, while one subject could not achieve any BCI control.

These bounds are never tight for the general AWGN model and are tight only under certain conditions for the FD-AWGN model. Two coding schemes that do not require the relay to decode any part of the message are then investigated. First, it is shown that the ""side-information coding scheme"" can outperform the block-Markov coding scheme. It is also shown that the achievable rate of the side-information coding scheme can be improved via time sharing. In the second scheme, the relaying functions are restricted to be linear. The problem is reduced to a ""single-letter"" nonconvex optimization problem for the FD-AWGN model. The paper also establishes a relationship between the minimum energy-per-bit and capacity of the AWGN relay channel. This relationship together with the lower and upper bounds on capacity are used to establish corresponding lower and upper bounds on the minimum energy-per-bit that do not differ by more than a factor of 1.45 for the FD-AWGN relay channel model and 1.7 for the general AWGN model.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.871579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1614082","Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels;channel capacity;minimum energy-per-bit;relay channel","Degradation;Upper bound;Channel capacity;Additive white noise;Digital relays;AWGN channels;Frequency;Decoding;Time sharing computer systems;Gaussian noise","","222","","28","IEEE","3 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This way avoids complete siphon enumeration that is more time-consuming for a sizable plant model than the MIP method. Monitors are added for only those siphons that require them. Second, we rearrange the output arcs of the monitors on condition that liveness is still preserved. The liveness is verified by an MIP-based deadlock detection method instead of much time-consuming reachability analysis. Experimental studies show that the proposed approach is more efficient than the existing ones and can result in more permissive and structurally simpler liveness-enforcing supervisors than all the known existing methods.

The currents induced on the arrays are presented for the first time and their study reveals two distinct resonance phenomena associated with these surfaces. A new technique is presented to tailor the spectral position of the AMC operation and the EBG. Square patch arrays with fixed element size and variable periodicities are employed as working examples to demonstrate the dependence of the spectral AMC and EBG characteristics on array parameters. It is revealed that as the array periodicity is increased, the AMC frequency is increased, while the EBG frequency is reduced. This is shown to occur due to the different nature of the resonance phenomena and the associated underlying physical mechanisms that produce the two effects. The effect of substrate thickness is also investigated. Full wave method of moments (MoM) has been employed for the derivation of the reflection characteristics, the currents and the dispersion relations.

The exact sparseness of the delayed-state information matrix is in contrast to other recent feature-based SLAM information algorithms, such as sparse extended information filter or thin junction-tree filter, since these methods have to make approximations in order to force the feature-based SLAM information matrix to be sparse. The benefit of the exact sparsity of the delayed-state framework is that it allows one to take advantage of the information space parameterization without incurring any sparse approximation error. Therefore, it can produce equivalent results to the full-covariance solution.

The battery side voltage ranges from 11V to 16V while the fuel cell is operated between 220V and 447V and the required power is typically 1kW. Careful analysis shows that the high currents on the battery side cause significant design issues in order to obtain a high efficiency. The standard phase shift modulation method can result in high conduction and switching losses. This paper proposes a combined triangular and trapezoidal modulation method to reduce losses over the wide operating range. Approximately, a 2% improvement in efficiency can be expected.

The BAT-relaying is utilizing the concept of anti-packets, defined for bi-directional traffic flows. The relay node combines the packets (anti-packets) that are destined for different nodes and broadcasts the combined packet. The first variant, termed decode-and-forward (DF) BAT-relaying, has been proposed before in the literature. It combines the packets by using the XOR operation, which makes such proposal closely related to the network coding approaches. We proposed another type of BAT-relaying based on amplify-and-forward (AF), which utilizes the inherent packet combining that emerges from simultaneous utilization of a multiple access channel. We analyze the achievable throughput of the DF and AF BAT-relaying, regarding the impact of the traffic asymmetry and the channel errors.

The chromatic property states that the changes of R, G, and B values of rainaffected pixels are approximately the same. By using both properties, the algorithm can detect and remove rain streaks in both stationary and dynamic scenes taken by stationary cameras.

To evaluate the audio quality of a given distorted signal relative to a corresponding high-quality reference signal, the auditory model is employed to compute ""internal representations"" of the signals, which are partly assimilated in order to account for assumed cognitive aspects. The linear cross correlation coefficient of the assimilated internal representations represents the perceptual similarity measure (PSM). PSM shows good correlations with subjective quality ratings if different types of audio signals are considered separately, whereas a better accuracy of signal-independent quality prediction is achieved by a second quality measure PSMt represented by the fifth percentile of the sequence of instantaneous audio quality PSM(t). The new measures were evaluated using a large database of subjective listening tests that were originally carried out on behalf of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) for the evaluation of various low bit-rate audio codecs.

The flight stabilization problem is formulated as high-frequency periodic control of an underactuated system. In particular, we provide a methodology to approximate the time-varying dynamics caused by the aerodynamic forces with a time-invariant model using averaging theory and a biomimetic parametrization of the wing trajectories. This approximation leads to a simpler dynamical model that can be identified using experimental data from the on-board sensors and the voltage inputs to the wing actuators. The overall control law is a periodic proportional output feedback. Simulations, including sensor and actuator models, demonstrate stable flight in hovering mode.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2006.875483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668261","Averaging;biomimetic;flapping flight;micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs);periodic control","Biomimetics;Insects;Control design;Aerodynamics;Biosensors;Actuators;Robot sensing systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Aerospace control;Micromechanical devices","","219","1","57","IEEE","7 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

RNC makes decision on which channel is used by which BS at super-frame level and BSs then make decision on which user is assigned to which channel at frame-level. Two optimization problems for RNC and BSs are formulated and computationally efficient algorithms that perform the function of interference avoidance and traffic/channel adaptation are developed. Numerical analysis is performed under several cell configurations to show tradeoffs between sector interference suppression and dynamic interference avoidance.

We address the drawbacks of the conventional watershed algorithm when it is applied to medical images by using k-means clustering to produce a primary segmentation of the image before we apply our improved watershed segmentation algorithm to it. The k-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm, while the improved watershed segmentation algorithm makes use of automated thresholding on the gradient magnitude map and post-segmentation merging on the initial partitions to reduce the number of false edges and over-segmentation.

While several methods for small pulmonary nodules have previously been presented, the segmentation of larger tumors that appear frequently in oncological patients and are more likely to be complexly interconnected with lung morphology has not yet received much attention. We present a fast, automated segmentation method that is based on morphological processing and is suitable for both small and large lesions. In addition, the proposed approach addresses clinical challenges to volume assessment such as variations in imaging protocol or inspiration state by introducing a method of segmentation-based partial volume analysis (SPVA) that follows on the segmentation procedure. Accuracy and reproducibility studies were performed to evaluate the new algorithms. In vivo interobserver and interscan studies on low-dose data from eight clinical metastasis patients revealed that clinically significant volume change can be detected reliably and with negligible computation time by the presented methods. In addition, phantom studies were conducted. Based on the segmentation performed with the proposed method, the performance of the SPVA volumetry method was compared with the conventional technique on a phantom that was scanned with different dosages and reconstructed with varying parameters. Both systematic and absolute errors were shown to be reduced substantially by the SPVA method. The method was especially successful in accounting for slice thickness and reconstruction kernel variations, where the median error was more than halved in comparison to the conventional approach.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2006.871547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610747","Chest imaging;computer aided analysis;image segmentation;volume measurement;X-ray tomography","Solids;Lesions;Computed tomography;Image segmentation;Lungs;Imaging phantoms;Image reconstruction;Cancer;Medical treatment;Patient monitoring","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Coin Lesion, Pulmonary;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Phantoms, Imaging;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Radiography, Thoracic;Radiography, Thoracic;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","219","2","34","IEEE","27 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the computation of the likelihood function for huge trees of more than 1,000 organisms is computationally intensive due to a large amount of floating point operations and high memory consumption. Within this context, the present paper compares two competing mathematical models that account for evolutionary rate heterogeneity: the Gamma and CAT models. The intention of this paper is to show that - from a purely empirical point of view - CAT can be used instead of Gamma. The main advantage of CAT over Gamma consists in significantly lower memory consumption and faster inference times. An experimental study using RAxML has been performed on 19 real-world datasets comprising 73 up to 1,663 DNA sequences. Results show that CAT is on average 5.5 times faster than Gamma and - surprisingly enough - also yields trees with slightly superior Gamma likelihood values.

The proposed method is based on injecting a disturbance signal into the system through either the direct axis (d-axis) or the quadrature axis (q-axis) current controllers of the interface voltage-sourced converter. Signal injection through the d-axis controller modulates the amplitude of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC), whereas signal injection through the q-axis controller causes a frequency deviation at PCC, under islanded conditions. Monitoring strategies to detect islanding are also presented for the proposed injection method. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated under the UL1741 anti-islanding test configuration. The studies reported in this paper are based on time-domain simulations in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment. The studies show that the proposed islanding detection method succeeds in detecting the islanding phenomenon as fast as 33.3 ms for the parameter setting of the test system, and always meets the two-second UL detection requirement. The paper also concludes that the proposed method has the salient feature of offering a potential application in a micro-grid scenario, where fast ""islanding detection"" and not necessarily the ""anti-islanding function"" is required.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2006.876980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1645219","Distributed generation;distributed resources;distribution systems;islanding detection;microgrid","Voltage control;Control systems;System testing;Frequency;PSCAD;EMTDC;Distributed power generation;Power industry;Amplitude modulation;Time domain analysis","","218","2","16","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The criterion is based on maximizing the mean-squared weighted inner product (MSwIP) between the optimum and the quantized beamforming vector. The performance of systems with quantized beamforming is analyzed for the independent fading case. This requires finding the density of the squared inner product between the optimum and the quantized beamforming vector, which is obtained by considering a simple approximation of the quantization cell. The approximate density function is used to lower-bound the capacity loss due to quantization, the outage probability, and the bit error probability. The resulting expressions provide insight into the dependence of the performance of transmit beamforming MISO systems on the number of transmit antennas and feedback rate.

The objective is to design the transmitter according to an imperfect channel estimate, where the errors are explicitly taken into account to obtain a robust design under the maximin or worst case philosophy. The robust transmission scheme is composed of an orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC), whose outputs are transmitted through the eigenmodes of the channel estimate with an appropriate power allocation among them. At the receiver, the signal is detected assuming a perfect channel knowledge. The optimization problem corresponding to the design of the power allocation among the estimated eigenmodes, whose goal is the maximization of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), is transformed to a simple convex problem that can be easily solved. Different sources of errors are considered in the channel estimate, such as the Gaussian noise from the estimation process and the errors from the quantization of the channel estimate, among others. For the case of Gaussian noise, the robust power allocation admits a closed-form expression. Finally, the benefits of the proposed design are evaluated and compared with the pure OSTBC and nonrobust approaches.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2005.861084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561600","Antenna arrays;beamforming;convex optimization theory;maximum optimization problems;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems;saddle point;space–time coding;worst-case robust designs","Robustness;MIMO;Channel state information;Signal to noise ratio;Gaussian noise;Wireless communication;Receiving antennas;Transmitters;Block codes;Signal detection","","218","3","53","IEEE","19 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This reduces computational requirements in situations when either the verification step fails or the zero-distortion reconstruction is not needed. For verified images, integrity of the reconstructed image is ensured by the uniqueness of the reconstruction procedure.

The steady-state error due to 120-Hz ac signals has been reduced by employing a resonant-gain path in the current regulator. This paper also proposes simplified current-reference calculation scheme in the regulation of instantaneous active/reactive power. Compared to the previous works, the proposed control method has better transient response in compensation for generalized unbalanced operating conditions (unbalanced input supply and unbalanced input impedances) of wide range while still satisfying unity input power-factor correction and ripple-free dc-output-voltage regulation without adding any external hardware. The proposed control system has been analyzed and tuned based on the ac small signal perturbed model under unbalance.

With the exhaustion of fossil resources the energy economy will change from a chemical to an electrical base. This transition is one of physics, not one of politics. It must be based on proven technology and existing engineering experience. The transition process will take many years and should start soon. Unfortunately, politics seems to listen to the advice of visionaries and lobby groups. Many of their qualitative arguments are not based on facts and physics. A secure sustainable energy future cannot be based on hype and activism, but has to be built on solid grounds of established science and engineering. In this paper the energy needs of a hydrogen economy are quantified. Only 20%–25% of the source energy needed to synthesized hydrogen from natural compounds can be recovered for end use by efficient fuel cells. Because of the high energy losses within a hydrogen economy the synthetic energy carrier cannot compete with electricity. As the fundamental laws of physics cannot be chanced by research, politics or investments, a hydrogen economy will never make sense.

The error is thus as small as possible. This result is rigorously proven under the assumption that the probability distribution of the independent signal components belongs to the class of generalized Gaussian (GG) distributions with parameter$alpha$, denoted$ GG(alpha)$for$alpha≫2$. We name the algorithm efficient FastICA (EFICA). Computational complexity of a Matlab implementation of the algorithm is shown to be only slightly (about three times) higher than that of the standard symmetric FastICA. Simulations corroborate these claims and show superior performance of the algorithm compared with algorithm JADE of Cardoso and Souloumiac and nonparametric ICA of Boscolo on separating sources with distribution$ GG(alpha)$with arbitrary$alpha$, as well as on sources with bimodal distribution, and a good performance in separating linearly mixed speech signals.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2006.875991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1687935","Algorithm FastICA;blind deconvolution;blind source separation;CramÉr–Rao lower bound (CRB);independent component analysis (ICA)","Independent component analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Information theory;Automation;Probability distribution;Computational complexity;Computational modeling;Speech;Deconvolution","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Computing Methodologies;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","215","","28","IEEE","6 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then develop an LBK-based neighborhood authentication scheme to localize the impact of compromised nodes to their vicinity. We also present efficient approaches to establish a shared key between any two network nodes. In contrast to previous key establishment solutions, our approaches feature nearly perfect resilience to node compromise, low communication and computation overhead, low memory requirements, and high network scalability. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of LBKs in counteracting several notorious attacks against sensor networks such as the Sybil attack, the identity replication attack, and wormhole and sinkhole attacks. Finally, we propose a location-based threshold-endorsement scheme, called LTE, to thwart the infamous bogus data injection attack, in which adversaries inject lots of bogus data into the network. The utility of LTE in achieving remarkable energy savings is validated by detailed performance evaluation.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.861382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1589106","Compromise tolerance;location;pairing;security;wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks;Data security;National security;Routing;Cryptography;Authentication;Resilience;Intrusion detection;Computer networks;Scalability","","214","1","50","IEEE","6 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Herein, we derive distributed estimators based on binary observations along with their fundamental error-variance limits for more pragmatic signal models: i) known univariate but generally non-Gaussian noise probability density functions (pdfs); ii) known noise pdfs with a finite number of unknown parameters; iii) completely unknown noise pdfs; and iv) practical generalizations to multivariate and possibly correlated pdfs.

State-of-the-art short-time noise reduction techniques are most often expressed as a spectral gain depending on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The well-known decision-directed (DD) approach drastically limits the level of musical noise, but the estimated a priori SNR is biased since it depends on the speech spectrum estimation in the previous frame. Therefore, the gain function matches the previous frame rather than the current one which degrades the noise reduction performance. The consequence of this bias is an annoying reverberation effect. We propose a method called two-step noise reduction (TSNR) technique which solves this problem while maintaining the benefits of the decision-directed approach. The estimation of the a priori SNR is refined by a second step to remove the bias of the DD approach, thus removing the reverberation effect. However, classic short-time noise reduction techniques, including TSNR, introduce harmonic distortion in enhanced speech because of the unreliability of estimators for small signal-to-noise ratios. This is mainly due to the difficult task of noise power spectrum density (PSD) estimation in single-microphone schemes. To overcome this problem, we propose a method called harmonic regeneration noise reduction (HRNR). A nonlinearity is used to regenerate the degraded harmonics of the distorted signal in an efficient way. The resulting artificial signal is produced in order to refine the a priori SNR used to compute a spectral gain able to preserve the speech harmonics. These methods are analyzed and objective and formal subjective test results between HRNR and TSNR techniques are provided. A significant improvement is brought by HRNR compared to TSNR thanks to the preservation of harmonics","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2006.872621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709898","A posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR);a priori SNR;harmonic regeneration;noise reduction;speech enhancement","Signal to noise ratio;Speech enhancement;Noise reduction;Working environment noise;Degradation;Reverberation;Harmonic distortion;Noise level;Spectral analysis;Performance gain","","214","3","15","IEEE","16 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In many cases, such a map—representing the structure of the Internet as a graph with nodes and links—is a prerequisite when investigating properties of the Internet. A common way to obtain such maps is to make certain local measurements at a small subset of the nodes, and then to combine these in order to “discover” (an approximation of) the actual graph. Each of these measurements is potentially quite costly. It is thus a natural objective to minimize the number of measurements which still discover the whole graph. We formalize this problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and consider it for two different models characterized by different types of measurements. We give several upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio (for the online network discovery problem) and the approximation ratio (for the offline network verification problem) in both models.

In this paper, we show that the projection neural network can also be used to solve pseudomonotone variational inequalities and related pseudoconvex optimization problems. Under various pseudomonotonicity conditions and other conditions, the projection neural network is proved to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and globally convergent, globally asymptotically stable, and globally exponentially stable. Since monotonicity is a special case of pseudomononicity, the projection neural network can be applied to solve a broader class of constrained optimization problems related to variational inequalities.

Power control is modeled as a noncooperative game in which each user decides how much power to transmit over each carrier to maximize its own utility. The utility function considered here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted over all the carriers per joule of energy consumed and is particularly suitable for networks where energy efficiency is important. The multidimensional nature of users' strategies and the nonquasi-concavity of the utility function make the multicarrier problem much more challenging than the single-carrier or throughput-based-utility case. It is shown that, for all linear receivers including the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the minimum-mean-square-error detector, a user's utility is maximized when the user transmits only on its ""best"" carrier. This is the carrier that requires the least amount of power to achieve a particular target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the output of the receiver. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the proposed power control game are studied. In particular, conditions are given that must be satisfied by the channel gains for a Nash equilibrium to exist, and the distribution of the users among the carriers at equilibrium is characterized. In addition, an iterative and distributed algorithm for reaching the equilibrium (when it exists) is presented. It is shown that the proposed approach results in significant improvements in the total utility achieved at equilibrium compared with a single-carrier system and also to a multicarrier system in which each user maximizes its utility over each carrier independently.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.864028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1637718","Energy efficiency;game theory;multicarrier code-division multiple-access (CDMA);multiuser detection;Nash equilibrium;power control;utility function","Energy efficiency;Power control;Multiaccess communication;Power system modeling;Nash equilibrium;Energy measurement;Particle measurements;Power system reliability;Multidimensional systems;Matched filters","","213","","21","IEEE","30 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes the methods and results from experiments conducted in November 2002 on San Clemente Island, CA, using a plume of Rhodamine dye developed in a turbulent fluid flow (i.e., near-shore ocean conditions). These experiments demonstrated chemical plume tracing over 100 m and source declaration accuracy relative to the nominal source location on the order of tens of meters. The designed maneuvers are divided into four behavior types: finding a plume,tracing the plume, reacquiring the plume, and declaring the source location. The tracing and reacquiring behaviors are inspired by male moths flying up wind along a pheromone plume to locate a sexually receptive female. All behaviors are formulated by perception and action modules and translated into chemical plume-tracing algorithms suitable for implementation on a REMUS AUV. To coordinate the different behaviors, the subsumption architecture is adopted to define and arbitrate the behavior priorities. AUVs capable of such feats would have applicability in searching for environmentally interesting phenomena, unexploded ordnance, undersea wreckage, and sources of hazardous chemicals or pollutants.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2006.870627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1618529","Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs);behavior-based planning;chemical plume tracing;subsumption architecture","Underwater vehicles;Position measurement;Chemical sensors;Chemical hazards;Fluid flow measurement;Sea measurements;Velocity measurement;Pollution measurement;Fluid flow;Oceans","","213","","52","IEEE","10 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They are the second leading cause of unintentional-injury death for people of all ages and the leading cause of death for elders 79 years and older. Studies have shown that the medical outcome of a fall is largely dependent upon the response and rescue time. Hence, a highly accurate automatic fall detector is an important component of the living setting for older adult to expedite and improve the medical care provided to this population. Though there are several kinds of fall detectors currently available, they suffer from various drawbacks. Some of them are intrusive while others require the user to wear and activate the devices, and hence may fail in the event of user non-compliance. This paper describes the working principle and the design of a floor vibration-based fall detector that is completely passive and unobtrusive to the resident. The detector was designed to overcome some of the common drawbacks of the earlier fall detectors. The performance of the detector is evaluated by conducting controlled laboratory tests using anthropomorphic dummies.

Salient features are generally determined from the local differential structure of images. They focus on the shape-saliency of the local neighborhood. The majority of these detectors are luminance-based, which has the disadvantage that the distinctiveness of the local color information is completely ignored in determining salient image features. To fully exploit the possibilities of salient point detection in color images, color distinctiveness should be taken into account in addition to shape distinctiveness. In this paper, color distinctiveness is explicitly incorporated into the design of saliency detection. The algorithm, called color saliency boosting, is based on an analysis of the statistics of color image derivatives. Color saliency boosting is designed as a generic method easily adaptable to existing feature detectors. Results show that substantial improvements in information content are acquired by targeting color salient features.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2006.3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542040","Index Terms- Image saliency;feature detection;image statistics;color imaging.","Boosting;Computer vision;Detectors;Event detection;Shape;Image color analysis;Image analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Statistical analysis;Statistics","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Color;Colorimetry;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","212","","24","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nano- and micro-filler mixture composites were made by dispersing nano-scale layered silicate fillers and micro-scale silica fillers in epoxy resin. To investigate the effects of nano- and micro-filler mixture, the thermal expansion coefficient and insulation breakdown properties by a needle-plate electrode method were measured for the filler mixture composite and the conventional filled epoxy. The filler mixture composite had almost the same thermal expansion coefficient as the conventional filled epoxy. In a continuous voltage rising test, the filler mixture composite had 7% higher insulation breakdown strength than the conventional filled epoxy. Moreover, under constant AC voltage (10 kV at 1 kHz), the filler mixture composite had an insulation breakdown time of more than 20,000 minutes whereas the conventional filled epoxy had a breakdown time of 830 minutes. Electron microscope observation showed that the area surrounded by dispersed micro-scale silica fillers were also filled with the nano-scale layered silicate fillers. Furthermore, the estimate of spacing between the fillers and the filler/epoxy interface area showed a more densely-packed structure of the filler mixture composite than the conventional filled epoxy.

One-dimensional (1-D) discontinuities in images (edges and contours) that are very important elements in visual perception, intersect too many wavelet basis functions and lead to a nonsparse representation. To efficiently capture these anisotropic geometrical structures characterized by many more than the horizontal and vertical directions, a more complex multidirectional (M-DIR) and anisotropic transform is required. We present a new lattice-based perfect reconstruction and critically sampled anisotropic M-DIR WT. The transform retains the separable filtering and subsampling and the simplicity of computations and filter design from the standard two-dimensional WT, unlike in the case of some other directional transform constructions (e.g., curvelets, contourlets, or edgelets). The corresponding anisotropic basis functions (directionlets) have directional vanishing moments along any two directions with rational slopes. Furthermore, we show that this novel transform provides an efficient tool for nonlinear approximation of images, achieving the approximation power O(N/sup -1.55/), which, while slower than the optimal rate O(N/sup -2/), is much better than O(N/sup -1/) achieved with wavelets, but at similar complexity.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.877076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1643699","Directional vanishing moments;directionlets;filter banks;geometry;multidirection;multiresolution;separable filtering;sparse image representation;wavelets","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Filtering;Channel bank filters;Image processing;Wavelet transforms;Filter bank;Image coding;Visual perception;Image reconstruction;Geometry","Algorithms;Anisotropy;Artifacts;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Filtration;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stochastic Processes","212","4","46","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The DARPA KA sensor signal processing and expert reasoning (KASSPER) program has as its goal the demonstration of a high performance embedded computing (HPEC) architecture capable of integrating high-fidelity environmental knowledge (i.e., priors) into the most computationally demanding subsystem of a modern radar: the adaptive space-time beamformer. This is no mean feat as environmental knowledge is a memory quantity that is inherently difficult (if not impossible) to access at the rates required to meet radar front-end throughput requirements. In this article, we will provide an overview of the KASSPER program highlighting both the benefits of KA adaptive radar, key algorithmic concepts, and the breakthrough look-ahead radar scheduling approach that is the keystone to the KASSPER HPEC architecture.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2006.1593336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593336","","Radar signal processing;Embedded computing;Interference;Adaptive signal processing;Computer architecture;High performance computing;Spaceborne radar;Throughput;Signal processing algorithms;Scheduling algorithm","","212","1","27","IEEE","13 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online. Theoretical frameworks for detection procedures are presented. We also give the results of the experimental study with the use of a network simulator testbed as well as real-life testing for TCP SYN flooding attacks.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2006.879308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1677904","Attack detection;change point detection;denial of service;intrusion detection;man-in-the-middle;network security;network traffic;nonparametric detection;port scanning;sequential tests;service survivability;worm","Intrusion detection;Computer networks;Adaptive systems;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Statistical analysis;Large-scale systems;Fluctuations;Computer vision;Computer crime","","212","3","38","IEEE","21 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, the study and determination of this set of poses, called the wrench-closure workspace (WCW), is an important issue for parallel cable-driven mechanisms. In this paper, the case of planar parallel cable-driven mechanisms is addressed. Theorems that characterize the poses of the WCW are proposed.

The model is described first in the Hybrid Systems Description Language to obtain a mixed-logical dynamical (MLD) hybrid model of the open-loop system. For the resulting MLD model, we design a receding horizon finite-time optimal controller. The resulting optimal controller is converted to its equivalent piecewise affine form by employing multiparametric programming techniques, and finally experimentally tested on a car prototype. Experiments show that good and robust performance is achieved in a limited development time by avoiding the design of ad hoc supervisory and logical constructs usually required by controllers developed according to standard techniques.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2005.860527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624479","Antiskid systems;hybrid systems;model predictive control;multiparametric programming;optimal control;traction control","Control systems;Open loop systems;Predictive models;Optimal control;Predictive control;Control system synthesis;Testing;Prototypes;Robust control;Standards development","","211","19","30","IEEE","24 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, ISPs often throttle BitTorrent traffic to control the cost. In this paper, we examine a new approach to enhance BitTorrent traffic locality, biased neighbor selection, in which a peer chooses the majority, but not all, of its neighbors from peers within the same ISP. Using simulations, we show that biased neighbor selection maintains the nearly optimal performance of Bit- Torrent in a variety of environments, and fundamentally reduces the cross-ISP traffic by eliminating the traffic’s linear growth with the number of peers. Key to its performance is the rarest first piece replication algorithm used by Bit- Torrent clients. Compared with existing locality-enhancing approaches such as bandwidth limiting, gateway peers, and caching, biased neighbor selection requires no dedicated servers and scales to a large number of BitTorrent networks.","1063-6927","0-7695-2540-7","10.1109/ICDCS.2006.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1648853","","Traffic control;Bandwidth;Internet;Costs;Analytical models;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Computer science;Application software;Network servers","","211","21","25","IEEE","24 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To maximize their control, both attackers and defenders have migrated to low-level, operating system code. In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, who is trying to run malicious software and avoid detection. By assuming this perspective, we hope to help defenders understand and defend against the threat posed by a new class of rootkits. We evaluate a new type of malicious software that gains qualitatively more control over a system. This new type of malware, which we call a virtual-machine based rootkit (VMBR), installs a virtual-machine monitor underneath an existing operating system and hoists the original operating system into a virtual machine. Virtual-machine based rootkits are hard to detect and remove because their state cannot be accessed by software running in the target system. Further, VMBRs support general-purpose malicious services by allowing such services to run in a separate operating system that is protected from the target system. We evaluate this new threat by implementing two proof-of-concept VMBRs. We use our proof-of-concept VMBRs to subvert Windows XP and Linux target systems, and we implement four example malicious services using the VMBR platform. Last, we use what we learn from our proof-of-concept VMBRs to explore ways to defend against this new threat. We discuss possible ways to detect and prevent VMBRs, and we implement a defense strategy suitable for protecting systems against this threat","2375-1207","0-7695-2574-1","10.1109/SP.2006.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624022","","Virtual machining;Control systems;Operating systems;Security;Protection;Kernel;Intrusion detection;Data structures;Detectors;Jacobian matrices","","211","62","49","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that the random selection of the nonzero elements of the GF(q) parity-check matrix induces a permutation-invariance property on the densities of the decoder messages, which simplifies their analysis and approximation. We generalize several properties, including symmetry and stability from the analysis of binary LDPC codes. We show that under a Gaussian approximation, the entire q-1-dimensional distribution of the vector messages is described by a single scalar parameter (like the distributions of binary LDPC messages).

In many cases, due to inherent uncertainty, experts cannot express their score or preference using exact numbers. The use of linguistic labels makes expert judgment more reliable and informative for decision-making. One of the problems of group decision making in fuzzy domains is aggregating experts' opinions, expressed using linguistic labels, into a group opinion. This aggregation allows the group to select the most ""preferred"" alternative from a finite set of candidates. The aggregation of individual judgments into a group opinion requires a measured level of consensus. In this paper, by introducing a new linguistic-labels aggregation operation, we present a procedure for handling an autocratic group decision-making process under linguistic assessments. The methodology presented results in two consequent outcomes: a group-based recommendation, and a score for each expert, reflecting the expert's contribution towards the group recommendation. By changing the weights of the experts based on their contributions, we increase the consensus and reinforce the common decision, without forcing the experts to modify their opinions. This methodology allows an autocratic decision maker to use a diversified group of consultants for a succession of decisions reaching a high level of consensus","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2005.853488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632291","Aggregation operators;consensus measure;fuzzy sets;multicriteria decision making","Decision making;Fuzzy sets;Industrial relations;Manufacturing industries;Manufacturing systems;Systems engineering and theory;Open wireless architecture;Aggregates","","210","","42","IEEE","15 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, these methods lack the generality to be easily applied to new applications or diverse image collections. This paper describes a novel unsupervised, information-theoretic, adaptive filter (UINTA) that improves the predictability of pixel intensities from their neighborhoods by decreasing their joint entropy. In this way, UINTA automatically discovers the statistical properties of the signal and can thereby restore a wide spectrum of images.

The concept was studied for future development of microdevices designed to perform minimally invasive interventions in remote sites accessible through the human cardiovascular system. A mathematical model is described taking into account various parameters such as the size of blood vessels, the velocities and viscous properties of blood, the magnetic properties of the materials, the characteristics of MRI gradient coils, as well as the ratio between the diameter of a spherical core and the diameter of the blood vessels. The concept of magnetic propulsion by MRI is validated experimentally by measuring the flow velocities that magnetized spheres (carbon steel 1010/1020) can withstand inside cylindrical tubes under the different magnetic forces created with a Siemens Magnetom Vision 1.5 T MRI system. The differences between the velocities predicted by the theoretical model and the experiments are approximately 10%. The results indicate that with the technology available today for gradient coils used in clinical MRI systems, it is possible to generate sufficient gradients to propel a ferromagnetic sphere in the larger sections of the arterial system. In other words, the results show that in the larger blood vessels where the diameter of the microdevices could be as large as a couple a millimeters, the few tens of mT/m of gradients required for displacement against the relatively high blood flow rate is well within the limits of clinical MRI systems. On the other hand, although propulsion of a ferromagnetic core with diameter of /spl sim/600 /spl mu/m may be possible with existing clinical MRI systems, gradient amplitudes of several T/m would be required to propel a much smaller ferromagnetic core in small vessels such as capillaries and additional gradient coils would be required to upgrade existing MRI systems for operations at such a scale.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2005.862570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580835","Blood vessels;ferromagnetic;magnetic gradients;magnetic resonance imaging system;microdevice;propulsion","Propulsion;Magnetic cores;Cardiovascular system;Magnetic resonance imaging;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging;Coils;Magnetic properties;Magnetic materials;Minimally invasive surgery","Animals;Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures;Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures;Computer-Aided Design;Electromagnetic Fields;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Humans;Iron;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetics;Micromanipulation;Micromanipulation;Microsurgery;Microsurgery;Motion;Robotics;Robotics","209","2","40","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Causes of this phenomenon, which has been referred to as “software aging”, are the accumulation of internal error conditions, and the depletion of operating system resources. A proactive technique called “software rejuvenation” has been proposed as a way to counteract software aging. It involves occasionally terminating the software application, cleaning its internal state and/or its environment, and then restarting it. Due to the costs incurred by software rejuvenation, an important question is when to schedule this action. While periodic rejuvenation at constant time intervals is straightforward to implement, it may not yield the best results. The rate at which software ages is usually not constant, but it depends on the time-varying system workload. Software rejuvenation should therefore be planned & initiated in the face of the actual system behavior. This requires the measurement, analysis, and prediction of system resource usage. In this paper, we study the development of resource usage in a web server while subjecting it to an artificial workload. We first collect data on several system resource usage & activity parameters. Non-parametric statistical methods are then applied toward detecting & estimating trends in the data sets. Finally, we fit time series models to the data collected. Unlike the models used previously in the research on software aging, these time series models allow for seasonal patterns, and we show how the exploitation of the seasonal variation can help in adequately predicting the future resource usage. Based on the models employed here, proactive management techniques like software rejuvenation triggered by actual measurements can be built.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2006.879609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688077","Apache web server;Linux;non-parametric trend analysis;performance monitoring;prediction of resource utilization;software aging;software rejuvenation;time series analysis","Aging;Web server;Predictive models;Software systems;Degradation;Operating systems;Application software;Cleaning;Costs;Time varying systems","","208","","40","IEEE","6 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This tradeoff is precisely known in the case of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading, for$T geq n_t+n_r-1$where$T$is the number of time slots over which coding takes place and$n_t,n_r$are the number of transmit and receive antennas, respectively. For$T ≪ n_t+n_r-1$, only upper and lower bounds on the D-MG tradeoff are available. In this paper, we present a complete solution to the problem of explicitly constructing D-MG optimal ST codes, i.e., codes that achieve the D-MG tradeoff for any number of receive antennas. We do this by showing that for the square minimum-delay case when$T=n_t=n$, cyclic-division-algebra (CDA)-based ST codes having the nonvanishing determinant property are D-MG optimal. While constructions of such codes were previously known for restricted values of$n$, we provide here a construction for such codes that is valid for all$n$. For the rectangular,$T ≫ n_t$case, we present two general techniques for building D-MG-optimal rectangular ST codes from their square counterparts. A byproduct of our results establishes that the D-MG tradeoff for all$Tgeq n_t$is the same as that previously known to hold for$T geq n_t + n_r -1$.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.880037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1683914","Cyclic division algebra;diversity–multiplexing gain tradeoff;explicit construction;space-time codes","Receiving antennas;Diversity methods;Rayleigh channels;MIMO;Signal to noise ratio;Buildings;Algebra;Space time codes;Random variables","","207","1","49","IEEE","28 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We demonstrate the use of the latter approach to identify the thermal modes that contribute most to damping, and present an example that illustrates how this information may be used to design devices with higher quality factors.

The elderly population being less familiar with IT implies that issues pertaining to their acceptance of information systems (IS) deserve special attention. However, the IS and gerontology literatures seldom explore IS acceptance among the aged. Attempting to address this gap, a research model is developed by integrating relevant antecedents from previous literature and empirically tested in the context of an e-Government service tailored for senior citizens. Our findings reveal that consistent with previous technology acceptance studies, senior citizens' use intention is driven by their perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the service. Additionally, their Internet safety perception impacts the acceptance of this online financial service. Furthermore, resource savings and self-actualization determine senior citizens' usefulness perception, whereas computer anxiety and computing support are antecedents of perceived ease of use. Of these antecedents, self actualization and computer anxiety appear particularly relevant for the elderly as compared to younger working professionals in most previous literature for whom these antecedents have not been important. The study contributes by providing an integrative model of IS acceptance among the aged, which may facilitate theory development and practice","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2006.883710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1715647","E-government;information systems acceptance;perceived ease of use;perceived usefulness;senior citizens","Senior citizens;Electronic government;Statistics;Aging;Internet;Gerontology","","207","","81","IEEE","23 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, while data on plasma concentrations of glucose are available, the rates of appearance in plasma of ingested glucose (Ra) were not available to develop such models. Here we utilize the recent availability of Ra data, estimated with a model-independent multiple tracer technique, to formulate a system model of intestinal glucose absorption. Two published and two new models are tested on this new data set. One of the two new models performed best: it is nonlinear, describes the Ra data well and its parameters are estimated with good precision. This model has important potential both in simulation contexts, e.g., it can be incorporated in whole-body models of the glucose regulatory system, as well as in physiological and clinical studies to quantitatively characterize possible impairment of glucose absorption in particular populations such as elderly and diabetic individuals.

Several maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods that force the operating point to oscillate have been presented in the past few decades. In the MPPT system, the ideal operation is to determine the maximum power point (MPP) of the photovoltaic (PV) array directly rather than to track it by using the active operation of trial and error, which causes undesirable oscillation around the MPP. Since the output features of a PV cell vary with environment changes in irradiance and temperature from time to time, real-time operation is required to trace the variations of local MPPs in PV power systems. The method of real-time estimation proposed in this paper uses polynomials to demonstrate the power-voltage relationship of PV panels and implements the recursive least-squares method and Newton-Raphson method to identify the voltage of the optimal operating point. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is successfully demonstrated by computer simulations and experimental evaluations of two major types of PV panels, namely: 1) crystalline silicon and 2) copper-indium-diselenide thin film","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.878355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667899","Curve fitting;least-squares method (LS);Newton–Raphson method (NRM);parameter estimation;photovoltaic (PV) power systems;polynomials;real-time systems","Real time systems;Photovoltaic systems;Control systems;Solar power generation;Temperature;Power system simulation;Recursive estimation;Polynomials;Newton method;Voltage","","207","2","11","IEEE","7 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A mixture model composed of a large number of Gaussians is used to represent the brain image. Each tissue is represented by a large number of Gaussian components to capture the complex tissue spatial layout. The intensity of a tissue is considered a global feature and is incorporated into the model through tying of all the related Gaussian parameters. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to learn the parameter-tied, constrained Gaussian mixture model. An elaborate initialization scheme is suggested to link the set of Gaussians per tissue type, such that each Gaussian in the set has similar intensity characteristics with minimal overlapping spatial supports. Segmentation of the brain image is achieved by the affiliation of each voxel to the component of the model that maximized the a posteriori probability. The presented algorithm is used to segment three-dimensional, T1-weighted, simulated and real MR images of the brain into three different tissues, under varying noise conditions. Results are compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. The algorithm does not use an atlas for initialization or parameter learning.

We proposed the epsivDE, defined by applying the epsiv constrained method to a differential evolution (DE). DE is a simple, fast and stable population based search algorithm that is robust to multi-modal problems. The epsivDE is improved to solve problems with many equality constraints by introducing a gradient-based mutation that finds feasible point using the gradient of constraints at an infeasible point. Also the epsivDE is improved to find feasible solutions faster by introducing elitism where more feasible points are preserved as feasible elites.

Colocation pattern discovery presents challenges since spatial objects are embedded in a continuous space, whereas classical data is often discrete. A large fraction of the computation time is devoted to identifying the instances of colocation patterns. We propose a novel joinless approach for efficient colocation pattern mining. The joinless colocation mining algorithm uses an instance-lookup scheme instead of an expensive spatial or an instance join operation for identifying colocation instances. We prove the joinless algorithm is correct and complete in finding colocation rules. We also describe a partial join approach for a spatial data set often clustered in neighborhood areas. We provide the algebraic cost models to characterize the performance dominance zones of the joinless method and the partial join method with a current join-based colocation mining method, and compare their computational complexities. In the experimental evaluation, using synthetic and real-world data sets, our methods performed more efficiently than the join-based method and show more scalability in dense data.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1683769","Spatial data mining;association rule;colocation pattern;spatial neighbor relationship.","Data mining;Association rules;Diseases;Water resources;Clustering algorithms;Spatial databases;Costs;Computational complexity;Performance evaluation;Scalability","","206","1","16","IEEE","28 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, in many engineering reliability experiments, measures of degradation or wear toward failure can often be observed over a period of time before failure occurs. Because the degradation values provide additional information beyond that provided by the failure observations, both sets of observations need to be considered when doing inference on the statistical parameters of the product or system lifetime distributions. For highly-reliable modern products, it often takes much more time to obtain lifetime & degradation data under usual use conditions, and this requires one to use accelerated tests. Accelerated tests expose the products to greater environmental stress levels so that we can obtain lifetime & degradation measurements in a more timely fashion. In addition, many products are exposed to several environmental variables in some manufacturing processes, or under some operating conditions. This motivates the need for developing general accelerated test models with several accelerating variables for inference based on both observed failure values, and degradation measurements. In this paper, new accelerated test models are developed based on a generalized cumulative damage approach with a stochastic process characterizing a degradation phenomenon.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2006.874937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638421","Accelerated testing;Brownian motion process;cumulative damage;degradation process;first passage time;gamma process;geometric Brownian motion process;inverse Gaussian distribution;stochastic process","Stochastic processes;Degradation;Acceleration;Life estimation;Time measurement;Life testing;Power system modeling;Stress measurement;Accelerometers;Reliability engineering","","206","","41","IEEE","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The subcarrier weights are determined in such a way that the sidelobes of the transmission signal are minimized according to an optimization algorithm which allows several optimization constraints. As a result, sidelobe suppression by subcarrier weighting reduces OFDM sidelobes by more than 10 dB in the average without requiring the transmission of any side information","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2006.1638610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638610","","Constraint optimization;Frequency division multiplexing;Phase shift keying;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Phased arrays;Wireless communication;OFDM modulation;Throughput;Bandwidth","","206","23","6","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Respecting the five requirements of total measures of uncertainty in the evidence theory, different ways have been proposed to quantify the total uncertainty, i.e., the ambiguity of a belief function. Among them is a measure of aggregate uncertainty, called AU, that captures in an aggregate fashion both types of uncertainty. But some shortcomings of AU have been identified, which are that: 1) it is complicated to compute; 2) it is highly insensitive to changes in evidence; and 3) it hides the distinction between the two types of uncertainty that coexist in every theory of imprecise probabilities. To overcome the shortcomings, Klir and Smith defined the TU1 measure that is a linear combination of the AU measure and the nonspecificity measure N. But the TU1 measure cannot solve the problem of computing complexity, and brings a new problem with the choice of the linear parameter delta. In this paper, an alternative measure to AU for quantifying ambiguity of belief functions is proposed. This measure, called Ambiguity Measure (AM), besides satisfying all the requirements for general measures also overcomes some of the shortcomings of the AU measure. Indeed, AM overcomes the limitations of AU by: 1) minimizing complexity for minimum number of focal points; 2) allowing for sensitivity changes in evidence; and 3) better distinguishing discord and nonspecificity. Moreover, AM is a special case of TU1 that does not need the parameter delta","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2005.853483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1678019","Aggregate uncertainty;ambiguity;Dempster–Shafer theory;uncertainty measure","Gold;Measurement uncertainty;Aggregates;Information theory;Information entropy;Councils;Collaborative work;Decision support systems;Research and development","","206","","35","IEEE","21 Aug 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents an interpolative reasoning method by means of scale and move transformations. It can be used to interpolate fuzzy rules involving complex polygon, Gaussian or other bell-shaped fuzzy membership functions. The method works by first constructing a new inference rule via manipulating two given adjacent rules, and then by using scale and move transformations to convert the intermediate inference results into the final derived conclusions. This method has three advantages thanks to the proposed transformations: 1) it can handle interpolation of multiple antecedent variables with simple computation; 2) it guarantees the uniqueness as well as normality and convexity of the resulting interpolated fuzzy sets; and 3) it suggests a variety of definitions for representative values, providing a degree of freedom to meet different requirements.

The mechanical fault results in a sinusoidal phase modulation of the stator current, which is equivalent to a time-varying frequency. Based on these assumptions, several signal processing methods suitable for stator current signature analysis are discussed: classical spectral analysis, instantaneous frequency estimation, and the Wigner distribution.

But determining the access structure is very hard as this requires the complete characterization of the minimal codewords of the underlying linear code, which is a difficult problem in general. In this paper, a sufficient condition for all nonzero codewords of a linear code to be minimal is derived from exponential sums. Some linear codes whose covering structure can be determined are constructed, and then used to construct secret sharing schemes with nice access structures.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.860412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564435","Cryptography;linear codes;secret sharing;covering problem;exponential sums","Cryptography;Linear code;Vectors;Hamming weight;Sufficient conditions;Error correction codes;Councils;Computer science","","205","","18","IEEE","27 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our system uses an adaptive algorithm, based on kernel partial least squares classification (KPLS), to associate patterns in multichannel EEG frequency spectra with cursor controls. Our first BCI, Target Practice, is a system for one-dimensional device control, in which participants use biofeedback to learn voluntary control of their EEG spectra. Target Practice uses a KPLS classifier to map power spectra of 62-electrode EEG signals to rightward or leftward position of a moving cursor on a computer display. Three subjects learned to control motion of a cursor on a video display in multiple blocks of 60 trials over periods of up to six weeks. The best subject's average skill in correct selection of the cursor direction grew from 58% to 88% after 13 training sessions. Target Practice also implements online control of two artifact sources: 1) removal of ocular artifact by linear subtraction of wavelet-smoothed vertical and horizontal electrooculograms (EOG) signals, 2) control of muscle artifact by inhibition of BCI training during periods of relatively high power in the 40-64 Hz band. The second BCI, Think Pointer, is a system for two-dimensional cursor control. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) are triggered by four flickering checkerboard stimuli located in narrow strips at each edge of the display. The user attends to one of the four beacons to initiate motion in the desired direction. The SSVEP signals are recorded from 12 electrodes located over the occipital region. A KPLS classifier is individually calibrated to map multichannel frequency bands of the SSVEP signals to right-left or up-down motion of a cursor on a computer display. The display stops moving when the user attends to a central fixation point. As for Target Practice, Think Pointer also implements wavelet-based online removal of ocular artifact; however, in Think Pointer muscle artifact is controlled via adaptive normalization of the SSVEP. Training of the classifier requires about 3 min. We have tested our system in real-time operation in three human subjects. Across subjects and sessions, control accuracy ranged from 80% to 100% correct with lags of 1-5 s for movement initiation and turning. We have also developed a realistic demonstration of our system for control of a moving map display (http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/).","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642775","Brain–computer interfaces (BCI);electroencephalogram (EEG);kernel partial least squares (KPLS);steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)","Brain computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Steady-state;Computer displays;Control systems;Frequency;Muscles;Testing;Adaptive algorithm;Kernel","Algorithms;Communication Aids for Disabled;Computer Peripherals;Data Display;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Visual;Feedback;Humans;Man-Machine Systems;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface;Visual Cortex;Volition","205","","16","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They can deal with uncertain or incomplete data and knowledge relating to power system diagnosis, so they are flexible. The structures and initial parameters of the Bayesian networks depend on the prior knowledge of the domain experts. The parameters can be revised by using an error back propagation algorithm similar to the back-propagation algorithm for artificial neural networks. The fault diagnosis models do not vary with the change of the network structure, so they can be applied to any transmission power system. Furthermore, they have clear semantics, rapid reasoning, powerful error tolerance ability, and no convergence problem during the diagnosing procedure. Experimental tests show that the approach is feasible and efficient, so the prototype program based on the approach is promising to be used in a large transmission power system for online fault diagnosis.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2005.858774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610672","Bayesian networks;fault diagnosis;Noisy-And node;Noisy-Or node;parameter revision","Bayesian methods;Power system faults;Fault diagnosis;Power system modeling;Circuit faults;Power system restoration;Fuzzy logic;Uncertainty;Backpropagation algorithms;Fuzzy neural networks","","205","3","12","IEEE","27 Mar 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The comprehensive model includes turbine-specific parameters such as radius, height, and tower dimensions, as well as the site-specific parameter, the wind shear exponent. The model proves the existence of a 3p pulsation due to wind shear and explains why it cannot be easily identified in field measurements. The proportionality constant between the torque and the wind speed is determined allowing direct aerodynamic torque calculation from an equivalent wind speed. It is shown that the tower shadow effect is more dominant than the wind shear effect in determining the dynamic torque, although there is a small dc reduction in the torque oscillation due to wind shear.

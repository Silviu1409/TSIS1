An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations.

However, it has not yet been widely used in multiobjective evolutionary optimization. This paper proposes a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). It decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and optimizes them simultaneously. Each subproblem is optimized by only using information from its several neighboring subproblems, which makes MOEA/D have lower computational complexity at each generation than MOGLS and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Experimental results have demonstrated that MOEA/D with simple decomposition methods outperforms or performs similarly to MOGLS and NSGA-II on multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problems and continuous multiobjective optimization problems. It has been shown that MOEA/D using objective normalization can deal with disparately-scaled objectives, and MOEA/D with an advanced decomposition method can generate a set of very evenly distributed solutions for 3-objective test instances. The ability of MOEA/D with small population, the scalability and sensitivity of MOEA/D have also been experimentally investigated in this paper.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2007.892759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358754","Computational complexity;decomposition;evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;Pareto optimality;Computational complexity;decomposition;evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;Pareto optimality","Evolutionary computation;Pareto optimization;Computational complexity;Sorting;Genetic algorithms;Optimization methods;Testing;Scalability;Computer science;Mathematical model","","6879","3","40","IEEE","27 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3D data arrays which we call ""groups."" Collaborative Altering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3D transformation. The result is a 3D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.901238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271520","Adaptive grouping;block matching;image denoising;sparsity;3-D transform shrinkage","Image denoising;Collaboration;Filtering;Noise reduction;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Energy resolution;Spatial resolution;Signal resolution;Discrete cosine transforms","Algorithms;Artifacts;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","6622","90","23","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept confidential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous attribute-based encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user's keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user's credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as role-based access control (RBAC). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements.","2375-1207","0-7695-2848-1","10.1109/SP.2007.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223236","","Cryptography;Access control;Secure storage;Measurement;Personnel;File servers;Monitoring;Certification;Data security;Public key","","3089","223","31","IEEE","4 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SVC enables the transmission and decoding of partial bit streams to provide video services with lower temporal or spatial resolutions or reduced fidelity while retaining a reconstruction quality that is high relative to the rate of the partial bit streams. Hence, SVC provides functionalities such as graceful degradation in lossy transmission environments as well as bit rate, format, and power adaptation. These functionalities provide enhancements to transmission and storage applications. SVC has achieved significant improvements in coding efficiency with an increased degree of supported scalability relative to the scalable profiles of prior video coding standards.

Basis pursuit, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), wavelet-based deconvolution, and compressed sensing are a few well-known examples of this approach. This paper proposes gradient projection (GP) algorithms for the bound-constrained quadratic programming (BCQP) formulation of these problems. We test variants of this approach that select the line search parameters in different ways, including techniques based on the Barzilai-Borwein method. Computational experiments show that these GP approaches perform well in a wide range of applications, often being significantly faster (in terms of computation time) than competing methods.

In graph embedding, each algorithm can be considered as the direct graph embedding or its linear/kernel/tensor extension of a specific intrinsic graph that describes certain desired statistical or geometric properties of a data set, with constraints from scale normalization or a penalty graph that characterizes a statistical or geometric property that should be avoided. Furthermore, the graph embedding framework can be used as a general platform for developing new dimensionality reduction algorithms. By utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called marginal Fisher analysis in which the intrinsic graph characterizes the intraclass compactness and connects each data point with its neighboring points of the same class, while the penalty graph connects the marginal points and characterizes the interclass separability.

This paper develops the modeling and analysis of autonomous operation of inverter-based microgrids. Each sub-module is modeled in state-space form and all are combined together on a common reference frame. The model captures the detail of the control loops of the inverter but not the switching action. Some inverter modes are found at relatively high frequency and so a full dynamic model of the network (rather than an algebraic impedance model) is used. The complete model is linearized around an operating point and the resulting system matrix is used to derive the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues (termed “modes”) indicate the frequency and damping of oscillatory components in the transient response. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which helps identifying the origin of each of the modes and identify possible feedback signals for design of controllers to improve the system stability. With experience it is possible to simplify the model (reduce the order) if particular modes are not of interest as is the case with synchronous machine models. Experimental results from a microgrid of three 10-kW inverters are used to verify the results obtained from the model.

In this paper, a novel approach for recognizing DTs is proposed and its simplifications and extensions to facial image analysis are also considered. First, the textures are modeled with volume local binary patterns (VLBP), which are an extension of the LBP operator widely used in ordinary texture analysis, combining motion and appearance. To make the approach computationally simple and easy to extend, only the co-occurrences of the local binary patterns on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) are then considered. A block-based method is also proposed to deal with specific dynamic events such as facial expressions in which local information and its spatial locations should also be taken into account. In experiments with two DT databases, DynTex and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both the VLBP and LBP-TOP clearly outperformed the earlier approaches. The proposed block-based method was evaluated with the Cohn-Kanade facial expression database with excellent results.

The notion of l-diversity has been proposed to address this; l-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least l well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper we show that l-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the earth mover distance measure for our t-closeness requirement.

This class of problems results from combining a linear observation model with a nonquadratic regularizer (e.g., total variation or wavelet-based regularization). It happens that the convergence rate of these 1ST algorithms depends heavily on the linear observation operator, becoming very slow when this operator is ill-conditioned or ill-posed. In this paper, we introduce two-step 1ST (TwIST) algorithms, exhibiting much faster convergence rate than 1ST for ill-conditioned problems. For a vast class of nonquadratic convex regularizers (lscrP norms, some Besov norms, and total variation), we show that TwIST converges to a minimizer of the objective function, for a given range of values of its parameters. For noninvertible observation operators, we introduce a monotonic version of TwIST (MTwIST); although the convergence proof does not apply to this scenario, we give experimental evidence that MTwIST exhibits similar speed gains over IST.

All terminals operate in half-duplex mode, hence the transmission of one information symbol from the source terminal to the destination terminal occupies two channel uses. This leads to a loss in spectral efficiency due to the pre-log factor one-half in corresponding capacity expressions. We propose two new half-duplex relaying protocols that avoid the pre-log factor one-half. Firstly, we consider a relaying protocol where a bidirectional connection between two terminals is established via one amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) relay (two-way relaying). We also extend this protocol to a multi-user scenario, where multiple terminals communicate with multiple partner terminals via several orthogonalize-and-forward (OF) relay terminals, i.e., the relays orthogonalize the different two-way transmissions by a distributed zero-forcing algorithm. Secondly, we propose a relaying protocol where two relays, either AF or DF, alternately forward messages from a source terminal to a destination terminal (two-path relaying). It is shown that both protocols recover a significant portion of the half-duplex loss","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.070213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107956","","Protocols;Fading;Relays;Decoding;Base stations;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Throughput;Interchannel interference;Wireless networks","","1415","6","21","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the first time, DG tunnel FET devices, which are using a high-gate dielectric, are explored using realistic design parameters, showing an on-current as high as 0.23 mA for a gate voltage of 1.8 V, an off-current of less than 1 fA (neglecting gate leakage), an improved average subthreshold swing of 57 mV/dec, and a minimum point slope of 11 mV/dec. The 2D nature of tunnel FET current flow is studied, demonstrating that the current is not confined to a channel at the gate-dielectric surface. When varying temperature, tunnel FETs with a high-kappa gate dielectric have a smaller threshold voltage shift than those using SiO2, while the subthreshold slope for fixed values of Vg remains nearly unchanged, in contrast with the traditional MOSFET. Moreover, an Ion/Ioff ratio of more than 2 times 1011 is shown for simulated devices with a gate length (over the intrinsic region) of 50 nm, which indicates that the tunnel FET is a promising candidate to achieve better-than-ITRS low-standby-power switch performance.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.899389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4252356","Band-to-band tunneling;double gate (DG);gated p-i-n diode;high-$\kappa$ dielectric;subthreshold swing;tunnel field-effect transistor (FET)","","","1370","15","23","IEEE","25 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Frequency and voltage control, including mitigation of voltage harmonics, are achieved without the need for any common control circuitry or communication between inverters. Each inverter supplies a current that is the result of the voltage difference between a reference ac voltage source and the grid voltage across a virtual complex impedance. The reference ac voltage source is synchronized with the grid, with a phase shift, depending on the difference between rated and actual grid frequency. A detailed analysis shows that this approach has a superior behavior compared to existing methods, regarding the mitigation of voltage harmonics, short-circuit behavior and the effectiveness of the frequency and voltage control, as it takes the R to X line impedance ratio into account. Experiments show the behavior of the method for an inverter feeding a highly nonlinear load and during the connection of two parallel inverters in operation.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.900456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267747","Autonomous power systems;converter control;dispersed generation;finite output-impedance ac voltage source emulation;frequency and voltage droops;harmonics;parallel connection;power quality;microgrids;stand-alone systems;uninterruptible power supplies (UPS);virtual impedance;voltage source inverter;mixed voltage-current control","Frequency;Voltage control;Inverters;Communication system control;Impedance;Power system harmonics;Uninterruptible power systems;Control systems;Circuits;Proportional control","","1365","21","21","IEEE","9 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recognizing hardware and energy constraints, we assume that a secondary user may not be able to perform full-spectrum sensing or may not be willing to monitor the spectrum when it has no data to transmit. We develop an analytical framework for opportunistic spectrum access based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). This decision-theoretic approach integrates the design of spectrum access protocols at the MAC layer with spectrum sensing at the physical layer and traffic statistics determined by the application layer of the primary network. It also allows easy incorporation of spectrum sensing error and constraint on the probability of colliding with the primary users. Under this POMDP framework, we propose cognitive MAC protocols that optimize the performance of secondary users while limiting the interference perceived by primary users. A suboptimal strategy with reduced complexity yet comparable performance is developed. Without additional control message exchange between the secondary transmitter and receiver, the proposed decentralized protocols ensure synchronous hopping in the spectrum between the transmitter and the receiver in the presence of collisions and spectrum sensing errors","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.070409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4155374","","Ad hoc networks;Media Access Protocol;Access protocols;Transmitters;Communication channels;Hardware;Monitoring;Physical layer;Telecommunication traffic;Statistics","","1236","12","18","IEEE","16 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Expressions for the outage probability are derived for a variety of atmospheric conditions. For given weather and misalignment conditions, the beam width is optimized to maximize the channel capacity subject to outage. Large gains in achievable rate are realized versus using a nominal beam width. In light fog, by optimizing the beam width, the achievable rate is increased by 80% over the nominal beam width at an outage probability of 10-5.

To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide Web (WWW) as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the WWW using Google page counts. The WWW is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish translation. Finally, we use the WordNet database as an objective baseline against which to judge the performance of our method. We conduct a massive randomized trial in binary classification using support vector machines to learn categories based on our Google distance, resulting in an a mean agreement of 87 percent with the expert crafted WordNet categories","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4072748","Accuracy comparison with WordNet categories;automatic classification and clustering;automatic meaning discovery using Google;automatic relative semantics;automatic translation;dissimilarity semantic distance;Google search;Google distribution via page hit counts;Google code;Kolmogorov complexity;normalized compression distance (ncd);normalized information distance (nid);normalized Google distance (ngd);meaning of words and phrases extracted from the Web;parameter-free data mining;universal similarity metric.","Databases;World Wide Web;Search engines;Web sites;Data mining;Earth;Natural languages;Painting;Books;Support vector machines","","1130","12","40","IEEE","29 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first algorithm is a modification of a previous DKF algorithm presented by the author in CDC-ECC '05. The previous algorithm was only applicable to sensors with identical observation matrices which meant the process had to be observable by every sensor. The modified DKF algorithm uses two identical consensus filters for fusion of the sensor data and covariance information and is applicable to sensor networks with different observation matrices. This enables the sensor network to act as a collective observer for the processes occurring in an environment. Then, we introduce a continuous-time distributed Kalman filter that uses local aggregation of the sensor data but attempts to reach a consensus on estimates with other nodes in the network. This peer-to-peer distributed estimation method gives rise to two iterative distributed Kalman filtering algorithms with different consensus strategies on estimates. Communication complexity and packet-loss issues are discussed. The performance and effectiveness of these distributed Kalman filtering algorithms are compared and demonstrated on a target tracking task.","0191-2216","978-1-4244-1497-0","10.1109/CDC.2007.4434303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4434303","sensor networks;distributed Kalman filtering;consensus filtering;sensor fusion","Kalman filters;Filtering algorithms;Covariance matrix;Sensor fusion;Peer to peer computing;Information filtering;Information filters;Iterative methods;Complexity theory;Target tracking","","1117","1","24","IEEE","21 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tian's difference-expansion technique is a high-capacity, reversible method for data embedding. However, the method suffers from undesirable distortion at low embedding capacities and lack of capacity control due to the need for embedding a location map. We propose a histogram shifting technique as an alternative to embedding the location map. The proposed technique improves the distortion performance at low embedding capacities and mitigates the capacity control problem. We also propose a reversible data-embedding technique called prediction-error expansion. This new technique better exploits the correlation inherent in the neighborhood of a pixel than the difference-expansion scheme. Prediction-error expansion and histogram shifting combine to form an effective method for data embedding. The experimental results for many standard test images show that prediction-error expansion doubles the maximum embedding capacity when compared to difference expansion.

We propose to apply this framework to image categorization where the input signals are images and where the underlying generative model is a visual vocabulary: a Gaussian mixture model which approximates the distribution of low-level features in images. We show that Fisher kernels can actually be understood as an extension of the popular bag-of-visterms. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance on two challenging databases: an in-house database of 19 object/scene categories and the recently released VOC 2006 database. It is also very practical: it has low computational needs both at training and test time and vocabularies trained on one set of categories can be applied to another set without any significant loss in performance.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270291","","Kernel;Vocabulary;Image databases;Spatial databases;Signal generators;Visual databases;Pattern classification;Power generation;Character generation;Feeds","","1028","61","18","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motivated by the successes of the two dimensional LDA (2DLDA) for face recognition, we develop a general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA) as a preprocessing step for LDA. The benefits of GTDA compared with existing preprocessing methods, e.g., principal component analysis (PCA) and 2DLDA, include 1) the USP is reduced in subsequent classification by, for example, LDA; 2) the discriminative information in the training tensors is preserved; and 3) GTDA provides stable recognition rates because the alternating projection optimization algorithm to obtain a solution of GTDA converges, while that of 2DLDA does not.We use human gait recognition to validate the proposed GTDA. The averaged gait images are utilized for gait representation. Given the popularity of Gabor function based image decompositions for image understanding and object recognition, we develop three different Gabor function based image representations: 1) the GaborD representation is the sum of Gabor filter responses over directions, 2) GaborS is the sum of Gabor filter responses over scales, and 3) GaborSD is the sum of Gabor filter responses over scales and directions. The GaborD, GaborS and GaborSD representations are applied to the problem of recognizing people from their averaged gait images.A large number of experiments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness (recognition rate) of gait recognition based on first obtaining a Gabor, GaborD, GaborS or GaborSD image representation, then using GDTA to extract features and finally using LDA for classification.

This paper presents a survey of the recent efforts towards a systematic understanding of “layering” as “optimization decomposition,” where the overall communication network is modeled by a generalized network utility maximization problem, each layer corresponds to a decomposed subproblem, and the interfaces among layers are quantified as functions of the optimization variables coordinating the subproblems. There can be many alternative decompositions, leading to a choice of different layering architectures. This paper surveys the current status of horizontal decomposition into distributed computation, and vertical decomposition into functional modules such as congestion control, routing, scheduling, random access, power control, and channel coding. Key messages and methods arising from many recent works are summarized, and open issues discussed. Through case studies, it is illustrated how “Layering as Optimization Decomposition” provides a common language to think about modularization in the face of complex, networked interactions, a unifying, top-down approach to design protocol stacks, and a mathematical theory of network architectures.

The weights are obtained as regression coefficients between the MS bands and the spatially degraded panchromatic (Pan) image, with the aim of capturing the spectral responses of the sensors. Once it has been integrated into the Gram-Schmidt spectral-sharpening method, which is implemented in environment for visualizing images (ENVI) program, and into the generalized intensity-hue-saturation fusion method, the proposed preprocessing module allows the production of fused images of the same spatial sharpness but of increased spectral quality with respect to the standard implementations. In addition, quantitative scores carried out on spatially degraded data clearly confirm the superiority of the enhanced methods over their baselines.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.901007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4305344","Component substitution (CS) pansharpening;Gram–Schmidt (GS) spectral sharpening;IKONOS satellite data;image fusion;intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transform;multispectral (MS) imagery;multivariate regression;QuickBird images","Multivariate regression;Image fusion;Degradation;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Radiometry;Principal component analysis;Image sensors;Data visualization","","934","","25","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed metric, the visual signal-to-noise ratio (VSNR), operates via a two-stage approach. In the first stage, contrast thresholds for detection of distortions in the presence of natural images are computed via wavelet-based models of visual masking and visual summation in order to determine whether the distortions in the distorted image are visible. If the distortions are below the threshold of detection, the distorted image is deemed to be of perfect visual fidelity (VSNR = infin)and no further analysis is required. If the distortions are suprathreshold, a second stage is applied which operates based on the low-level visual property of perceived contrast, and the mid-level visual property of global precedence. These two properties are modeled as Euclidean distances in distortion-contrast space of a multiscale wavelet decomposition, and VSNR is computed based on a simple linear sum of these distances. The proposed VSNR metric is generally competitive with current metrics of visual fidelity; it is efficient both in terms of its low computational complexity and in terms of its low memory requirements; and it operates based on physical luminances and visual angle (rather than on digital pixel values and pixel-based dimensions) to accommodate different viewing conditions.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.901820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286985","Contrast;distortion;human visual system (HVS);image fidelity;image quality;noise;visual fidelity;wavelet","Signal to noise ratio;Humans;Visual system;PSNR;Digital images;Image coding;Psychology;Object detection;Distortion measurement;Image analysis","Algorithms;Biomimetics;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Visual Perception","919","13","83","IEEE","13 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast with the conventional droop-control method, the proposed controller uses resistive output impedance, and as a result, a different control law is obtained. The controller is implemented by using a digital signal processor board, which only uses local measurements of the unit, thus increasing the modularity, reliability, and flexibility of the distributed system.

We propose using the inner-distance to build shape descriptors that are robust to articulation and capture part structure. The inner-distance is defined as the length of the shortest path between landmark points within the shape silhouette. We show that it is articulation insensitive and more effective at capturing part structures than the Euclidean distance. This suggests that the inner-distance can be used as a replacement for the Euclidean distance to build more accurate descriptors for complex shapes, especially for those with articulated parts. In addition, texture information along the shortest path can be used to further improve shape classification. With this idea, we propose three approaches to using the inner-distance. The first method combines the inner-distance and multidimensional scaling (MDS) to build articulation invariant signatures for articulated shapes. The second method uses the inner-distance to build a new shape descriptor based on shape contexts. The third one extends the second one by considering the texture information along shortest paths. The proposed approaches have been tested on a variety of shape databases, including an articulated shape data set, MPEG7 CE-Shape-1, Kimia silhouettes, the ETH-80 data set, two leaf data sets, and a human motion silhouette data set.

To realize these gains, however, the BS should be informed with the user's channel coefficients, which may limit practical application to TDD or low-mobility settings.

Therefore, licensees are protected from any interference all the time. From a practical standpoint, however, an unlicensed (secondary) user may share a frequency band with its licensed (primary) owner as long as the interference it incurs is not deemed harmful by the licensee. In a fading environment, a secondary user may take advantage of this fact by opportunistically transmitting with high power when its signal, as received by the licensed receiver, is deeply faded. In this paper we investigate the capacity gains offered by this dynamic spectrum sharing approach when channels vary due to fading. In particular, we quantify the relation between the secondary channel capacity and the interference inflicted on the primary user. We further evaluate and compare the capacity under different fading distributions.

For linear systems, we show how fundamental tradeoffs between the data rate and control goals, such as stability, mean entry times, and asymptotic state norms, emerge naturally. While many classical tools from both control and information theory can still be used in this context, it turns out that the deepest results necessitate a novel, integrated view of both disciplines.

It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the ""length"" of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the ""Fiedler vector,"" widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called ""statistical relational learning"" framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4072747","Graph analysis;graph and database mining;collaborative recommendation;graph kernels;spectral clustering;Fiedler vector;proximity measures;statistical relational learning.","Collaboration;Principal component analysis;Laplace equations;Relational databases;Collaborative work;Joining processes;Euclidean distance;Kernel;Motion pictures;Watches","","830","7","67","IEEE","29 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From an electrical engineering point of view, a new situation will arise for consumers concerning security of supply and power quality, which calls for further technical measures by the grid operators to ensure that the increasingly stringent supply criteria can be met. This article describes a new power electronics based approach which allows a grid compatible integration of predominantly renewable electricity generators even in weak grids making them appear to be electromechanical synchronous machines. As a consequence, all the proven properties of this type of machine which have so far defined the grid continue to do so, even when integrating photovoltaic or wind energy. These properties include, for instance, interaction between grid and generator as in a remote power dispatch, reaction to transients as well as the full electrical effects of a rotating mass.

Importing the concept of fuzzy sets, vectors' similarity is fuzzily defined in FuzzyEn on the basis of exponential function and their shapes. Besides possessing the good properties of SampEn superior to ApEn, FuzzyEn also succeeds in giving the entropy definition in the case of small parameters. Its performance on characterizing surface EMG signals, as well as independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random numbers and periodical sinusoidal signals, shows that FuzzyEn can more efficiently measure the regularity of time series.

Additional design inputs include anatomical and physiological considerations, workspace analyses, and upper limb joint ranges of motion. The database was compiled from 19 arm activities of daily living.

In the past decade, numerous algorithms have been proposed to perform this estimation. One commonly used assumption is the presence of pure pixels in the given image scene, which are detected to serve as endmembers. When such pixels are absent, the image is referred to as the highly mixed data, for which these algorithms at best can only return certain data points that are close to the real endmembers. To overcome this problem, we present a novel method without the pure-pixel assumption, referred to as the minimum volume constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (MVC-NMF), for unsupervised endmember extraction from highly mixed image data. Two important facts are exploited: First, the spectral data are nonnegative; second, the simplex volume determined by the endmembers is the minimum among all possible simplexes that circumscribe the data scatter space. The proposed method takes advantage of the fast convergence of NMF schemes, and at the same time eliminates the pure-pixel assumption. The experimental results based on a set of synthetic mixtures and a real image scene demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several other advanced endmember detection approaches","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.888466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4106058","Convex geometry;endmember;nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF);simplex;spectral unmixing","Data mining;Principal component analysis;Pixel;Layout;Independent component analysis;Geometry;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Clouds;Signal processing","","742","","36","IEEE","20 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These internal self-similarities are efficiently captured by a compact local ""self-similarity descriptor""', measured densely throughout the image/video, at multiple scales, while accounting for local and global geometric distortions. This gives rise to matching capabilities of complex visual data, including detection of objects in real cluttered images using only rough hand-sketches, handling textured objects with no clear boundaries, and detecting complex actions in cluttered video data with no prior learning.

We introduce a new computation of the inverse projection matrices for which a rigorous resampling is proposed. The irregular resampling problem is explicitly addressed to avoid introducing aliasing in the ortho-rectified images. Image registration and correlation is achieved with a new iterative unbiased processor that estimates the phase plane in the Fourier domain for subpixel shift detection. Without using supplementary data, raw images are wrapped onto the digital elevation model and coregistered with a 1/50 pixel accuracy. The procedure applies to images from any pushbroom imaging system.

With Q's this high in on-chip abundance, such devices might also enable a paradigm shift in the design of timing and frequency control functions, where the advantages of high-Q are emphasized, rather than suppressed (e.g., due to size and cost reasons), resulting in enhanced robustness and power savings. Indeed, as vibrating RF MEMS devices are perceived more as circuit building blocks than as stand-alone devices, and as the frequency processing circuits they enable become larger and more complex, the makings of an integrated micromechanical circuit technology begin to take shape, perhaps with a functional breadth not unlike that of integrated transistor circuits.

This generalizes the standard sparse representation problem to the case where multiple responses exist that were putatively generated by the same small subset of features. Ideally, the associated sparse generating weights should be recovered, which can have physical significance in many applications (e.g., source localization). The generic solution to this problem is intractable and, therefore, approximate procedures are sought. Based on the concept of automatic relevance determination, this paper uses an empirical Bayesian prior to estimate a convenient posterior distribution over candidate basis vectors. This particular approximation enforces a common sparsity profile and consistently places its prominent posterior mass on the appropriate region of weight-space necessary for simultaneous sparse recovery. The resultant algorithm is then compared with multiple response extensions of matching pursuit, basis pursuit, FOCUSS, and Jeffreys prior-based Bayesian methods, finding that it often outperforms the others. Additional motivation for this particular choice of cost function is also provided, including the analysis of global and local minima and a variational derivation that highlights the similarities and differences between the proposed algorithm and previous approaches.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.894265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4244754","Automatic relevance determination;empirical Bayes;multiple response models;simultaneous sparse approximation;sparse Bayesian learning;variable selection","Bayesian methods;Matching pursuit algorithms;Dictionaries;Signal generators;Pursuit algorithms;Focusing;Cost function;Algorithm design and analysis;Input variables;Design for experiments","","711","1","57","IEEE","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed approach could be used by vertically integrated utilities as well as the ISOs in electricity markets. In this model, random disturbances, such as outages of generation units and transmission lines as well as load forecasting inaccuracies, are modeled as scenario trees using the Monte Carlo simulation method. For dual optimization, coupling constraints among scenarios are relaxed and the optimization problem is decomposed into deterministic long-term SCUC subproblems. For each deterministic long-term SCUC, resource constraints represent fuel and emission constraints (in the case of vertically integrated utilities) and energy constraints (in the case of electricity markets). Lagrangian relaxation is used to decompose subproblems with long-term SCUC into tractable short-term MIP-based SCUC subproblems without resource constraints. Accordingly, penalty prices (Lagrangian multipliers) are signals to coordinate the master problem and small-scale subproblems. Computational requirements for solving scenario-based optimization models depend on the number of scenarios in which the objective is to minimize the weighted-average generation cost over the entire scenario tree. In large scale applications, the scenario reduction method is introduced for enhancing a tradeoff between calculation speed and accuracy of long-term SCUC solution.

The algorithm is based on factorizing the magnitude spectrogram of an input signal into a sum of components, each of which has a fixed magnitude spectrum and a time-varying gain. Each sound source, in turn, is modeled as a sum of one or more components. The parameters of the components are estimated by minimizing the reconstruction error between the input spectrogram and the model, while restricting the component spectrograms to be nonnegative and favoring components whose gains are slowly varying and sparse. Temporal continuity is favored by using a cost term which is the sum of squared differences between the gains in adjacent frames, and sparseness is favored by penalizing nonzero gains. The proposed iterative estimation algorithm is initialized with random values, and the gains and the spectra are then alternatively updated using multiplicative update rules until the values converge. Simulation experiments were carried out using generated mixtures of pitched musical instrument samples and drum sounds. The performance of the proposed method was compared with independent subspace analysis and basic nonnegative matrix factorization, which are based on the same linear model. According to these simulations, the proposed method enables a better separation quality than the previous algorithms. Especially, the temporal continuity criterion improved the detection of pitched musical sounds.

This paper proposes an automatic age estimation method named AGES (AGing pattErn Subspace). The basic idea is to model the aging pattern, which is defined as the sequence of a particular individual's face images sorted in time order, by constructing a representative subspace. The proper aging pattern for a previously unseen face image is determined by the projection in the subspace that can reconstruct the face image with minimum reconstruction error, while the position of the face image in that aging pattern will then indicate its age. In the experiments, AGES and its variants are compared with the limited existing age estimation methods (WAS and AAS) and some well-established classification methods (kNN, BP, C4.5, and SVM). Moreover, a comparison with human perception ability on age is conducted. It is interesting to note that the performance of AGES is not only significantly better than that of all the other algorithms, but also comparable to that of the human observers.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359348","Computer vision;pattern recognition;machine learning;face and gesture recognition;age estimation;Computer vision;pattern recognition;machine learning;face and gesture recognition;age estimation","Aging;Face recognition;Pattern recognition;Humans;Image databases;Image reconstruction;Face detection;Data mining;Senior members;Support vector machines","Aging;Algorithms;Anthropometry;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Face;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Anatomic;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","707","8","31","IEEE","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the solutions to overcome this weakness is by preserving the mean brightness of the input image inside the output image. This paper proposes a new method, known as brightness preserving dynamic histogram equalization (BPDHE), which is an extension to HE that can produce the output image with the mean intensity almost equal to the mean intensity of the input, thus fulfill the requirement of maintaining the mean brightness of the image. First, the method smoothes the input histogram with one dimensional Gaussian filter, and then partitions the smoothed histogram based on its local maximums. Next, each partition will be assigned to a new dynamic range. After that, the histogram equalization process is applied independently to these partitions, based on this new dynamic range. For sure, the changes in dynamic range, and also histogram equalization process will alter the mean brightness of the image. Therefore, the last step in this method is to normalize the output image to the input mean brightness. Our results from 80 test images shows that this method outperforms other present mean brightness preserving histogram equalization methods. In most cases, BPDHE successfully enhance the image without severe side effects, and at the same time, maintain the mean input brightness1.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2007.4429280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429280","","Brightness;Histograms;Image enhancement;Dynamic range;Consumer electronics;TV;Pixel;Digital images;Filters","","702","","10","IEEE","14 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several complete data sets from two different sensors, namely, QuickBird and simulated Pleiades, were delivered to all participants. The fusion results were collected and evaluated, both visually and objectively. Quantitative results of pansharpening were possible owing to the availability of reference originals obtained either by simulating the data collected from the satellite sensor by means of higher resolution data from an airborne platform, in the case of the Pleiades data, or by first degrading all the available data to a coarser resolution and saving the original as the reference, in the case of the QuickBird data. The evaluation results were presented during the special session on data fusion at the 2006 international geoscience and remote sensing symposium in Denver, and these are discussed in further detail in this paper. Two algorithms outperform all the others, the visual analysis being confirmed by the quantitative evaluation. These two methods share the same philosophy: they basically rely on MRA and employ adaptive models for the injection of high-pass details.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.904923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4305345","Image fusion;multispectral (MS) imagery;pansharpening;quality assessment;QuickBird (QB);simulated PlÉiades data","Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Geoscience and remote sensing;Image sensors;Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society;Testing;Multiresolution analysis;Satellites;Degradation;Algorithm design and analysis","","692","6","35","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As neuroprosthetic devices transition from experimental to clinical use, there is a need for fully-implantable amplification and telemetry electronics in close proximity to the recording sites. To address these needs, we developed a prototype integrated circuit for wireless neural recording from a 100-channel microelectrode array. The design of both the system-level architecture and the individual circuits were driven by severe power constraints for small implantable devices; chronically heating tissue by only a few degrees Celsius leads to cell death. Due to the high data rate produced by 100 neural signals, the system must perform data reduction as well. We use a combination of a low-power ADC and an array of ""spike detectors"" to reduce the transmitted data rate while preserving critical information.

We exploit this equivalence to develop a fast high-quality multilevel algorithm that directly optimizes various weighted graph clustering objectives, such as the popular ratio cut, normalized cut, and ratio association criteria. This eliminates the need for any eigenvector computation for graph clustering problems, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs. Previous multilevel graph partitioning methods such as Metis have suffered from the restriction of equal-sized clusters; our multilevel algorithm removes this restriction by using kernel k-means to optimize weighted graph cuts. Experimental results show that our multilevel algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithm in terms of speed, memory usage, and quality.

In general, the CPHD recursion is computationally intractable. This paper proposes a closed-form solution to the CPHD recursion under linear Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process. Based on this solution, an effective multitarget tracking algorithm is developed. Extensions of the proposed closed-form recursion to accommodate nonlinear models are also given using linearization and unscented transform techniques. The proposed CPHD implementations not only sidestep the need to perform data association found in traditional methods, but also dramatically improve the accuracy of individual state estimates as well as the variance of the estimated number of targets when compared to the standard PHD filter.

In this paper, numerous methods that have been developed to reduce or eliminate intensity inhomogeneities in MRI are reviewed. First, the methods are classified according to the inhomogeneity correction strategy. Next, different qualitative and quantitative evaluation approaches are reviewed.

The topology is evaluated in terms of its ability to improve the performance both during normal operation and during transients.

A well-known color constancy method is based on the gray-world assumption which assumes that the average reflectance of surfaces in the world is achromatic. In this paper, we propose a new hypothesis for color constancy namely the gray-edge hypothesis, which assumes that the average edge difference in a scene is achromatic. Based on this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm for color constancy. Contrary to existing color constancy algorithms, which are computed from the zero-order structure of images, our method is based on the derivative structure of images. Furthermore, we propose a framework which unifies a variety of known (gray-world, max-RGB, Minkowski norm) and the newly proposed gray-edge and higher order gray-edge algorithms. The quality of the various instantiations of the framework is tested and compared to the state-of-the-art color constancy methods on two large data sets of images recording objects under a large number of different light sources.

The modeled nonidealities include the quantum confinement effects on both circumferential and axial directions, the acoustical/optical phonon scattering in the channel region, and the screening effect by the parallel CNTs for CNFET with multiple CNTs. In order to be compatible with both large-(digital) and small-signal (analog) applications, a complete transcapacitance network is implemented to deliver the real-time dynamic response. This model is implemented with an HSPICE. Using this model, we project a 13 times CV/I improvement of the intrinsic CNFET with (19, 0) CNT over the bulk n-type MOSFET at the 32-nm node.

However, biometrics raises several privacy concerns. A biometric is permanently associated with a user and cannot be changed. Hence, if a biometric identifier is compromised, it is lost forever and possibly for every application where the biometric is used. Moreover, if the same biometric is used in multiple applications, a user can potentially be tracked from one application to the next by cross-matching biometric databases. In this paper, we demonstrate several methods to generate multiple cancelable identifiers from fingerprint images to overcome these problems. In essence, a user can be given as many biometric identifiers as needed by issuing a new transformation ""key."" The identifiers can be cancelled and replaced when compromised. We empirically compare the performance of several algorithms such as Cartesian, polar, and surface folding transformations of the minutiae positions. It is demonstrated through multiple experiments that we can achieve revocability and prevent cross-matching of biometric databases. It is also shown that the transforms are noninvertible by demonstrating that it is computationally as hard to recover the original biometric identifier from a transformed version as by randomly guessing. Based on these empirical results and a theoretical analysis we conclude that feature-level cancelable biometric construction is practicable in large biometric deployments.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107561","Fingerprint identification;image registration;cancelable biometrics;privacy;security.","Fingerprint recognition;Biometrics;Authentication;Privacy;Usability;Identity management systems;Security;Image databases;Image matching;Spatial databases","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Dermatoglyphics;Fingers;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique","655","29","31","IEEE","20 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first consider a two-user cognitive radio network and show how the inherent asymmetry in the network can be exploited to increase the agility. We show that our cooperation scheme increases the agility of the cognitive users by as much as 35%. We then extend our cooperation scheme to multicarrier networks with two users per carrier and analyze asymptotic agility gain.

Can a machine be endowed with such an intrinsic motivation system? This is the question we study in this paper, presenting a number of computational systems that try to capture this drive towards novel or curious situations. After discussing related research coming from developmental psychology, neuroscience, developmental robotics, and active learning, this paper presents the mechanism of Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity, an intrinsic motivation system which pushes a robot towards situations in which it maximizes its learning progress. This drive makes the robot focus on situations which are neither too predictable nor too unpredictable, thus permitting autonomous mental development. The complexity of the robot's activities autonomously increases and complex developmental sequences self-organize without being constructed in a supervised manner. Two experiments are presented illustrating the stage-like organization emerging with this mechanism. In one of them, a physical robot is placed on a baby play mat with objects that it can learn to manipulate. Experimental results show that the robot first spends time in situations which are easy to learn, then shifts its attention progressively to situations of increasing difficulty, avoiding situations in which nothing can be learned. Finally, these various results are discussed in relation to more complex forms of behavioral organization and data coming from developmental psychology.

Using various attributes of precipitation derived from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data, the GSMaP has implemented hydrometeor profiles derived from Precipitation Radar (PR), statistical rain/no-rain classification, and scattering algorithms using polarization-corrected temperatures (PCTs) at 85.5 and 37 GHz. Combined scattering-based surface rainfalls are computed depending on rainfall intensities. PCT85 is not used for stronger rainfalls, because strong depressions of PCT85 are related to tall precipitation-top heights. Therefore, for stronger rainfalls, PCT37 is used, with PCT85 used for weaker rainfalls. With the suspiciously strong rainfalls retrieved from PCT85 deleted, the combined rainfalls correspond well to the PR rain rates over land. The GSMaP algorithm for the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is validated using the TRMM PR, ground radar [Kwajalein (KWAJ) radar and COBRA], and Radar Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) precipitation analysis (RA). Monthly surface rainfalls retrieved from six microwave radiometers (GSMaP_MWR) are compared with the gauge-based dataset. Rain rates retrieved from the TMI (GSMaP_TMI) are in better agreement with the PR estimates over land everywhere except over tropical Africa in the boreal summer. Validation results of the KWAJ radar and COBRA show a good linear relationship for instantaneous rainfall rates, while validation around Japan using the RA shows a good relationship in the warm season. Poor results, connected to weak-precipitation cases, are found in the cold season around Japan.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.895337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261062","Microwave radiometer;precipitation;rain-rate retrieval;validation","Radiometers;Production;Spaceborne radar;Electromagnetic heating;Radar scattering;Rain;Meteorological radar;Radar imaging;Information retrieval;Satellite broadcasting","","645","","73","IEEE","25 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By exploiting this structure we develop a passivity-based design framework, which results in a broad class of feedback rules that encompass as special cases some of the existing formation stabilization and group agreement designs in the literature. The passivity approach offers additional design flexibility compared to these special cases, and systematically constructs a Lurie-type Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system.

The design of aperiodic (nonuniform and thinned) antenna arrays is presented as an example for the application of the PSO engine. In particular, in order to achieve an improved peak sidelobe level (SLL), element positions in a nonuniform array are optimized by real-number PSO (RPSO). On the other hand, in a thinned array, the on/off  state of each element is determined by binary PSO (BPSO). Optimizations for both nonuniform arrays and thinned arrays are also expanded to multiobjective cases. As a result, nondominated designs on the Pareto front enable one to achieve other design factors than the peak SLL. Optimized antenna arrays are compared with periodic arrays and previously presented aperiodic arrays.

In contrast to the conventional sum-power constraint on the transmit antennas, this paper adopts a more realistic per-antenna power constraint, because in practical implementations each antenna is equipped with its own power amplifier and is limited individually by the linearity of the amplifier. Assuming perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter, this paper investigates two different transmission schemes under the per-antenna power constraint: a minimum-power beamforming design for downlink channels with a single antenna at each remote user and a capacity-achieving transmitter design for downlink channels with multiple antennas at each remote user. It is shown that in both cases, the per-antenna downlink transmitter optimization problem may be transformed into a dual uplink problem with an uncertain noise. This generalizes previous uplink-downlink duality results and transforms the per-antenna transmitter optimization problem into an equivalent minimax optimization problem. Further, it is shown that various notions of uplink-downlink duality may be unified under a Lagrangian duality framework.

That is, the particle is made to remember its worst position also. This modification helps to explore the search space very effectively. In order to well exploit the promising solution region, a simple local random search (LRS) procedure is integrated with NPSO.

After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376144","Information visualization;interaction;interaction techniques;taxonomy;visual analytics","Visual analytics;Taxonomy;Data visualization;Research and development;Filters;Computer graphics;Rendering (computer graphics);Computer displays;Human computer interaction;Conference proceedings","","624","5","56","IEEE","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Without a direct link between the source and the destination, the optimal canonical coordinates of the relay matrix are first established, and the optimal power allocations along these coordinates are then found.

Annotation and retrieval are posed as classification problems where each class is defined as the group of database images labeled with a common semantic label. It is shown that, by establishing this one-to-one correspondence between semantic labels and semantic classes, a minimum probability of error annotation and retrieval are feasible with algorithms that are 1) conceptually simple, 2) computationally efficient, and 3) do not require prior semantic segmentation of training images. In particular, images are represented as bags of localized feature vectors, a mixture density estimated for each image, and the mixtures associated with all images annotated with a common semantic label pooled into a density estimate for the corresponding semantic class. This pooling is justified by a multiple instance learning argument and performed efficiently with a hierarchical extension of expectation-maximization. The benefits of the supervised formulation over the more complex, and currently popular, joint modeling of semantic label and visual feature distributions are illustrated through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments. The supervised formulation is shown to achieve higher accuracy than various previously published methods at a fraction of their computational cost.

The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle would be 1.66-2.0 times higher","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2007.892490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4168012","Batteries;control strategies;fuel cells;hybrid vehicles;improved fuel economy;ultracapacitors","Supercapacitors;Fuel cell vehicles;Battery powered vehicles;Fuel economy;Energy storage;Hybrid electric vehicles;Engines;Hydrogen;Fuel cells;Vehicle driving","","599","5","30","IEEE","30 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, evaluation of segmentation algorithms thus far has been largely subjective, leaving a system designer to judge the effectiveness of a technique based only on intuition and results in the form of a few example segmented images. This is largely due to image segmentation being an ill-defined problem-there is no unique ground-truth segmentation of an image against which the output of an algorithm may be compared. This paper demonstrates how a recently proposed measure of similarity, the normalized probabilistic rand (NPR) index, can be used to perform a quantitative comparison between image segmentation algorithms using a hand-labeled set of ground-truth segmentations. We show that the measure allows principled comparisons between segmentations created by different algorithms, as well as segmentations on different images. We outline a procedure for algorithm evaluation through an example evaluation of some familiar algorithms - the mean-shift-based algorithm, an efficient graph-based segmentation algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of both methods, and expectation maximization.

These rules have the advantage of not requiring a central authority that verifies compliance to the protocol. Any self-enforcing protocol must correspond to an equilibrium of a game. We first analyze the possible outcomes of a one shot game, and observe that in many cases an inefficient solution results. However, systems often coexist for long periods and a repeated game is more appropriate to model their interaction. In this repeated game the possibility of building reputations and applying punishments allows for a larger set of self-enforcing outcomes. When this set includes the optimal operating point, efficient, fair, and incentive compatible spectrum sharing becomes possible. We present examples that illustrate that in many cases the performance loss due to selfish behavior is small.

Synchronization represents one of the most challenging issues and plays a major role in the physical layer design. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the latest results in the field of synchronization for OFDMA systems, with tutorial objectives foremost. After quantifying the effects of synchronization errors on the system performance, we review some common methods to achieve timing and frequency alignment in a downlink transmission. We then consider the uplink case, where synchronization is made particularly difficult by the fact that each user's signal is characterized by different timing and frequency errors, and the base station has thus to estimate a relatively large number of unknown parameters. A second difficulty is related to how the estimated parameters must be employed to correct the uplink timing and frequency errors. The paper concludes with a comparison of the reviewed synchronization schemes in an OFDMA scenario inspired by the IEEE 802.16 standard for wireless metropolitan area networks.

Attackers can exploit this loss of control to substitute Trojan ICs for genuine ones or insert a Trojan circuit into the design or mask used for fabrication. We show that a technique borrowed from side-channel cryptanalysis can be used to mitigate this problem. Our approach uses noise modeling to construct a set of fingerprints/or an IC family utilizing side- channel information such as power, temperature, and electromagnetic (EM) profiles. The set of fingerprints can be developed using a few ICs from a batch and only these ICs would have to be invasively tested to ensure that they were all authentic. The remaining ICs are verified using statistical tests against the fingerprints. We describe the theoretical framework and present preliminary experimental results to show that this approach is viable by presenting results obtained by using power simulations performed on representative circuits with several different Trojan circuitry. These results show that Trojans that are 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than the main circuit can be detected by signal processing techniques. While scaling our technique to detect even smaller Trojans in complex ICs with tens or hundreds of millions of transistors would require certain modifications to the IC design process, our results provide a starting point to address this important problem.","2375-1207","0-7695-2848-1","10.1109/SP.2007.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223234","","Fingerprint recognition;Fabrication;Integrated circuit noise;Integrated circuit modeling;Circuit testing;Hardware;Manufacturing;Outsourcing;Costs;Security","","583","22","29","IEEE","4 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the conventional broadcast mechanism may lead to the so-called broadcast storm problem, a scenario in which there is a high level of contention and collisions at the link layer due to an excessive number of broadcast packets. While this is a well-known problem in mobile ad hoc wireless networks, only a few studies have addressed this issue in the VANET context, where mobile hosts move along the roads in a certain limited set of directions as opposed to randomly moving in arbitrary directions within a bounded area. Unlike other existing works, we quantify the impact of broadcast storms in VANETs in terms of message delay and packet loss rate in addition to conventional metrics such as message reachability and overhead. Given that VANET applications are currently confined to using the DSRC protocol at the data link layer, we propose three probabilistic and timer-based broadcast suppression techniques: weighted p-persistence, slotted 1-persistence, and slotted p-persistence schemes, to be used at the network layer. Our simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly reduce contention at the MAC layer by achieving up to 70 percent reduction in packet loss rate while keeping end-to-end delay at acceptable levels for most VANET applications.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4407231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407231","","Broadcasting;Storms;Ad hoc networks;Delay;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicles;Road accidents;Wireless networks;Protocols","","582","1","18","IEEE","18 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The profile order is evaluated and compared with a uniform profile distribution in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and artifact level. The favorable characteristics of such a profile order are exemplified in two applications on healthy volunteers.

Second, a contrast-enhancing k-space filter is presented that permits reconstructing an arbitrary number of images at arbitrary time points from one raw data set.

The design presented in this paper shows the advantage of geometrical simplicity while simultaneously reducing the overall thickness (for the current design $\lambda/16$). The design is very pragmatic and is based on a combination of AMC and perfect electric conductor (PEC) cells in a chessboard like configuration. An array of Sievenpiper's mushrooms constitutes the AMC part, while the PEC part is formed by full metallic patches. Around the operational frequency of the AMC-elements, the reflection of the AMC and PEC have opposite phase, so for any normal incident plane wave the reflections cancel out, thus reducing the RCS. The same applies to specular reflections for off-normal incidence angles. A simple basic model has been implemented in order to verify the behavior of this structure, while Ansoft-HFSS software has been used to provide a more thorough analysis.

Although it is reasonably effective, the deterioration of speech quality is caused by some problems: 1) appropriate spectral movements are not always caused by the frame-based conversion process, and 2) the converted spectra are excessively smoothed by statistical modeling. In order to address those problems, we propose a conversion method based on the maximum-likelihood estimation of a spectral parameter trajectory. Not only static but also dynamic feature statistics are used for realizing the appropriate converted spectrum sequence. Moreover, the oversmoothing effect is alleviated by considering a global variance feature of the converted spectra. Experimental results indicate that the performance of VC can be dramatically improved by the proposed method in view of both speech quality and conversion accuracy for speaker individuality.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2007.907344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317579","Dynamic feature;global variance;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE);voice conversion (VC)","Maximum likelihood estimation;Virtual colonoscopy;Loudspeakers;Speech enhancement;Parameter estimation;Mean square error methods;Speech processing;Statistics;Training data;Natural languages","","580","10","45","IEEE","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By choosing appropriate correction factors or offsets, we show that the EMS decoder performance is quite good, and in some cases better than the regular BP decoder. The optimal values of the factor and offset correction are obtained asymptotically with simulated density evolution.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Semi- supervised Discriminant Analysis (SDA), which makes use of both labeled and unlabeled samples.

We adopt the bag-of-visual-words architecture which has proven successful in achieving high precision at low recall. Unfortunately, feature detection and quantization are noisy processes and this can result in variation in the particular visual words that appear in different images of the same object, leading to missed results. In the text retrieval literature a standard method for improving performance is query expansion. A number of the highly ranked documents from the original query are reissued as a new query. In this way, additional relevant terms can be added to the query. This is a form of blind relevance feedback and it can fail if `outlier' (false positive) documents are included in the reissued query. In this paper we bring query expansion into the visual domain via two novel contributions. Firstly, strong spatial constraints between the query image and each result allow us to accurately verify each return, suppressing the false positives which typically ruin text-based query expansion. Secondly, the verified images can be used to learn a latent feature model to enable the controlled construction of expanded queries. We illustrate these ideas on the 5000 annotated image Oxford building database together with more than 1M Flickr images.

In a previous paper, we present a selection process to deal with group decision making problems with incomplete fuzzy preference relations, which uses consistency measures to estimate the incomplete fuzzy preference relations. In this paper we present a consensus model. The main novelty of this consensus model is that of being guided by both consensus and consistency measures. Also, the consensus reaching process is guided automatically, without moderator, through both consensus and consistency criteria. To do that, a feedback mechanism is developed to generate advice on how experts should change or complete their preferences in order to reach a solution with high consensus and consistency degrees. In each consensus round, experts are given information on how to change their preferences, and to estimate missing values if their corresponding preference relation is incomplete. Additionally, a consensus and consistency based induced ordered weighted averaging operator to aggregate the experts' preferences is introduced, which can be used in consensus models as well as in selection processes.

A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64% error on MNIST, and 54% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category.

The weights are selected adaptively to account for the quality of both source-relay-destination and source-destination links. Analysis proves that the novel coherent demodulator can achieve the maximum possible diversity, regardless of the underlying constellation.

This design allows localization of bandpass characteristics to within a small area on the surface which in turn facilitates flexible spatial filtering for an arbitrary wave phasefront. The proposed FSS is made up of periodic array of metallic patches separated by thin air-gaps backed by a wire mesh having the same periodicity (Ltlambda). The array of metallic patches constitute a capacitive surface and the wire mesh a coupled inductive surface, which together act as a resonant structure in the path of an incident plane wave. Like traditional FSSs, the capacitive and inductive surfaces of the proposed FSS can easily be fabricated using printed circuit technology on both sides of microwave substrates. It is shown that by cascading such bandpass surfaces in a proper fashion, any arbitrary multipole filter or non-commensurate multiband response can be obtained. The frequency response of the proposed miniaturized-element frequency selective surface (MEFSS) is demonstrated for various incident angles and it is shown that one-pole designs are less sensitive than two-pole designs to the angle of incidence. Dual band designs are also possible based on two-pole designs, but are more sensitive to incident angle than single band designs because of their larger (in terms of wavelengths) spacing. Prototypes of single-pole and dual-pole MEFSSs are fabricated and tested in a waveguide environment at X-band frequencies and excellent agreements between the measured and simulated results are demonstrated","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.895567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4200922","Bandpass radome;frequency selective surfaces (FSSs);spatial filter","Frequency selective surfaces;Surface waves;Resonance;Band pass filters;Wire;Filtering;Air gaps;Coupling circuits;Printed circuits;Microwave technology","","551","2","18","IEEE","15 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite the near-optimal decorrelation and energy compaction properties, application of the SA-DCT has been rather limited, targeted nearly exclusively to video compression. In this paper, we present a novel approach to image filtering based on the SA-DCT. We use the SA-DCT in conjunction with the Anisotropic Local Polynomial Approximation-Intersection of Confidence Intervals technique, which defines the shape of the transform's support in a pointwise adaptive manner. The thresholded or attenuated SA-DCT coefficients are used to reconstruct a local estimate of the signal within the adaptive-shape support. Since supports corresponding to different points are in general overlapping, the local estimates are averaged together using adaptive weights that depend on the region's statistics. This approach can be used for various image-processing tasks. In this paper, we consider, in particular, image denoising and image deblocking and deringing from block-DCT compression. A special structural constraint in luminance-chrominance space is also proposed to enable an accurate filtering of color images. Simulation experiments show a state-of-the-art quality of the final estimate, both in terms of objective criteria and visual appearance.

The need of a high-input voltage represents an important drawback of the half-bridge. The bipolar PWM full bridge requires a lower input voltage but exhibits a low efficiency.

"The Regularized Iteratively Reweighted MAD Method for Change Detection in Multi- and Hyperspectral Data","A. A.

Much like boosting methods often applied in data mining work, the iteratively reweighted (IR) MAD method in a series of iterations places increasing focus on ""difficult"" observations, here observations whose change status over time is uncertain. The MAD method is based on the established technique of canonical correlation analysis: for the multivariate data acquired at two points in time and covering the same geographical region, we calculate the canonical variates and subtract them from each other. These orthogonal differences contain maximum information on joint change in all variables (spectral bands). The change detected in this fashion is invariant to separate linear (affine) transformations in the originally measured variables at the two points in time, such as 1) changes in gain and offset in the measuring device used to acquire the data, 2) data normalization or calibration schemes that are linear (affine) in the gray values of the original variables, or 3) orthogonal or other affine transformations, such as principal component (PC) or maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) transformations. The IR-MAD method first calculates ordinary canonical and original MAD variates. In the following iterations we apply different weights to the observations, large weights being assigned to observations that show little change, i.e., for which the sum of squared, standardized MAD variates is small, and small weights being assigned to observations for which the sum is large. Like the original MAD method, the iterative extension is invariant to linear (affine) transformations of the original variables. To stabilize solutions to the (IR-)MAD problem, some form of regularization may be needed. This is especially useful for work on hyperspectral data. This paper describes ordinary two-set canonical correlation analysis, the MAD transformation, the iterative extension, and three regularization schemes. A simple case with real Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data at one point in time and (partly) constructed data at the other point in time that demonstrates the superiority of the iterative scheme over the original MAD method is shown. Also, examples with SPOT High Resolution Visible data from an agricultural region in Kenya, and hyperspectral airborne HyMap data from a small rural area in southeastern Germany are given. The latter case demonstrates the need for regularization","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.888195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4060945","Canonical correlation analysis (CCA);iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD);MAD transformation;regularization or penalization;remote sensing","Hyperspectral imaging;Remote sensing;Gain measurement;Time measurement;Iterative methods;Hyperspectral sensors;Boosting;Data mining;Calibration;Autocorrelation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Multivariate Analysis;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","539","","54","IEEE","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although many architectures are possible for IPTV video distribution, several mesh-pull P2P architectures have been successfully deployed on the Internet. In order to gain insights into mesh-pull P2P IPTV systems and the traffic loads they place on ISPs, we have undertaken an in-depth measurement study of one of the most popular IPTV systems, namely, PPLive. We have developed a dedicated PPLive crawler, which enables us to study the global characteristics of the mesh-pull PPLive system. We have also collected extensive packet traces for various different measurement scenarios, including both campus access networks and residential access networks. The measurement results obtained through these platforms bring important insights into P2P IPTV systems. Specifically, our results show the following. 1) P2P IPTV users have the similar viewing behaviors as regular TV users. 2) During its session, a peer exchanges video data dynamically with a large number of peers. 3) A small set of super peers act as video proxy and contribute significantly to video data uploading. 4) Users in the measured P2P IPTV system still suffer from long start-up delays and playback lags, ranging from several seconds to a couple of minutes. Insights obtained in this study will be valuable for the development and deployment of future P2P IPTV systems.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2007.907451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378423","IPTV;measurement;peer-to-peer streaming","Large-scale systems;IPTV;Internet;Floods;Spine;Telecommunication traffic;Gain measurement;Crawlers;TV;Delay","","539","11","39","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous design methodologies for coils made of 1-D filaments are not comprehensive and accurate enough to consider all geometrical aspects of PSCs with planar 3-D conductors as well as design constraints imposed by implantable device application and fabrication technology.

We demonstrate that CS has the potential to make two significant improvements to radar systems: (i) eliminating the need for the pulse compression matched filter at the receiver, and (ii) reducing the required receiver analog-to-digital conversion bandwidth so that it need operate only at the radar reflectivity's potentially low ""information rate"" rather than at its potentially high Nyquist rate.

The method is designed to handle the special characteristics of hyperspectral images, namely, high-input dimension of pixels, low number of labeled samples, and spatial variability of the spectral signature. To alleviate these problems, the method incorporates three ingredients, respectively. First, being a kernel-based method, it combats the curse of dimensionality efficiently. Second, following a semi-supervised approach, it exploits the wealth of unlabeled samples in the image, and naturally gives relative importance to the labeled ones through a graph-based methodology. Finally, it incorporates contextual information through a full family of composite kernels. Noting that the graph method relies on inverting a huge kernel matrix formed by both labeled and unlabeled samples, we originally introduce the NystrÖm method in the formulation to speed up the classification process. The presented semi-supervised-graph-based method is compared to state-of-the-art support vector machines in the classification of hyperspectral data. The proposed method produces better classification maps, which capture the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by labeled and unlabeled points. Good and stable accuracy is produced in ill-posed classification problems (high dimensional spaces and low number of labeled samples). In addition, the introduction of the composite-kernel framework drastically improves results, and the new fast formulation ranks almost linearly in the computational cost, rather than cubic as in the original method, thus allowing the use of this method in remote-sensing applications.

The system collects locally-generated peer feedbacks and aggregates them to yield the global reputation scores. Surprisingly, most previous work ignored the distribution of peer feedbacks. We use a trust overlay network (TON) to model the trust relationships among peers. After examining the eBay transaction trace of over 10,000 users, we discover a power-law distribution in user feedbacks. Our mathematical analysis justifies that power-law distribution is applicable to any dynamically growing P2P systems, either structured or unstructured. We develop a robust and scalable P2P reputation system, PowerTrust, to leverage the power-law feedback characteristics. The PowerTrust system dynamically selects small number of power nodes that are most reputable using a distributed ranking mechanism. By using a look-ahead random walk strategy and leveraging the power nodes, PowerTrust significantly improves in global reputation accuracy and aggregation speed. PowerTrust is adaptable to dynamics in peer joining and leaving and robust to disturbance by malicious peers. Through P2P network simulation experiments, we find significant performance gains in using PowerTrust. This power-law guided reputation system design proves to achieve high query success rate in P2P file-sharing applications.

The filtering method is a fully data-driven approach. A noisy signal is adaptively decomposed into intrinsic oscillatory components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by means of an algorithm referred to as a sifting process. The basic principle of the method is to make use of partial reconstructions of the signal, with the relevant IMFs corresponding to the most important structures of the signal (low-frequency components). A criterion is proposed to determine the IMF, after which, the energy distribution of the important structures of the signal overcomes that of the noise and that of the high-frequency components of the signal. The method is illustrated on simulated and real data, and the results are compared to well-known filtering methods. The study is limited to signals that were corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise and is conducted on the basis of extended numerical experiments.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2007.907967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4389086","Empirical mode decomposition (EMD);nonstationary signals;signal filtering","Filtering;Nonlinear filters;Additive white noise;Gaussian noise;Signal processing;Wiener filter;AWGN;Wavelet packets;Signal processing algorithms;Low-frequency noise","","514","","19","IEEE","6 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A focus of recent research activities in cooperative communications is to achieve spatial diversity gains by requiring these neighboring stations to retransmit the overheard information to the final destination. In this paper we demonstrate that such cooperation among stations in a wireless LAN (WLAN) can achieve both higher throughput and lower interference. We present the design for a medium access control protocol called CoopMAC, in which high data rate stations assist low data rate stations in their transmission by forwarding their traffic. In our proposed protocol, using the overheard transmissions, each low data rate node maintains a table, called a CoopTable, of potential helper nodes that can assist in its transmissions. During transmission, each low data rate node selects either direct transmission or transmission through a helper node in order to minimize the total transmission time. Using analysis, simulation and testbed experimentation, we quantify the increase in the total network throughput, and the reduction in delay, if such cooperative transmissions are utilized. The CoopMAC protocol is simple and backward compatible with the legacy 802.11 system. In this paper, we also demonstrate a reduction in the signal-to-interference ratio in a dense deployment of 802.11 access points, which in some cases is a more important consequence of cooperation","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.070210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107953","","Wireless LAN;Throughput;Access protocols;Bit rate;Fading;Interference;Media Access Protocol;Analytical models;Wireless networks;MIMO","","511","2","33","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Alternative DFIG control targets during network unbalance, such as reducing stator current unbalance, torque, and power pulsations minimization, are identified. A rotor current control strategy based on positive and negative (dq) reference frames is used to provide precise control of the rotor positive and negative sequence currents. Simulation results using EMTDC/PSCAD are presented for a 2-MW DFIG wind generation system. It shows that conventional vector control of DFIG without considering network unbalance results in excessive oscillations on the stator active/reactive power, electromagnetic torque, and stator/rotor currents even with a small stator voltage unbalance.

Characteristic modes are real current modes that can be computed numerically for conducting bodies of arbitrary shape. Since characteristic modes form a set of orthogonal functions, they can be used to expand the total current on the surface of the body. However, this paper shows that what makes characteristic modes really attractive for antenna design is the physical insight they bring into the radiating phenomena taking place in the antenna. The resonance frequency of modes, as well as their radiating behavior, can be determined from the information provided by the eigenvalues associated with the characteristic modes. Moreover, by studying the current distribution of modes, an optimum feeding arrangement can be found in order to obtain the desired radiating behavior.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2007.4395295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4395295","","Antenna theory;Broadband antennas;Microstrip antennas;Mobile antennas;Reflector antennas;Antenna feeds;Telephone sets;Resonance;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Current distribution","","509","12","41","IEEE","6 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Our technique builds inputs incrementally by randomly selecting a method call to apply and finding arguments from among previously-constructed inputs. As soon as an input is built, it is executed and checked against a set of contracts and filters. The result of the execution determines whether the input is redundant, illegal, contract-violating, or useful for generating more inputs. The technique outputs a test suite consisting of unit tests for the classes under test. Passing tests can be used to ensure that code contracts are preserved across program changes; failing tests (that violate one or more contract) point to potential errors that should be corrected. Our experimental results indicate that feedback-directed random test generation can outperform systematic and undirected random test generation, in terms of coverage and error detection. On four small but nontrivial data structures (used previously in the literature), our technique achieves higher or equal block and predicate coverage than model checking (with and without abstraction) and undirected random generation.

A particularly suitable application of the network coding arises for the two-way relay channels, where two nodes communicate with each other assisted by using a third, relay node. Such a scenario enables application of physical network coding, where the network coding is either done (a) jointly with the channel coding or (b) through physical combining of the communication flows over the multiple access channel. In this paper we first group the existing schemes for physical network coding into two generic schemes, termed 3-step and 2-step scheme, respectively. We investigate the conditions for maximization of the two-way rate for each individual scheme: (1) the decode-and-forward (DF) 3-step schemes (2) three different schemes with two steps: amplify-and-forward (AF), JDF and denoise-and-forward (DNF). While the DNF scheme has a potential to offer the best two-way rate, the most interesting result of the paper is that, for some SNR configurations of the source - relay links, JDF yields identical maximal two-way rate as the upper bound on the rate for DNF.","1938-1883","1-4244-0353-7","10.1109/ICC.2007.121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288792","","Network coding;Relays;Decoding;Broadcasting;Wireless networks;Peer to peer computing;Channel coding;Communications Society;Upper bound;Interference","","505","5","12","IEEE","13 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent academic studies have shown that in addition to coverage improvements, DAS can also have potential advantages such as reduced power and increased system capacity in a single cell environment. This paper analytically quantifies downlink capacity of multicell DAS for two different transmission strategies: selection diversity (where just one or two of the distributed antennas are used) and blanket transmission (where all antennas in the cell broadcast data). Simple repeaters are a special case of our analysis. A generalized information theoretic analysis is provided to illuminate the fundamental limits of such systems in the cellular context. The results show that DAS reduces other-cell interference in a multicell environment and hence significantly improves capacity (by about 2x), with particularly large improvements for users near cell boundaries. Less obviously, from a communication theory standpoint, it is shown that selection diversity is preferable to blanket transmission in terms of achievable ergodic capacity. For blanket transmission, we show that the optimal transmission strategy is just phase steering due to the per antenna module power constraints in DAS","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.05207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4114255","","Downlink;Interference;Transmitting antennas;Wireless communication;Radio frequency;Base stations;Performance analysis;Multiaccess communication;Computer simulation;Art","","504","11","17","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Total harmonic distortion of the current, fed into the grid, is restricted as per the IEEE-519 standard. The proposed topology has several desirable features such as better utilization of the PV array, higher efficiency, low cost and compact size. Further, due to the very nature of the proposed topology, the PV array appears as a floating source to the grid, thereby enhancing the overall safety of the system.

The method uses a time series of observed and predicted 15-min average wind speeds at foreseen onshore- and offshore-wind farm locations. A Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch (UC-ED) tool is adapted to allow for frequent revisions of conventional generation unit schedules, using information on current wind energy output and forecasts for the next 36 h. This is deemed the most faithful way of simulating actual operations and short-term planning activities for a system with large wind power penetration. The problem formulation includes ramp-rate constraints for generation schedules and for reserve activation, and minimum up-time and down-time of conventional units. Results are shown for a realistic future scenario of the Dutch power system. It is shown that problems such as insufficient regulating and reserve power—which are typically associated with the variablility and limited predictability of wind power—can only be assessed in conjunction with the specifics of the conventional generation system that wind power is integrated into. For the thermal system with a large share of combined heat and power (CHP) investigated here, wind power forecasting does not provide significant benefits for optimal unit commitment and dispatch. Minimum load problems do occur, which result in wasted wind in amounts increasing with the wind power installed.

A particular challenge in this technique is the presence of dc offset resulting from receiver imperfections and clutter reflections, in addition to dc information related to target position and associated phase. These dc components can be large compared to the ac motion-related signal, and thus, cannot simply be included in digitization without adversely affecting resolution. Presented here is a method for calibrating the dc offset while preserving the dc information and capturing the motion-related signal with maximum resolution.

Canonical correlations offer many benefits in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness compared to the two main classical methods: parametric distribution-based and nonparametric sample-based matching of sets. Here, this is first demonstrated experimentally for reasonably sized data sets using existing methods exploiting canonical correlations. Motivated by their proven effectiveness, a novel discriminative learning method over sets is proposed for set classification. Specifically, inspired by classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA), we develop a linear discriminant function that maximizes the canonical correlations of within-class sets and minimizes the canonical correlations of between-class sets. Image sets transformed by the discriminant function are then compared by the canonical correlations. Classical orthogonal subspace method (OSM) is also investigated for the similar purpose and compared with the proposed method. The proposed method is evaluated on various object recognition problems using face image sets with arbitrary motion captured under different illuminations and image sets of 500 general objects taken at different views.

In this paper, we present a new model for group decision making in which experts' preferences can be expressed as incomplete fuzzy preference relations. As part of this decision model, we propose an iterative procedure to estimate the missing information in an expert's incomplete fuzzy preference relation. This procedure is guided by the additive-consistency (AC) property and only uses the preference values the expert provides. The AC property is also used to measure the level of consistency of the information provided by the experts and also to propose a new induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator, the AC-IOWA operator, which permits the aggregation of the experts' preferences in such a way that more importance is given to the most consistent ones.

We define an event in a static image as a human activity taking place in a specific environment. In this paper, we use a number of sport games such as snow boarding, rock climbing or badminton to demonstrate event classification. Our goal is to classify the event in the image as well as to provide a number of semantic labels to the objects and scene environment within the image. For example, given a rowing scene, our algorithm recognizes the event as rowing by classifying the environment as a lake and recognizing the critical objects in the image as athletes, rowing boat, water, etc. We achieve this integrative and holistic recognition through a generative graphical model. We have assembled a highly challenging database of 8 widely varied sport events. We show that our system is capable of classifying these event classes at 73.4% accuracy. While each component of the model contributes to the final recognition, using scene or objects alone cannot achieve this performance.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-1630-1","10.1109/ICCV.2007.4408872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408872","","Layout;Object recognition;Image recognition;Humans;Snow;Lakes;Boats;Graphical models;Assembly;Image databases","","496","4","26","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different designs and technical advances now make it possible to erect wind turbines offshore. The fast expansion of the wind power market faces some problems. The new designs are not always fully tested, and the designed 20-year lifetime is typically never achieved before the next generation of turbines are erected. This paper presents results from an investigation of failure statistics from four sources, i.e., two separate sources from Sweden, one from Finland, and one from Germany. Statistics reveal reliability performance of the different components within the wind turbine. The gearbox is the most critical, because downtime per failure is high compared to the other components. The statistical data for larger turbines also show trends toward higher, ever-increasing failure frequency when compared to small turbines, which have a decreasing failure rate over the operational years","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2006.889614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4106014","Availability;failures;statistics;reliability;wind power generation","Wind energy;Wind turbines;Power system reliability;Statistics;Frequency;Availability;Power system planning;Preventive maintenance;Books;Mechanical energy","","492","6","15","IEEE","20 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, there may be insufficient resources to allow for the reexecution of all test cases during regression testing. In this situation, test case prioritization techniques aim to improve the effectiveness of regression testing by ordering the test cases so that the most beneficial are executed first. Previous work on regression test case prioritization has focused on Greedy Algorithms. However, it is known that these algorithms may produce suboptimal results because they may construct results that denote only local minima within the search space. By contrast, metaheuristic and evolutionary search algorithms aim to avoid such problems. This paper presents results from an empirical study of the application of several greedy, metaheuristic, and evolutionary search algorithms to six programs, ranging from 374 to 11,148 lines of code for three choices of fitness metric. The paper addresses the problems of choice of fitness metric, characterization of landscape modality, and determination of the most suitable search technique to apply. The empirical results replicate previous results concerning Greedy Algorithms. They shed light on the nature of the regression testing search space, indicating that it is multimodal. The results also show that Genetic Algorithms perform well, although Greedy approaches are surprisingly effective, given the multimodal nature of the landscape.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2007.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4123325","Search techniques;test case prioritization;regression testing.","Greedy algorithms;Cost function;Genetic algorithms;Software testing;Libraries;Fault detection","","492","4","22","IEEE","12 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is found that isolations of more than -20 dB can be achieved between two parallel individual planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) sharing a common ground plane, with inter-antenna spacing (center to center) of 0.116 lambdao and ground plane size 0.331lambdao 2. At 2.31 GHz it is demonstrated that this translates into an edge to edge separation between antennas of just 10 mm. Similarly the structure can be applied to reduce mutual coupling between three or four radiating elements. In addition the mutual coupling between half wavelength patches and monopoles can also be reduced with the aid of the proposed ground plane structure.

Moreover, we discuss how the new QKF can be extended and modified to take into account specific details of a given application. We then go on to extend the use of the new QKF to discrete-time, nonlinear systems with additive, possibly non-Gaussian noise. A bank of parallel QKFs, called the Gaussian sum-quadrature Kalman filter (GS-QKF) approximates the predicted and posterior densities as a finite number of weighted sums of Gaussian densities. The weights are obtained from the residuals of the QKFs. Three different Gaussian mixture reduction techniques are presented to alleviate the growing number of the Gaussian sum terms inherent to the GS-QKFs. Simulation results exhibit a significant improvement of the GS-QKFs over other nonlinear filtering approaches, namely, the basic bootstrap (particle) filters and Gaussian-sum extended Kalman filters, to solve nonlinear non- Gaussian filtering problems.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2007.894705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4266868","Gauss–Hermite Quadrature Rule;Gaussian sum filter;nonlinear filtering;quadrature Kalman filter;statistical linear regression (SLR)","Filtering algorithms;Gaussian processes;Additive noise;Nonlinear systems;Gaussian noise;Testing;Density measurement;Noise measurement;Linear regression;Filters","","489","","63","IEEE","2 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We experiment with different types of motion-direction sensitive units as well as different system architectures.

After discussing several misconceptions and apparently insurmountable obstacles, we propose a general model which, under mild assumptions, will generate provably random bits with some tolerance to adversarial manipulation and running in the megabit-per-second range. A key idea throughout the paper is the fill rate, which measures the fraction of the time domain in which the analog output signal is arguably random. Our study shows that an exponential increase in the number of oscillators is required to obtain a constant factor improvement in the fill rate. Yet, we overcome this problem by introducing a postprocessing step which consists of an application of an appropriate resilient function. These allow the designer to extract random samples only from a signal with only moderate fill rate and, therefore, many fewer oscillators than in other designs. Last, we develop fault-attack models and we employ the properties of resilient functions to withstand such attacks. All of our analysis is based on rigorous methods, enabling us to develop a framework in which we accurately quantify the performance and the degree of resilience of the design","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2007.250627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016501","True (and pseudo) random number generators;resilient functions;cryptography.","","","485","11","21","IEEE","30 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional line of defense against malware is composed of malware detectors such as virus and spyware scanners. Unfortunately, both researchers and malware authors have demonstrated that these scanners, which use pattern matching to identify malware, can be easily evaded by simple code transformations. To address this shortcoming, more powerful malware detectors have been proposed. These tools rely on semantic signatures and employ static analysis techniques such as model checking and theorem proving to perform detection. While it has been shown that these systems are highly effective in identifying current malware, it is less clear how successful they would be against adversaries that take into account the novel detection mechanisms. The goal of this paper is to explore the limits of static analysis for the detection of malicious code. To this end, we present a binary obfuscation scheme that relies on the idea of opaque constants, which are primitives that allow us to load a constant into a register such that an analysis tool cannot determine its value. Based on opaque constants, we build obfuscation transformations that obscure program control flow, disguise access to local and global variables, and interrupt tracking of values held in processor registers. Using our proposed obfuscation approach, we were able to show that advanced semantics-based malware detectors can be evaded. Moreover, our opaque constant primitive can be applied in a way such that is provably hard to analyze for any static code analyzer. This demonstrates that static analysis techniques alone might no longer be sufficient to identify malware.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413008","","Detectors;Registers;Computer security;Face detection;Application software;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Power system modeling;Internet;Databases","","481","23","22","IEEE","2 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first one is to design waveforms that maximize the conditional mutual information (MI) between the random target impulse response and the reflected waveforms given the knowledge of transmitted waveforms. The second one is to find transmitted waveforms that minimize the mean-square error (MSE) in estimating the target impulse response. Our analysis indicates that under the same total power constraint, these two criteria lead to the same solution for a matrix which specifies the essential part of the optimum waveform design.

The EEG recordings of the ambulatory recording systems generate very lengthy data and the detection of the epileptic activity requires a time-consuming analysis of the entire length of the EEG data by an expert. The traditional methods of analysis being tedious, many automated diagnostic systems for epilepsy have emerged in recent years. This paper proposes a neural-network-based automated epileptic EEG detection system that uses approximate entropy (ApEn) as the input feature. ApEn is a statistical parameter that measures the predictability of the current amplitude values of a physiological signal based on its previous amplitude values. It is known that the value of the ApEn drops sharply during an epileptic seizure and this fact is used in the proposed system. Two different types of neural networks, namely, Elman and probabilistic neural networks, are considered in this paper. ApEn is used for the first time in the proposed system for the detection of epilepsy using neural networks. It is shown that the overall accuracy values as high as 100% can be achieved by using the proposed system","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2006.884369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4167902","Approximate entropy (ApEn);artificial neural network (ANN);electroencephalogram (EEG);Elman network (EN);epilepsy;probabilistic neural network (PNN);seizure","Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Entropy;Information technology;Multimedia computing;Electronic mail;Current measurement;Medical treatment","Algorithms;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Entropy;Epilepsy;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","478","1","26","IEEE","30 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that randomly scattered nodes can achieve, with high probability, the same 1/radicn transmission rate of arbitrarily located nodes. This contrasts with previous results suggesting that a 1/radicnlogn reduced rate is the price to pay for the randomness due to the location of the nodes. The network operation strategy to achieve the result corresponds to the transition region between order and disorder of an underlying percolation model. If nodes are allowed to transmit over large distances, then paths of connected nodes that cross the entire network area can be easily found, but these generate excessive interference. If nodes transmit over short distances, then such crossing paths do not exist. Percolation theory ensures that crossing paths form in the transition region between these two extreme scenarios. Nodes along these paths are used as a backbone, relaying data for other nodes, and can transport the total amount of information generated by all the sources. A lower bound on the achievable bit rate is then obtained by performing pairwise coding and decoding at each hop along the paths, and using a time division multiple access scheme","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.890791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4106120","Ad-hoc networks;capacity;percolation theory;scaling laws;throughput;wireless networks","Wireless networks;Bit rate;Physics;Scattering;Probability;Interference;Spine;Relays;Decoding;Time division multiple access","","477","5","19","IEEE","20 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The compression method is based on the multiple reference picture technique in the H.264/AVC video coding standard. The idea is to exploit the statistical dependencies from both temporal and inter-view reference pictures for motion-compensated prediction. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by an experimental analysis of temporal versus inter-view prediction in terms of the Lagrange cost function. The results show that prediction with temporal reference pictures is highly efficient, but for 20% of a picture's blocks on average prediction with reference pictures from adjacent views is more efficient. Hierarchical B pictures are used as basic structure for temporal prediction. Their advantages are combined with inter-view prediction for different temporal hierarchy levels, starting from simulcast coding with no inter-view prediction up to full level inter-view prediction. When using inter-view prediction at key picture temporal levels, average gains of 1.4-dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are reported, while additionally using inter-view prediction at nonkey picture temporal levels, average gains of 1.6-dB PSNR are reported. For some cases, gains of more than 3 dB, corresponding to bit-rate savings of up to 50%, are obtained.

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by training each class separately tend to be more object-specific. The generic features generalize better and considerably reduce the computational cost of multiclass object detection","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4135679","Object detection;interclass transfer;sharing features;boosting;multiclass.","Object detection;Detectors;Runtime;Training data;Layout;Batteries;Computational complexity;Costs;Computational efficiency;Boosting","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","475","17","37","IEEE","19 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Signals transmitted from one user to another at distance r apart are subject to a power loss of r-alpha as well as a random phase. We identify the scaling laws of the information-theoretic capacity of the network when nodes can relay information for each other. In the case of dense networks, where the area is fixed and the density of nodes increasing, we show that the total capacity of the network scales linearly with n. This improves on the best known achievability result of n2/3 of Aeron and Saligrama. In the case of extended networks, where the density of nodes is fixed and the area increasing linearly with n, we show that this capacity scales as n2-alpha/2 for 2lesalpha<3 and radicn for a alphages3. The best known earlier result of Xie and Kumar identified the scaling law for alpha > 4. Thus, much better scaling than multihop can be achieved in dense networks, as well as in extended networks with low attenuation. The performance gain is achieved by intelligent node cooperation and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication.

The method is applied to experimental RF data from a heart phantom, in which we show increased resolution and improved definition of the ventricular walls. A potential weakness of adaptive beamformers is sensitivity to errors in the assumed wavefield parameters. We look at two ways to increase robustness of the proposed method; spatial smoothing and diagonal loading. We show that both are controlled by a single parameter that can move the performance from that of a MV beamformer to that of a DAS beamformer.

Instead of postulating a statistical model for the wavelet coefficients, we directly parametrize the denoising process as a sum of elementary nonlinear processes with unknown weights. We then minimize an estimate of the mean square error between the clean image and the denoised one. The key point is that we have at our disposal a very accurate, statistically unbiased, MSE estimate-Stein's unbiased risk estimate-that depends on the noisy image alone, not on the clean one. Like the MSE, this estimate is quadratic in the unknown weights, and its minimization amounts to solving a linear system of equations. The existence of this a priori estimate makes it unnecessary to devise a specific statistical model for the wavelet coefficients. Instead, and contrary to the custom in the literature, these coefficients are not considered random any more. We describe an interscale orthonormal wavelet thresholding algorithm based on this new approach and show its near-optimal performance-both regarding quality and CPU requirement-by comparing it with the results of three state-of-the-art nonredundant denoising algorithms on a large set of test images.

For example, in text clustering, clusters of documents of different topics are categorized by different subsets of terms or keywords. The keywords for one cluster may not occur in the documents of other clusters. This is a data sparsity problem faced in clustering high-dimensional data. In the new algorithm, we extend the k-means clustering process to calculate a weight for each dimension in each cluster and use the weight values to identify the subsets of important dimensions that categorize different clusters. This is achieved by including the weight entropy in the objective function that is minimized in the k-means clustering process. An additional step is added to the k-means clustering process to automatically compute the weights of all dimensions in each cluster. The experiments on both synthetic and real data have shown that the new algorithm can generate better clustering results than other subspace clustering algorithms.

This paper performs analysis and develops a solution for locating a moving source using time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements in the presence of random errors in receiver locations. The analysis starts with the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the problem, and derives the increase in mean-square error (MSE) in source location estimate if the receiver locations are assumed correct but in fact have error. A solution is then proposed that takes the receiver error into account to reduce the estimation error, and it is shown analytically, under some mild approximations, to achieve the CRLB accuracy for far-field sources.

In HGPP, the quadrant-bit codes are first extracted from faces based on the Gabor transformation. Global Gabor phase pattern (GGPP) and local Gabor phase pattern (LGPP) are then proposed to encode the phase variations. GGPP captures the variations derived from the orientation changing of Gabor wavelet at a given scale (frequency), while LGPP encodes the local neighborhood variations by using a novel local XOR pattern (LXP) operator. They are both divided into the nonoverlapping rectangular regions, from which spatial histograms are extracted and concatenated into an extended histogram feature to represent the original image. Finally, the recognition is performed by using the nearest-neighbor classifier with histogram intersection as the similarity measurement. The features of HGPP lie in two aspects: 1) HGPP can describe the general face images robustly without the training procedure; 2) HGPP encodes the Gabor phase information, while most previous face recognition methods exploit the Gabor magnitude information. In addition, Fisher separation criterion is further used to improve the performance of HGPP by weighing the subregions of the image according to their discriminative powers. The proposed methods are successfully applied to face recognition, and the experiment results on the large-scale FERET and CAS-PEAL databases show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform other well-known systems in terms of recognition rate","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2006.884956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032834","Face recognition;feature extraction;Gabor;histogram;local pattern;phase pattern","Histograms;Face recognition;Frequency;Feature extraction;Robustness;Image databases;Pattern recognition;Computers;Concatenated codes;Performance evaluation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Cluster Analysis;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated","463","1","34","IEEE","19 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting optimal step nonrigid ICP framework allows the use of different regularisations, as long as they have an adjustable stiffness parameter. The registration loops over a series of decreasing stiffness weights, and incrementally deforms the template towards the target, recovering the whole range of global and local deformations. To find the optimal deformation for a given stiffness, optimal iterative closest point steps are used. Preliminary correspondences are estimated by a nearest-point search. Then the optimal deformation of the template for these fixed correspondences and the active stiffness is calculated. Afterwards the process continues with new correspondences found by searching from the displaced template vertices. We present an algorithm using a locally affine regularisation which assigns an affine transformation to each vertex and minimises the difference in the transformation of neighbouring vertices. It is shown that for this regularisation the optimal deformation for fixed correspondences and fixed stiffness can be determined exactly and efficiently. The method succeeds for a wide range of initial conditions, and handles missing data robustly. It is compared qualitatively and quantitatively to other algorithms using synthetic examples and real world data.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270190","","Iterative closest point algorithm;Iterative algorithms;Convergence;Head;Scholarships;Humans;Noise robustness;Shape;Material properties;Smoothing methods","","460","19","15","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MTJs consist of two metal ferromagnets separated by a thin insulator and exhibit two resistances, low (Rp) or high (Rap) depending on the relative direction of ferromagnet magnetizations, parallel (P) or antiparallel (AP), respectively. Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios, defined as (Rap $Rp)/Rp as high as 361%, have been obtained in MTJs with Co40Fe40B20 fixed and free layers made by sputtering with an industry-standard exchange-bias structure and post deposition annealing at Ta = 400 degC. The corresponding output voltage swing DeltaV is over 500 mV, which is five times greater than that of the conventional amorphous Al-O-barrier MTJs. The highest TMR ratio obtained so far is 500% in a pseudospin-valve MTJ annealed at Ta = 475 degC, showing a high potential of the current material system. In addition to this high-output voltage swing, current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) takes place at the critical current densities (JCO) on the order of 106 A/cm2 in these MgO-barrier MTJs. Furthermore, high antiferromagnetic coupling between the two CoFeB layers in a synthetic ferrimagnetic free layer has been shown to result in a high thermal-stability factor with a reduced JCO compared to single free-layer MTJs. The high TMR ratio enabled by the MgO-barrier MTJs, together with the demonstration of CIMS at a low JCO, allows development of not only scalable magnetoresistive random-access memory with feature sizes below 90 nm but also new memory-in-logic CMOS circuits that can overcome a number of bottlenecks in the current integrated-circuit architecture","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.894617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4160113","CoFeB electrode;magnetoresistive random-access memories (MRAMs);memory-in-logic CMOS circuit;MgO barrier;spintronics;tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR)","","","457","24","111","IEEE","23 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our algorithm detects changes by finding a match between nodes of the compared two abstract syntax trees and a minimum edit script. We can identify change types between program versions according to our taxonomy of source code changes. We evaluated our change distilling algorithm with a benchmark we developed that consists of 1,064 manually classified changes in 219 revisions from three different open source projects. We achieved significant improvements in extracting types of source code changes: our algorithm approximates the minimum edit script by 45% better than the original change extraction approach by Chawathe et al. We are able to find all occurring changes and almost reach the minimum conforming edit script, i.e., we reach a mean absolute percentage error of 34%, compared to 79% reached by the original algorithm.

A drawback of the DFIG is that it is very sensitive to grid disturbances, especially to voltage dips. However, the operation of the machine in these situations has only been studied in the literature by means of simulations. This paper develops a theoretical analysis of the dynamic behavior of the induction machine during three-phase voltage dips.

Accurate forecasts of wind generation are therefore paramount for reducing such penalties and thus maximizing revenue. Despite the fact that increasing accuracy in spot forecasts may reduce penalties, this paper shows that, if such forecasts are accompanied with information on their uncertainty, i.e., in the form of predictive distributions, then this can be the basis for defining advanced strategies for market participation. Such strategies permit to further increase revenues and thus enhance competitiveness of wind generation compared to other forms of dispatchable generation. This paper formulates a general methodology for deriving optimal bidding strategies based on probabilistic forecasts of wind generation, as well as on modeling of the sensitivity a wind power producer may have to regulation costs. The benefits resulting from the application of these strategies are clearly demonstrated on the test case of the participation of a multi-MW wind farm in the Dutch electricity market over a year.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4282048","Decision-making;energy markets;forecasting;uncertainty;wind energy","Wind forecasting;Wind power generation;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Wind energy;Economic forecasting;Electricity supply industry;Costs;Uncertainty;Predictive models","","448","","29","IEEE","30 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective of HEV control is in fact to find out the sequence of optimal power splits at each instant of time that minimizes the fuel consumption over a given driving schedule. Big obstacles to the control design are the model complexity and the necessity of ""a priori"" knowledge of torque and velocity profiles. This paper presents three different energy management approaches for the control of a parallel hybrid electric sport-utility-vehicle that do not require a priori knowledge of the driving cycle.

However, even in thus-constrained applications, most existing systems, academic and commercial, are compromised in accuracy by changes in environmental illumination. In this paper, we present a novel solution for illumination invariant face recognition for indoor, cooperative-user applications. First, we present an active near infrared (NIR) imaging system that is able to produce face images of good condition regardless of visible lights in the environment. Second, we show that the resulting face images encode intrinsic information of the face, subject only to a monotonic transform in the gray tone; based on this, we use local binary pattern (LBP) features to compensate for the monotonic transform, thus deriving an illumination invariant face representation. Then, we present methods for face recognition using NIR images; statistical learning algorithms are used to extract most discriminative features from a large pool of invariant LBP features and construct a highly accurate face matching engine. Finally, we present a system that is able to achieve accurate and fast face recognition in practice, in which a method is provided to deal with specular reflections of active NIR lights on eyeglasses, a critical issue in active NIR image-based face recognition. Extensive, comparative results are provided to evaluate the imaging hardware, the face and eye detection algorithms, and the face recognition algorithms and systems, with respect to various factors, including illumination, eyeglasses, time lapse, and ethnic groups","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107567","Biometrics;face recognition;near infrared (NIR);illumination invariant;local binary pattern (LBP);statistical learning.","Lighting;Face recognition;Infrared imaging;Optical imaging;Statistical learning;Feature extraction;Engines;Optical reflection;Hardware;Face detection","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Face;Humans;Lighting;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Skin Physiology;Spectrophotometry, Infrared;Thermography","446","8","52","IEEE","20 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Within this constraint, two aggressive measurement objectives are 1) full characterization and exploitation of the backscattered field, and 2) invariance to geometrical orientations of features in the scene. Full characterization implies coherent dual-polarization to support the four Stokes parameters. These are rotationally invariant with respect backscatterer orientation if and only if the transmission is circularly polarized. Given that the data products are the Stokes parameters, the receivers can use any orthogonal polarization basis. A SAR in hybrid-polarity architecture (CL-pol) transmits circular polarization and receives two orthogonal mutually coherent linear polarizations, which is one manifestation of compact polarimetry. The resulting radar is relatively simple to implement, and has unique self-calibration features and low susceptibility to noise and cross-channel errors. It is the architecture of choice for two lunar radars scheduled for launch in 2008. Data from a CL-pol SAR yield to decomposition strategies such as the m-delta method introduced in this paper.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.895883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358849","Calibration;circular polarization;compact polarimetry;decomposition;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);Calibration;circular polarization;compact polarimetry;decomposition;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Polarization;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar;Stokes parameters;Extraterrestrial measurements;Backscatter;Layout;Moon;Costs;Radar imaging","","446","2","38","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their performance is investigated with ray-tracing simulations of a terahertz propagation channel in a dynamic office environment, which is calibrated with measured building-material and mirror parameters. We demonstrate that a directed NLOS path scheme will make a terahertz communication system robust to shadowing.

It is one important aspect of the algorithm that it considers the input image as a periodic image. To overcome this problem, we use a folded algorithm by extending the image symmetrically about its borders. Finally, we list various numerical results on denoising real images.

The observed symbols are first modeled as channel responses in a multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) model, while the channel inputs are conceptually considered sparse positive pulse trains carrying the information about the symbol arising times. Our decomposition approach compensates channel responses and aims at reconstructing the input pulse trains directly. The algorithm is derived first for the overdetermined noiseless MIMO case. A generalized scheme is then provided for the underdetermined mixtures in noisy environments. Although blind, the proposed technique approaches Bayesian optimal linear minimum mean square error estimator and is, hence, significantly noise resistant. The results of simulation tests prove it can be applied to considerably underdetermined convolutive mixtures and even to the mixtures of moderately correlated input pulse trains, with their cross-correlation up to 10% of its maximum possible value.

Our results indicate that the superior performance of a particular similarity coefficient, used to analyze the program spectra, is largely independent of test design. Furthermore, near- optimal diagnostic accuracy (exonerating about 80% of the blocks of code on average) is already obtained for low-quality error observations and limited numbers of test cases.

This paper introduces a new energy minimization framework for phase unwrapping. The considered objective functions are first-order Markov random fields. We provide an exact energy minimization algorithm, whenever the corresponding clique potentials are convex, namely for the phase unwrapping classical Lp norm, with pges1. Its complexity is KT(n,3n), where K is the length of the absolute phase domain measured in 2pi units and T(n,m) is the complexity of a max-flow computation in a graph with n nodes and m edges. For nonconvex clique potentials, often used owing to their discontinuity preserving ability, we face an NP-hard problem for which we devise an approximate solution.

The results for continuous-wave (CW) and Q-switched operation as well as for amplification of short (nanosecond) and ultrashort (picosecond, femtosecond) pulses demonstrate the potential of the thin-disk laser design. The scaling laws for this laser design show that the power limit for CW operation is far beyond 40 kW for one single disk and the energy limit is higher than 3 J from one disk in pulsed operation. Also, the applicability of the thin-disk laser concept to optically pumped semiconductor structures will be discussed. When pumping directly into the quantum wells, the energy defect between the pump photon and the laser photon can be smaller than 5%, thus reducing the waste heat generated inside the semiconductor structure. First results demonstrate the potential of this new concept.

Optimizing for surface normals within a photoconsistency measure significantly improves the matching results.

Specifically, our proposed scheme aims at maximizing the system throughput subject to a given delay QoS constraint. First, we derive an optimal adaptation policy by integrating information theory with the concept of effective capacity for a block fading channel model. Our analyses reveal an important fact that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between throughput and QoS provisioning. In particular, when the QoS constraint becomes loose, the optimal power-control policy converges to the well-known water-filling scheme, where Shannon (ergodic) capacity can be achieved. On the other hand, when the QoS constraint gets stringent, the optimal policy converges to the total channel inversion scheme under which the system operates at a constant rate. Inspired by the above observations, we then consider a more practical scenario where variable-power adaptive modulation is employed over both block fading and Markov correlated fading channels. In both cases, we derive the associated power and rate adaptation policies. The obtained results suggest that the channel correlation has a significant impact on QoS-driven power and rate adaptations. The higher the correlation is, the faster the power-control policy converges to the total channel inversion when the QoS constraint becomes more stringent. Finally, we conduct simulations to verify that the adaptation policy proposed for Markov channel models can also be applied to the more general channel models.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.051075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4290047","","Quality of service;Delay;Wireless networks;Fading;Throughput;Information theory;Power system modeling;Power control;Programmable control;Adaptive control","","426","","22","IEEE","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The degree of evolution of the local statistics is measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. An analytical expression for this detector is given, allowing a simple computation which depends on the four first statistical moments of the pixels inside the analysis window only. The proposed change indicator is compared to the classical mean ratio detector and also to other model-based approaches. Tests on the simulated and real data show that our detector outperforms all the others. The fast computation of the proposed detector allows a multiscale approach in the change detection for operational use.

Nanoscale EMs (nEMs) particularly offer the promise of much higher energy densities, faster rate of energy release, greater stability, and more security (sensitivity to unwanted initiation). nEMs could therefore give response to microenergetics challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of current research activities in nEMs for microenergetics application. While thermodynamic calculations of flame temperature and reaction enthalpies are tools to choose desirable EMs, they are not sufficient for the choice of good material for microscale application where thermal losses are very penalizing. A strategy to select nEM is therefore proposed based on an analysis of the material diffusivity and heat of reaction. Finally, after a description of the different nEMs synthesis approaches, some guidelines for future investigations are provided.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2007.893519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4285648","Materials processing;materials science and technology;microelectromechanical devices;microelectromechanical system (MEMS);micropyrotechnics;nanoscale energetic materials (nEMs);propulsion;synthesis;thermal power generation","Nanostructured materials;Micromechanical devices;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Propulsion;Stability;Power system security;Thermodynamics;Fires;Temperature sensors;Guidelines","","421","4","35","IEEE","8 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

UDP characterizes the local scatter as well as the nonlocal scatter, seeking to find a projection that simultaneously maximizes the nonlocal scatter and minimizes the local scatter. This characteristic makes UDP more intuitive and more powerful than the most up-to-date method, locality preserving projection (LPP), which considers only the local scatter for clustering or classification tasks. The proposed method is applied to face and palm biometrics and is examined using the Yale, FERET, and AR face image databases and the PolyU palmprint database.

Two control strategies where developed: one based on heuristics and the other based on an optimization model using neural networks. These strategies were translated to algorithms and implemented in a digital signal processor, and their performance was evaluated in urban driving. The results were incorporated to an economic evaluation of the system, which shows that the reduction in costs would only justify the inclusion of this type of system in a lead-acid battery-powered vehicle if the battery life is extended by 50% or more, which is unlikely. The same results were extrapolated to a case in which the lead-acid batteries are replaced by a fuel cell. In this case, the costs of different power support systems were evaluated, such as ultracapacitors and high-specific-power lithium-based batteries.

No explicit computation of reachable sets is required in the construction of barrier certificates, which makes it possible to handle nonlinearity, uncertainty, and constraints directly within this framework. In the stochastic setting, our method computes an upper bound on the probability that a trajectory of the system reaches the unsafe set, a bound whose validity is proven by the existence of a barrier certificate. For polynomial systems, barrier certificates can be constructed using convex optimization, and hence the method is computationally tractable.

In addition to the average angular error used in Barron et al., we compute the absolute flow endpoint error, measures for frame interpolation error, improved statistics, and flow accuracy at motion boundaries and in textureless regions.

Two design methods are provided, which give controller transfer functions with superior frequency response. The complete current controller is realized as the superposition of all individual harmonic controllers. The frequency response of the entire closed loop control is optimal with respect to filtering objectives, i.e., the system provides good overall stability and excellent selectivity for interesting harmonics.

Pedestrian safety measures, including infrastructure enhancements and passive safety features in vehicles, are described, followed by a systematic description of active safety systems based on pedestrian detection using sensors in vehicle and infrastructure. The pedestrian detection approaches are classified according to various criteria such as the type and configuration of sensors, as well as the video cues and classifiers used in detection algorithms.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a distributed beamforming approach to this problem, with a cluster of distributed transmitters emulating a centralized antenna array so as to transmit a common message signal coherently to a distant base station. The potential SNR gains from beamforming are well-known. However, realizing these gains requires synchronization of the individual carrier signals in phase and frequency. In this paper we show that a large fraction of the beamforming gains can be realised even with imperfect synchronization corresponding to phase errors with moderately large variance. We present a master-slave architecture where a designated master transmitter coordinates the synchronization of other (slave) transmitters for beamforming. We observe that the transmitters can achieve distributed beamforming with minimal coordination with the base station using channel reciprocity. Thus, inexpensive local coordination with a master transmitter makes the expensive communication with a distant base station receiver more efficient. However, the duplexing constraints of the wireless channel place a fundamental limitation on the achievable accuracy of synchronization. We present a stochastic analysis that demonstrates the robustness of beamforming gains with imperfect synchronization, and demonstrate a tradeoff between synchronization overhead and beamforming gains. We also present simulation results for the phase errors that validate the analysis","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.360377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4202181","","Array signal processing;Wireless networks;Frequency synchronization;Transmitters;Base stations;Wireless sensor networks;Master-slave;Energy efficiency;Transmitting antennas;Antenna arrays","","415","17","16","IEEE","21 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a unified view of several recently proposed algorithms for handling this class of optimization problems, placing them in a common majorization-minimization (MM) framework. One of the classes of algorithms considered (when using quadratic bounds on nondifferentiable log-priors) shares the infamous ¿singularity issue¿ (SI) of ¿iteratively re weighted least squares¿ (IRLS) algorithms: the possibility of having to handle infinite weights, which may cause both numerical and convergence issues. In this paper, we prove several new results which strongly support the claim that the SI does not compromise the usefulness of this class of algorithms. Exploiting the unified MM perspective, we introduce a new algorithm, resulting from using bounds for nonconvex regularizers; the experiments confirm the superior performance of this method, when compared to the one based on quadratic majorization. Finally, an experimental comparison of the several algorithms, reveals their relative merits for different standard types of scenarios.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.909318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358845","Image deconvolution;image restoration;majorization–minimization (MM) algorithms;optimization;regularization;wavelets;Image deconvolution;image restoration;majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms;optimization;regularization;wavelets","Image restoration;Noise reduction;Iterative algorithms;Deconvolution;Optimization methods;Convolution;Convergence of numerical methods;Image denoising;Computational efficiency;Telecommunications","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","414","3","53","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These on-chip caches will heavily impact processor performance, power dissipation, and thermal management strategies. There are a number of interconnect design considerations that influence power/performance/area characteristics of large caches, such as wire models (width/spacing/repeaters), signaling strategy (RC/differential/transmission), router design, etc. Yet, to date, there exists no analytical tool that takes all of these parameters into account to carry out a design space exploration for large caches and estimate an optimal organization. In this work, we implement two major extensions to the CACTI cache modeling tool that focus on interconnect design for a large cache. First, we add the ability to model different types of wires, such as RC-based wires with different power/delay characteristics and differential low-swing buses. Second, we add the ability to model non-uniform cache access (NUCA). We not only adopt state-of-the-art design space exploration strategies for NUCA, we also enhance this exploration by considering on-chip network contention and a wider spectrum of wiring and routing choices. We present a validation analysis of the new tool (to be released as CACTI 6.0) and present a case study to showcase how the tool can improve architecture research methodologies.","2379-3155","978-0-7695-3047-5","10.1109/MICRO.2007.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408241","","Wiring;Thermal management;Signal design;Space exploration;Wires;Microprocessors;Power dissipation;Energy management;Repeaters;Delay","","408","12","44","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An internal MES measurement should have less muscular crosstalk allowing for more independent control sites. However, it remains unclear if this benefit outweighs the loss of the more global information contained in the surface MES. This paper compares the classification accuracy of six pattern recognition-based myoelectric controllers which use multi-channel surface MES as inputs to the same controllers which use multi-channel intramuscular MES as inputs. An experiment was designed during which surface and intramuscular MES were collected simultaneously for 10 different classes of isometric contraction. There was no significant difference in classification accuracy as a result of using the intramuscular MES measurement technique when compared to the surface MES measurement technique.

In the proposed PSO-based MA (PSOMA), both PSO-based searching operators and some special local searching operators are designed to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. In particular, the PSOMA applies the evolutionary searching mechanism of PSO, which is characterized by individual improvement, population cooperation, and competition to effectively perform exploration. On the other hand, the PSOMA utilizes several adaptive local searches to perform exploitation. First, to make PSO suitable for solving PFSSP, a ranked-order value rule based on random key representation is presented to convert the continuous position values of particles to job permutations. Second, to generate an initial swarm with certain quality and diversity, the famous Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic is incorporated into the initialization of population. Third, to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, after the standard PSO-based searching operation, a new local search technique named NEH_1 insertion is probabilistically applied to some good particles selected by using a roulette wheel mechanism with a specified probability. Fourth, to enrich the searching behaviors and to avoid premature convergence, a simulated annealing (SA)-based local search with multiple different neighborhoods is designed and incorporated into the PSOMA. Meanwhile, an effective adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy is employed to decide which neighborhood to be used in SA-based local search. Finally, to further enhance the exploitation ability, a pairwise-based local search is applied after the SA-based search. Simulation results based on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSOMA.

These characteristics shed light on the key routing performance metrics of interest in disconnected VANETs, such as the average time taken to propagate a packet to disconnected nodes (i.e., the re-healing time). Our results show that, depending on the sparsity of vehicles or the market penetration rate of cars using Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) technology, the network re-healing time can vary from a few seconds to several minutes. This suggests that, for vehicular safety applications, a new ad hoc routing protocol will be needed as the conventional ad hoc routing protocols such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) will not work with such long re-healing times. In addition, the developed analytical framework and its predictions provide valuable insights into the VANET routing performance in the disconnected network regime.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.071005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4346442","","Wireless networks;Routing protocols;Ad hoc networks;Wireless communication;Road vehicles;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Measurement;Optical propagation;Communications technology","","405","1","27","IEEE","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This fading can be mitigated by the use of antenna diversity, and gains of up to 10 dB are obtained. Separation of the antenna's performance from the channel characteristics is difficult, but results show that for many channels, an antenna polarized normal to the body's surface gives the best path gain.

A systematic procedure to construct a family of finite-dimensional LMI relaxations is provided. The robust stability is assessed by means of the existence of a Lyapunov function, more specifically, a homogeneous polynomially parameter-dependent Lyapunov (HPPDL) function of arbitrary degree. For a given degree , if an HPPDL solution exists, a sequence of relaxations based on real algebraic properties provides sufficient LMI conditions of increasing precision and constant number of decision variables for the existence of an HPPDL function which tend to the necessity. Alternatively, if an HPPDL solution of degree exists, a sequence of relaxations which increases the number of variables and the number of LMIs will provide an HPPDL solution of larger degree. The method proposed can be applied to determine homogeneous parameter-dependent matrix solutions to a wide variety of PD-LMIs by transforming the infinite-dimensional LMI problem described in terms of uncertain parameters belonging to the unit simplex in a sequence of finite-dimensional LMI conditions which converges to the necessary conditions for the existence of a homogeneous polynomially parameter-dependent solution of arbitrary degree.

Unfortunately, beamforming requires the transmitter to have knowledge of the forward-link channel which is often not available a priori. One way of overcoming this problem is to design the beamforming vector using a limited number of feedback bits sent from the receiver to the transmitter. In limited feedback beamforming, the beamforming vector is restricted to lie in a codebook that is known to both the transmitter and receiver. Random vector quantization (RVQ) is a simple approach to codebook design that generates the vectors independently from a uniform distribution on the complex unit sphere.

The objective of this article is to illustrate the use of systems theory to analyze emergent behaviors in animal groups and to design autonomous and reliable robotic networks. We present and survey some recently developed theoretical tools for modeling, analysis, and design of motion coordination algorithms in both continuous and discrete time. We pay special attention to the distributed character of coordination algorithms, the characterization of their performance, and the development of design methodologies that provide mobile networks with provably correct cooperative strategies.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2007.384124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272330","","Robot kinematics;Algorithm design and analysis;Biological systems;Remotely operated vehicles;Biosensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Mobile robots;Robot sensing systems;Autonomous agents","","400","","54","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

For this purpose, a flow field generated by a moving crowd is treated as an aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a numerical integration scheme. The evolution of particles through the flow is tracked using a flow map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to setup a Cauchy Green deformation tensor for quantifying the amount by which the neighboring particles have diverged over the length of the integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is used to construct a finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively different dynamics and are used to locate boundaries of the flow segments in a normalized cuts framework. Any change in the number of flow segments over time is regarded as an instability, which is detected by establishing correspondences between flow segments over time. The experiments are conducted on a challenging set of videos taken from Google Video and a National Geographic documentary.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.382977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270002","","Lagrangian functions;Stability analysis;Layout;Computer vision;Bridges;Cities and towns;Safety;Tensile stress;Videos;Fluid dynamics","","396","","17","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A modified version of this model is used in several Bayesian filters, including the Extended Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Smoother, and Unscented Kalman Filter. An automatic parameter selection method is also introduced, to facilitate the adaptation of the model parameters to a vast variety of ECGs. This approach is evaluated on several normal ECGs, by artificially adding white and colored Gaussian noises to visually inspected clean ECG recordings, and studying the SNR and morphology of the filter outputs. The results of the study demonstrate superior results compared with conventional ECG denoising approaches such as bandpass filtering, adaptive filtering, and wavelet denoising, over a wide range of ECG SNRs. The method is also successfully evaluated on real nonstationary muscle artifact. This method may therefore serve as an effective framework for the model-based filtering of noisy ECG recordings.

The design challenge is compounded further by the need to take user traffic demands into consideration. This paper proposes a centralized utility maximization framework for such a network. We show that for a cellular system employing orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA), the optimization of physical-layer transmission strategies can be done efficiently by introducing a set of pricing variables as weighting factors. The proposed solution incorporates both user traffic demands and the physical channel realizations in a cross-layer design that not only allocates power and bandwidth optimally for each user, but also selects the best relay node and best relay strategy (i.e. decode-and-forward vs. amplify-and-forward) for each source-destination pair","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.070209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107952","","Relays;Resource management;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Cellular networks;Base stations;Wireless networks;Radio spectrum management;Power system relaying","","392","2","42","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model permits a polarization basis invariant representation of coherent target scattering in terms of five independent target parameters, the magnitude and phase of the symmetric scattering type introduced in this paper, and the maximum polarization parameters (orientation, helicity, and maximum return). The new scattering vector model served for the assessment of the Cloude-Pottier incoherent target decomposition. Whereas the Cloude-Pottier scattering type alpha and entropy H are roll invariant, beta and the so-called target-phase parameters do depend on the target orientation angle for asymmetric scattering. The scattering vector model is then used as the basis for the development of new coherent and incoherent target decompositions in terms of unique and roll-invariant target parameters. It is shown that both the phase and magnitude of the symmetric scattering type should be used for an unambiguous description of symmetric target scattering. Target helicity is required for the assessment of the symmetry-asymmetry nature of target scattering.

We therefore propose a novel iterative approach that first infers scene geometry using Belief Propagation and then resolves interactions between objects using a global optimization procedure. This approach leads to a robust solution in few iterations, while allowing object detection to benefit from geometry estimation and vice versa.

While cryptography is a powerful tool to achieve information security, one of the main challenges in cryptosystems is to maintain the secrecy of the cryptographic keys. Though biometric authentication can be used to ensure that only the legitimate user has access to the secret keys, a biometric system itself is vulnerable to a number of threats. A critical issue in biometric systems is to protect the template of a user which is typically stored in a database or a smart card. The fuzzy vault construct is a biometric cryptosystem that secures both the secret key and the biometric template by binding them within a cryptographic framework. We present a fully automatic implementation of the fuzzy vault scheme based on fingerprint minutiae. Since the fuzzy vault stores only a transformed version of the template, aligning the query fingerprint with the template is a challenging task. We extract high curvature points derived from the fingerprint orientation field and use them as helper data to align the template and query minutiae. The helper data itself do not leak any information about the minutiae template, yet contain sufficient information to align the template and query fingerprints accurately. Further, we apply a minutiae matcher during decoding to account for nonlinear distortion and this leads to significant improvement in the genuine accept rate. We demonstrate the performance of the vault implementation on two different fingerprint databases. We also show that performance improvement can be achieved by using multiple fingerprint impressions during enrollment and verification.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.908165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378259","Biometric cryptosystems;fingerprint alignment;fuzzy vault;helper data;minutiae;minutiae mosaicing;polynomial reconstruction","Fingerprint recognition;Cryptography;Biometrics;Information security;Databases;Maintenance;Authentication;Protection;Smart cards;Data mining","","388","5","37","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wavelet analysis is used to decompose the EEG into delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma sub-bands. Three parameters are employed for EEG representation: standard deviation (quantifying the signal variance), correlation dimension, and largest Lyapunov exponent (quantifying the non-linear chaotic dynamics of the signal). The classification accuracies of the following techniques are compared: 1) unsupervised-means clustering; 2) linear and quadratic discriminant analysis; 3) radial basis function neural network; 4) Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural network (LMBPNN). To reduce the computing time and output analysis, the research was performed in two phases: band-specific analysis and mixed-band analysis. In phase two, over 500 different combinations of mixed-band feature spaces consisting of promising parameters from phase one of the research were investigated. It is concluded that all three key components of the wavelet-chaos-neural network methodology are important for improving the EEG classification accuracy. Judicious combinations of parameters and classifiers are needed to accurately discriminate between the three types of EEGs.

The conventional nonregenerative approach is the amplify and forward (A&F) approach, where the signal received at the relay is simply amplified and retransmitted. In this paper, we propose an alternative linear transceiver design for nonregenerative relaying (including pure relaying and the cooperative transmission cases), making proper use of CSI at the relay station. Specifically, we design the optimum linear filtering performed on the data to be forwarded at the relay. As optimization criteria, we have considered the maximization of mutual information (that provides an information rate for which reliable communication is possible) for a given available transmission power at the relay station. Three different levels of CSI can be considered at the relay station: only first hop channel information (between the source and relay); first hop channel and second hop channel (between relay and destination) information, or a third situation where the relay may have complete cooperative channel information including all the links: first and second hop channels and also the direct channel between source and destination. Despite the latter being a more unrealistic situation, since it requires the destination to inform the relay station about the direct channel, it is useful as an upper benchmark.

The amplifier appears to be the lowest power and most energy-efficient neural recording amplifier reported to date. We describe low-noise design techniques that help the neural amplifier achieve input-referred noise that is near the theoretical limit of any amplifier using a differential pair as an input stage. Since neural amplifiers must include differential input pairs in practice to allow robust rejection of common-mode and power supply noise, our design appears to be near the optimum allowed by theory. The bandwidth of the amplifier can be adjusted for recording either neural spikes or local field potentials (LFPs). When configured for recording neural spikes, the amplifier yielded a midband gain of 40.8 dB and a -3-dB bandwidth from 45 Hz to 5.32 kHz; the amplifier's input-referred noise was measured to be 3.06 muVrms while consuming 7.56 muW of power from a 2.8-V supply corresponding to a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 2.67 with the theoretical limit being 2.02. When configured for recording LFPs, the amplifier achieved a midband gain of 40.9 dB and a -3-dB bandwidth from 392 mHz to 295 Hz; the input-referred noise was 1.66 muVrms while consuming 2.08 muW from a 2.8-V supply corresponding to an NEF of 3.21.

We developed new and very effective techniques for automatic writer identification and verification that use probability distribution functions (PDFs) extracted from the handwriting images to characterize writer individuality. A defining property of our methods is that they are designed to be independent of the textual content of the handwritten samples. Our methods operate at two levels of analysis: the texture level and the character-shape (allograph) level. At the texture level, we use contour-based joint directional PDFs that encode orientation and curvature information to give an intimate characterization of individual handwriting style. In our analysis at the allograph level, the writer is considered to be characterized by a stochastic pattern generator of ink-trace fragments, or graphemes. The PDF of these simple shapes in a given handwriting sample is characteristic for the writer and is computed using a common shape codebook obtained by grapheme clustering. Combining multiple features (directional, grapheme, and run-length PDFs) yields increased writer identification and verification performance. The proposed methods are applicable to free-style handwriting (both cursive and isolated) and have practical feasibility, under the assumption that a few text lines of handwritten material are available in order to obtain reliable probability estimates","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107573","Handwriting analysis;writer identification and verification;behavioral biometrics;joint directional probability distributions;grapheme-emission probability distribution.","Biometrics;Shape;Forensics;Text analysis;Image analysis;Probability distribution;Image texture analysis;Pattern analysis;Stochastic processes;Character generation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Biometry;Handwriting;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","374","","26","IEEE","20 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been shown in previous studies that the brain-wave pattern of every individual is unique and that the electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used for biometric identification. EEG-based biometry is an emerging research topic and we believe that it may open new research directions and applications in the future. However, very little work has been done in this area and was focusing mainly on person identification but not on person authentication. Person authentication aims to accept or to reject a person claiming an identity, i.e., comparing a biometric data to one template, while the goal of person identification is to match the biometric data against all the records in a database. We propose the use of a statistical framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models and Maximum A Posteriori model adaptation, successfully applied to speaker and face authentication, which can deal with only one training session. We perform intensive experimental simulations using several strict train/test protocols to show the potential of our method.

Our algorithm is multimodal (2D and 3D) and performs hybrid (feature based and holistic) matching in order to achieve efficiency and robustness to facial expressions. The pose of a 3D face along with its texture is automatically corrected using a novel approach based on a single automatically detected point and the Hotelling transform. A novel 3D spherical face representation (SFR) is used in conjunction with the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor to form a rejection classifier, which quickly eliminates a large number of candidate faces at an early stage for efficient recognition in case of large galleries. The remaining faces are then verified using a novel region-based matching approach, which is robust to facial expressions. This approach automatically segments the eyes- forehead and the nose regions, which are relatively less sensitive to expressions and matches them separately using a modified iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The results of all the matching engines are fused at the metric level to achieve higher accuracy. We use the FRGC benchmark to compare our results to other algorithms that used the same database. Our multimodal hybrid algorithm performed better than others by achieving 99.74 percent and 98.31 percent verification rates at a 0.001 false acceptance rate (FAR) and identification rates of 99.02 percent and 95.37 percent for probes with a neutral and a nonneutral expression, respectively.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302759","Biometrics;face recognition;rejection classifier;3D shape representation","Face recognition;Face detection;Iterative algorithms;Robustness;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Forehead;Nose;Iterative methods;Iterative closest point algorithm;Engines","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","372","1","50","IEEE","17 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Uncertain information can create imperfect expressions for pattern sets in various pattern recognition algorithms. Therefore, various types of uncertainty may be taken into account when performing several pattern recognition methods. When one performs clustering with fuzzy sets, fuzzy membership values express assignment availability of patterns for clusters. However, when one assigns fuzzy memberships to a pattern set, imperfect information for a pattern set involves uncertainty which exist in the various parameters that are used in fuzzy membership assignment. When one encounters fuzzy clustering, fuzzy membership design includes various uncertainties (e.g., distance measure, fuzzifier, prototypes, etc.). In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty associated with the fuzzifier parameter m that controls the amount of fuzziness of the final C-partition in the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm. To design and manage uncertainty for fuzzifier m, we extend a pattern set to interval type-2 fuzzy sets using two fuzzifiers m1  and m2 which creates a footprint of uncertainty (FOU) for the fuzzifier m. Then, we incorporate this interval type-2 fuzzy set into FCM to observe the effect of managing uncertainty from the two fuzzifiers. We also provide some solutions to type-reduction and defuzzification (i.e., cluster center updating and hard-partitioning) in FCM.

Our study for signalling includes the two well known digital (decode and forward) relaying, analogue (amplify and forward) relaying, and a novel hybrid (filter, amplify and forward) relaying. We propose both optimal and suboptimal hybrid relaying schemes which avoid full decoding of the message at the relay. We show that they outperform analogue relaying and give similar performance to digital relaying, particularly when the relay has forward channel state information (CSI) or larger number of antennas than the source and destination. For the routing schemes designed for multiple relay channels, we use relay selection schemes to exploit the spatial diversity, which we call selection diversity of the networks. We propose both optimal and suboptimal relay selection schemes and show that their performance converges when a large number of antennas is deployed at each node in the network. We also compare relay selection routing with a space-time coded relay cooperation protocol and show the performance advantage of selection diversity over cooperative diversity in certain scenarios. Finally, we give a brief discussion on the application of another MIMO structure called single signal beamforming in the relay scenario. Its performance will be compared with that of spatial multiplexing","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.360379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4202183","","MIMO;Digital relays;Decoding;Antenna theory;Digital filters;Channel state information;Routing protocols;Array signal processing;Wireless networks","","371","31","38","IEEE","21 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

NFPs represent the ensemble activity of thousands of neurons and code-useful information for both normal activity and disease states. NFPs are small - of the order of tens of muV- and reside at low bandwidths that make them susceptible to excess noise. Therefore, to ensure the highest fidelity of signal measurement for diagnostic analysis, the amplifier is chopper-stabilized to eliminate 1/f and popcorn noise. The circuit was prototyped in an 0.8 mum CMOS process and consumes under 2.0 muW from a 1.8 V supply. A noise floor of 0.98 muVrms was achieved over a bandwidth from 0.05 to 100 Hz; the noise-efficiency factor of 4.6 is one of the lowest published to date. A flexible on-chip high-pass filter is used to suppress front-end electrode offsets while maintaining relevant physiological data. The monolithic architect and micropower low-noise low-supply operation could help enable applications ranging from neuroprosthetics to seizure monitors that require a small form factor and battery operation. Although the focus of this paper is on neurophysiological sensing, the circuit architecture can be applied generally to micropower sensor interfaces that benefit from chopper stabilization.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2007.908664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381446","Amplifier noise;choppers;low power;neurocontrollers;neuroprosthesis","Instruments;Circuit noise;Prototypes;Bandwidth;Neurons;Diseases;Noise measurement;Signal analysis;CMOS process;Filters","","368","58","27","IEEE","27 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We investigate both InAs/InP dashes in a barrier and dashes in a well (DWELL) heterostructures operating at 1.5  $\mu$m. These two types of QDs can provide high gain and low losses. Continuous-wave (CW) room-temperature lasing operation on ground state of cavity length as short as 200  $\mu$m has been achieved, demonstrating the high modal gain of the active core. A threshold current density as low as 110 A/cm$^{2}$ per QD layer has been obtained for infinite-length DWELL laser. An optimized DWELL structure allows achieving of a  $T_{0}$ larger than 100 K for broad-area (BA) lasers, and of 80 K for single-transverse-mode lasers in the temperature range between 25$^{\circ}$C and 85 $^{\circ}$C. Buried ridge stripe (BRS)-type single-mode distributed feedback (DFB) lasers are also demonstrated for the first time, exhibiting a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) as high as 45 dB. Such DFB lasers allow the first floor-free 10-Gb/s direct modulation for back-to-back and transmission over 16-km standard optical fiber. In addition, novel results are given on gain, noise, and four-wave mixing of QD-based semiconductor optical amplifiers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that QD Fabry–Perot (FP) lasers, owing to the small confinement factor and the three-dimensional (3-D) quantification of electronic energy levels, exhibit a beating linewidth as narrow as 15 kHz. Such an extremely narrow linewidth, compared to their QW or bulk counterparts, leads to the excellent phase noise and time-jitter characteristics when QD lasers are actively mode-locked. These advances constitute a new step toward the application of QD lasers and amplifiers to the field of optical fiber communications.

Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, attribute selectors preserve the original meaning of the attributes after reduction. This has found application in tasks that involve datasets containing huge numbers of attributes (in the order of tens of thousands) which, for some learning algorithms, might be impossible to process further. Recent examples include text processing and web content classification. AS techniques have also been applied to small and medium-sized datasets in order to locate the most informative attributes for later use. One of the many successful applications of rough set theory has been to this area. The rough set ideology of using only the supplied data and no other information has many benefits in AS, where most other methods require supplementary knowledge. However, the main limitation of rough set-based attribute selection in the literature is the restrictive requirement that all data is discrete. In classical rough set theory, it is not possible to consider real-valued or noisy data. This paper investigates a novel approach based on fuzzy-rough sets, fuzzy rough feature selection (FRFS), that addresses these problems and retains dataset semantics. FRFS is applied to two challenging domains where a feature reducing step is important; namely, web content classification and complex systems monitoring. The utility of this approach is demonstrated and is compared empirically with several dimensionality reducers. In the experimental studies, FRFS is shown to equal or improve classification accuracy when compared to the results from unreduced data. Classifiers that use a lower dimensional set of attributes which are retained by fuzzy-rough reduction outperform those that employ more attributes returned by the existing crisp rough reduction method. In addition, it is shown that FRFS is more powerful than the other AS techniques in the comparative study","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4088988","Attribute selection;dimensionality reduction;fuzzy-rough sets;rough selection","Signal processing algorithms;Set theory;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Machine learning algorithms;Text processing;Fuzzy sets;Monitoring;Text categorization;Computer science","","364","","47","IEEE","12 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the phase shift is zero for a unit-cell that supports an infinite wavelength, the physical size of the antenna can be arbitrary; the antenna's size is independent of the resonance phenomenon. The antenna's operational frequency depends only on its unit-cell and the antenna's physical size depends on the number of unit-cells. In particular, the unit-cell is based on the composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterial transmission line (TL). It is shown that the CRLH TL is a general model for the required unit-cell, which includes a nonessential series capacitance for the generation of an infinite wavelength. The analysis and design of the required unit-cell is discussed based upon field distributions and dispersion diagrams.

To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings.

A promising way to overcome this problem is to detect driver distraction and adapt in-vehicle systems accordingly to mitigate such distractions. To realize this strategy, this paper applied support vector machines (SVMs), which is a data mining method, to develop a real-time approach for detecting cognitive distraction using drivers' eye movements and driving performance data. Data were collected in a simulator experiment in which ten participants interacted with an IVIS while driving. The data were used to train and test both SVM and logistic regression models, and three different model characteristics were investigated: how distraction was defined, which data were input to the model, and how the input data were summarized. The results show that the SVM models were able to detect driver distraction with an average accuracy of 81.1%, outperforming more traditional logistic regression models. The best performing model (96.1% accuracy) resulted when distraction was defined using experimental conditions (i.e., IVIS drive or baseline drive), the input data were comprised of eye movement and driving measures, and these data were summarized over a 40-s window with 95% overlap of windows. These results demonstrate that eye movements and simple measures of driving performance can be used to detect driver distraction in real time.

In addition to the immediate display of the remaining battery capacity to the user, precise knowledge of SOC exerts additional control over the charging/discharging process, which can be employed to increase battery life. This reduces the risk of overvoltage and gassing, which degrade the chemical composition of the electrolyte and plates. The proposed model in this paper determines the SOC by incorporating the changes occurring due to terminal voltage, current load, and internal resistance, which mitigate the disadvantages of using impedance only. Electromotive force (EMF) voltage is predicted while the battery is under load conditions; from the estimated EMF voltage, the SOC is then determined. The method divides the battery voltage curve into two regions: 1) the linear region for full to partial SOC and 2) the hyperbolic region from partial to low SOC. Algorithms are developed to correspond to the different characteristic changes occurring within each region. In the hyperbolic region, the rate of change in impedance and terminal voltage is greater than that in the linear region. The magnitude of current discharge causes varying rates of change to the terminal voltage and impedance. Experimental tests and results are presented to validate the new models.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.899926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4285705","$C$ rate;electromotive force (EMF) voltage;impedance;lead-acid battery;lithium-ion battery;state of charge (SOC);terminal voltage","Batteries;State estimation;Impedance;Kinetic theory;Power engineering and energy;Mathematical model;Chemical technology;Displays;Voltage control;Degradation","","361","5","22","IEEE","8 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using Ad-aBoost, these shapelet features are created as a combination of oriented gradient responses. To train the final classifier, we use AdaBoost for a second time to select a subset of our learned shapelets. By first focusing locally on smaller feature sets, our algorithm attempts to harvest more useful information than by examining all the low-level features together. We present quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm.

When static obstacles popup during the flight, the UAVs are required to steer around them and also avoid collisions between each other. In order to achieve these goals, a new dual-mode control strategy is proposed: a ""safe mode"" is defined as an operation in an obstacle-free environment and a ""danger mode"" is activated when there is a chance of collision or when there are obstacles in the path. Safe mode achieves global optimization because the dynamics of all the UAVs participating in the formation are taken into account in the controller formulation. In the danger mode, a novel algorithm using a modified Grossberg neural network (GNN) is proposed for obstacle/collision avoidance. This decentralized algorithm in 2-D uses the geometry of the flight space to generate optimal/suboptimal trajectories. Extension of the proposed scheme for obstacle avoidance in a 3-D environment is shown. In order to handle practical vehicle constraints, a model predictive control-based tracking controller is used to track the references generated. Numerical results are provided to motivate this approach and to demonstrate its potential.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2007.899191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4252107","Collision avoidance;cooperative control;Grossberg neural network (GNN);model predictive control (MPC);obstacle avoidance;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);visibility graph","Unmanned aerial vehicles;Collision avoidance;Predictive models;Radar tracking;Neural networks;Predictive control;Nuclear power generation;Vehicle dynamics;Geometry;Fires","","360","1","24","IEEE","25 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints are one way in which data-rate limits arise, and are the focus of this paper. In both continuous and discrete-time settings, we show that there are limitations on the ability to stabilize an unstable plant over a SNR constrained channel using finite-dimensional linear time invariant (LTI) feedback. In the case of state feedback, or output feedback with a delay-free, minimum phase plant, these limitations in fact match precisely those that might have been inferred by considering the associated ideal Shannon capacity data rate over the same channel. In the case of LTI output feedback, additional limitations are shown to apply if the plant is nonminimum phase. In this case, we show that for a continuous-time nonminimum phase plant, a periodic linear time varying feedback scheme with fast sampling may be used to recover the original SNR requirement at the cost of robustness properties. The proposed framework inherently captures channel noise effects in a simple formulation suited to conventional LTI control performance and robustness analysis, and has potential to handle time delays and bandwidth constraints in a variety of control over communication links problems.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2007.902739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287133","Communication channels;control systems;feedback communication;information rates;linear-quadratic-Gaussian control;networked control systems;signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","Signal to noise ratio;Output feedback;Noise robustness;Communication system control;State feedback;Delay;Sampling methods;Costs;Robust control;Performance analysis","","360","","37","IEEE","13 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, type-2 FLCs will have the potential to overcome the limitations of type-1 FLCs and produce a new generation of fuzzy controllers with improved performance for many applications, which require handling high levels of uncertainty.

Given sufficiently wide transmission bandwidth, the impulse response of the shallow-water acoustic channel is often sparse as the multipath arrivals become resolvable. In the presence of significant surface waves, the multipath arrivals associated with surface scattering fluctuate rapidly over time, in the sense that the complex gain, the arrival time, and the Dopplers of each arrival all change dynamically. A sparse channel estimation technique is developed based on the delay-Doppler-spread function representation of the channel. The delay-Doppler-spread function may be considered as a first-order approximation to the rapidly time-varying channel in which each channel component is associated with Doppler shifts that are assumed constant over an averaging interval. The sparse structure of the delay-Doppler-spread function is then exploited by sequentially choosing the dominant components that minimize a least squares error. The advantage of this approach is that it captures both the channel structure as well as its dynamics without the need of explicit dynamic channel modeling. As the symbols are populated with the sample Dopplers, the increase in complexity depends on the channel Doppler spread and can be significant for a severely Doppler-spread channel. Comparison is made between nonsparse recursive least squares (RLS) channel estimation, sparse channel impulse response estimation, and estimation using the proposed approach. The results are demonstrated using experimental data. In training mode, the proposed approach shows a 3-dB reduction in signal prediction error. In decision-directed mode, it improves significantly the robustness of the performance of the channel-estimate-based equalizer against rapid channel fluctuations.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2007.906409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4445731","Channel-estimate-based equalization;delay-Doppler-spread function;matching pursuit;sparse estimation;time-varying channels","Phase estimation;Surface acoustic waves;Channel estimation;Delay;Least squares approximation;Recursive estimation;Communication channels;Bandwidth;Signal resolution;Acoustic scattering","","359","2","26","IEEE","8 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the 30 GHz-3 THz region dielectrics such as plastic and cloth are also transparent and the detection of contraband hidden under clothing is possible. A passive millimeter-wave imaging concept based on a folded Schmidt camera has been developed and applied to poor weather navigation and security. The optical design uses a rotating mirror and is folded using polarization techniques. The design is very well corrected over a wide field of view making it ideal for surveillance and security. This produces a relatively compact imager which minimizes the receiver count.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2007.898832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4337827","Millimeter-wave imaging;security;submillimeter-wave imaging;surveillance;terahertz;35 GHz;94 GHz","Surveillance;Millimeter wave technology;Optical receivers;Millimeter wave measurements;Optical imaging;Information security;Solid state circuits;Optical materials;Image generation;Dielectrics","","355","4","27","IEEE","1 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While this was at first motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in perovskite Cu oxides, this technological breakthrough was soon applied to other transition-metal oxides and, notably, mixed-valence manganites. The discovery of colossal magnetoresistance in manganite films triggered intense research activity on these materials, but the first notable impact of magnetic oxides in the field of spintronics was the use of such manganites as electrodes in magnetic tunnel junctions, yielding tunnel magnetoresistance ratios that are one order of magnitude larger than what had been obtained with transition-metal electrodes. Since then, research on oxide spintronics has been intense, with the latest developments focused on diluted magnetic oxides and, more recently, on multiferroics. In this paper, we will review the most important results on oxide spintronics, emphasizing materials physics as well as spin-dependent transport phenomena, and finally give some perspectives on how the flurry of new magnetic oxides could be useful for next-generation spintronics devices.

With the increasing demand for wireless communication, efficiently using the spectrum resource has become an essential issue. With the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) spectrum policy reform, secondary spectrum sharing has gained increasing interest. One of the policy reforms introduces the concept of an interference temperature - the total allowable interference in a spectral band. This means that secondary users can use different transmit powers as long as the sum of these power is less than the interference threshold. In this paper, we study two problems in secondary spectrum access with minimum signal to interference noise ratio (quality of service (QoS)) guarantee under an interference temperature constraint. First, when all the secondary links can be supported, a nonlinear optimization problem with the objective to maximize the total transmitting rate of the secondary users is formulated. The nonlinear optimization is solved efficiently using geometric programming techniques. The second problem we address is, when not all the secondary links can be supported with their QoS requirement, it is desirable to have the spectrum access opportunity proportional to the user priority if they belong to different priority classes. In this context, we formulate an operator problem which takes the priority issues into consideration. To solve this problem, first, we propose a centralized reduced complexity search algorithm to find the optimal solution. Then, in order to solve this problem distributively, we define a secondary spectrum sharing potential game. The Nash equilibria of this potential game are investigated. The efficiency of the Nash equilibria solutions are characterized. It is shown that distributed sequential play and an algorithm based on stochastic learning attain the equilibrium solutions. Finally, the performances are examined through simulations","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2007.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4116705","Wireless communication;access schemes;constrained optimization;mobile communication systems.","Temperature;Interference constraints;Quality of service;Signal to noise ratio;Radiofrequency interference;FCC;Mobile communication;Wireless sensor networks;Radio frequency;Signal processing","","354","","22","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional univariate statistical process control charts have long been used for fault detection. Recently, multivariate statistical fault detection methods such as principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods have drawn increasing interest in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, the unique characteristics of the semiconductor processes, such as nonlinearity in most batch processes, multimodal batch trajectories due to product mix, and process steps with variable durations, have posed some difficulties to the PCA-based methods. To explicitly account for these unique characteristics, a fault detection method using the k-nearest neighbor rule (FD-kNN) is developed in this paper. Because in fault detection faults are usually not identified and characterized beforehand, in this paper the traditional kNN algorithm is adapted such that only normal operation data is needed. Because the developed method makes use of the kNN rule, which is a nonlinear classifier, it naturally handles possible nonlinearity in the data. Also, because the FD-kNN method makes decisions based on small local neighborhoods of similar batches, it is well suited for multimodal cases. Another feature of the proposed FD-kNN method, which is essential for online fault detection, is that the data preprocessing is performed automatically without human intervention. These capabilities of the developed FD-kNN method are demonstrated by simulated illustrative examples as well as an industrial example.","1558-2345","","10.1109/TSM.2007.907607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4369338","Fault detection;k-nearest neighbor rule;pattern recognition;semiconductor manufacturing;statistical process monitoring","Fault detection;Manufacturing processes;Semiconductor device manufacture;Semiconductor device testing;Process control;Principal component analysis;Manufacturing industries;Fault diagnosis;Data preprocessing;Humans","","353","2","35","IEEE","12 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This results in contrast- and range-resolution degradation, particularly when the system is intended for high-resolution long-range applications, as it is the case for SAR. This paper presents a novel processing solution, which solves the nonlinearity problem for the whole range profile. Additionally, the conventional stop-and-go approximation used in pulse-radar algorithms is not valid in FMCW SAR applications under certain circumstances. Therefore, the motion within the sweep needs to be taken into account. Analytical development of the FMCW SAR signal model, starting from the deramped signal and without using the stop-and-go approximation, is presented in this paper. The model is then applied to stripmap, spotlight, and single-transmitter/multiple-receiver digital-beamforming SAR operational mode. The proposed algorithms are verified by processing real FMCW SAR data collected with the demonstrator system built at the Delft University of Technology.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.906140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373378","Doppler frequency correction;frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW);nonlinearity correction;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Radar signal processing;Frequency;Synthetic aperture radar;High-resolution imaging;Image sensors;Image resolution;Signal resolution;Limiting","","353","5","34","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence secondary users need to constantly sense the presence of the primary users. When the primary users are detected, the secondary users have to vacate that channel. This makes the probability of detection important to the primary users as it indicates their protection level from secondary users. When the secondary users detect the presence of a primary user which is in fact not there, it is referred to as false alarm. The probability of false alarm is important to the secondary users as it determines their usage of an unoccupied channel. Depending on whose interest is of priority, either a targeted probability of detection or false alarm shall be set. After setting one of the probabilities, the other can be optimized through cooperative sensing. In this paper, we show that cooperating all secondary users in the network does not necessary achieve the optimum performance, but instead, it is achieved by cooperating a certain number of users with the highest primary user's signal to noise ratio.

This is in contrast to classical error detection where a failure is detected after errors appear in system data and states. Circuit failure prediction is performed during system operation by analyzing the data collected by sensors inserted at various locations inside a chip. We demonstrate this concept of circuit failure prediction for a dominant PMOS aging mechanism induced by negative bias temperature instability (NBTI). NBTI-induced PMOS aging slows down PMOS transistors over time. As a result, the speed of a chip can significantly degrade over time and can result in delay faults. The traditional practice is to incorporate worst-case speed margins to prevent delay faults during system operation due to NBTI aging. A new sensor design integrated inside a flip-flop enables efficient circuit failure prediction at a low cost. Simulation results using 90nm and 65nm technologies demonstrate that this technique can significantly improve system performance by enabling close to best-case design instead of traditional worst-case design.","2375-1053","0-7695-2812-0","10.1109/VTS.2007.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4209925","","Aging;Niobium compounds;Titanium compounds;Circuit faults;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Performance analysis;Sensor systems;Negative bias temperature instability;MOSFETs","","351","19","33","IEEE","21 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this correspondence, we study fundamental limits and coding methods for wire tap channels. We provide an alternative view of the proof for secrecy capacity of wire tap channels and show how capacity achieving codes can be used to achieve the secrecy capacity for any wiretap channel.

A distributed intelligent energy management system (DIEMS) is implemented to optimize operating costs. As the optimization greatly depends on the power generation and the power output from renewable sources strongly depends on the weather, the forecast of power generation is required for DIEMS. A Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to predict hourly day-type outputs based on which generation can be forecasted.

There are many real networks that follow this model, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), etc. To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use controlled replication or ""spraying "" methods that can reduce the overhead of flooding-based schemes by distributing a small number of copies to only a few relays. These relays then ""look"" for the destination in parallel as they move into the network. Although such schemes can perform well in scenarios with high mobility (e.g. VANETs), they struggle in situations were mobility is slow and correlated in space and/or time. To route messages efficiently in such networks, we propose a scheme that also distributes a small number of copies to few relays. However, each relay can then forward its copy further using a single-copy utility-based scheme, instead of naively waiting to deliver it to the destination itself. This scheme exploits all the advantages of controlled replication, but is also able to identify appropriate forwarding opportunities that could deliver the message faster. Simulation results for traditional mobility models, as well as for a more realistic ""community-based"" model, indicate that our scheme can reduce the delay of existing spraying techniques up to 20 times in some scenarios","","0-7695-2788-4","10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144798","","Spraying;Relays;Ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Computer science;Mobile computing;Wildlife;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Internet telephony","","348","1","21","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally speaking, the utilization of a coupled inductor is useful for raising the step-up ratio of the conventional boost converter. However, the switch surge voltage may be caused by the leakage inductor so that it will result in the requirement of high-voltage-rated devices. In the proposed topology, a three-winding coupled inductor is used for providing a high voltage gain without extreme switch duty-cycle and enhancing the utility rate of magnetic core. Moreover, the energy in the leakage inductor is released directly to the output terminal for avoiding the phenomenon of circulating current and the production of switch surge voltage. In addition, the delay time formed with the cross of primary and secondary currents of the coupled inductor is manipulated to alleviate the reverse-recovery current of the output diode. It can achieve the aim of high-efficiency power conversion. Furthermore, the closed-loop control methodology is utilized in the proposed scheme to overcome the voltage drift problem of the power source under the variation of loads.

Such devices are of particular interest if they are compatible with back-end-of-line processing for CMOS integrated circuits. A variety of resistance-change technologies show promise in this respect, but a new approach that is based on switching in copper-doped silicon dioxide may be the simplest and least expensive to integrate. This paper describes the characteristics of W-(Cu/SiO2)-Cu programmable metallization cell (PMC) devices formed by the thermal diffusion of Cu into deposited SiO2. PMC devices operate by the electrochemical control of metallic pathways in solid electrolytes. Both unipolar and bipolar resistive switching could be attained in these devices. Bipolar switching, which is identical to that seen in PMC devices based on other solid electrolytes, was observed for low bias (a few tenths of volts) and programming currents in the microampere range. The resistance ratio between high and low states was on the order of 103, and a multibit storage is considered possible via the strong dependence of ON-state resistance on programming current. The low and high resistance states were stable for more than 5 x 104 s. The devices could be made to exhibit unipolar switching using a negative bias on the order of -1 V combined with erase currents of hundreds of microampere to a few milliampere. In this case, the OFF/ON ratio was 106.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.904402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317748","Electrical switching;nonvolatile memory;silicon oxide;solid electrolytes","Switches;Copper;Solids;Resistance;Electrodes;Voltage control","","344","14","13","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we linearize the nonlinear dynamics of the piezoactuator by accounting for the hysteresis (as well as creep) using high-gain feedback control. Next, we model the linear vibrational dynamics and then invert the model to find a feedforward input to account vibration - this process is significantly easier than considering the complete nonlinear dynamics (which combines hysteresis and vibration effects). Afterwards, the feedforward input is augmented to the feedback-linearized system to achieve high-precision highspeed positioning. We apply the method to a piezoscanner used in an experimental atomic force microscope to demonstrate the method's effectiveness and we show significant reduction of both the maximum and root-mean-square tracking error. For example, high-gain feedback control compensates for hysteresis and creep effects, and in our case, it reduces the maximum error (compared to the uncompensated case) by over 90%. Then, at relatively high scan rates, the performance of the feedback controlled system can be improved by over 75% (i.e., reduction of maximum error) when the inversion-based feedforward input is integrated with the high-gain feedback controlled system.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2007.902956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4294014","Creep;feedback control;high-precision positioning;hysteresis;inversion-based feedforward control;piezo actuator;vibration","Creep;Hysteresis;Scanning probe microscopy;Vibration control;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Feedback control;Atomic force microscopy;Error correction;Adaptive control;Mechanical engineering","","342","2","28","IEEE","27 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper investigates the behavior of capacity when constraints are placed on the channel output signal (as well as generalizations thereof). While such a change in perspective leaves the point-to-point problem (essentially) unchanged, the main conclusion is that in certain network scenarios, including multiple-access and relay situations, both the structure of the problem and the conclusions change. For example, capacity results are found for the many-user Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) with arbitrarily dependent sources, cooperation, or feedback, and for the nondegraded Gaussian relay network. The investigations are motivated by recent questions arising in spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum allocation: Multiple independent networks share the same frequency band, but are spatially mostly disjoint. One approach to grant coexistence is via spatial interference power restrictions, imposed at the network level, rather than at the device level. The corresponding capacity question is posed and partially answered in this paper","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.889016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4069138","Capacity;cognitive radio;multiple-access channel (MAC);relay channel;sensor network;separation theorem","AWGN;Relays;FCC;Transmitters;Interference constraints;Power measurement;Feedback;Radio spectrum management;Cognitive radio;Communication channels","","340","","36","IEEE","22 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we develop the first framework of system approximation that applies to both discrete and continuous systems by developing notions of approximate language inclusion, approximate simulation, and approximate bisimulation relations. We define a hierarchy of approximation pseudo-metrics between two systems that quantify the quality of the approximation, and capture the established exact relationships as zero sections. Our approximation framework is compositional for a synchronous composition operator. Algorithms are developed for computing the proposed pseudo-metrics, both exactly and approximately. The exact algorithms require the generalization of the fixed point algorithms for computing simulation and bisimulation relations, or dually, the solution of a static game whose cost is the so-called branching distance between the systems. Approximations for the pseudo-metrics can be obtained by considering Lyapunov-like functions called simulation and bisimulation functions.

The industry has selected time-division multiplexing (TDM) for current PON deployments. To satisfy future bandwidth demands, however, next-generation PON systems are being investigated to provide even higher performance. In this paper, we first review current TDM-PONs; we designate them as generation C. Next, we review next-generation PON systems, which we categorize into C+1 and C+2 generations. We expect C+1 systems to provide economic near-term bandwidth upgrade by overlaying new services on current TDM-PONs. For the long term, C+2 systems will provide more dramatic system improvement using wavelength division multiplexing technologies. Some C+2 architectures require new infrastructures and/or equipment, whereas others employ a more evolutionary approach. We also review key enabling components and technologies for C+1 and C+2 generations and point out important topics for future research.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2007.907748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4397122","Access networks;passive optical network (PON);time division multiplexing (TDM);wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)","Next generation networking;Optical fiber networks;Passive optical networks;Bandwidth;Optical fiber devices;Time division multiplexing;Wavelength division multiplexing;Photonics;HDTV;DSL","","336","6","67","IEEE","6 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

GPUs typically use single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) pipelines to achieve high performance with minimal overhead incurred by control hardware. Scalar threads are grouped together into SIMD batches, sometimes referred to as warps. While SIMD is ideally suited for simple programs, recent GPUs include control flow instructions in the GPU instruction set architecture and programs using these instructions may experience reduced performance due to the way branch execution is supported by hardware. One approach is to add a stack to allow different SIMD processing elements to execute distinct program paths after a branch instruction. The occurrence of diverging branch outcomes for different processing elements significantly degrades performance. In this paper, we explore mechanisms for more efficient SIMD branch execution on GPUs. We show that a realistic hardware implementation that dynamically regroups threads into new warps on the fly following the occurrence of diverging branch outcomes improves performance by an average of 20.7% for an estimated area increase of 4.7%.","2379-3155","978-0-7695-3047-5","10.1109/MICRO.2007.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408272","","Dynamic scheduling;Hardware;Yarn;Computer graphics;Pipelines;Parallel processing;Software performance;Rendering (computer graphics);Microarchitecture;Processor scheduling","","336","17","37","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the privacy of all irrelevant flows are still preserved. We formally define the security for MRQED and prove the security of our construction under the decision bilinear Diffie-Hellman and decision linear assumptions in certain bilinear groups.

The problem becomes more difficult in very reverberant conditions, with an increasing number of sources, and geometric configurations of the sources such that finding directionality is not sufficient for source separation. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that exploits higher order frequency dependencies of source signals in order to separate them when they are mixed. In the frequency domain, this formulation assumes that dependencies exist between frequency bins instead of defining independence for each frequency bin. In this manner, we can avoid the well-known frequency permutation problem. To derive the learning algorithm, we define a cost function, which is an extension of mutual information between multivariate random variables. By introducing a source prior that models the inherent frequency dependencies, we obtain a simple form of a multivariate score function. In experiments, we generate simulated data with various kinds of sources in various environments. We evaluate the performances and compare it with other well-known algorithms. The results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the others in most cases. The algorithm is also able to accurately recover six sources with six microphones. In this case, we can obtain about 16-dB signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) improvement.

Many hand-crafted descriptors have been proposed in the literature for measuring visual similarity. Looking past initial differences, what really distinguishes one descriptor from another is the tradeoff that it achieves between discriminative power and invariance. Since this trade-off must vary from task to task, no single descriptor can be optimal in all situations. Our focus, in this paper, is on learning the optimal tradeoff for classification given a particular training set and prior constraints. The problem is posed in the kernel learning framework. We learn the optimal, domain-specific kernel as a combination of base kernels corresponding to base features which achieve different levels of trade-off (such as no invariance, rotation invariance, scale invariance, affine invariance, etc.) This leads to a convex optimisation problem with a unique global optimum which can be solved for efficiently.

Long distance transmission by sensor nodes is not energy efficient since energy consumption is a superlinear function of the transmission distance. One approach to prolonging network lifetime while preserving network connectivity is to deploy a small number of costly, but more powerful, relay nodes whose main task is communication with other sensor or relay nodes. In this paper, we assume that sensor nodes have communication range r>0, while relay nodes have communication range Rgesr, and we study two versions of relay node placement problems. In the first version, we want to deploy the minimum number of relay nodes so that, between each pair of sensor nodes, there is a connecting path consisting of relay and/or sensor nodes. In the second version, we want to deploy the minimum number of relay nodes so that, between each pair of sensor nodes, there is a connecting path consisting solely of relay nodes.

Tests were conducted with seven different levels of controller delay ranging from nearly 0-300 ms and with two different artificial hand speeds. Based on repeted measures ANOVA analysis and a linear mixed effects model, the optimal controller delay was found to range between approximately 100 ms for fast prehensors and 125 ms for slower prehensors.

BI is a process that includes two primary activities: getting data in and getting data out. Getting data in, traditionally referred to as data warehousing, involves moving data from a set of source systems into an integrated data warehouse. Getting data in delivers limited value to an enterprise; only when users and applications access the data and use it to make decisions does the organization realize the full value from its data warehouse. Thus, getting data out receives most attention from organizations. This second activity, which is commonly referred to as BI, consists of business users and applications accessing data from the data warehouse to perform enterprise reporting, OLAP, querying, and predictive analytics.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2007.331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302625","IT systems perspectives;business intelligence","Bismuth;Data warehouses;Performance analysis;Costs;Data mining;Warehousing;Publishing;Time measurement;Application software;Hardware","","327","1","","IEEE","17 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Also presented are the results of bent fiber simulations using the beam propagation method (BPM), and experimental measurements of bend loss. Agreement among simulation, formula and measurement support the validity of both theoretical methods. BPM simulations showed that the lowest order modes of the bent fiber were reduced to their linearly polarized constituents prior to the onset of significant bend loss. This implies that certain LP mode orientations should propagate with much lower loss than previously expected, and should impact the mode stripping ability of bent large mode area fibers, as employed in fiber lasers and amplifiers.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2007.903364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300920","Dielectric waveguides;laser amplifiers;optical fiber amplifiers;optical fiber lasers;optical waveguide theory;waveguide bends","Optical fiber losses;Optical fibers;Optical fiber polarization;Optical waveguides;Optical propagation;Propagation losses;Loss measurement;Fiber lasers;Laser modes;Optical fiber amplifiers","","325","1","23","IEEE","10 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Weighted centroid localization (WCL) provides a fast and easy algorithm to locate devices in wireless sensor networks. The algorithm is derived from a centroid determination which calculates the position of devices by averaging the coordinates of known reference points. To improve the calculated position in real implementations, WCL uses weights to attract the estimated position to close reference points provided that coarse distances are available. Due to the fact that Zigbee provides the link quality indication (LQI) as a quality indicator of a received packet, it can also be used to estimate a distance from a node to reference points.","","978-1-4244-0829-0","10.1109/WISP.2007.4447528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4447528","CC2420;Weighted Centroid Localization;Distance Determination;Link Quality (LQI);Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI);Sensor Networks;Zigbee","Wireless sensor networks;ZigBee;Time measurement;Intelligent sensors;Signal processing;Automation;Computer science;Microelectronics;Application software;Electric variables measurement","","325","1","14","IEEE","8 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, a force sensor is used for sensing the external force. It is well known that information of a force sensor has much noise. Furthermore, unstable state is also caused by the narrow bandwidth of force information by a force sensor. This paper shows that stable contact with the environment is difficult when a force sensor is used because of its soft mechanical structure and narrow bandwidth of force sensing. In order to solve the instability of force control, the disturbance observer is implemented instead of the force sensor. The disturbance observer can observe the external force without force sensors. When the disturbance observer is implemented in a robot, a force control system does not include a soft mechanism between a robot and the environment. Since a robot can detect the environmental information directly, a wide bandwidth of force sensing is attained. In this way, this paper solves the problems of force control by considering the force sensing method without changing the control architecture, and the ability of force control is improved.

Our probabilistic formulation takes into account intensity and texture distributions in a local area around each region. It further incorporates priors based on the geometry of the regions. Finally, posteriors based on intensity and texture cues are combined using a mixture of experts formulation. This probabilistic approach is integrated into a graph coarsening scheme providing a complete hierarchical segmentation of the image.

Taking a cue from a digital front-end, the receiver's flexible analog baseband samples the channel of interest at zero IF, and is followed by clock-programmable downsampling with embedded filtering. This gives a tunable selectivity that exceeds that of an RF prefilter, and a conversion rate that is low enough for A/D conversion at only milliwatts.

Traditionally, highly skilled artists and animators construct shape and appearance models for digital character. They then define the character's motion at each time frame or specific key-frames in a motion sequence to create a digital performance. Increasingly, producers are using motion capture technology to record animations from an actor's performance. This technology reduces animation production time and captures natural movements to create a more believable production. However, motion capture requires the use of specialist suits and markers and only records skeletal motion. It lacks the detailed secondary surface dynamics of cloth and hair that provide the visual realism of a live performance. Over the last decade, we have investigated studio capture technology with the objective of creating models of real people that accurately reflect the time-varying shape and appearance of the whole body with clothing. Surface capture is a fully automated system for capturing a human's shape and appearance as well as motion from multiple video cameras to create highly realistic animated content from an actor's performance in full wardrobe.

Dynamically-biased shunt feedback is proposed in the buffer to lower its output resistance such that the pole at the gate of the pass device is pushed to high frequencies without dissipating large quiescent current. By employing the current-buffer compensation, only a single pole is realized within the regulation loop unity-gain bandwidth and over 65deg phase margin is achieved under the full range of the load current in the LDO. The LDO thus achieves stability without using any low-frequency zero. The maximum output-voltage variation can be minimized during load transients even if a small output capacitor is used. The LDO with the proposed impedance-attenuated buffer has been implemented in a 0.35-mum twin-well CMOS process. The proposed LDO dissipates 20-muA quiescent current at no-load condition and is able to deliver up to 200-mA load current. With a 1-muF output capacitor, the maximum transient output-voltage variation is within 3% of the output voltage with load step changes of 200 mA/100 ns.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2007.900281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4277856","Linear regulator;load transient response;low- dropout regulator (LDO);pass device;power management integrated circuits;voltage buffer","Regulators;Impedance;Attenuation;Capacitors;Output feedback;Frequency;Bandwidth;Stability;CMOS process;Voltage","","320","14","17","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this aim, we propose a new framework where we model actions using three dimensional occupancy grids, built from multiple viewpoints, in an exemplar-based HMM. The novelty is, that a 3D reconstruction is not required during the recognition phase, instead learned 3D exemplars are used to produce 2D image information that is compared to the observations. Parameters that describe image projections are added as latent variables in the recognition process. In addition, the temporal Markov dependency applied to view parameters allows them to evolve during recognition as with a smoothly moving camera. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated with experiments on real datasets and with challenging recognition scenarios.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-1630-1","10.1109/ICCV.2007.4408849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408849","","Cameras;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Image recognition;Image reconstruction;Solid modeling;Layout;Parametric statistics;Kinematics;Image motion analysis","","319","","20","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classical sampling theory does not enable a perfect reconstruction of such signals since they are not bandlimited. Recently, it was shown that, by using an adequate sampling kernel and a sampling rate greater or equal to the rate of innovation, it is possible to reconstruct such signals uniquely . These sampling schemes, however, use kernels with infinite support, and this leads to complex and potentially unstable reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we show that many signals with a finite rate of innovation can be sampled and perfectly reconstructed using physically realizable kernels of compact support and a local reconstruction algorithm. The class of kernels that we can use is very rich and includes functions satisfying Strang-Fix conditions, exponential splines and functions with rational Fourier transform. This last class of kernels is quite general and includes, for instance, any linear electric circuit. We, thus, show with an example how to estimate a signal of finite rate of innovation at the output of an RC circuit.

The simulation and measurement show that the miniaturized antenna achieves a broad operating bandwidth of 2.9-11.6 GHz for a 10-dB return loss. In particular, the ground-plane effect on impedance performance is greatly reduced by cutting the notch from the radiator because the electric currents on the ground plane are significantly suppressed at the lower edge operating frequencies.

The goal is to find the optimal segmentation that minimizes the overall coding length of the segmented data, subject to a given distortion. By analyzing the coding length/rate of mixed data, we formally establish some strong connections of data segmentation to many fundamental concepts in lossy data compression and rate-distortion theory. We show that a deterministic segmentation is approximately the (asymptotically) optimal solution for compressing mixed data. We propose a very simple and effective algorithm that depends on a single parameter, the allowable distortion. At any given distortion, the algorithm automatically determines the corresponding number and dimension of the groups and does not involve any parameter estimation. Simulation results reveal intriguing phase-transition-like behaviors of the number of segments when changing the level of distortion or the amount of outliers. Finally, we demonstrate how this technique can be readily applied to segment real imagery and bioinformatic data.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288157","Multivariate Mixed Data;Data Segmentation;Data Clustering;Rate Distortion;Lossy Coding;Lossy Compression;Image Segmentation;Microarray Data Clustering","Image segmentation;Image coding;Gaussian distribution;Rate-distortion;Signal processing algorithms;Bioinformatics;Maximum likelihood estimation;Data compression;Parameter estimation;Phase distortion","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Compression;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Models, Statistical;Multivariate Analysis;Normal Distribution;Pattern Recognition, Automated","316","2","36","IEEE","13 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The performance and capacity of many classification algorithms and devices, including TCAMs, depend upon properties of filter sets and query patterns. Despite the pressing need, no standard performance evaluation tools or filter sets are publicly available. In response to this problem, we present ClassBench, a suite of tools for benchmarking packet classification algorithms and devices. ClassBench includes a filter set generator  that produces synthetic filter sets that accurately model the characteristics of real filter sets. Along with varying the size of the filter sets, we provide high-level control over the composition of the filters in the resulting filter set. The tool suite also includes a trace generator that produces a sequence of packet headers to exercise packet classification algorithms with respect to a given filter set. Along with specifying the relative size of the trace, we provide a simple mechanism for controlling locality of reference. While we have already found ClassBench to be very useful in our own research, we seek to eliminate the significant access barriers to realistic test vectors for researchers and initiate a broader discussion to guide the refinement of the tools and codification of a formal benchmarking methodology.

In order to have high-power density, the converter can be designed to operate in discontinuous conducting mode (DCM) such that the passive inductor can be minimized. The DCM operation associated current ripple can be alleviated by interleaving multiphase currents. However, DCM operation tends to increase turnoff loss because of a high peak current and its associated parasitic ringing due to the oscillation between the inductor and the device output capacitance. Thus, the efficiency is suffered with the conventional DCM operation. Although to reduce the turnoff loss a lossless capacitor snubber can be added across the switch, the energy stored in the capacitor needs to be discharged before device is turned on. This paper adopts a gate signal complimentary control scheme to turn on the nonactive switch and to divert the current into the antiparalleled diode of the active switch so that the main switch can be turned on under zero-voltage condition. This diverted current also eliminates the parasitic ringing in inductor current. For capacitor value selection, there is a tradeoff between turnon and turnoff losses. This paper suggests the optimization of capacitance selection through a series of hardware experiments to ensure the overall power loss minimization under complimentary DCM operating condition. According to the suggested design optimization, a 100-kW hardware prototype is constructed and tested. The experimental results are provided to verify the proposed design approach.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.900462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267791","Bidirectional dc–dc converter;high-power dc–dc converter;high-power density;synchronous operating mode","Switches;Inductors;Capacitors;DC-DC power converters;Parasitic capacitance;Hardware;Interleaved codes;Snubbers;Diodes;Design optimization","","312","","9","IEEE","9 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We derive the equations for maximum a posteriori joint detection of the transmitted symbols and the carrier phase. The result is a multidimensional optimization problem that we approximate with a two-stage iterative algorithm: The first stage is a symbol-by-symbol soft detector of the carrier phase, and the second stage is a hard-decision phase estimator that uses prior and subsequent soft-phase decisions to obtain a minimum mean-square-error phase estimate by exploiting the temporal correlation in the phase-noise process. The received symbols are then derotated by the hard-decision phase estimates, and maximum- likelihood sequence detection of the symbols follows. As each component in the carrier-recovery unit can be separately optimized, the resulting system is highly flexible. We show that the optimum hard-decision phase estimator is a linear filter whose impulse response consists of a causal and an anticausal exponential sequence, which we can truncate and implement as an finite-impulse- response filter. We derive equations for the phase-error variance and the system bit-error ratio (BER).

VFC is calculated by convolving the edge map generated from the image with the user-defined vector field kernel. We propose two structures for the magnitude function of the vector field kernel, and we provide an analytical method to estimate the parameter of the magnitude function. Mixed VFC is introduced to alleviate the possible leakage problem caused by choosing inappropriate parameters.

One of the critical issues consists of the design of scalable routing algorithms that are robust to frequent path disruptions caused by vehicles' mobility. This paper argues the use of information on vehicles' movement information (e.g., position, direction, speed, and digital mapping of roads) to predict a possible link-breakage event prior to its occurrence. Vehicles are grouped according to their velocity vectors. This kind of grouping ensures that vehicles, belonging to the same group, are more likely to establish stable single and multihop paths as they are moving together. Setting up routes that involve only vehicles from the same group guarantees a high level of stable communication in VANETs. The scheme presented in this paper also reduces the overall traffic in highly mobile VANET networks. The frequency of flood requests is reduced by elongating the link duration of the selected paths. To prevent broadcast storms that may be intrigued during path discovery operation, another scheme is also introduced. The basic concept behind the proposed scheme is to broadcast only specific and well-defined packets, referred to as ldquobest packetsrdquo in this paper. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through computer simulations. Simulation results indicate the benefits of the proposed routing strategy in terms of increasing link duration, reducing the number of link-breakage events and increasing the end-to-end throughput.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2007.906873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357358","Intervehicular communications (IVC);road–vehicle communications (RVC);stable routing;vehicular ad hoc network (VANET);IVC;RVC;VANET;Stable Routing","Routing protocols;Broadcasting;Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Robustness;Road vehicles;Mobile communication;Telecommunication traffic;Frequency;Floods","","308","1","34","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An analytic model for the zero-load latency of each network that considers the effects of the topology on the performance of a 3D NoC is developed. Tradeoffs between the number of nodes utilized in the third dimension, which reduces the average number of hops traversed by a packet, and the number of physical planes used to integrate the functional blocks of the network, which decreases the length of the communication channel, is evaluated for both the latency and power consumption of a network.

This paper presents a descriptor system approach to fuzzy control system design using fuzzy Lyapunov functions. The design conditions are still cast in terms of LMIs but the proposed approach takes advantage of the redundancy of descriptor systems to reduce the number of LMI conditions which leads to less computational requirement. To obtain relaxed LMI conditions, new types of fuzzy controller and fuzzy Lyapunov function are proposed. A salient feature of the LMI conditions derived in this paper is to relate the feasibility of the LMIs to the switching speed of each linear subsystem (to be exact, to the lower bounds of time derivatives of membership functions). To illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, two design examples are provided. The first example shows that the LMI conditions based on the fuzzy Lyapunov function are less conservative than those based on a common (standard) Lyapunov function. The second example illustrates the utility of the fuzzy Lyapunov function approach in comparison with a piecewise Lyapunov function approach.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.880005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4231868","Descriptor representation;fuzzy control;fuzzy Lyapunov function;redundancy","Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Lyapunov method;System analysis and design;Linear matrix inequalities;Control system synthesis;Mechanical engineering;Control systems;Stability;Control design","","308","","35","IEEE","11 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although latent print examiners frequently take advantage of level 3 features to assist in identification, automated fingerprint identification systems (AFIS) currently rely only on level 1 and level 2 features. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) standard of fingerprint resolution for AFIS is 500 pixels per inch (ppi), which is inadequate for capturing level 3 features, such as pores. With the advances in fingerprint sensing technology, many sensors are now equipped with dual resolution (500 ppi/1,000 ppi) scanning capability. However, increasing the scan resolution alone does not necessarily provide any performance improvement in fingerprint matching, unless an extended feature set is utilized. As a result, a systematic study to determine how much performance gain one can achieve by introducing level 3 features in AFIS is highly desired. We propose a hierarchical matching system that utilizes features at all the three levels extracted from 1,000 ppi fingerprint scans. Level 3 features, including pores and ridge contours, are automatically extracted using Gabor filters and wavelet transform and are locally matched using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. Our experiments show that level 3 features carry significant discriminatory information. There is a relative reduction of 20 percent in the equal error rate (EER) of the matching system when level 3 features are employed in combination with level 1 and 2 features.

Early work in MANET research has mainly focused on developing an efficient routing mechanism in such a highly dynamic and resource-constrained network. At present, several efficient routing protocols have been proposed for MANET. Most of these protocols assume a trusted and cooperative environment. However, in the presence of malicious nodes, the networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. In MANET, routing attacks are particularly serious.

Memory requests from different threads can interfere with each other. Existing memory access scheduling techniques try to optimize the overall data throughput obtained from the DRAM and thus do not take into account inter-thread interference. Therefore, different threads running together on the same chip can experience extremely different memory system performance: one thread can experience a severe slowdown or starvation while another is unfairly prioritized by the memory scheduler. This paper proposes a new memory access scheduler, called the Stall-Time Fair Memory scheduler (STFM), that provides quality of service to different threads sharing the DRAM memory system. The goal of the proposed scheduler is to ""equalize "" the DRAM-related slowdown experienced by each thread due to interference from other threads, without hurting overall system performance. As such, STFM takes into account inherent memory characteristics of each thread and does not unfairly penalize threads that use the DRAM system without interfering with other threads. We show that STFM significantly reduces the unfairness in the DRAM system while also improving system throughput (i.e., weighted speedup of threads) on a wide variety of workloads and systems. For example, averaged over 32 different workloads running on an 8-core CMP, the ratio between the highest DRAM-related slowdown and the lowest DRAM-related slowdown reduces from 5.26X to 1.4X, while the average system throughput improves by 7.6%. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare STFM to one new and three previously- proposed memory access scheduling algorithms, including network fair queueing. Our results show that STFM provides the best fairness, system throughput, and scalability.","2379-3155","978-0-7695-3047-5","10.1109/MICRO.2007.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408252","","Yarn;Random access memory;Throughput;Interference;Quality of service;Scheduling algorithm;System performance;Microarchitecture;Scalability;Grid computing","","306","15","33","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Behind this trajectory was the continuous advancement of power semiconductor device technology allowing an increase of converter switching frequencies by a factor of 10 every decade. However, today's cooling concepts, and passive components and wire bond interconnection technologies could be major barriers for a continuation of this trend. For identifying and quantifying such technological barriers this paper investigates the volume of the cooling system and of the main passive components for the basic forms of power electronics energy conversion in dependency of the switching frequency and determines switching frequencies minimizing the total volume. The analysis is for 5 kW rated output power, high performance air cooling, advanced power semiconductors, and single systems in all cases. A power density limit of 28 kW/dm3@300 kHz is calculated for an isolated DC-DC converter considering only transformer, output inductor and heat sink volume. For single-phase AC-DC conversion a general limit of 35 kW/dm3 results from the DC link capacitor required for buffering the power fluctuating with twice the mains frequency. For a three-phase unity power factor PWM rectifier the limit is 45 kW/dm3@810 kHz just taking into account EMI filter and cooling system. For the sparse matrix converter the limiting components are the input EMI filter and the common mode output inductor; the power density limit is 71 kW/dm3@50 kHz when not considering the cooling system. The calculated power density limits highlight the major importance of broadening the scope of research in power electronics from traditional areas like converter topologies, and modulation and control concepts to cooling systems, high frequency electromagnetics, interconnection technology, multi-functional integration, packaging and multi-domain modeling and simulation to ensure further advancement of the field along the power density trajectory.","","1-4244-0843-1","10.1109/PCCON.2007.372914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4239129","Figures of Merit;Power density;Cooling system;Passive components","Pulse width modulation converters;Electronics cooling;Power electronics;Switching frequency;Power system interconnection;Inductors;Frequency conversion;Pulse width modulation;Electromagnetic interference;Filters","","306","6","73","IEEE","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The coordinate mapping that relates the two images is found using an iterative optimization procedure. This work compares the performance of eight optimization methods: gradient descent (with two different step size selection algorithms), quasi-Newton, nonlinear conjugate gradient, Kiefer-Wolfowitz, simultaneous perturbation, Robbins-Monro, and evolution strategy. Special attention is paid to computation time reduction by using fewer voxels to calculate the cost function and its derivatives. The optimization methods are tested on manually deformed CT images of the heart, on follow-up CT chest scans, and on MR scans of the prostate acquired using a BFFE, Tl, and T2 protocol. Registration accuracy is assessed by computing the overlap of segmented edges. Precision and convergence properties are studied by comparing deformation fields. The results show that the Robbins-Monro method is the best choice in most applications. With this approach, the computation time per iteration can be lowered approximately 500 times without affecting the rate of convergence by using a small subset of the image, randomly selected in every iteration, to compute the derivative of the mutual information. From the other methods the quasi-Newton and the nonlinear conjugate gradient method achieve a slightly higher precision, at the price of larger computation times.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.909412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374125","B-splines;mutual information;nonrigid image registration;optimization;subsampling","Optimization methods;Biomedical imaging;Image registration;Mutual information;Spline;Computed tomography;Convergence;Iterative algorithms;Cost function;Testing","Algorithms;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","305","3","49","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We analyze the properties of the numerical scheme associated with this filter, using a semi-explicit scheme. We then extend the filter to a matrix anisotropic diffusion, allowing different levels of filtering across the image contours and in the principal curvature directions. We also show a relation between the local directional variance of the image intensity and the local geometry of the image, which can justify the choice of the gradient and the principal curvature directions as a basis for the diffusion matrix.

Then, we apply fast Fourier transform (FFT) to individual points along this line of interest to capitalize on the pulse's thermal propagation effect. Finally, we use an adaptive estimation function on the average FFT outcome to quantify the pulse. We have carried out experiments on a data set of 34 subjects and compared the pulse computed from our thermal signal analysis method to concomitant ground-truth measurements obtained through a standard contact sensor (piezo-electric transducer).

Using multiple-view-angle thermal-infrared (TIR) observations, the temperatures of soil and vegetation may be retrieved. However, particularly for sparsely vegetated areas, the soil and vegetation component temperatures in the sun and in the shade may be very different depending on the solar radiation, the physical properties of the surface, and the meteorological conditions. This may interfere with a correct retrieval of component temperatures, but it might also yield extra information related to canopy structure. Both are strong reasons to investigate this phenomenon in some more detail. To this end, the relationship between the TIR radiance directionality and the component temperatures has been analyzed. In this paper, we extend the four-stream radiative transfer (RT) formalism of the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves model family to the TIR domain. This new approach enables us to simulate the multiple scattering and emission inside a geometrically homogenous but thermodynamically heterogeneous canopy for optical as well as thermal radiation using the same modeling framework. In this way top-of-canopy thermal radiances observed under multiple viewing angles can be related to the temperatures of sunlit and shaded soil and sunlit and shaded leaves. In this paper, we describe the development of this unified optical-thermal RT theory and demonstrate its capabilities. A preliminary validation using an experimental data set collected in the Shunyi remote sensing field campaign in China is briefly addressed.

Matting is inherently an ill-posed problem. Previous matting approaches either use naive color sampling methods to estimate foreground and background colors for unknown pixels, or use propagation-based methods to avoid color sampling under weak assumptions about image statistics. We argue that neither method itself is enough to generate good results for complex natural images. We analyze the weaknesses of previous matting approaches, and propose a new robust matting algorithm. In our approach we also sample foreground and background colors for unknown pixels, but more importantly, analyze the confidence of these samples. Only high confidence samples are chosen to contribute to the matting energy function which is minimized by a Random Walk. The energy function we define also contains a neighborhood term to enforce the smoothness of the matte. To validate the approach, we present an extensive and quantitative comparison between our algorithm and a number of previous approaches in hopes of providing a benchmark for future matting research.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270031","","Sampling methods;Robustness;Pixel;Image sampling;Image color analysis;Statistics;Optimization methods;Statistical distributions;Bayesian methods;Algorithm design and analysis","","303","15","14","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new control scheme is characterized by a discrete-time integral sliding manifold which inherits the desired properties of the continuous-time integral sliding manifold, such as full order sliding manifold with pole assignment, and elimination of the reaching phase. In particular, comparing with existing discrete-time sliding-mode control, the new scheme is able to achieve more precise tracking performance.

Another desirable feature is, the proposed DISMC prevents the generation of overlarge control actions due to deadbeat response, which is usually inevitable due to the existence of poles at the origin for a reduced order sliding manifold designed for sampled-data systems.

The keystone transform has been employed to remove the linear component of the range migration for the moving target, where interpolation is required. In this letter, a realization of the keystone transform avoiding interpolation is presented. The kernel of this transform, i.e., the range-frequency-dependent azimuth time rescaling, is implemented using only complex multiplications and fast Fourier transforms based on the scaling principle, which has been successfully applied in the equalization of the space-variant range cell migration in SAR processing. In addition, the moving target is coarsely focused according to the SAR geometry and the platform velocity while exploiting the scaling principle. This preliminary focusing is helpful in the isolation of the moving target from ground clutter, so as to facilitate a more refined processing with respect to each mover. SAR raw data combined with simulated echoes of moving targets are utilized to validate the presented approach","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2006.882147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4063317","Ground moving-target imaging (GMTIm);keystone transform;scaling principle;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Interpolation;Focusing;Synthetic aperture radar;Fast Fourier transforms;Signal processing algorithms;Trajectory;Azimuth;Geometry;Radar imaging;Kernel","","301","2","11","IEEE","15 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, the dc optimal power flow (DCOPF) model has been applied in the power industry to calculate locational marginal prices (LMPs), especially in market simulation and planning owing to its robustness and speed. In this paper, first, an iterative DCOPF-based algorithm is presented with the fictitious nodal demand (FND) model to calculate LMP. The algorithm has three features: the iterative approach is employed to address the nonlinear marginal loss; FND is proposed to eliminate the large mismatch at the reference bus if FND is not applied; and an offset of system loss in the energy balance equation is proved to be necessary because the net injection multiplied by marginal delivery factors creates doubled system loss. Second, the algorithm is compared with ACOPF algorithm for accuracy of LMP results at various load levels using the PJM 5-bus system. It is clearly shown that the FND algorithm is a good estimate of the LMP calculated from the ACOPF algorithm and outperforms the lossless DCOPF algorithm. Third, the DCOPF-based algorithm is employed to analyze the sensitivity of LMP with respect to the system load. The infinite sensitivity or step change in LMP is also discussed.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2007.907924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4349100","DCOPF;energy markets;fictitious nodal demand (FND);locational marginal pricing (LMP);marginal loss pricing;optimal power flow (OPF);power markets;power system planning;sensitivity analysis","Iterative algorithms;Pricing;Power markets;Load flow;Power industry;Robustness;Power system modeling;Iterative methods;Nonlinear equations;Algorithm design and analysis","","300","","18","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose a new algorithm, called FEC, to mine signed social networks so that both positive within-group relations and negative between-group relations are dense. FEC considers both the sign and the density of relations as the clustering attributes, making itself effective for not only signed networks but also conventional social networks including only positive relations. Also, FEC adopts an agent-based heuristic that makes the algorithm efficient (in linear time with respect to the size of a network) and capable of giving nearly optimal solutions. FEC depends on only one parameter whose value can easily be set, and requires no prior knowledge on hidden community structures. The effectiveness and efficacy of FEC have been demonstrated through a set of rigorous experiments involving both benchmark and randomly-generated signed networks.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.1061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302742","community mining;agent-based approach;random walk;signed social networks","Social network services;Clustering algorithms;Polynomials;Algorithm design and analysis;Joining processes;Humans;Robustness","","299","1","34","IEEE","17 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To facilitate the implementation of additional protocols and to make them more comparable OverSim provides several common functions like a generic lookup mechanism for structured peer-to-peer networks and an RPC interface.

According to the cognitive radio principle, the activity of the secondary link is required not to interfere with the performance of the primary. Therefore, in this paper, it is assumed that the cognitive link accesses the channel only when sensed idle. Moreover, the analysis includes: (1) random packet arrivals; (2) sensing errors due to fading at the secondary link; (3) power allocation at the secondary transmitter based on long-term measurements. In this framework, the maximum stable throughput of the cognitive link (in packets/slot) is derived for a fixed throughput selected by the primary link. The model is modified so as to allow the secondary transmitter to act as a ldquotransparentrdquo relay for the primary link. In particular, packets that are not received correctly by the intended destination might be decoded successfully by the secondary transmitter. The latter can, then, queue and forward these packets to the intended receiver. A stable throughput of the secondary link with relaying is derived under the same conditions as before. Results show that benefits of relaying strongly depend on the topology (i.e., average channel powers) of the network.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2007.910699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4395275","Cognitive radio;cooperative transmission;queuing systems;stability;unlicensed spectrum access","Throughput;Cognitive radio;Relays;Radio transmitters;Media Access Protocol;Power system relaying;Bandwidth;Physical layer;Fading;Power measurement","","299","1","20","IEEE","12 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples of such systems include certain large scale process control systems, chains of coupled oscillators and supply chain management systems. Receding horizon control (RHC) is a method of choice in these venues as constraints can be explicitly accommodated. In addition, a distributed control approach is sought to enable the autonomy of the individual subsystems and reduce the computational burden of centralized implementations. In this paper, a distributed RHC algorithm is presented for dynamically coupled nonlinear systems that are subject to decoupled input constraints. By this algorithm, each subsystem computes its own control locally. Provided an initially feasible solution can be found, subsequent feasibility of the algorithm is guaranteed at every update, and asymptotic stabilization is established. The theoretical conditions for feasibility and stability are shown to be satisfied for a set of coupled Van der Pol oscillators that model a walking robot experiment. In simulations, distributed and centralized receding horizon controllers are employed for stabilization of the oscillators. The numerical experiments show that the controllers perform comparably, while the computational savings of the distributed implementation over the centralized implementation is clearly demonstrated.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2007.900828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268375","Coupled nonlinear oscillators;distributed control;receding horizon control (RHC);supply chain management","Distributed control;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Couplings;Nonlinear systems;Oscillators;Distributed computing;Legged locomotion;Centralized control;Large-scale systems","","295","1","24","IEEE","9 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have implemented a low-power and low-noise readout front-end with configurable characteristics for Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Electromyogram (EMG) signals. Key to its performance is the new AC-coupled chopped instrumentation amplifier (ACCIA), which uses a low power current feedback instrumentation amplifier (IA). Thus, while chopping filters the 1/f noise of CMOS transistors and increases the CMRR, AC coupling is capable of rejecting differential electrode offset (DEO) up to ${\pm}$50 mV from conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. The ACCIA achieves 120 dB CMRR and 57 nV/$\surd$Hz input-referred voltage noise density, while consuming 11.1 $\mu$ A from a 3 V supply. The chopping spike filter (CSF) stage filters the chopping spikes generated by the input chopper of ACCIA and the digitally controllable variable gain stage is used to set the gain and the bandwidth of the front-end.

The efficiency of the new algorithm enables its application to problems that were previously prohibitive due to high time complexities. The proposed EMD-L_{1} significantly simplifies the original linear programming formulation of EMD. Exploiting the L_{1} metric structure, the number of unknown variables in EMD-L_{1} is reduced to O(N) from O(N^{2}) of the original EMD for a histogram with N bins. In addition, the number of constraints is reduced by half and the objective function of the linear program is simplified. Formally, without any approximation, we prove that the EMD-L_{1} formulation is equivalent to the original EMD with a L_{1} ground distance. To perform the EMD-L_{1} computation, we propose an efficient tree-based algorithm, Tree-EMD. Tree-EMD exploits the fact that a basic feasible solution of the simplex algorithm-based solver forms a spanning tree when we interpret EMD-L_{1} as a network flow optimization problem. We empirically show that this new algorithm has an average time complexity of O(N^{2}), which significantly improves the best reported supercubic complexity of the original EMD. The accuracy of the proposed methods is evaluated by experiments for two computation-intensive problems: shape recognition and interest point matching using multidimensional histogram-based local features. For shape recognition, EMD-L_{1} is applied to compare shape contexts on the widely tested MPEG7 shape data set, as well as an articulated shape data set. For interest point matching, SIFT, shape context and spin image are tested on both synthetic and real image pairs with large geometrical deformation, illumination change, and heavy intensity noise. The results demonstrate that our EMD-L_{1}-based solutions outperform previously reported state-of-the-art features and distance measures in solving the two tasks.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4135678","Earth Mover's Distance;transportation problem;histogram-based descriptor;SIFT;shape context;spin image;shape matching;interest point matching.","Earth;Robustness;Histograms;Shape;Testing;Linear programming;Multidimensional systems;MPEG 7 Standard;Lighting;Noise shaping","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","294","4","51","IEEE","19 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An algorithm that incorporates output from two advanced retrieval techniques, namely, a physical-iterative approach and a computationally efficient statistical method, has been developed to retrieve these parameters. The forward model used in both methods is the monochromatic radiative transfer model MonoRTM. An important component of this MWR RETrieval (MWRRET) algorithm is the determination of small ($≪ 1\ \hbox{K}$) offsets that are subtracted from the observed brightness temperatures before the retrievals are performed. Accounting for these offsets removes systematic biases from the observations and/or the model spectroscopy necessary for the retrieval, significantly reducing the systematic biases in the retrieved LWP. The MWRRET algorithm significantly provides more accurate retrievals than the original ARM statistical retrieval, which uses monthly retrieval coefficients. By combining the two retrieval methods with the application of brightness temperature offsets to reduce the spurious LWP bias in clear skies, the MWRRET algorithm significantly provides better retrievals of PWV and LWP from the ARM two-channel MWRs compared to the original ARM product.

However, actually there are always errors in these forecasted values. A characteristic feature of the proposed fuzzy-optimization approach is that the forecast hourly load, available water, wind speed and solar radiation errors can be taken into account using fuzzy sets. Fuzzy set notations in the hourly load, available water, wind speed, solar radiation, spinning reserve and total fuel cost are developed to obtain the optimal generation schedule under an uncertain environment.

The attraction of producing, and exploiting nanoparticles (NPs; one dimension less than 100 nm) is a consequence of the fact that the properties are often strikingly different from bulk forms composed from the same material. As a consequence, the field of nanotechnology has generated substantial interest resulting in incorporation of NPs into a wide variety of products including electronics, food, clothing, medicines, cosmetics and sporting equipment. While there is general recognition that nanotechnology has the potential to advance science, quality of life and to generate substantial financial gains, a number of reports suggest that potential toxicity should be considered in order to allow the safe and sustainable development of such products. For example, substances which are ordinarily innocuous can elicit toxicity due to the altered chemical and physical properties that become evident within nano dimensions leading to potentially detrimental consequences for the producer, consumer or environment. Research into respirable air pollution particles (PM10) has focused on the role of ultra fine particle (diameter less than 100 nm) in inducing oxidative stress leading to inflammation and resulting in exacerbation of preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological studies have repeatedly found a positive correlation between the level of particulate air pollution and increased morbidity and mortality rates in both adults and children. Such studies have also identified a link between respiratory ill health and the number of ambient ultrafine particles. In vivo and in vitro toxicology studies confirm that for low solubility, low toxicity materials such as TiO2, carbon black and polystyrene beads, ultrafine particles are more toxic and inflammogenic than fine particles. In many of these studies the term ""ultrafine particle"" can be directly exchanged for nanoparticle, as these particles are manufactured industrially. In such studies the NPs generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to a greater extent than larger particles leading to increased transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators via intracellular signaling pathways including calcium and oxidative stress. To date, only limited NP compositions and structures have been tested, including materials such as carbon, polystyrene beads and TiO2 as surrogate particles that aimed to represent particulate air pollution. All of these materials are generally low toxicity and low solubility. Much work is required to identify whether the conclusions made for such materials can be extrapolated to engineered nanoparticles varying not only in size but also, shape, composition, structure, surface area, surface coating, and aggregation state. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal if the diversity of NPs available will confer to a varied extent and mechanisms of toxicity.","1558-2639","","10.1109/TNB.2007.909005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378199","Air pollution;calcium;nanoparticles;NF-$\kappa$B;oxidative stress;quantum dots;ultrafine;air pollution, , , , , ,;nanoparticles;ultrafine;oxidative stress;calcium;NF-º B;quantum dots","Air pollution;Toxicology;Nanotechnology;Biological materials;Nanoparticles;Stress;Organic materials;Carbon dioxide;Composite materials;Surface contamination","Adult;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell Physiology;Child;Hazardous Waste;Humans;Industrial Waste;Inflammation;Inflammation;Inhalation Exposure;Lung Diseases;Lung Diseases;Nanoparticles;Oxidative Stress;Particle Size;Particulate Matter;Particulate Matter;Reactive Oxygen Species;Silicones;Silicones","291","","114","IEEE","4 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic assumption is that faults do not occur in isolation, but rather in bursts of several related faults. Therefore, we cache locations that are likely to have faults: starting from the location of a known (fixed) fault, we cache the location itself, any locations changed together with the fault, recently added locations, and recently changed locations. By consulting the cache at the moment a fault is fixed, a developer can detect likely fault-prone locations. This is useful for prioritizing verification and validation resources on the most fault prone files or entities. In our evaluation of seven open source projects with more than 200,000 revisions, the cache selects 10% of the source code files; these files account for 73%-95% of faults - a significant advance beyond the state of the art.","1558-1225","0-7695-2828-7","10.1109/ICSE.2007.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4222610","","History;Software quality;Fault diagnosis;Prediction algorithms;Software algorithms;Switches;Isolation technology;Software systems;Fault detection;Open source software","","289","7","26","IEEE","4 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, security is a critical factor and a significant challenge to be met. Misbehaving or faulty network nodes have to be detected and prevented from disrupting network operation, a problem particularly hard to address in the life-critical VN environment. Existing networks rely mainly on node certificate revocation for attacker eviction, but the lack of an omnipresent infrastructure in VNs may unacceptably delay the retrieval of the most recent and relevant revocation information; this will especially be the case in the early deployment stages of such a highly volatile and large-scale system. In this paper, we address this specific problem. We propose protocols, as components of a framework, for the identification and local containment of misbehaving or faulty nodes, and then for their eviction from the system. We tailor our design to the VN characteristics and analyze our system. Our results show that the distributed approach to contain nodes and contribute to their eviction is efficiently feasible and achieves a sufficient level of robustness.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.071006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4346443","","Vehicle safety;Robustness;Vehicle driving;Fault detection;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Protocols;Fault diagnosis;Research initiatives;Manufacturing","","289","4","38","IEEE","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A BbNN consists of a 2-D array of modular component NNs with flexible structures and internal configurations that can be implemented using reconfigurable digital hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Signal flow between the blocks determines the internal configuration of a block as well as the overall structure of the BbNN. Network structure and the weights are optimized using local gradient-based search and evolutionary operators with the rates changing adaptively according to their effectiveness in the previous evolution period. Such adaptive operator rate update scheme ensures higher fitness on average compared to predetermined fixed operator rates. The Hermite transform coefficients and the time interval between two neighboring R-peaks of ECG signals are used as inputs to the BbNN. A BbNN optimized with the proposed evolutionary algorithm (EA) makes a personalized heartbeat pattern classifier that copes with changing operating environments caused by individual difference and time-varying characteristics of ECG signals. Simulation results using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database demonstrate high average detection accuracies of ventricular ectopic beats (98.1%) and supraventricular ectopic beats (96.6%) patterns for heartbeat monitoring, being a significant improvement over previously reported electrocardiogram (ECG) classification results.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2007.900239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359186","Block-based neural networks (BbNNs);evolutionary algorithms (EAs);personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) classification;Block-based neural networks (BbNNs);evolutionary algorithms (EAs);personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) classification","Neural networks;Electrocardiography;Pattern classification;Heart beat;Field programmable gate arrays;Heart rate variability;Flexible structures;Hardware;Evolutionary computation;Hospitals","Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Heart Ventricles;Humans;Models, Statistical;Monitoring, Physiologic;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Predictive Value of Tests;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ventricular Premature Complexes;Ventricular Premature Complexes","289","1","40","IEEE","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike most existing denoising algorithms, using the SURE makes it needless to hypothesize a statistical model for the noiseless image. A key point of our approach is that, although the (nonlinear) processing is performed in a transformed domain-typically, an undecimated discrete wavelet transform, but we also address nonorthonormal transforms-this minimization is performed in the image domain. Indeed, we demonstrate that, when the transform is a ldquotightrdquo frame (an undecimated wavelet transform using orthonormal filters), separate subband minimization yields substantially worse results. In order for our approach to be viable, we add another principle, that the denoising process can be expressed as a linear combination of elementary denoising processes-linear expansion of thresholds (LET). Armed with the SURE and LET principles, we show that a denoising algorithm merely amounts to solving a linear system of equations which is obviously fast and efficient. Quite remarkably, the very competitive results obtained by performing a simple threshold (image-domain SURE optimized) on the undecimated Haar wavelet coefficients show that the SURE-LET principle has a huge potential.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.906002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4337754","","Image denoising;Noise reduction;PSNR;Discrete wavelet transforms;Wavelet coefficients;Biomedical imaging;Gaussian noise;Wavelet domain;Filters;Linear systems","Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","288","1","29","IEEE","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But little research has been done to develop and analyze the much larger samples of existing data generated daily by mobile networks. The most common explanation for this is that the challenge of data-sharing with the telecommunications industry has hampered data access.

Compared to other mobile networks, VANET exhibits unique characteristics in terms of vehicular mobility constraints, application requirements such as a safety message broadcast period, and vehicular network connectivity. Based on the observed characteristics, we propose a scheme called AMOEBA, that provides location privacy by utilizing the group navigation of vehicles. By simulating vehicular mobility in freeways and streets, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated under VANET application constraints and two passive adversary models.

The reflectivity of smooth, optically thick materials can be modeled with Fresnel equations. In case of materials with a rough surface, diffuse scattering reduces the power reflected in the specular direction. Kirchhoff scattering theory can be employed to derive modified Fresnel equations which account for these losses by introducing a Rayleigh roughness factor calculated from the measured surface height distribution of the sample under observation. Using the resulting, analytically derived reflection coefficient based on material parameter and surface measurements in propagation models enables the simulation of arbitrary configurations. We present a set of calculated and measured reflection coefficients for a selection of common indoor building materials which are in good agreement, thus verifying our modeling approach. Furthermore, we illustrate by ray-tracing simulations the effect of wall and ceiling roughness on propagation in future indoor scenarios. Both, absolute power levels and propagation patterns are shown to be strongly influenced by scattering. In some cases, reflected transmissions with longer propagation paths can be more efficient than the shorter ones in terms of incurred losses.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.908559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4380579","Kirchhoff approximation;ray-tracing;rough surface scattering;THz channel modeling;THz communication","Optical scattering;Rayleigh scattering;Power system modeling;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Communication systems;Building materials;Optical materials;Equations;Optical reflection","","287","1","16","IEEE","12 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spectrally efficient, inexpensive cellular systems are by definition densely populated and interference-limited. But spatial multiplexing MIMO systems- whose principal merit is a supposed dramatic increase in spectral efficiency- lose much of their effectiveness in high levels of interference. This article overviews several approaches to handling interference in multicell MIMO systems. The discussion is applicable to any multi-antenna cellular network, including 802.16e/WiMAX, 3GPP (HSDPA and 3GPP LTE), and 3GPP2 (lxEVDO). We argue that many of the traditional interference management techniques have limited usefulness (or are even counterproductive) when viewed in concert with MIMO. The problem of interference in MIMO systems is too large in scope to be handled with a single technique: in practice a combination of complementary countermeasures will be needed. We overview emerging system-level interference-reducing strategies based on cooperation, which will be important for overcoming interference in future spatial multiplexing cellular systems.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4407232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407232","","Interference;MIMO;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Multiaccess communication;Wireless LAN;WiMAX;Downlink;Transmitters","","287","10","28","IEEE","18 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Then, the chips are classified by using the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm with the radial basis function (RBF) network as the base learner. Since the RBF network is a binary classifier, the multiclass problem was decomposed into a set of binary ones through the error-correcting output codes (ECOC) method, specifying a dictionary of code words for the set of three possible classes. AdaBoost combines the classification results of the RBF network for each binary problem into a code word, which is then ""decoded"" as one of the code words (i.e., ground-vehicle classes) in the specified dictionary. Along with classification, within the AdaBoost framework, we also conduct efficient fusion of the fine and raw image-feature vectors.

Regions that display strong correlations between tissue volume and classification (clinical) variables are extracted using a watershed segmentation algorithm, taking into account the regional smoothness of the correlation map which is estimated by a cross-validation strategy to achieve robustness to outliers. A volume increment algorithm is then applied to these regions to extract regional volumetric features, from which a feature selection technique using support vector machine (SVM)-based criteria is used to select the most discriminative features, according to their effect on the upper bound of the leave-one-out generalization error. Finally, SVM-based classification is applied using the best set of features, and it is tested using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy.

Generally speaking, the aim of symbolic control as is envisioned in this article is to enable the usage of methods of formal logic, languages, and automata theory for solving effectively complex planning problems for robots and teams of robots. The results presented in this article can be divided in two groups: top-down approaches, whereby formal logic tools are employed on rather abstract models of robots; and bottom up approaches, whose aim is to provide means by which such abstractions are possible and effective. The two ends do not quite tie as yet, and much work remains to be done in both directions to obtain generally applicable methods.

The fact that channel availability can rapidly change over time and the need for coordinated quiet periods in order to quickly and robustly detect the presence of incumbents, are just some of the examples of the unique challenges in protocol and algorithm design for CR networks and, in particular, in the medium access control (MAC) layer. With this in mind, in this paper we introduce a novel cognitive MAC (C-MAC) protocol for distributed multi-channel wireless networks. C-MAC operates over multiple channels, and hence is able to effectively deal with, among other things, the dynamics of resource availability due to primary users and mitigate the effects of distributed quiet periods utilized for primary user signal detection. In C-MAC, each channel is logically divided into recurring superframes which, in turn, include a slotted beaconing period (BP) where nodes exchange information and negotiate channel usage. Each node transmits a beacon in a designated beacon slot during the BP, which helps in dealing with hidden nodes, medium reservations, and mobility. For coordination amongst nodes in different channels, a rendezvous channel (RC) is employed that is decided dynamically and in a totally distributed fashion. Among other things, the RC is used to support network-wide multicast and broadcast which are often neglected in existing multi-channel MAC protocols. We present promising performance results of C- MAC. We also describe our efforts to implement features of C- MAC in a real CR prototype with Atheros chipset, which currently includes the spectrum sensing module and preliminary features of C-MAC.","","1-4244-0663-3","10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221489","","Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks;Chromium;Algorithm design and analysis;Access protocols;Multicast protocols;Wireless communication;Communications technology;Cognitive radio","","285","13","28","IEEE","4 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The moments-generating, probability density, cumulative distribution, and moments functions of the N *Nakagami distribution are developed in closed form using the Meijer's G -function. Using these formulas, generic closed-form expressions for the outage probability, amount of fading, and average error probabilities for several binary and multilevel modulation signals of digital communication systems operating over the N *Nakagami fading and the additive white Gaussian noise channel are presented. Complementary numerical and computer simulation performance evaluation results verify the correctness of the proposed formulation.

A sum consisting of a mixture of the above distributions can also be easily handled. The method uses the moment generating function (MGF) as a tool in the approximation and does so without the extremely precise numerical computations at a large number of points that were required by the previously proposed methods in the literature. Unlike popular approximation methods such as the Fenton-Wilkinson method and the Schwartz-Yeh method, which have their own respective short-comings, the proposed method provides the parametric flexibility to accurately approximate different portions of the lognormal sum distribution.

Moreover, digital microfluidics is being applied in other areas such as airborne chemical detection, DNA sequencing by synthesis, and tissue engineering. In most diagnostic and chemical-detection applications, a key challenge is the preparation of the analyte for presentation to the on-chip detection system. Thus, in diagnostics, raw physiological samples must be introduced onto the chip and then further processed by lysing blood cells and extracting DNA. For massively parallel DNA sequencing, sample preparation can be performed off chip, but the synthesis steps must be performed in a sequential on-chip format by automated control of buffers and nucleotides to extend the read lengths of DNA fragments. In airborne particulate-sampling applications, the sample collection from an air stream must be integrated into the LoC analytical component, which requires a collection droplet to scan an exposed impacted surface after its introduction into a closed analytical section. Finally, in tissue-engineering applications, the challenge for LoC technology is to build high-resolution (less than 10 microns) 3D tissue constructs with embedded cells and growth factors by manipulating and maintaining live cells in the chip platform.

Current approaches in the field are either based on theoretical properties and do not take into account important factors such as misalignment or camera-lens distortion or over-parametrised which leads to minimisation problems that are difficult to solve. Recent techniques based on polynomial approximations lead to impractical calibration methods. Our model is based on an exact theoretical projection function to which we add well identified parameters to model real-world errors. This leads to a full methodology from the initialisation of the intrinsic parameters to the general calibration. We also discuss the validity of the approach for fish-eye and spherical models.

By incorporating the advantages of the mean shift (MS) segmentation and the normalized cut (Ncut) partitioning methods, the proposed method requires low computational complexity and is therefore very feasible for real-time image segmentation processing. It preprocesses an image by using the MS algorithm to form segmented regions that preserve the desirable discontinuity characteristics of the image. The segmented regions are then represented by using the graph structures, and the Ncut method is applied to perform globally optimized clustering. Because the number of the segmented regions is much smaller than that of the image pixels, the proposed method allows a low-dimensional image clustering with significant reduction of the complexity compared to conventional graph-partitioning methods that are directly applied to the image pixels. In addition, the image clustering using the segmented regions, instead of the image pixels, also reduces the sensitivity to noise and results in enhanced image segmentation performance. Furthermore, to avoid some inappropriate partitioning when considering every region as only one graph node, we develop an improved segmentation strategy using multiple child nodes for each region. The superiority of the proposed method is examined and demonstrated through a large number of experiments using color natural scene images.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2007.902249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4305291","Color image segmentation;graph partitioning;mean shift (MS);normalized cut (Ncut)","Color;Image segmentation;Pixel;Robustness;Computational complexity;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Optimization methods;Noise reduction;Layout","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Color;Colorimetry;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","283","3","31","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we discuss an efficient implementation of the ""probing"" technique introduced recently by Bows et al. (2006). It simplifies the MRF while preserving the global optimum. Our code is 400-700 faster on some graphs than the implementation of the work of Bows et al. (2006). Second, we present a new technique which takes an arbitrary input labeling and tries to improve its energy. We give theoretical characterizations of local minima of this procedure. We applied both techniques to many applications, including image segmentation, new view synthesis, super-resolution, diagram recognition, parameter learning, texture restoration, and image deconvolution. For several applications we see that we are able to find the global minimum very efficiently, and considerably outperform the original roof duality approach.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the supervised dimensionality reduction problem by encoding an image object as a general tensor of second or even higher order. First, we propose a discriminant tensor criterion, whereby multiple interrelated lower dimensional discriminative subspaces are derived for feature extraction. Then, a novel approach, called  ${k}$-mode optimization, is presented to iteratively learn these subspaces by unfolding the tensor along different tensor directions. We call this algorithm multilinear discriminant analysis (MDA), which has the following characteristics: 1) multiple interrelated subspaces can collaborate to discriminate different classes, 2) for classification problems involving higher order tensors, the MDA algorithm can avoid the curse of dimensionality dilemma and alleviate the small sample size problem, and 3) the computational cost in the learning stage is reduced to a large extent owing to the reduced data dimensions in ${k}$-mode optimization. We provide extensive experiments on ORL, CMU PIE, and FERET databases by encoding face images as second- or third-order tensors to demonstrate that the proposed MDA algorithm based on higher order tensors has the potential to outperform the traditional vector-based subspace learning algorithms, especially in the cases with small sample sizes.

In our approach, each action is modeled as a series of synthetic 2D human poses rendered from a wide range of viewpoints. The constraints on transition of the synthetic poses is represented by a graph model called Action Net. Given the input, silhouette matching between the input frames and the key poses is performed first using an enhanced Pyramid Match Kernel algorithm. The best matched sequence of actions is then tracked using the Viterbi algorithm.

However, developing such a system is always challenging due to the richness, ambiguity, and the dynamic nature of facial actions. Although a number of research groups attempt to recognize facial action units (AUs) by either improving facial feature extraction techniques, or the AU classification techniques, these methods often recognize AUs or certain AU combinations individually and statically, ignoring the semantic relationships among AUs and the dynamics of AUs. Hence, these approaches cannot always recognize AUs reliably, robustly, and consistently.In this paper, we propose a novel approach that systematically accounts for the relationships among AUs and their temporal evolutions for AU recognition. Specifically, we use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model the relationships among different AUs. The DBN provides a coherent and unified hierarchical probabilistic framework to represent probabilistic relationships among various AUs and to account for the temporal changes in facial action development. Within our system, robust computer vision techniques are used to obtain AU measurements. And such AU measurements are then applied as evidence to the DBN for inferring various AUs. The experiments show that the integration of AU relationships and AU dynamics with AU measurements yields significant improvement of AU recognition, especially for spontaneous facial expressions and under more realistic environment including illumination variation, face pose variation, and occlusion.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293201","Facial Action Unit Recognition;Facial Expression Analysis;Facial Action Coding System;Bayesian Networks","Face recognition;Gold;Facial features;Humans;Robustness;Real time systems;Facial animation;Computer vision;Lighting;Bayesian methods","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Biometry;Face;Face;Facial Expression;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Semantics;Sensitivity and Specificity","277","6","41","IEEE","27 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the ripple current propagation path is analyzed, and its linearized ac model is derived. The equivalent circuit model and ripple current reduction with passive energy storage component are simulated and verified with experiments. An advanced active control technique is then proposed to incorporate a current control loop in the dc-dc converter for ripple reduction.

If a hypothesis could be learned in the presence of a large amount of undiagnosed samples, the heavy burden on the medical experts could be released.

It extends the co-training paradigm by using a well-known ensemble method named Random Forest, which enables Co-Forest to estimate the labeling confidence of undiagnosed samples and easily produce the final hypothesis. Experiments on benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Case studies on three medical data sets and a successful application to microcalcification detection for breast cancer diagnosis show that undiagnosed samples are helpful in building CAD systems, and Co-Forest is able to enhance the performance of the hypothesis that is learned on only a small amount of diagnosed samples by utilizing the available undiagnosed samples.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2007.904745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4342802","Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD);co-training;ensemble learning;machine learning;microcalcification cluster detection;random forest;semisupervised learning","Computer aided diagnosis;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Semisupervised learning;Breast cancer;Labeling;Cancer detection;Technological innovation;Supervised learning;Machine learning algorithms","","277","","47","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its modal fields are highly confined over a wavelength range extending from zero frequency to the ultraviolet. We then show that for an asymmetric plasmonic slot waveguide, in which the surrounding dielectric media above and below the metal film are different, there may exist a cutoff slot width and/or a cutoff metal film thickness above which the mode becomes leaky, and there always exists a cutoff wavelength above which the mode becomes leaky. We investigate in detail the effect of variations of the parameters of the symmetric and asymmetric plasmonic slot waveguides. We also consider related alternative 3-D plasmonic waveguide geometries, such as a plasmonic slot waveguide, in which the two metal film regions that form the slot have a finite width, and a plasmonic strip waveguide, which is formed between a metallic strip and a metallic substrate.

By wireless transmission, UWB communications systems can only operate in a short distance of a few meters to tens of meters. The convergence of UWB and optical fiber distribution techniques, or UWB over fiber, offers the availability of undisrupted service across different networks and eventually achieves high-data-rate access at any time and from any place. To distribute the UWB signals over the optical fiber, it is also desirable that the UWB signals can be generated in the optical domain without having extra electrical-to-optical conversion. In addition, UWB signals that are generated in the optical domain can be easily tailored to have a spectrum that meets the FCC-specified spectral mask. In this paper, techniques to generate UWB signals in the optical domain will be discussed. These techniques are divided into three categories, with the generation of UWB signals based on the following: 1) phase-modulation-to-intensity-modulation conversion; 2) a photonic microwave delay-line filter; and 3) optical spectral shaping and dispersion-induced frequency-to-time mapping. The areas for future development and the challenge of implementation of these techniques for practical applications will also be discussed.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2007.906820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357926","Dispersion;frequency-to-time mapping;microwave photonics;optical frequency discriminator;optical phase modulation;photonic microwave filter;radio over fiber;spectral shaping;ultrashort pulse;ultrawideband (UWB);Dispersion;frequency-to-time mapping;microwave photonics;optical frequency discriminator;optical phase modulation;photonic microwave filter;radio over fiber;spectral shaping;ultrashort pulse;ultrawideband (UWB)","Signal generators;Ultra wideband technology;Optical filters;Optical sensors;FCC;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Optical fibers;Optoelectronic and photonic sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization","","277","1","42","IEEE","6 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of separately modeling the two interacting dynamic effects, this work treats their combined effect phenomenologically and proposes a rate-dependent modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii operator to account for the hysteretic nonlinearity of a piezoelectric actuator at varying actuation frequency.

Up to now, this assumption has shaped most of the algorithms for phasor estimation. This paper breaks that old paradigm by relaxing the static phasor concept to a dynamic one, i.e., the dynamic phasor, which is one complex time function with movement freedom. This paper presents the algorithm to approximate the dynamic phasor by a second-order Taylor polynomial and compares its phasor estimate to the traditional one. This approximation leads to the definition of the phasor state vector, which contains not only the estimate of the dynamic phasor but the estimates of its derivatives as well. These new estimates improve the accuracy of oscillation estimation by including new Taylor details into the interpolation process. Errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ are achieved with this approximation in bandpass signals over observation intervals of two cycles.

We consider two approaches: (i) separate optimization of the source or the relay PA with individual per node transmit power constraints and (ii) joint optimization of the source and the relay PA with joint transmit power constraint. We provide the optimal PA at the source (or the relay) with a node transmit power constraint that maximizes the instantaneous rate for a given relay (or source) PA. Furthermore, we show that repeating this separate optimization of the source and the relay PA alternately converges and improves the achievable rate of the considered link. Since the joint optimization of the source and the relay PA is analytically not tractable we use a high SNR approximation of the SNR at the destination.

Existing methods can suffer from a lack of global stability, a lack of tracking accuracy, or a dependence on smooth road surfaces, any one of which could lead to the loss of the vehicle in autonomous off-road driving. This work treats automobile trajectory tracking in a new manner, by considering the orientation of the front wheels - not the vehicle's body - with respect to the desired trajectory, enabling collocated control of the system. A steering control law is designed using the kinematic equations of motion, for which global asymptotic stability is proven. This control law is then augmented to handle the dynamics of pneumatic tires and of the servo-actuated steering wheel. To control vehicle speed, the brake and throttle are actuated by a switching proportional integral (PI) controller. The complete control system consumes a negligible fraction of a computer's resources. It was implemented on a Volkswagen Touareg, ""Stanley"", the Stanford Racing Team's entry in the DARPA Grand Challenge 2005, a 132 mi autonomous off-road race. Experimental results from Stanley demonstrate the ability of the controller to track trajectories between obstacles, over steep and wavy terrain, through deep mud puddles, and along cliff edges, with a typical root mean square (RMS) crosstrack error of under 0.1 m. In the DARPA National Qualification Event 2005, Stanley was the only vehicle out of 40 competitors to not hit an obstacle or miss a gate, and in the DARPA Grand Challenge 2005 Stanley had the fastest course completion time.","2378-5861","1-4244-0988-8","10.1109/ACC.2007.4282788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4282788","","Automobiles;Trajectory;Remotely operated vehicles;Wheels;Control systems;Pi control;Proportional control;Stability;Roads;Surface treatment","","273","","15","IEEE","30 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several frequency estimation techniques have been developed and are used to help the induction machine fault detection and diagnosis. This paper presents a technique to improve the fault detection technique by using the classical multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method. This method is a powerful tool that extracts meaningful frequencies from the signal, and it has been widely used in different areas, which include electrical machines. In the proposed application, the fault sensitive frequencies have to be found in the stator current signature. They are numerous in a given frequency range, and they are affected by the signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the MUSIC method takes a long computation time to find many frequencies by increasing the dimension of the autocorrelation matrix. To solve this problem, an algorithm that is based on zooming in a specific frequency range is proposed with MUSIC in order to improve the performances of frequency extraction. Moreover, the method is integrated as a part of MUSIC to estimate the frequency signal dimension order based on classification of autocorrelation matrix eigenvalues. The proposed algorithm has been applied to detect a rotor broken bar fault in a three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine under different loads and in steady-state condition.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.899826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4278024","Electric variables measurement;fault diagnosis;Fourier transforms;frequency estimation;induction machines;multidimensional signal processing;pattern classification","Frequency estimation;Induction machines;Fault detection;Multiple signal classification;Electrical fault detection;Stators;Autocorrelation;Fault diagnosis;Signal to noise ratio;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","273","5","22","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The robust controller is realized by including an adaptive element in the reference-voltage-generation stage using the feedforward control. Due to the time-varying nature and the high-bandwidth property of the uncertainties in a practical PMSM drive system, the adaptive element is simply chosen as the estimated uncertainty function, which adaptively varies with different operating conditions. Subsequently, the frequency modes of the uncertainty function are embedded in the control effort, and a robust current-control performance is yielded. Furthermore, the inclusion of the estimated uncertainty function provides an efficient solution for torque-ripple minimization in PMSM drives. This is because the frequency modes of the disturbances to be eliminated, i.e., the flux harmonics, are included in the stable closed-loop system. To provide a high-bandwidth estimate of the uncertainty function, a simple adaptation law is derived using the nominal current dynamics and the steepest descent method. To guarantee the system's convergence and to properly tune the proposed observer, a stability analysis based on a discrete-time Lyapunov function has been used. Comparative evaluation experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under different operating conditions.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.895074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273665","Adaptive control;current control;disturbance estimation;permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM);torque-ripple minimization","Robustness;Drives;Uncertainty;Robust control;Frequency;Synchronous motors;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Time varying systems;Adaptive systems","","273","","21","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a unified approach that directly predicts the change of key transistor parameters under various process and design conditions for both NBTI and CHC effects. Using the general reaction-diffusion model and the concept of surface potential, the proposed method continuously captures the performance degradation across subthreshold and strong inversion regions. Models are comprehensively verified with an industrial 65-nm technology. By benchmarking the prediction of circuit performance degradation with the measured ring oscillator data and simulations of an amplifier, we demonstrate that the proposed method very well predicts the degradation.

The algorithms are designed aiming minimum estimation error in both transient and steady state over a wide velocity range, including very low and persistent zero-speed operation. A major challenge at very low and zero speed is the lost coupling effect from the rotor to the stator, which makes the information on rotor variables unobservable on the stator side. As a solution to this problem, in this paper, the load torque and the rotor angular velocity are simultaneously estimated, with the velocity taken into consideration via the equation of motion and not as a constant parameter, which is commonly the case in most past studies. The estimation of load torque, on the other hand, is performed as a constant parameter to account for Coulomb and viscous friction at steady state to improve the estimation performance at very low and zero speed. The estimation algorithms developed based on the rotor and stator fluxes are experimentally tested under challenging variations and reversals of the velocity and load torque (step-type and varying linearly with velocity) over a wide velocity range and at zero speed. In all the scenarios, the current estimation error has remained within a very narrow error band, also yielding acceptable velocity estimation errors, which motivate the use of the developed estimation method in sensorless control of IMs over a wide velocity range and persistent zero-speed operation","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2006.885123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4084641","Extended Kalman filter (EKF);induction motor (IM);low/zero-speed operation;sensorless control","Induction motors;Estimation error;Stators;Torque;Steady-state;State estimation;Algorithm design and analysis;Couplings;Rotors;Angular velocity","","269","1","23","IEEE","5 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have adopted an integrated system approach to develop humanoid robots. Herein, we describe the importance of replicating human-like capabilities and responses during human–robot interaction in this context. Our balancing controller provides gravity compensation, making the robot passive and thereby facilitating safe physical interactions. The method operates by setting an appropriate ground reaction force and transforming these forces into full-body joint torques. It handles an arbitrary number of force interaction points on the robot. It does not require force measurement at interested contact points. It requires neither inverse kinematics nor inverse dynamics. It can adapt to uneven ground surfaces. It operates as a force control process, and can therefore, accommodate simultaneous control processes using force-, velocity-, or position-based control. Forces are distributed over supporting contact points in an optimal manner. Joint redundancy is resolved by damping injection in the context of passivity. We present various force interaction experiments using our full-sized bipedal humanoid platform, including compliant balance, even when affected by unknown external forces, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.

We performed a systematic review of studies that compared predictions from cross-company models with predictions from within-company models based on analysis of project data. Ten papers compared cross-company and within-company estimation models; however, only seven presented independent results. Of those seven, three found that cross-company models were not significantly different from within-company models, and four found that cross-company models were significantly worse than within-company models. Experimental procedures used by the studies differed making it impossible to undertake formal meta-analysis of the results. The main trend distinguishing study results was that studies with small within-company data sets (i.e., $20 projects) that used leave-one-out cross validation all found that the within-company model was significantly different (better) from the cross-company model. The results of this review are inconclusive. It is clear that some organizations would be ill-served by cross-company models whereas others would benefit. Further studies are needed, but they must be independent (i.e., based on different data bases or at least different single company data sets) and should address specific hypotheses concerning the conditions that would favor cross-company or within-company models.

The amelioration of powerful multicarrier OFDM arrangements with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has numerous benefits, which are detailed in this treatise. We continue by highlighting the limitations of conventional detection and channel estimation techniques designed for multiuser MIMO OFDM systems in the so-called rank-deficient scenarios, where the number of users supported or the number of transmit antennas employed exceeds the number of receiver antennas. This is often encountered in practice, unless we limit the number of users granted access in the base station's or radio port's coverage area. Following a historical perspective on the associated design problems and their state-of-the-art solutions, the second half of this treatise details a range of classic multiuser detectors (MUDs) designed for MIMO-OFDM systems and characterizes their achievable performance. A further section aims for identifying novel cutting-edge genetic algorithm (GA)-aided detector solutions, which have found numerous applications in wireless communications in recent years. In an effort to stimulate the cross pollination of ideas across the machine learning, optimization, signal processing, and wireless communications research communities, we will review the broadly applicable principles of various GA-assisted optimization techniques, which were recently proposed also for employment in multiuser MIMO OFDM. In order to stimulate new research, we demonstrate that the family of GA-aided MUDs is capable of achieving a near-optimum performance at the cost of a significantly lower computational complexity than that imposed by their optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) MUD aided counterparts.

Malware analysis is the process of determining the behavior and purpose of a given Malware sample (such as a virus, worm, or Trojan horse). This process is a necessary step to be able to develop effective detection techniques and removal tools. Currently, Malware analysis is mostly a manual process that is tedious and time-intensive. To mitigate this problem, a number of analysis tools have been proposed that automatically extract the behavior of an unknown program by executing it in a restricted environment and recording the operating system calls that are invoked. The problem of dynamic analysis tools is that only a single program execution is observed. Unfortunately, however, it is possible that certain malicious actions are only triggered under specific circumstances (e.g., on a particular day, when a certain file is present, or when a certain command is received). In this paper, we propose a system that allows us to explore multiple execution paths and identify malicious actions that are executed only when certain conditions are met. This enables us to automatically extract a more complete view of the program under analysis and identify under which circumstances suspicious actions are carried out. Our experimental results demonstrate that many Malware samples show different behavior depending on input read from the environment. Thus, by exploring multiple execution paths, we can obtain a more complete picture of their actions.","2375-1207","0-7695-2848-1","10.1109/SP.2007.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223228","","Computer worms;Operating systems;Invasive software;Data security;Databases;Humans;Virtual machining;Internet;Payloads;Computer viruses","","266","20","30","IEEE","4 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The hand is conceived to be applied to prosthetics as well as to humanoid and personal robotics; hence, anthropomorphism is a fundamental requirement to be addressed both in the physical aspect and in the functional behavior. In this paper, a biomechatronic approach is addressed to harmonize the mechanical design of the anthropomorphic artificial hand with the design of the hand control system. More in detail, this paper focuses on the control system of the hand and on the optimization of the hand design in order to obtain a human-like kinematics and dynamics. By evaluating the simulated hand performance, the mechanical design is iteratively refined. The mechanical structure and the ratio between number of actuators and number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) have been optimized in order to cope with the strict size and weight constraints that are typical of application of artificial hands to prosthetics and humanoid robotics. The proposed hand has a kinematic structure similar to the natural hand featuring three articulated fingers (thumb, index, and middle finger with 3 DOF for each finger and 1 DOF for the abduction/adduction of the thumb) driven by four dc motors. A special underactuated transmission has been designed that allows keeping the number of motors as low as possible while achieving a self-adaptive grasp, as a result of the passive compliance of the distal DOF of the fingers. A proper hand control scheme has been designed and implemented for the study and optimization of hand motor performance in order to achieve a human-like motor behavior. To this aim, available data on motion of the human fingers are collected from the neuroscience literature in order to derive a reference input for the control. Simulation trials and computer-aided design (CAD) mechanical tools are used to obtain a finger model including its dynamics. Also the closed-loop control system is simulated in order to study the effect of iterative mechanical redesign and to define the final set of mechanical parameters for the hand optimization. Results of the experimental tests carried out for validating the model of the robotic finger, and details on the process of integrated refinement and optimization of the mechanical structure and of the hand motor control scheme are extensively reported in the paper.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2007.901936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291586","Biomechatronic design;biorobotics;hand motor control;prosthetics","Biomechatronics;Anthropomorphism;Prosthetics;Fingers;DC motors;Humans;Humanoid robots;Control systems;Design optimization;Kinematics","","266","1","46","IEEE","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, the cycle frequency domain profile (CDP) is used for signal detection and preprocessing for signal classification. Signal features are extracted from CDP using a threshold-test method. For classification, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been used to process extracted signal features due to its robust pattern-matching capability. We also investigate the effects of varied observation length on signal detection and classification. It is found that the CDP-based detector and the HMM-based classifier can detect and classify incoming signals at a range of low SNRs.","","1-4244-0663-3","10.1109/DYSPAN.2007.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221497","","Signal detection;Cognitive radio;Chromium;Hidden Markov models;Adaptive signal detection;Feature extraction;Frequency domain analysis;Pattern classification;Signal processing;Robustness","","265","2","13","IEEE","4 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For electric field amplitudes exceeding MV/m, such pulses are also expected to allow access to the cell interior through conduction currents flowing through the permeabilized plasma membrane. In both cases, limiting the duration of the electrical pulses to nanoseconds ensures only nonthermal interactions of the electric field with subcellular structures. This intracellular access allows the manipulation of cell functions. Experimental studies, in which human cells were exposed to pulsed electric fields of up to 300 kV/cm amplitude with durations as short as 3 ns, have confirmed this hypothesis and have shown that it is possible to selectively alter the behavior and/or survival of cells. Observed nanosecond pulsed effects at moderate electric fields include intracellular release of calcium and enhanced gene expression, which could have long term implications on cell behavior and function. At increased electric fields, the application of nanosecond pulses induces a type of programmed cell death, apoptosis, in biological cells. Cell survival studies with 10 ns pulses have shown that the viability of the cells scales inversely with the electrical energy density, which is similar to the ""dose"" effect caused by ionizing radiation. On the other hand, there is experimental evidence that, for pulses of varying durations, the onset of a range of observed biological effects is determined by the electrical charge that is transferred to the cell membrane during pulsing. This leads to an empirical similarity law for nanosecond pulse effects, with the product of electric field intensity, pulse duration, and the square root of the number of pulses as the similarity parameter. The similarity law allows one not only to predict cell viability based on pulse parameters, but has also been shown to be applicable for inducing platelet aggregation, an effect which is triggered by internal calcium release. Applications for nanosecond pulse effects cover a wide range: from a rather simple use as preventing biofouling in cooling water systems, to advanced medical applications, such as gene therapy and tumor treatment. Results of this continuing research are leading to the development of wound healing and skin cancer treatments, which are discussed in some detail.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2007.4339468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4339468","","Bioelectric phenomena;Nanobioscience;Cells (biology);Biomembranes;Biological cells;Calcium;Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Plasmas;Humans","","265","13","83","IEEE","8 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem is difficult because one needs to determine both the number of people in each frame and estimate their configurations. But, finding people and localizing their limbs is hard because people can move fast and unpredictably, can appear in a variety of poses and clothes, and are often surrounded by limb-like clutter. We develop a completely automatic system that works in two stages; it first builds a model of appearance of each person in a video and then it tracks by detecting those models in each frame (""tracking by model-building and detection""). We develop two algorithms that build models; one bottom-up approach groups together candidate body parts found throughout a sequence. We also describe a top-down approach that automatically builds people-models by detecting convenient key poses within a sequence. We finally show that building a discriminative model of appearance is quite helpful since it exploits structure in a background (without background-subtraction). We demonstrate the resulting tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames of unscripted indoor and outdoor activity, a feature-length film (""Run Lola Run""), and legacy sports footage (from the 2002 World Series and 1998 Winter Olympics). Experiments suggest that our system 1) can count distinct individuals, 2) can identify and track them, 3) can recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly leave the view, 4) can identify body configuration accurately, and 5) is not dependent on particular models of human motion","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.250600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016551","People tracking;motion capture;surveillance.","Video sequences;Tracking;Humans;Surveillance;Hidden Markov models;Buildings;Biological system modeling;Computer vision;Computer interfaces;Data mining","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Video Recording;Whole Body Imaging","265","2","47","IEEE","30 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These sensors are robust and easy to use without compromising noise performance. They are optimized for operation with our high-speed direct-coupled flux-locked loop (FLL) electronics XXF-1. For the readout of cryogenic detectors, series arrays of 16 SQUIDs with 3 nH input inductance were designed which can be cooled down and operated in the Earth's field without magnetic shield. A compact gradiometric design allows the chips to be mounted directly on a Cu block at the cold stage of a mK cryostat without degradation in noise. A current noise level of 9 or 5 is achieved at 4.2 K or 300 mK, respectively. Ultra-high-speed operation was demonstrated by using a cold FLL electronics prototype in close proximity to the SQUID array. An extremely high FLL bandwidth of 350 MHz was achieved which outperforms any flux-locked SQUID before by more than an order of magnitude. For applications requiring a larger input inductance of up to 2 , integrated two-stage sensors were developed consisting of a single front-end SQUID with double-transformer coupling read out by a 16-SQUID array. These sensors are very convenient to use as their voltage-flux characteristic is essentially single-SQUID-like. Devices optimized for 4.2 K operation have a coupled energy resolution around 50 times Planck's constant . Heavily shunted devices for low-temperature operation typically achieve 80 or 8 at 4.2 K or 300 mK, respectively. An optional current limiter (Q-spoiler) at the input reduces the input current in pulsed applications like nuclear magnetic resonance or magnetorelaxometry. Integrated rf filters and resistor-capacitor shunts across the input coil result in smooth, well-behaved voltage-flux characteristics even at low temperatures 4.2 K. For magnetic field sensing applications, integrated miniature multiloop magnetometers were designed with maximized field resolution.

The relationship between following distance and velocity mapped into a two-dimensional space is modeled for each driver with an optimal velocity model approximated by a nonlinear function or with a statistical method of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Pedal operation patterns are also modeled with GMMs that represent the distributions of raw pedal operation signals or spectral features extracted through spectral analysis of the raw pedal operation signals. The driver models are evaluated in driver identification experiments using driving signals collected in a driving simulator and in a real vehicle.

In the static model, existence of dc solution, which is a necessary no-limit-cycle condition, is examined using a graphical method. Based on the generalized describing function method, the amplitude and offset-dependent gain model of a quantizer is applied to derive the dynamic system model. From the static and dynamic models, no-limit-cycle conditions associated with A/D, DPWM and compensator design criteria are derived.

The objective was to automatically and objectively classify points within unclassified LiDAR point clouds, with few model parameters and minimal postprocessing. Presented is an automated method for classifying LiDAR returns as ground or nonground in forested environments occurring in complex terrains. Multiscale curvature classification (MCC) is an iterative multiscale algorithm for classifying LiDAR returns that exceed positive surface curvature thresholds, resulting in all the LiDAR measurements being classified as ground or nonground. The MCC algorithm yields a solution of classified returns that support bare-earth surface interpolation at a resolution commensurate with the sampling frequency of the LiDAR survey. Errors in classified ground returns were assessed using 204 independent validation points consisting of 165 field plot global positioning system locations and 39 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Geodetic Survey monuments. Jackknife validation and Monte Carlo simulation were used to assess the quality and error of a bare-earth digital elevation model interpolated from the classified returns. A local indicator of spatial association statistic was used to test for commission errors in the classified ground returns.

The results show that both devices can operate at 450degC, which is impossible for conventional Si devices, at the expense of significant derating. The current capability of the SiC SBD does not change with temperature, but as expected the JFET current decreases with rising temperatures.

The converter is designed and built in accordance with the static characteristics of the SiC devices measured under extremely high ambient temperatures, and then tested up to an ambient temperature of 400degC. The conduction loss of the SiC JFET increases slightly with increasing temperatures, as predicted from its dc characteristics, but its switching characteristics hardly change.

The feedback techniques shed geometric insight into link design and minimize algebraic manipulations. We demonstrate that when the loop transmission of the link's feedback loop is -1, the link is critically coupled, i.e., the magnitude of the voltage transfer function across the link is maximal. We also derive an optimal loading condition that maximizes the energy efficiency of the link and use it as a basis for our link design. We present an example of a bionic implant system designed for load power consumptions in the 1-10-mW range, a low-power regime not significantly explored in prior designs. Such low power levels add to the challenge of link efficiency, because the overhead associated with switching losses in power amplifiers at the link input and with rectifiers at the link output significantly degrade link efficiency. We describe a novel integrated Class-E power amplifier design that uses a simple control strategy to minimize such losses.

Due to the enormous progress recently achieved in the technology of light emitting diodes (LEDs) it can be expected that LEDs lighting will replace incandescent and halogen bulbs in general illumination in the near future. A LED light source typically consists of a series connection of single LED cells. It shows a similar behaviour like a zener diode. For efficiency reasons LED strings can not be supplied via series resistors but need switched mode power drivers with current control. Different standard DC-DC converter topologies are discussed which can be adapted to feed a constant current into a LED load. For future LED driver developments it has to be considered that LEDs can also efficiently be supplied by pulsating currents. This simplifies the converter and control design and reduces the number of components. Hence, different converter topologies are studied which are able to stabilise the average value of a pulsating output current. This also includes topologies with galvanic isolation. Resonant operating LED drivers seem to be specially suited for this task. Hence, a series resonant galvanic isolating LED driver is studied in detail. Under certain conditions this converter does not need a current sensor to stabilise the average current in the LED load.

Because the temporal profiles of such energy sources exhibit great variability due to dynamic weather patterns, an important problem is designing an adaptive duty-cycling mechanism that allows sensor nodes to maintain their power supply at sufficient levels (energy neutral operation) by adapting to changing environmental conditions. Existing techniques to address this problem are minimally adaptive and assume a priori knowledge of the energy profile. While such approaches are reasonable in environments that exhibit low variance, we find that it is highly inefficient in more variable scenarios. We introduce a new technique for solving this problem based on results from adaptive control theory and show that we achieve better performance than previous approaches on a broader class of energy source data sets. Additionally, we include a tunable mechanism for reducing the variance of the node's duty cycle over time, which is an important feature in tasks such as event monitoring. We obtain reductions in variance as great as two-thirds without compromising task performance or ability to maintain energy neutral operation.","2155-5494","1-4244-1268-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292814","Increasingly many wireless sensor network","Adaptive control;Wireless sensor networks;Peer to peer computing;Batteries;Monitoring;Heuristic algorithms;Computer science;Power supplies;Embedded system;Sun","","259","9","15","IEEE","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method consists of two stages. First, noisy face normals are filtered iteratively by weighted averaging of neighboring face normals. Second, vertex positions are iteratively updated to agree with the denoised face normals. The weight function used during normal filtering is much simpler than that used in previous similar approaches, being simply a trimmed quadratic. This makes the algorithm both fast and simple to implement. Vertex position updating is based on the integration of surface normals using a least-squares error criterion. Like previous algorithms, we solve the least-squares problem by gradient descent; whereas previous methods needed user input to determine the iteration step size, we determine it automatically. In addition, we prove the convergence of the vertex position updating approach. Analysis and experiments show the advantages of our proposed method over various earlier surface denoising methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.1065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276075","Mesh smoothing;mesh denoising;feature preservation","Noise reduction;Smoothing methods;Filters;Filtering;Solid modeling;Noise measurement;Sun;Iterative algorithms;Convergence;Design automation","Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","258","1","37","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Backfilling means that short jobs are allowed to run ahead of their time provided they do not delay previously queued jobs (or at least the first queued job). However, predictions have not been incorporated into production schedulers, partially due to a misconception (that we resolve) claiming inaccuracy actually improves performance, but mainly because underprediction is technically unacceptable: users will not tolerate jobs being killed just because system predictions were too short. We solve this problem by divorcing kill-time from the runtime prediction and correcting predictions adaptively as needed if they are proved wrong. The end result is a surprisingly simple scheduler, which requires minimal deviations from current practices (e.g., using FCFS as the basis) and behaves exactly like EASY as far as users are concerned; nevertheless, it achieves significant improvements in performance, predictability, and accuracy. Notably, this is based on a very simple runtime predictor that just averages the runtimes of the last two jobs by the same user; counter intuitively, our results indicate that using recent data is more important than mining the history for similar jobs.

In this paper, we propose a mechanism for two social communication abilities: forming long-term relationships and estimating friendly relationships among people. The mechanism for long-term relationships is based on three principles of behavior design. The robot we developed, Robovie, is able to interact with children in the same way as children do. Moreover, the mechanism is designed for long-term interaction along the following three design principles: (1) it calls children by name using radio frequency identification tags; (2) it adapts its interactive behaviors for each child based on a pseudo development mechanism; and (3) it confides its personal matters to the children who have interacted with the robot for an extended period of time. Regarding the estimation of friendly relationships, the robot assumes that people who spontaneously behave as a group together are friends. Then, by identifying each person in the interacting group around the robot, it estimates the relationships between them. We conducted a two-month field trial at an elementary school. An interactive humanoid robot, Robovie, was placed in a classroom at the school. The results of the field trial revealed that the robot successfully continued interacting with many children for two months, and seemed to have established friendly relationships with them. In addition, it demonstrated reasonable performance in identifying friendships among children. We believe that these results demonstrate the potential of current interactive robots to establish social relationships with humans in our daily lives.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2007.904904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4339534","Field trial;friendship estimation;human–robot interaction;long-term interaction;longitudinal study","Intelligent robots;Human robot interaction;Humanoid robots;Laboratories;Positron emission tomography;Radiofrequency identification;Speech;Communications technology;Medical treatment;Robustness","","258","","31","IEEE","8 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new method is called multi-stencils fast marching (MSFM), which computes the solution at each grid point by solving the Eikonal equation along several stencils and then picks the solution that satisfies the upwind condition. The stencils are centered at each grid point and cover its entire nearest neighbors. In 2D space, 2 stencils cover the 8-neighbors of the point, while in 3D space, 6 stencils cover its 26-neighbors. For those stencils that are not aligned with the natural coordinate system, the Eikonal equation is derived using directional derivatives and then solved using higher order finite difference schemes. The accuracy of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art FMM-based techniques has been demonstrated through comprehensive numerical experiments.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288158","Multi-stencils fast marching methods;monotonically advancing fronts;fast marching methods;level set methods;Eikonal equation","Computer vision;Level set;Nonlinear equations;Grid computing;Tracking;Application software;Partial differential equations;Shape;Path planning;Iterative algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","258","","40","IEEE","13 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We examine several subcases of this most general problem taking into account the processing capability of the relays (half-duplex or full-duplex), and the network geometry (clustered or nonclustered). We first study the multiple-antenna relay channel with a full-duplex relay to understand the effect of increased degrees of freedom in the direct link. We find DMT upper bounds and investigate the achievable performance of decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-forward (CF) protocols. Our results suggest that while DF is DMT optimal when all terminals have one antenna each, it may not maintain its good performance when the degrees of freedom in the direct link are increased, whereas CF continues to perform optimally. We also study the multiple-antenna relay channel with a half-duplex relay. We show that the half-duplex DMT behavior can significantly be different from the full-duplex case. We find that CF is DMT optimal for half-duplex relaying as well, and is the first protocol known to achieve the half-duplex relay DMT. We next study the multiple-access relay channel (MARC) DMT. Finally, we investigate a system with a single source–destination pair and multiple relays, each node with a single antenna, and show that even under the ideal assumption of full-duplex relays and a clustered network, this virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system can never fully mimic a real MIMO DMT.

In order to be able to avoid the occurrence of visually inconsistent results, we pose all of the above image-editing tasks in the form of a discrete global optimization problem. The objective function of this problem is always well-defined, and corresponds to the energy of a discrete Markov random field (MRF). For efficiently optimizing this MRF, a novel optimization scheme, called priority belief propagation (BP), is then proposed, which carries two very important extensions over the standard BP algorithm: ldquopriority-based message schedulingrdquo and ldquodynamic label pruning.rdquo These two extensions work in cooperation to deal with the intolerable computational cost of BP, which is caused by the huge number of labels associated with our MRF. Moreover, both of our extensions are generic, since they do not rely on the use of domain-specific prior knowledge. They can, therefore, be applied to any MRF, i.e., to a very wide class of problems in image processing and computer vision, thus managing to resolve what is currently considered as one major limitation of the BP algorithm: its inefficiency in handling MRFs with very large discrete state spaces. Experimental results on a wide variety of input images are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our image-completion framework for tasks such as object removal, texture synthesis, text removal, and image inpainting.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.906269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4337762","Belief propagation (BP);image completion;Markov random fields (MRFs);optimization;texture synthesis","Belief propagation;Dynamic scheduling;Markov random fields;Scheduling algorithm;Processor scheduling;Computational efficiency;Image processing;Computer vision;Image resolution;State-space methods","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","256","25","41","IEEE","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, given the values of a photometric variable (or of a set thereof), which is to be used for classifying the image pixels, the active contours are designed to converge to the shape that results in maximal discrepancy between the empirical distributions of the photometric variable inside and outside of the contours. The above discrepancy is measured by means of the Bhattacharyya distance that proves to be an extremely useful tool for solving the problem at hand. The proposed methodology can be viewed as a generalization of the segmentation methods, in which active contours maximize the difference between a finite number of empirical moments of the “inside” and “outside” distributions. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed methodology is very versatile and flexible in the sense that it allows one to easily accommodate a diversity of the image features based on which the segmentation should be performed. As an additional contribution, a method for automatically adjusting the smoothness properties of the empirical distributions is proposed. Such a procedure is crucial in situations when the number of data samples (supporting a certain segmentation class) varies considerably in the course of the evolution of the active contour. In this case, the smoothness properties of the empirical distributions have to be properly adjusted to avoid either over- or underestimation artifacts. Finally, a number of relevant segmentation results are demonstrated and some further research directions are discussed.

Definitions of five types of infrastructure inter-dependencies are presented and incorporated into a network flows mathematical representation, i.e., an interdependent layer network model. Using the lower Manhattan region of New York, for illustrative purposes, the implementation of the model is shown. First, the data requirements are presented with realistic data on the interdependent infrastructure systems of power, telecommunications, and subways.

We present an adaptive location-based routing protocol, called hop-by-hop vector-based forwarding (HH-VBF). It uses the notion of a ""routing vector"" (a vector from the source to the sink) acting as the axis of the ""routing pipe"", similar to the vector based forward (VBF) routing in [11]. Unlike the original VBF approach, however, HH-VBF suggests the use of a routing vector for each individual forwarder in the network, instead of a single network-wide source-to-sink routing vector. By the creation of the hop-by-hop vectors, HH-VBF can overcome two major problems in VBF: (1) too small data delivery ratio for sparse networks; (2) too sensitive to ""routing pipe"" radius threshold. We conduct simulations to evaluate HH-VBF, and the results show that HH-VBF yields much better performance than VBF in sparse networks. In addition, HH-VBF is less sensitive to the routing pipe radius threshold. Furthermore, we also analyze the behavior of HH-VBF and show that assuming proper redundancy and feedback techniques, HH-VBF can facilitate the avoidance of any ""void"" areas in the network.","","978-1-4244-0634-0","10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302470","Underwater Sensor Networks;Location-Based Routing;Energy Efficiency;Robustness;Avoid ""Voids""","Robustness;Routing protocols;Computer science;Telecommunication traffic;Network topology;Degradation;Computational modeling;Power engineering and energy;Feedback;Energy efficiency","","256","","11","IEEE","17 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the ability to filter spoofed IP packets near victim servers is essential to their own protection and prevention of becoming involuntary DoS reflectors. Although an attacker can forge any field in the IP header, he cannot falsify the number of hops an IP packet takes to reach its destination. More importantly, since the hop-count values are diverse, an attacker cannot randomly spoof IP addresses while maintaining consistent hop-counts. On the other hand, an Internet server can easily infer the hop-count information from the Time-to-Live (TTL) field of the IP header. Using a mapping between IP addresses and their hop-counts, the server can distinguish spoofed IP packets from legitimate ones. Based on this observation, we present a novel filtering technique, called Hop-Count Filtering (HCF)-which builds an accurate IP-to-hop-count (IP2HC) mapping table-to detect and discard spoofed IP packets. HCF is easy to deploy, as it does not require any support from the underlying network. Through analysis using network measurement data, we show that HCF can identify close to 90% of spoofed IP packets, and then discard them with little collateral damage. We implement and evaluate HCF in the Linux kernel, demonstrating its effectiveness with experimental measurements","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2006.890133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4100726","DDoS attacks;IP spoofing;hop-count;host-based","Computer crime;Floods;Internet;Web server;Information filtering;Information filters;Telecommunication traffic;Coaxial components;Protection;Linux","","255","5","56","IEEE","20 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework, called spectral regression (SR), for efficient regularized subspace learning. SR casts the problem of learning the projective functions into a regression framework, which avoids eigen-decomposition of dense matrices. Also, with the regression based framework, different kinds of regularizes can be naturally incorporated into our algorithm which makes it more flexible. Computational analysis shows that SR has only linear-time complexity which is a huge speed up comparing to the cubic-time complexity of the ordinary approaches.

Our work starts from a mathematical interpretation of the seemingly heuristic RELIEF algorithm as an online method solving a convex optimization problem with a margin-based objective function. This interpretation explains the success of RELIEF in real application and enables us to identify and address its following weaknesses. RELIEF makes an implicit assumption that the nearest neighbors found in the original feature space are the ones in the weighted space and RELIEF lacks a mechanism to deal with outlier data. We propose an iterative RELIEF (I-RELIEF) algorithm to alleviate the deficiencies of RELIEF by exploring the framework of the expectation-maximization algorithm. We extend I-RELIEF to multiclass settings by using a new multiclass margin definition. To reduce computational costs, an online learning algorithm is also developed.

The filter consists of five short-circuited stubs separated by nonredundant connecting lines in order to exhibit a high selectivity filtering characteristic. The narrow notched (rejection) band was introduced by using a new technique which involves embedding open stubs in the first and last connecting lines in order to reject any undesired existing radio signal which may interfere with the determined UWB passband. The bandwidth of the notched filter can be controlled by adjusting the width of the stubs or the gaps or both. The length of the stubs can be tuned to select a specific frequency for the notched band. The embedded stubs can be used to excite single or double band-reject response.

The main contributions of this paper are given as follows. First, we review hierarchical clustering research in the context of software architecture recovery and modularization. Second, to employ clustering meaningfully, it is necessary to understand the peculiarities of the software domain, as well as the behavior of clustering measures and algorithms in this domain. To this end, we provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of various similarity and distance measures that may be employed for software clustering. Third, we analyze the clustering process of various well-known clustering algorithms by using multiple criteria, and we show how arbitrary decisions taken by these algorithms during clustering affect the quality of their results. Finally, we present an analysis of two recently proposed clustering algorithms, revealing close similarities in their apparently different clustering approaches.

Our method selects depth estimates for each pixel that minimize violations of visibility constraints and thus remove errors and inconsistencies from the depth maps to produce a consistent surface. We advocate a two-stage process in which the first stage generates potentially noisy, overlapping depth maps from a set of calibrated images and the second stage fuses these depth maps to obtain an integrated surface with higher accuracy, suppressed noise, and reduced redundancy. We show that by dividing the processing into two stages we are able to achieve a very high throughput because we are able to use a computationally cheap stereo algorithm and because this architecture is amenable to hardware-accelerated (GPU) implementations. A rigorous formulation based on the notion of stability of a depth estimate is presented first. It aims to determine the validity of a depth estimate by rendering multiple depth maps into the reference view as well as rendering the reference depth map into the other views in order to detect occlusions and free- space violations. We also present an approximate alternative formulation that selects and validates only one hypothesis based on confidence. Both formulations enable us to perform video-based reconstruction at up to 25 frames per second. We show results on the multi-view stereo evaluation benchmark datasets and several outdoors video sequences. Extensive quantitative analysis is performed using an accurately surveyed model of a real building as ground truth.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-1630-1","10.1109/ICCV.2007.4408984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408984","","Noise reduction;Noise generators;Fusion power generation;Fuses;Redundancy;Throughput;Computer architecture;Stability;Image reconstruction;Video sequences","","253","14","24","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such routing misbehavior is that some selfish nodes will participate in the route discovery and maintenance processes but refuse to forward data packets. In this paper, we propose the 2ACK scheme that serves as an add-on technique for routing schemes to detect routing misbehavior and to mitigate their adverse effect. The main idea of the 2ACK scheme is to send two-hop acknowledgment packets in the opposite direction of the routing path.

A predominant approach to collaborative filtering is neighborhood based (""k-nearest neighbors""), where a user-item preference rating is interpolated from ratings of similar items and/or users. We enhance the neighborhood-based approach leading to substantial improvement of prediction accuracy, without a meaningful increase in running time. First, we remove certain so-called ""global effects"" from the data to make the ratings more comparable, thereby improving interpolation accuracy. Second, we show how to simultaneously derive interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors, unlike previous approaches where each weight is computed separately. By globally solving a suitable optimization problem, this simultaneous interpolation accounts for the many interactions between neighbors leading to improved accuracy. Our method is very fast in practice, generating a prediction in about 0.2 milliseconds. Importantly, it does not require training many parameters or a lengthy preprocessing, making it very practical for large scale applications. Finally, we show how to apply these methods to the perceivably much slower user-oriented approach. To this end, we suggest a novel scheme for low dimensional embedding of the users. We evaluate these methods on the netflix dataset, where they deliver significantly better results than the commercial netflix cinematch recommender system.","2374-8486","978-0-7695-3018-5","10.1109/ICDM.2007.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470228","","Filtering;Interpolation;Recommender systems;International collaboration;Nearest neighbor searches;Motion pictures;Data mining;Accuracy;Large-scale systems;Demography","","252","3","15","IEEE","12 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While prefetching improves performance substantially on many programs, it can significantly reduce performance on others. Also, prefetching can significantly increase memory bandwidth requirements. This paper proposes a mechanism that incorporates dynamic feedback into the design of the prefetcher to increase the performance improvement provided by prefetching as well as to reduce the negative performance and bandwidth impact of prefetching. Our mechanism estimates prefetcher accuracy, prefetcher timeliness, and prefetcher-caused cache pollution to adjust the aggressiveness of the data prefetcher dynamically. We introduce a new method to track cache pollution caused by the prefetcher at run-time. We also introduce a mechanism that dynamically decides where in the LRU stack to insert the prefetched blocks in the cache based on the cache pollution caused by the prefetcher. Using the proposed dynamic mechanism improves average performance by 6.5% on 17 memory-intensive benchmarks in the SPEC CPU2000 suite compared to the best-performing conventional stream-based data prefetcher configuration, while it consumes 18.7% less memory bandwidth. Compared to a conventional stream-based data prefetcher configuration that consumes similar amount of memory bandwidth, feedback directed prefetching provides 13.6% higher performance. Our results show that feedback-directed prefetching eliminates the large negative performance impact incurred on some benchmarks due to prefetching, and it is applicable to stream-based prefetchers, global-history-buffer based delta correlation prefetchers, and PC-based stride prefetchers","2378-203X","1-4244-0804-0","10.1109/HPCA.2007.346185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147648","","Prefetching;Hardware;Bandwidth;Pollution;Delay;Random access memory;Energy consumption;Negative feedback;Runtime;Clocks","","252","13","25","IEEE","10 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Exact symbol-error-rate (SER) expressions for an arbitrary N-node network employing M'ary phase-shift-keying (MPSK) modulation or quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) are provided for the proposed class of protocols. Further, approximate expressions for the SER are derived and shown to be tight at high enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our analysis reveals an interesting result: The class of cooperative protocols shares the same asymptotic performance at high enough SNR and does not depend on m, the number of previous nodes involving in coherent detection, hence, the asymptotic performance of a simple cooperative scenario in which each relay combines the signals from the source and the previous relay is exactly the same as that for a much more complicated scenario in which each relay combines the signals from the source and all the previous relays. The theoretical results also confirm that full diversity equal to the number of cooperating nodes is indeed achievable by the proposed protocols. Finally, we formulate a power-allocation problem in order to minimize the SER of the system. The analysis shows that the optimum power allocation at different nodes follows a certain ordering, and that the power-allocation scheme at high SNR does not depend on the channel quality of the direct link between the source and the destination.

In particular, we propose a method, named orthogonal neighborhood preserving projections, which works by first building an ""affinity"" graph for the data in a way that is similar to the method of locally linear embedding (LLE). However, in contrast with the standard LLE where the mapping between the input and the reduced spaces is implicit, ONPP employs an explicit linear mapping between the two. As a result, handling new data samples becomes straightforward, as this amounts to a simple linear transformation. We show how we can define kernel variants of ONPP, as well as how we can apply the method in a supervised setting.

The road detection step is based on shape classification of a local homogeneous region around a pixel. The local homogeneous region is enclosed by a polygon, called the footprint of the pixel. This step involves detecting road footprints, tracking roads, and growing a road tree. We use a spoke wheel operator to obtain the road footprint. We propose an automatic road seeding method based on rectangular approximations to road footprints and a toe-finding algorithm to classify footprints for growing a road tree. The road tree pruning step makes use of a Bayes decision model based on the area-to-perimeter ratio (the A/P ratio) of the footprint to prune the paths that leak into the surroundings.

In induction wind generators, unbalanced three-phase stator voltages cause a number of problems, such as overcurrent, unbalanced currents, reactive power pulsations, and stress on the mechanical components from torque pulsations. Therefore, beyond a certain amount of unbalance, induction wind generators are switched out of the network. This can further weaken the grid. In doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs), control of the rotor currents allows for adjustable speed operation and reactive power control. This paper presents a DFIG control strategy that enhances the standard speed and reactive power control with controllers that can compensate for the problems caused by an unbalanced grid by balancing the stator currents and eliminating torque and reactive power pulsations","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2006.889550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4105996","AC generators;induction motors;power system dynamic stability;reactive power control;torque control;variable speed drives;wind energy","Voltage control;Induction generators;Mesh generation;Wind energy generation;Reactive power control;Stators;Torque control;Wind energy;Power transmission;Wind power generation","","249","8","9","IEEE","20 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key goal is to minimize the amount of bandwidth used to maintain that redundancy. Storing a file using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes, promises to require less redundancy and hence less maintenance bandwidth than simple replication to provide the same level of reliability. However, since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes fail, a key question is how to generate a new fragment in a distributed way while transferring as little data as possible across the network. In this paper, we introduce a general technique to analyze storage architectures that combine any form of coding and replication, as well as presenting two new schemes for maintaining redundancy using erasure codes. First, we show how to optimally generate MDS fragments directly from existing fragments in the system. Second, we introduce a new scheme called regenerating codes which use slightly larger fragments than MDS but have lower overall bandwidth use. We also show through simulation that in realistic environments, regenerating codes can reduce maintenance bandwidth use by 25% or more compared with the best previous design - a hybrid of replication and erasure codes - while simplifying system architecture.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215814","","Network coding;Bandwidth;Redundancy;Peer to peer computing;Maintenance;Internet;Communications Society;Computer network reliability;Information theory","","249","28","30","IEEE","29 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm approximates the phase-noise waveform by using a Fourier series approximation for the current phase-noise realization. Thereby, it cancels the effects of the phase noise beyond the standard common phase error correction used in contemporary OFDM standards. The algorithm requires that the correlation properties of the intercarrier interference are known. We calculate these properties in terms of the phase-noise spectral correlation matrix for both Wiener and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck phase-noise models, respectively. This modeling corresponds to a free-running oscillator, as well as a phase-locked loop realization of the local oscillator in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transceivers. For both transceiver configurations, we investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm. It is demonstrated that the new algorithm achieves as much as one order of magnitude better performance in terms of packet/bit error rate when compared to a receiver with only the common phase error suppression.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2007.902593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291833","Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM);phase-locked loop;phase noise","Phase noise;OFDM;Phase locked loops;Local oscillators;Transceivers;Interference suppression;Approximation algorithms;Fourier series;Error correction;Bit error rate","","249","1","32","IEEE","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The central notion is the behavior, which consists of the set of time trajectories that are declared possible by the model of a dynamical system. Often, the behavior is defined as the set of solutions of a system of differential equations. Models that specify a behavior usually involve latent variables in addition to the manifest variables the model aims at. We have also described a methodology for modeling interconnected systems, called tearing, zooming, and linking. The underlying mathematical language consists of terminals, modules, the interconnection graph, the module embedding, and the manifest variable assignment. The combination of module equations, interconnection constraints, and manifest variable assignment leads to a latent-variable representation for the behavior of the manifest variables the model aims. This methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking offers a systematic procedure for modeling interconnected systems that is much better adapted to the physics of interconnected systems than input/output-modeling procedures such as, for example, Simulink. The methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking has many things in common with bond graphs.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2007.906923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384643","","Interconnected systems;Joining processes;Hydraulic systems;Signal processing;Switches;Visualization;Physics;Feedback control;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems","","249","2","74","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The evaluated tag communication range with a folded dipole antenna is from 0 m to 4.3 m, at the 953-MHz carrier frequency with 4-W transmitting Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) from a reader/writer. The developed tag IC features two circuit blocks to maximize the communication range in 0.35-mum CMOS/FeRAM technology. First is a CMOS-only full-wave rectifier, which can improve the measured efficiency by up to 36.6% by reducing the input parasitic capacitances and optimization of multiplier structure. This efficiency is more than twice that of previously-published results. Second is a low-voltage current-mode ASK demodulator to accommodate a low-breakdown voltage of FeRAM, which converts the ASK power modulation into a linearly modulated current over an incoming power range of 27 dB, corresponding to the entire communication range.

Our model is inspired by the traditional bag of words representation of texts and images as well as a number of related generative models, including probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). A major drawback of the pLSA and LDA models is the assumption that each patch in the image is independently generated given its corresponding latent topic. While such representation provides an efficient computational method, it lacks the power to describe the visually coherent images and scenes. Instead, we propose a spatially coherent latent topic model (Spatial-LTM). Spatial-LTM represents an image containing objects in a hierarchical way by over-segmented image regions of homogeneous appearances and the salient image patches within the regions. Only one single latent topic is assigned to the image patches within each region, enforcing the spatial coherency of the model. This idea gives rise to the following merits of Spatial-LTM: (1) Spatial-LTM provides a unified representation for spatially coherent bag of words topic models; (2) Spatial-LTM can simultaneously segment and classify objects, even in the case of occlusion and multiple instances; and (3) Spatial-LTM can be trained either unsupervised or supervised, as well as when partial object labels are provided. We verify the success of our model in a number of segmentation and classification experiments.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-1630-1","10.1109/ICCV.2007.4408965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408965","","Spatial coherence;Layout;Image segmentation;Linear discriminant analysis;Detectors;Computational efficiency;Text analysis;Computer vision;Vocabulary;Image recognition","","247","2","31","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the wireless part of WOBAN has been gaining increasing attention, and early versions are being deployed as municipal access solutions to eliminate the wired drop to every wireless router at customer premises. This architecture saves on network deployment cost because the fiber need not penetrate each end-user, and it extends the reach of emerging optical-access solutions, such as passive optical networks. This paper first presents an architecture and a vision for the WOBAN and articulates why the combination of wireless and optical presents a compelling solution that optimizes the best of both worlds. While this discussion briefly touches upon the business drivers, the main arguments are based on technical and deployment considerations. Consequently, the rest of this paper reviews a variety of relevant research challenges, namely, network setup, network connectivity, and fault-tolerant behavior of the WOBAN. In the network setup, we review the design of a WOBAN where the back end is a wired optical network, the front end is managed by a wireless connectivity, and, in between, the tail ends of the optical part [known as optical network unit (ONU)] communicate directly with wireless base stations (known as ldquogateway routersrdquo). We outline algorithms to optimize the placement of ONUs in a WOBAN and report on a survey that we conducted on the distribution and types of wireless routers in the Wildhorse residential neighborhood of North Davis, CA. Then, we examine the WOBAN's routing properties (network connectivity), discuss the pros and cons of various routing algorithms, and summarize the idea behind fault-tolerant design of such hybrid networks.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2007.906804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357916","Architecture;broadband access;fault tolerance;optical network;routing;wireless network;Architecture;broadband access;fault tolerance;optical network;routing;wireless network","Optical network units;Optical fiber networks;Passive optical networks;Fault tolerance;Routing;Costs;Optical design;Tail;Wireless communication;Base stations","","246","2","36","IEEE","6 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that a reduction of friction will also occur between a human finger and a vibrating plate. Thus, a vibrating plate can serve as a haptic interface. The amplitude of vibration can also be correlated to the amount of friction reduction between the plate and the finger. Varying the surface friction between the finger and the haptic interface is a way of indirectly controlling shear forces on the finger during active exploration.

A realistic assessment should consider the effects of practical channel estimation schemes. This paper considers pilot symbol aided channel estimation for cooperation diversity systems. Since the overall channel in AF systems is different from conventional cellular channels, the channel estimation problem is interesting and challenging and therefore our focus is on AF systems.

Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization [32], social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information [41]. We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative proper ties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences.

It is assumed that a group of sensors observe the same quantity in independent additive observation noises with possibly different variances. The observations are transmitted using amplify-and-forward (analog) transmissions over nonideal fading wireless channels from the sensors to a fusion center, where they are combined to generate an estimate of the observed quantity. Assuming that the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) is used by the fusion center, the equal-power transmission strategy is first discussed, where the system performance is analyzed by introducing the concept of estimation outage and estimation diversity, and it is shown that there is an achievable diversity gain on the order of the number of sensors. The optimal power allocation strategies are then considered for two cases: minimum distortion under power constraints; and minimum power under distortion constraints. In the first case, it is shown that by turning off bad sensors, i.e., sensors with bad channels and bad observation quality, adaptive power gain can be achieved without sacrificing diversity gain. Here, the adaptive power gain is similar to the array gain achieved in multiple-input single-output (MISO) multiantenna systems when channel conditions are known to the transmitter. In the second case, the sum power is minimized under zero-outage estimation distortion constraint, and some related energy efficiency issues in sensor networks are discussed.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.896019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291850","Distributed estimation;energy efficiency;estimation diversity;estimation outage","Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor fusion;Diversity methods;Additive noise;Fading;Fusion power generation;System performance;Performance analysis;Sensor systems","","245","1","31","IEEE","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The magnetic system consists of three orthogonal coils, the source, fixed to the body and 3-D magnetic sensors, fixed to remote body segments, which measure the fields generated by the source. Based on the measured signals, a processor calculates the relative positions and orientations between source and sensor. Magnetic actuation requires a substantial amount of energy which limits the update rate with a set of batteries. Moreover, the magnetic field can easily be disturbed by ferromagnetic materials or other sources. Inertial sensors can be sampled at high rates, require only little energy and do not suffer from magnetic interferences. However, accelerometers and gyroscopes can only measure changes in position and orientation and suffer from integration drift. By combing measurements from both systems in a complementary Kalman filter structure, an optimal solution for position and orientation estimates is obtained. The magnetic system provides 6 DOF measurements at a relatively low update rate while the inertial sensors track the changes position and orientation in between the magnetic updates. The implemented system is tested against a lab-bound camera tracking system for several functional body movements. The accuracy was about 5 mm for position and 3 degrees for orientation measurements.

PRISM allows for two key architectural enhancements: (1) inbuilt robustness to ""drift"" between encoder and decoder and (2) the feasibility of a flexible distribution of computational complexity between encoder and decoder. Specifically, PRISM enables transfer of the computationally expensive video encoder motion-search module to the video decoder. Based on this capability, we consider an instance of PRISM corresponding to a near reversal in codec complexities with respect to today's codecs (leading to a novel light encoder and heavy decoder paradigm), in this paper. We present encouraging preliminary results on real-world video sequences, particularly in the realm of transmission losses, where PRISM exhibits the characteristic of rapid recovery, in contrast to contemporary codecs.

To determine how they can be best used for face recognition, we conducted a comprehensive comparative study at each step of the local matching process. The conclusions from our experiments include: (1) additional evidence that Gabor features are effective local feature representations and are robust to illumination changes; (2) discrimination based only on a small portion of the face area is surprisingly good; (3) the configuration of facial components does contain rich discriminating information and comparing corresponding local regions utilizes shape features more effectively than comparing corresponding facial components; (4) spatial multiresolution analysis leads to better classification performance; (5) combining local regions with Borda count classifier combination method alleviates the curse of dimensionality. We implemented a complete face recognition system by integrating the best option of each step. Without training, illumination compensation and without any parameter tuning, it achieves superior performance on every category of the FERET test: near perfect classification accuracy (99.5%) on pictures taken on the same day regardless of indoor illumination variations, and significantly better than any other reported performance on pictures taken several days to more than a year apart.

We propose a technique for event recognition in crowded videos that reliably identifies actions in the presence of partial occlusion and background clutter. Our approach is based on three key ideas: (1) we efficiently match the volumetric representation of an event against oversegmented spatio-temporal video volumes; (2) we augment our shape-based features using flow; (3) rather than treating an event template as an atomic entity, we separately match by parts (both in space and time), enabling robustness against occlusions and actor variability.

The sampling is not required to be periodic, and the only assumption is that the distance between any two consecutive sampling instants is less than a given bound. By using the input delay approach, the T-S fuzzy system with variable uncertain sampling is transformed into a continuous-time T-S fuzzy system with a delay in the state. Though the resulting closed-loop state-delayed T-S fuzzy system takes a standard form, the existing results on delay T-S fuzzy systems cannot be used for our purpose due to their restrictive assumptions on the derivative of state delay. A new condition guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the closed-loop sampled-data system is derived by a Lyapunov approach plus the free weighting matrix technique. Based on this stability condition, two procedures for designing state-feedback control laws are given: one casts the controller design into a convex optimization by introducing some over design and the other utilizes the cone complementarity linearization idea to cast the controller design into a sequential minimization problem subject to linear matrix inequality constraints, which can be readily solved using standard numerical software. An illustrative example is provided to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed controller design methodology.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.890660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4343107","Input delay;linear matrix inequality;nonlinear systems;sampled-data control;Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems","Nonlinear systems;Sampling methods;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Delay systems;Takagi-Sugeno model;Asymptotic stability;Constraint optimization;Design optimization;Linear matrix inequalities","","245","","47","IEEE","8 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, the major challenges to the framework are identified. Second, a comprehensive review of the existing approaches is conducted. The representative approaches are categorized and compared according to their roles in the formal framework.

A new detector based on the Rao test criterion is introduced and its invariance properties and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) behavior are studied. At the analysis stage, the performance of the new receiver is assessed, also in comparison with some classical adaptive radar detectors, both in the matched as well as in the mismatched signal case. Remarkably, the Rao test may achieve a matched detection performance which is commensurate with that of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based detectors if a sufficient number of training data is available. Moreover, it also exhibits better rejection capabilities of mismatched signals than the counterparts. In the last part of the work, a two-stage detector whose second stage coincides with the Rao test is devised. It represents a suitable means to restore the detection performance of the plain Rao test in the presence of a small number of training data. Finally, the performance of the aforementioned two-stage processor is analyzed in closed form and the CFAR behavior is proved.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.894238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4244665","Adaptive radar detection;constant false alarm rate (CFAR) processing;radar signal processing","Testing;Interference;Covariance matrix;Radar detection;Detectors;Performance analysis;Training data;Signal detection;Signal analysis;Adaptive signal detection","","244","","18","IEEE","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work studies the improvement in TC obtainable with successive interference cancellation (SIC), an important receiver technique that has been shown to achieve the capacity of several classes of multiuser channels, but has not been carefully evaluated in the context of ad hoc wireless networks. This paper develops closed-form upper bounds and easily computable lower bounds for the TC of ad hoc networks with SIC receivers, for both perfect and imperfect SIC. The analysis applies to any multiuser receiver that cancels the $K$ strongest interfering signals by a factor $z \in [0,1]$ . In addition to providing the first closed-form capacity results for SIC in ad hoc networks, design-relevant insights are made possible. In particular, it is shown that SIC should be used with direct sequence spread spectrum. Also, any imperfections in the interference cancellation rapidly degrade its usefulness. More encouragingly, only a few—often just one—interfering nodes need to be canceled in order to get the vast majority of the available performance gain.

The approach is traceable; it exploits the PDE-solver's ability to accept the definition of solutions to Maxwell's equations in so-called weak form. Associated expressions and methods for estimating a WG mode's volume, filling factor(s), and in the case of closed (open) resonators, its wall (radiation) loss, are provided. As no transverse approximation is imposed, the approach remains accurate even for quasi-transverse-magnetic/electric modes of low finite azimuthal mode order. The approach's generality and utility are demonstrated by modeling several nontrivial structures, i.e., 1) two different optical microcavities (one toroidal made of silica, the other an AlGaAs microdisk), 2) a third-order sapphire:air Bragg cavity, and 3) two different cryogenic sapphire WG-mode resonators; both 2) and 3) operate in the microwave X-band.

SLD means many things to different people since there is no wide agreement on a definition of the term. Academia, designers, and EDA experts have taken different avenues to attack the problem, for the most part springing from the basis of traditional EDA and trying to raise the level of abstraction at which integrated circuit designs are captured, analyzed, and synthesized from. However, my opinion is that this is just the tip of the iceberg of a much bigger problem that is common to all system industry. In particular, I believe that notwithstanding the obvious differences in the vertical industrial segments (for example, consumer, automotive, computing, and communication), there is a common underlying basis that can be explored. This basis may yield a novel EDA industry and even a novel engineering field that could bring substantial productivity gains not only to the semiconductor industry but to all system industries including industrial and automotive, communication and computing, avionics and building automation, space and agriculture, and health and security, in short, a real technical renaissance. In this paper, I present the challenges faced by industry in system level design. Then, I propose a design methodology, platform-based design (PBD), that has the potential of addressing these challenges in a unified way. Further, I place methodology and tools available today in the PBD framework and present a tool environment, Metropolis, that supports PBD and that can be used to integrate available tools and methods together with two examples of its application to separate industrial domains","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2006.890107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4167779","Embedded software;embedded systems;models and tools;platform-based design (PBD);system-level design (SLD);system-level design environments","Superluminescent diodes;System-level design;Electronic design automation and methodology;Communication industry;Computer industry;Automotive engineering;Aerospace industry;Integrated circuit synthesis;Aerospace electronics;Design methodology","","243","7","217","IEEE","30 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main goal of this study was to develop an efficient feature- projection method for EMG pattern recognition. To this end, a linear supervised feature projection is proposed that utilizes a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). First, a wavelet packet transform (WPT) is performed to extract a feature vector from four-channel EMG signals. To dimensionally reduce and cluster the WPT features, an LDA, then, incorporates class information into the learning procedure, and identifies a linear matrix to maximize the class separability for the projected features. Finally, a multilayer perceptron classifies the LDA-reduced features into nine hand motions. To evaluate the performance of the LDA for WPT features, the LDA is compared with three other feature-projection methods. From a visualization and quantitative comparison, it is shown that the LDA produces a better performance for the class separability, plus the LDA-projected features improve the classification accuracy with a short processing time. A real-time pattern-recognition system is then implemented for a multifunction myoelectric hand. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a 97.4% recognition accuracy, and all processes, including the generation of control commands for the myoelectric hand, are completed within 97 ms. Consequently, these results confirm that the proposed method is applicable to real-time EMG pattern recognition for multifunction myoelectric hand control.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2007.897262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4244373","Electromyographic (EMG);linear discriminant analysis (LDA);myoelectric hand control;pattern recognition;wavelet packet transform (WPT)","Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Linear discriminant analysis;Wavelet packets;Wavelet transforms;Data mining;Feature extraction;Vectors;Multilayer perceptrons;Visualization","","242","2","26","IEEE","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first show that flocking algorithms that neglect agents' inertial effect can cause unstable group behavior. To incorporate this inertial effect, we use the passive decomposition, which decomposes the closed-loop group dynamics into two decoupled systems: a shape system representing the internal group shape and a locked system describing the motion of the center-of-mass. Then, analyzing the locked and shape systems separately with the help of graph theory, we propose a provably stable flocking control law, which ensures that the internal group shape is exponentially stabilized to a desired one, while all the agents' velocities converge to the centroid velocity that is also shown to be time-invariant. This result still holds for slow-switching balanced information graphs.

The goal is to incorporate the results of the learning engine into a predicate calculus-based reasoning engine so that radios can remember lessons learned in the past and act quickly in the future. We also investigate the differences between reasoning and learning, and the fundamentals of when a particular application requires learning, and when simple reasoning is sufficient. The basic architecture is consistent with cognitive engines seen in AI research. The focus of this article is not to propose new machine learning algorithms, but rather to formalize their application to cognitive radio and develop a framework from within which they can be useful.

Although several approaches have been proposed in recent years to take advantage of multiple microphones, they are either too computationally expensive and not easily scalable or they cannot outperform the simpler case of using the best single microphone. In this paper, the use of classic acoustic beamforming techniques is proposed together with several novel algorithms to create a complete frontend for speaker diarization in the meeting room domain. New techniques we are presenting include blind reference-channel selection, two-step time delay of arrival (TDOA) Viterbi postprocessing, and a dynamic output signal weighting algorithm, together with using such TDOA values in the diarization to complement the acoustic information. Tests on speaker diarization show a 25% relative improvement on the test set compared to using a single most centrally located microphone. Additional experimental results show improvements using these techniques in a speech recognition task.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2007.902460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291588","Acoustic beamforming;meeting processing;speaker diarization;speaker segmentation and clustering","Array signal processing;Loudspeakers;Acoustic testing;Speech;Ambient intelligence;Computer science;Signal processing;Switches;Microphone arrays;Associate members","","241","7","32","IEEE","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, an efficient iterative procedure is presented to directly solve the Trace Ratio problem. In each step, a Trace Difference problem arg maxW Tr [WT (SP - lambdaSI) W] is solved with lambda being the trace ratio value computed from the previous step. Convergence of the projection matrix W, as well as the global optimum of the trace ratio value lambda, are proven based on point-to-set map theories. In addition, this procedure is further extended for solving trace ratio problems with more general constraint WTCW=I and providing exact solutions for kernel-based subspace learning problems. Extensive experiments on faces and UCI data demonstrate the high convergence speed of the proposed solution, as well as its superiority in classification capability over corresponding solutions to the ratio trace problem.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.382983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270008","","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Asia;Subspace constraints;Closed-form solution;Uncertainty;Matrix decomposition;Computer vision;Pattern recognition","","240","4","13","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SPADs implemented in planar technology compatible with CMOS circuits offer typical advantages of microelectronic devices (small size, ruggedness, low voltage, low power, etc.). Furthermore, they have inherently higher photon detection efficiency, since they do not rely on electron emission in vacuum from a photocathode as do PMTs, but instead on the internal photoelectric effect. However, PMTs offer much wider sensitive area, which greatly simplifies the design of optical systems; they also attain remarkable performance at high counting rate, and offer picosecond timing resolution with microchannel plate models. In order to make SPAD detectors more competitive in a broader range of SPC and TCSPC applications, it is necessary to face several issues in the semiconductor device design and technology. Such issues will be discussed in the context of the two possible approaches to such a challenge: employing a standard industrial high-voltage CMOS technology or developing a dedicated CMOS-compatible technology.

Our proposed scheme integrates clustering with contention-free and/or -based medium access control (MAC) protocols. In our scheme, the elected cluster-head vehicle functions as the coordinator to collect/deliver real-time safety messages within its own cluster and forward the consolidated safety messages to the neighboring cluster heads. In addition, the cluster-head vehicle controls channel assignments for cluster-member vehicles transmitting/receiving nonreal-time traffics, which makes the wireless channels more efficiently utilized for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) nonreal-time data transmissions. Our scheme uses the contention-free MAC within a cluster and the contention-based IEEE 802.11 MAC among cluster-head vehicles such that the real-time delivery of safety messages can be guaranteed. Under our proposed scheme, we develop an analytical model to study the delay for the consolidated safety messages transmitted by the cluster-head vehicles. Based on this analytical model, we derive the desirable contention-window size, which can best balance the tradeoff between the delay of safety messages and the successful rate of delivering safety messages. The extensive simulation results show that, under various highway traffic scenarios, our proposed scheme can efficiently support the nonreal-time traffics while guaranteeing the real-time delivery of the safety messages.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2007.907233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357429","Clustering algorithms;Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC);multichannel medium-access control (MMAC);protocol designs;time–division multiple access (TDMA);vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications;vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications;dedicated short range communications (DSRC);protocol designs;clustering algorithms;multi-channel MAC;time division multiple access (TDMA)","Media Access Protocol;Vehicle safety;Analytical models;Delay;Traffic control;Road safety;Road vehicles;Communication system traffic control;Access protocols;Data communication","","240","2","25","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The probabilistic model generates words in their textual order by, for each word, first sampling a topic, then sampling its status as a unigram or bigram, and then sampling the word from a topic-specific unigram or bigram distribution. Thus our model can model ""white house"" as a special meaning phrase in the 'politics' topic, but not in the 'real estate' topic. Successive bigrams form longer phrases.

It is difficult to diagnose an MLID system using a mathematical model because MLID systems consist of many switching devices and their system complexity has a nonlinear factor. Therefore, a neural network (NN) classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of an MLID system. Multilayer perceptron networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults. The principal component analysis is utilized in the feature extraction process to reduce the NN input size. A lower dimensional input space will also usually reduce the time necessary to train an NN, and the reduced noise can improve the mapping performance. The genetic algorithm is also applied to select the valuable principal components. The proposed network is evaluated with simulation test set and experimental test set. The overall classification performance of the proposed network is more than 95%. A reconfiguration technique is also proposed. The proposed fault diagnostic system requires about six cycles to clear an open-circuit or short-circuit fault.

The technique is based on optimization of antenna placement in uniform linear arrays with respect to mutual information (MI). By introducing a new and more general 3-D geometrical model than that applied in earlier work, additional insight into the optimal design parameters is gained. We also perform a novel analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal design parameters, and derive analytical expressions for the eigenvalues of the pure LOS channel matrix which are valid also when allowing for non-optimal design. Furthermore, we investigate the approximations introduced in the derivations, in order to reveal when the results are applicable. The LOS matrix is employed in a Ricean fading channel model, and performance is evaluated with respect to the average MI and the MI cumulative distribution function.

More precisely, the repetitive scheme takes a negative feedback structure plus a feedforward path whenever the odd harmonics are considered for compensation only. The repetitive scheme, equivalent to the bank of resonant filters, acts as a refinement term to reject the harmonic distortion caused by the unbalanced and distorted load current, and thus, allowing the UPS inverter to deliver an almost pure sinusoidal balanced voltage.

On each block, basis functions are generated with support on the entire block, that are subsequently used as basis functions for the analysis of the complete structure. Only a small number of these functions is required to obtain an accurate solution; therefore, the overall number of unknowns is drastically reduced with consequent impact on storage and solution time. These entire-domain basis functions are called synthetic functions; they are generated from the solution of the electromagnetic problem for the block in isolation, under excitation by suitably defined sources. The synthetic functions are obtained from the responses to all sources via a procedure based on the singular-value decomposition. Because of the strong reduction of the global number of unknowns, one can store the MoM matrix and afford a direct solution.

The basic idea for FMCW-Radars is to generate a linear frequency ramp as transmit signal. The difference frequency between the transmitted and received signal is determined after downconversion. In order to detect range and velocity together, the information, extracted from one frequency ramp, is not enough, because it is ambiguous. Several subsequent ramps have to be generated to remove the ambiguity between the frequency portion produced by range and the doppler frequency. In this paper two methods are presented to perform this basic signal processing step. The two methods have the Fast Fourier Transform as basic calculation step in common, but the number of FFTs and their length are different. The requirements on bandwidth for the IF-Hardware and A/D-Converters are also determined by the algorithm for Range-Doppler-Detection. The CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate)-Algorithm for target detection must also be adapted to the chosen method. Both methods have been verified with a 24 GHz radar prototype.

This problem is further complicated by the fact that in many cases, outliers have to be detected from data streams that arrive at an enormous pace. In this paper, an incremental LOF (local outlier factor) algorithm, appropriate for detecting outliers in data streams, is proposed. The proposed incremental LOF algorithm provides equivalent detection performance as the iterated static LOF algorithm (applied after insertion of each data record), while requiring significantly less computational time. In addition, the incremental LOF algorithm also dynamically updates the profiles of data points. This is a very important property, since data profiles may change over time. The paper provides theoretical evidence that insertion of a new data point as well as deletion of an old data point influence only limited number of their closest neighbors and thus the number of updates per such insertion/deletion does not depend on the total number of points TV in the data set. Our experiments performed on several simulated and real life data sets have demonstrated that the proposed incremental LOF algorithm is computationally efficient, while at the same time very successful in detecting outliers and changes of distributional behavior in various data stream applications","","1-4244-0705-2","10.1109/CIDM.2007.368917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221341","","Event detection;Telecommunication traffic;Data mining;Change detection algorithms;Video surveillance;Computational Intelligence Society;Intrusion detection;Traffic control;Unsupervised learning;Computer networks","","237","3","42","IEEE","4 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Channel inversion and threshold scheduling may be viewed as simple ways to exploit channel state information (CSI) without requiring cooperation across transmitters. We use the transmission capacity (TC) as our metric, defined as the maximum spatial intensity of successful simultaneous transmissions subject to a constraint on the outage probability (OP). By assuming the nodes are located on the infinite plane according to a Poisson process, we are able to employ tools from stochastic geometry to obtain asymptotically tight bounds on the distribution of the signal-to-interference (SIR) level, yielding in turn tight bounds on the OP (relative to a given SIR threshold) and the TC. We demonstrate that in the absence of CSI, fading can significantly reduce the TC and somewhat surprisingly, channel inversion only makes matters worse. We develop a threshold-based transmission rule where transmitters are active only if the channel to their receiver is acceptably strong, obtain expressions for the optimal threshold, and show that this simple, fully distributed scheme can significantly reduce the effect of fading.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2007.907482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373437","Ad hoc networks;channel inversion;fading;threshold scheduling;transmission capacity (TC)","Fading;Transmitters;Power control;Ad hoc networks;Rayleigh channels;Channel state information;Shadow mapping;Capacity planning;Stochastic processes;Information geometry","","237","","37","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

PTLsim models a modern superscalar out of order x86-64 processor core at a configurable level of detail ranging from RTL-level models of all key pipeline structures, caches and devices up to full-speed native execution on the host CPU. Unlike other microarchitectural simulators, PTLsim targets the real commercially available x86 ISA, rather than a discontinued architecture with limited tools and an uncertain future. PTLsim supports several flavors: a single threaded userspace version and a full system version providing an SMT model and the infrastructure for multi-core support. We first describe what it takes to perform cycle accurate modeling of a complete x86 machine at the muop (micro-operation) level, along with the challenges and requirements for effective full system multi-processor capable simulation. We then describe the internal architecture of full system PTLsim and how it interacts with the Xen hypervisor and PTLsim's native mode co-simulation technology. We experimentally evaluate PTLsim's real world accuracy by configuring it like an AMD Athlon 64 machine before running a demanding full system client-server networked benchmark inside PTLsim. We compare the statistics generated by our model with the actual numbers from the real processor to demonstrate PTLsim is accurate to within 5% across all major parameters. We provide a discussion of prior simulation tools, along with their strengths and weaknesses. We describe why PTLsim's x86 focus is highly relevant, and we use our full system simulation results to demonstrate the pitfalls of userspace only simulation.

The determined effective TBR was found to increase with temperature at the GaN/SiC interface from 3.3 x 10-8 W-1 ldr m2 ldr K at 150degC to 6.5 x 3.3 x 10-8 W-1 ldr m2 ldr K at 275degC, respectively. The contribution of a low-thermal-conductivity GaN layer at the GaN/substrate interface toward the effective TBR in devices and its temperature dependence are also discussed.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2007.908874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383050","Field-effect transistors (FETs);Gallium compounds;high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs);Raman spectroscopy;temperature measurements;thermal boundary resistance (TBR);thermal simulations","Field effect transistors;Gallium compounds;High electron mobility;Thermal analysis;Raman spectra","","234","1","32","IEEE","27 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hyperspectral data are 3-D, and the nature of their correlation is different in each dimension. This calls for a careful design of the 3-D transform to be used for compression. In this paper, we investigate the transform design and rate allocation stage for lossy compression of hyperspectral data. First, we select a set of 3-D transforms, obtained by combining in various ways wavelets, wavelet packets, the discrete cosine transform, and the Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT), and evaluate the coding efficiency of these combinations. Second, we propose a low-complexity version of the KLT, in which complexity and performance can be balanced in a scalable way, allowing one to design the transform that better matches a specific application. Third, we integrate this, as well as other existing transforms, in the framework of Part 2 of the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) 2000 standard, taking advantage of the high coding efficiency of JPEG 2000, and exploiting the interoperability of an international standard. We introduce an evaluation framework based on both reconstruction fidelity and impact on image exploitation, and evaluate the proposed algorithm by applying this framework to AVIRIS scenes. It is shown that the scheme based on the proposed low-complexity KLT significantly outperforms previous schemes as to rate-distortion performance. As for impact on exploitation, we consider multiclass hard classification, spectral unmixing, binary classification, and anomaly detection as benchmark applications.

Surprisingly, within the context of multiobjective (MO) optimization, the impact of fitness assignment on the exploration-exploitation balance has drawn little attention. The vast majority of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) presented to date resort to Pareto dominance classification as a fitness assignment methodology. However, the proportion of Pareto optimal elements in a set P grows with the dimensionality of P. Therefore, when the number of objectives of a multiobjective problem (MOP) is large, Pareto dominance-based ranking procedures become ineffective in sorting out the quality of solutions. This paper investigates the potential of using preference order-based approach as an optimality criterion in the ranking stage of MOEAs. A ranking procedure that exploits the definition of preference ordering (PO) is proposed, along with two strategies that make different use of the conditions of efficiency provided, and it is compared with a more traditional Pareto dominance-based ranking scheme within the framework of NSGA-II. A series of extensive experiments is performed on seven widely applied test functions, namely, DTLZ1, DTLZ2, DTLZ3, DTLZ4, DTLZ5, DTLZ6, and DTLZ7, for up to eight objectives. The results are analyzed through a suite of five performance metrics and indicate that the ranking procedure based on PO enables NSGA-II to achieve better scalability properties compared with the standard ranking scheme and suggest that the proposed methodology could be successfully extended to other MOEAs","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2006.876362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4079613","Fitness assignment;multiobjective;ranking procedure;selective pressure","Evolutionary computation;Sorting;Performance evaluation;Testing;Performance analysis;Measurement;Scalability;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Biological cells","","232","","31","IEEE","5 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Unified Framework for Max-Min and Min-Max Fairness With Applications","B. Radunovic; J. -Y. Le Boudec","EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,"15 Oct 2007","2007","15","5","1073","1083"," Max-min fairness is widely used in various areas of networking. In every case where it is used, there is a proof of existence and one or several algorithms for computing it; in most, but not all cases, they are based on the notion of bottlenecks. In spite of this wide applicability, there are still examples, arising in the context of wireless or peer-to-peer networks, where the existing theories do not seem to apply directly. In this paper, we give a unifying treatment of max-min fairness, which encompasses all existing results in a simplifying framework, and extend its applicability to new examples. First, we observe that the existence of max-min fairness is actually a geometric property of the set of feasible allocations. There exist sets on which max-min fairness does not exist, and we describe a large class of sets on which a max-min fair allocation does exist. This class contains, but is not limited to the compact, convex sets of $\BBR^N$ . Second, we give a general purpose centralized algorithm, called Max-min Programming, for computing the max-min fair allocation in all cases where it exists (whether the set of feasible allocations is in our class or not). Its complexity is of the order of $N$  linear programming steps in $\BBR^N$ , in the case where the feasible set is defined by linear constraints. We show that, if the set of feasible allocations has the free disposal property, then Max-min Programming reduces to a simpler algorithm, called Water Filling, whose complexity is much lower. Free disposal corresponds to the cases where a bottleneck argument can be made, and Water Filling is the general form of all previously known centralized algorithms for such cases.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2007.896231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4346554","Best-effort traffic;elastic traffic;mathematical programming/optimization;max-min fairness;system design","Filling;Telecommunication traffic;Peer to peer computing;Linear programming;Water;Distributed algorithms;Distributed computing;Mathematical programming;Design optimization;Resource management","","232","5","28","IEEE","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model accounts for many of the essential features of a P2P streaming system, including the peers' realtime demand for content, peer churn (peers joining and leaving), peers with heterogeneous upload capacity, limited infrastructure capacity, and peer buffering and playback delay. The model is tractable, providing closed-form expressions which can be used to shed insight on the fundamental behavior of P2P streaming systems. The model shows that performance is largely determined by a critical value. When the system is of moderate-to-large size, if a certain ratio of traffic loads exceeds the critical value, the system performs well; otherwise, the system performs poorly. Furthermore, large systems have better performance than small systems since they are more resilient to bandwidth fluctuations caused by peer churn. Finally, buffering can dramatically improve performance in the critical region, for both small and large systems. In particular, buffering can bring more improvement than can additional infrastructure bandwidth.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215694","","Stochastic systems;Streaming media;Peer to peer computing;USA Councils;Bandwidth;Bit rate;Internet;Communications Society;Information science;Delay","","231","7","18","IEEE","29 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For CBIR, we deal with the relevance feedback problem by extending MFA to marginal biased analysis, in which within-class compactness is characterized only by the distances between each positive sample and its neighboring positive samples. In addition, we present a new technique to acquire a direct optimal solution for MFA without resorting to objective function modification as done in many previous algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a complete human recognition system using 3D ear biometrics. The system consists of 3D ear detection, 3D ear identification, and 3D ear verification. For ear detection, we propose a new approach which uses a single reference 3D ear shape model and locates the ear helix and the antihelix parts in registered 2D color and 3D range images. For ear identification and verification using range images, two new representations are proposed. These include the ear helix/antihelix representation obtained from the detection algorithm and the local surface patch (LSP) representation computed at feature points. A local surface descriptor is characterized by a centroid, a local surface type, and a 2D histogram. The 2D histogram shows the frequency of occurrence of shape index values versus the angles between the normal of reference feature point and that of its neighbors. Both shape representations are used to estimate the initial rigid transformation between a gallery-probe pair. This transformation is applied to selected locations of ears in the gallery set and a modified iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is used to iteratively refine the transformation to bring the gallery ear and probe ear into the best alignment in the sense of the least root mean square error. The experimental results on the UCR data set of 155 subjects with 902 images under pose variations and the University of Notre Dame data set of 302 subjects with time-lapse gallery-probe pairs are presented to compare and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the system","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107574","3D ear biometrics;3D ear identification;3D ear verification;range and color images;surface matching.","Humans;Ear;Shape;Biometrics;Histograms;Detection algorithms;Frequency;Iterative closest point algorithm;Iterative algorithms;Probes","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Ear;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","231","6","50","IEEE","20 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although FBGs are often referring to permanent refractive index modulation in the fiber core, exposure to high-temperature environments usually results in the bleach of the refractive index modulation. The maximum temperature reported for the conventional FBG temperature sensor is around 600 degC due to its weak bonds of germanium and oxygen. In this paper, we report design and development of a novel high-temperature resistance FBG temperature sensor, based on the hydrogen-loaded germanium-doped FBG. The refractive index modulation in the FBG is induced by the molecular water. The results of our experiments have shown that the stability of the device is substantially increased at high temperature range. Due to the high bonds energy of hydroxyl and the low diffusivity of the molecular water, the thermal testing results of this temperature sensor show the thermal stability of hydrogen-loaded FBG can be increased by using annealing treatment; moreover, the highest erasing temperature for the device could reach to 1100 degC or more. The reflectivity of this new FBG depends on the concentration of Si-OH and indirectly related to the reflectivity of hydrogen-loaded FBG. Furthermore, the experimental results have provided a better understanding of the formation of the hydrogen-loaded FBGs and the chemical transfers at elevated temperatures in the fiber core","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2007.891941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118146","Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) temperature sensors;high-temperature resistance FBGs;molecular-water induced FBGs","Temperature sensors;Fabrication;Fiber gratings;Bragg gratings;Sensor arrays;Refractive index;Reflectivity;Optical fiber sensors;Bleaching;Germanium","","231","","16","IEEE","5 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The assessment was done by evaluating the fuel consumption using three optimal controllers, each with a different level of information access to the driven route. The lowest information case represents that the vehicle knows that it is being driven in a certain environment, e.g., city driving, and that the controller has been optimized for that type of environment. The second highest information level represents a vehicle equipped with a GPS combined with a traffic-flow information system. In the highest information level, the future power demand is completely known to the control system, hence, the corresponding optimal controller results in the minimal attainable fuel consumption. This paper showed that good performance (1%-3% from the minimal attainable fuel consumption) can be achieved with the lowest information case, with a time-invariant controller that is optimized to the environment. The second highest information level results in less than 0.2% higher consumption than the minimal attainable on the studied route. This means that it is possible to design a predictive controller based on information supplied by the vehicle-navigation system and traffic-flow-information systems that can come very close to the minimal attainable fuel consumption. A novel algorithm that uses information supplied by the vehicle-navigation system was presented. The proposed algorithm results in a consumption only 0.3% from the minimal attainable consumption on the studied route","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2006.884887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4114343","Hybrid vehicles;predictive control;stochastic optimal control","Predictive control;Mechanical power transmission;Stochastic processes;Dynamic programming;Fuels;Optimal control;Control systems;Hybrid electric vehicles;Electric variables measurement;Surfaces","","230","8","10","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, based on a fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), a delay-dependent stability criterion is derived for the open-loop fuzzy systems. In the derivation process, some free fuzzy weighting matrices are introduced to express the relationships among the terms of the system equation, and among the terms in the Leibniz-Newton formula. Then, a delay-dependent stabilization condition based on the so-called parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme is worked out for the closed-loop fuzzy systems. The proposed stability criterion and stabilization condition are represented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and compared with the existing ones via two examples.

Although existing duty-cycle MAC protocols such as S-MAC are power efficient, they introduce significant end-to-end delivery latency and provide poor traffic contention handling. In this paper, we present a new duty-cycle MAC protocol, called RMAC (the routing enhanced MAC protocol), that exploits cross-layer routing information in order to avoid these problems without sacrificing energy efficiency. In RMAC, a setup control frame can travel across multiple hops and schedule the upcoming data packet delivery along that route. Each intermediate relaying node for the data packet along these hops sleeps and intelligently wakes up at a scheduled time, so that its upstream node can send the data packet to it and it can immediately forward the data packet to its downstream node. When wireless medium contention occurs, RMAC moves contention traffic away from the busy area by delivering data packets over multiple hops in a single cycle, helping to reduce the contention in the area quickly. Our simulation results in ns-2 show that RMAC achieves significant improvement in end-to-end delivery latency over S-MAC and can handle traffic contention much more efficiently than S-MAC, without sacrificing energy efficiency or network throughput.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215756","","Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks;Delay;Routing protocols;Energy efficiency;Traffic control;Communication system traffic control;Relays;Sleep","","230","3","19","IEEE","29 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This algorithm does not require any initialization in the form of a bounding volume, and it detects and discards automatically outliers and obstacles. It does not perform any smoothing across nearby features, yet is currently the top performer in terms of both coverage and accuracy for four of the six benchmark datasets presented in [20]. The keys to its performance are effective techniques for enforcing local photometric consistency and global visibility constraints. Stereopsis is implemented as a match, expand, and filter procedure, starting from a sparse set of matched keypoints, and repeatedly expanding these to nearby pixel correspondences before using visibility constraints to filter away false matches. A simple but effective method for turning the resulting patch model into a mesh appropriate for image-based modeling is also presented. The proposed approach is demonstrated on various datasets including objects with fine surface details, deep concavities, and thin structures, outdoor scenes observed from a restricted set of viewpoints, and ""crowded"" scenes where moving obstacles appear in different places in multiple images of a static structure of interest.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270271","","Robustness;Layout;Matched filters;Photometry;Image reconstruction;Smoothing methods;Turning;Embedded computing;Computer science;Surface reconstruction","","229","4","23","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was electrochemically deposited on thin film Pt electrodes of stimulation electrode arrays to evaluate its properties for chronic stimulation. The coated electrodes demonstrated much lower impedance than thin film Pt due to the high surface area and high ion conductivity across the film. The PEDOT film also presents intrinsic redox activity which contributes to the low impedance as well as a much higher charge storage capacity. The charge injection limit of PEDOT electrode was found to be 2.3 mC/cm2 , comparable to IrOx and much higher than thin film Pt. Under biphasic stimulation, the coated electrodes exhibited lower voltage and linear voltage excursion.

Therefore congestion in WSNs needs to be controlled in order to prolong system lifetime. In addition, this is also necessary to improve fairness and provide better quality of service (QoS), which is required by multimedia applications in wireless multimedia sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a novel upstream congestion control protocol for WSNs, called priority-based congestion control protocol (PCCP). Unlike existing work, PCCP innovatively measures congestion degree as the ratio of packet inter-arrival time along over packet service time. PCCP still introduced node priority index to reflect the importance of each sensor node. Based on the introduced congestion degree and node priority index, PCCP utilizes a cross-layer optimization and imposes a hop-by-hop approach to control congestion. We have demonstrated that PCCP achieves efficient congestion control and flexible weighted fairness for both single-path and multi-path routing, as a result this leads to higher energy efficiency and better QoS in terms of both packet loss rate and delay.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2007.070514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4205060","","Wireless sensor networks;Quality of service;Protocols;Energy consumption;Control systems;Time measurement;Weight control;Routing;Energy efficiency;Delay","","228","3","10","IEEE","21 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To realize this potential, the transmitter needs accurate channel state information (CSI) for the upcoming transmission frame. In most mobile radio systems, the CSI is estimated at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter. However, unless the mobile speed is very low, the estimated CSI cannot be used directly to select the parameters of adaptive transmission systems, since it quickly becomes outdated due to the rapid channel variation caused by multipath fading. To enable adaptive transmission for mobile radio systems, prediction of future fading channel samples is required. Several fundamental issues arise in the design and testing of fading prediction algorithms for adaptive transmission systems. These include complexity, robustness, choice of an appropriate channel model for algorithm validation, channel estimation and noise reduction required for reliable prediction, and design and analysis of adaptive transmission methods aided by fading prediction algorithms. We use these criteria in the review of recent advances in the area of fading channel prediction. We also demonstrate that reliable fading prediction makes adaptive transmission feasible in diverse wireless communication systems.

Five multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults from inverter output voltage measurement. The neural network design process is clearly described. The classification performance of the proposed network between normal and abnormal condition is about 90%, and the classification performance among fault features is about 85%.

The algorithm is based on a carrier-based pulsewidth modulation. Nevertheless, it can generate the maximum output-voltage amplitudes that are attainable under linear modulation, such as space-vector modulation. Furthermore, this technique can be implemented with a very simple algorithm and, hence, can be processed very quickly. The only drawback of this strategy is that the switching frequencies of the devices are one third higher than those of standard sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation. A control loop for balancing the voltages on the dc-link capacitors is also proposed. This balancing strategy is designed, so that it does not further increase the switching frequencies of the devices when it is applied to the converter.

In the existing literature, distributed implementations are typically achieved by means of the so-called dual decomposition technique. However, the span of decomposition possibilities includes many other elements that, thus far, have not been fully exploited, such as the use of the primal decomposition technique, the versatile introduction of auxiliary variables, and the potential of multilevel decompositions. This paper presents a systematic framework to exploit alternative decomposition structures as a way to obtain different distributed algorithms, each with a different tradeoff among convergence speed, message passing amount and asymmetry, and distributed computation architecture. Several specific applications are considered to illustrate the proposed framework, including resource-constrained and direct-control rate allocation, and rate allocation among QoS classes with multipath routing. For each of these applications, the associated generalized NUM formulation is first presented, followed by the development of novel alternative decompositions and numerical experiments on the resulting new distributed algorithms. A systematic enumeration and comparison of alternative vertical decompositions in the future will help complete a mathematical theory of network architectures.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2007.910665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4395184","Congestion control;distributed algorithm;mathematical programming/optimization;network control by pricing;network utility maximization (NUM);rate control;resource allocation","Distributed algorithms;Utility programs;Resource management;Protocols;Distributed computing;Computer architecture;Distributed control;Convergence;Message passing;Routing","","227","1","49","IEEE","12 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assisted with clinical evaluation, designers, engineers, and scientists have built a device for robotic assisted upper extremity repetitive therapy (RUPERT). Intense, repetitive physical rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial overcoming upper extremity deficits, but the therapy is labor intensive and expensive and difficult to evaluate quantitatively and objectively. The RUPERT is developed to provide a low cost, safe and easy-to-use, robotic-device to assist the patient and therapist to achieve more systematic therapy at home or in the clinic. The RUPERT has four actuated degrees-of-freedom driven by compliant and safe pneumatic muscles (PMs) on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. They are programmed to actuate the device to extend the arm and move the arm in 3-D space. It is very important to note that gravity is not compensated and the daily tasks are practiced in a natural setting. Because the device is wearable and lightweight to increase portability, it can be worn standing or sitting providing therapy tasks that better mimic activities of daily living. The sensors feed back position and force information for quantitative evaluation of task performance. The device can also provide real-time, objective assessment of functional improvement. We have tested the device on stroke survivors performing two critical activities of daily living (ADL): reaching out and self feeding. The future improvement of the device involves increased degrees-of-freedom and interactive control to adapt to a user's physical conditions.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2007.903903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4303112","Control;neuromotor function;pneumatic muscle;rehabilitation robot;repetitive therapy;stroke","Robots;Extremities;Medical treatment;Rehabilitation robotics;Control systems;Biological control systems;Design engineering;Costs;Muscles;Elbow","Computer Simulation;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Exercise Therapy;Exercise Therapy;Feedback;Humans;Models, Biological;Movement Disorders;Movement Disorders;Robotics;Robotics;Stroke;Stroke;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Upper Extremity","226","","28","IEEE","17 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on the following: 1) a split of the large-size image into subimages; 2) an adaptive analysis of each subimage; and 3) an automatic split-based threshold-selection procedure. This general approach is used for defining a system for damage assessment in multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.

Exploiting an important phenomenon in wireless networks, source burstiness, the cognitive relay utilizes the periods of silence of the terminals to enable cooperation. Therefore, no extra channel resources are allocated for cooperation and the system encounters no bandwidth losses. Two protocols are developed to implement the proposed multiple-access strategy. The maximum stable throughput region and the delay performance of the proposed protocols are characterized. The results reveal that the proposed protocols provide significant performance gains over conventional relaying strategies such as selection and incremental relaying, specially at high spectral efficiency regimes. The rationale is that the lossless bandwidth property of the proposed protocols results in a graceful degradation in the maximum stable throughput with increasing the required rate of communication. On the other hand, conventional relaying strategies suffer from catastrophic performance degradation because of their inherent bandwidth inefficiency that results from allocating specific channel resources for cooperation at the relay. The analysis reveals that the throughput region of the proposed strategy is a subset of its maximum stable throughput region, which is different from random access, where both regions are conjectured to be identical.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2007.904784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4305412","Cooperative communications;delay analysis;diversity techniques;multiple access;queueing theory;relay channel;stability analysis;stability region","Access protocols;Performance analysis;Relays;Throughput;Bandwidth;Resource management;Degradation;Wireless networks;Delay;Performance gain","","225","1","33","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using this scheme, antennas of the distributive relays work as transmit antennas of the sender and generate a space–time code at the receiver. It achieves the maximal diversity when the transmit power is infinitely large. This paper is on the design of practical distributed space–time codes (DSTCs). We use orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal designs which are originally used in the design of space–time codes for multiple-antenna systems. It is well known that orthogonal space–time codes have full diversity and linear decoding complexity. They are particularly suitable for transmissions in the network setting using distributed space–time coding since their ""scale-free"" property leads to good performance. Our simulations show that they achieve lower error rates than the random code. We also compare distributed space–time coding to selection decode-and-forward using the same orthogonal designs. Simulations show that distributed space–time coding achieves higher diversity than selection decode-and-forward (DF) when there is more than one relay. We also generalize the distributed space–time coding scheme to wireless relay networks with channel information at the relays. Although our analysis and simulations show that there is no improvement in the diversity, in some networks, having channel information at the relays saves both the transmission power and the transmission time.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2007.907516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373409","Relay network;distributed space–time coding;orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal designs;diversity;coding gain;pairwise error probability (PEP)","Relays;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Decoding;Transmitters;Error analysis;Wireless networks;Information analysis;Analytical models;Pairwise error probability","","224","3","20","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previously, we experimentally characterized the dielectric properties of a large number of excised normal and malignant breast tissue samples from 0.5 to 20 GHz. We subdivided the large database of normal tissue data into three groups based on the percent adipose tissue present in a particular sample. In addition, we formed a group of all cancer samples that contained at least 30% malignant tissue. We summarized the data using one-pole Cole-Cole models that were rigorously fit to the median dielectric properties of the three normal tissue groups and one malignant tissue group.

Interestingly, this receiver requires prior knowledge of the clutter covariance, but the detection threshold is functionally independent thereof. At the transmitter design stage, we give two criteria for code construction: the first is based on the classical Chernoff bound, the second is an information-theoretic criterion. Interestingly, the two criteria lead to the same condition for code optimality, which in turn specializes, under the assumption of uncorrelated clutter and square code matrix, in some well-known full-rate space-time codes.

Given a target and possible obstacle locations, the computer calculates the flexible needle-tip trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target. Using an inverse kinematics algorithm, the needle base maneuvers required for a tip to follow this trajectory are calculated, enabling a robot to perform controlled needle insertion. Assuming small displacements, the flexible needle is modeled as a linear beam supported by virtual springs, where the stiffness coefficients of the springs can vary along the needle. Using this simplified model, the forward and inverse kinematics of the needle are solved analytically, enabling both path planning and path correction in real time. The needle shape is detected in real time from fluoroscopic images, and the controller commands the needle base motion that minimizes the needle tip error. This approach was verified experimentally using a robot to maneuver the base of a flexible needle inserted into a muscle tissue. Along the 40-mm trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target, the error stayed below the 0.5-mm level.

Prior to the study, the SVR problem is enhanced by finding the optimal kernel. This is done by formulating the kernel learning problem in SVR form as a convex optimization problem, specifically a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. An additional constraint is added to reduce the SDP to a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. After this optimization, investigation of the relevancy of SVR to superresolution proceeds with the possibility of using a single and general support vector regression for all image content, and the results are impressive for small training sets.

Given a network domain, the fundamental issue in placing MRs is to find the minimal configuration of MRs so as to satisfy the network coverage, connectivity, and Internet traffic demand. In this paper, the problem is addressed under a constraint network model in which the traffic demand is non-uniformly distributed and the candidate positions for MRs are pre-decided. After formulating the MR placement problem, we first provide the theoretical analysis to validate the traffic demand and determine the optimal position of Internet gateway (IGW). To reduce complexity of determining the locations of MRs while satisfying the traffic constraint, we propose an effective heuristic algorithm to obtain an close-to-optimal solution. Finally, our simulation results verify our analytical model and show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","2155-6814","978-1-4244-1454-3","10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4428616","","Wireless mesh networks;Traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Internet;Throughput;Computer science;Heuristic algorithms;Analytical models;Interference constraints;Costs","","223","3","10","IEEE","14 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different 3DTV systems rely on different 3D scene representations that integrate various types of data. Efficient coding of these data is crucial for the success of 3DTV. Compression of pixel-type data including stereo video, multiview video, and associated depth or disparity maps extends available principles of classical video coding. Powerful algorithms and open international standards for multiview video coding and coding of video plus depth data are available and under development, which will provide the basis for introduction of various 3DTV systems and services in the near future. Compression of 3D mesh models has also reached a high level of maturity. For static geometry, a variety of powerful algorithms are available to efficiently compress vertices and connectivity. Compression of dynamic 3D geometry is currently a more active field of research. Temporal prediction is an important mechanism to remove redundancy from animated 3D mesh sequences. Error resilience is important for transmission of data over error prone channels, and multiple description coding (MDC) is a suitable way to protect data. MDC of still images and 2D video has already been widely studied, whereas multiview video and 3D meshes have been addressed only recently. Intellectual property protection of 3D data by watermarking is a pioneering research area as well. The 3D watermarking methods in the literature are classified into three groups, considering the dimensions of the main components of scene representations and the resulting components after applying the algorithm. In general, 3DTV coding technology is maturating. Systems and services may enter the market in the near future. However, the research area is relatively young compared to coding of other types of media.

This paper introduces the concept of a guard zone, defined as the region around each receiver where interfering transmissions are inhibited. Using stochastic geometry, the guard zone size that maximizes the transmission capacity for spread spectrum ad hoc networks is derived - narrowband transmission (spreading gain of unity) is a special case. A large guard zone naturally decreases the interference, but at the cost of inefficient spatial reuse. The derived results provide insight into the design of contention resolution algorithms by quantifying the optimal tradeoff between interference and spatial reuse in terms of the system parameters. A capacity increase relative to random access (ALOHA) in the range of 2 - 100 fold is demonstrated through an optimal guard zone; the capacity increase depending primarily on the required outage probability, as higher required QoS increasingly rewards scheduling. Compared to the ubiquitous carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) which essentially implements a guard zone around the transmitter rather than the receiver - we observe a capacity increase on the order of 30 - 100%","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2007.04793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4133877","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Ad hoc networks;Interference;Capacity planning;Stochastic processes;Geometry;Spread spectrum communication;Narrowband;Costs;Algorithm design and analysis","","223","","44","IEEE","19 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, an analytical redundancy method using neural network modeling of the induction motor in vibration spectra is proposed for machine fault detection and diagnosis. The short-time Fourier transform is used to process the quasi-steady vibration signals to continuous spectra for the neural network model training.

A mobile data observer, called SenCar, which could be a mobile robot or a vehicle equipped with a powerful transceiver and battery, works like a mobile base station in the network. SenCar starts the data gathering tour periodically from the static data processing center, traverses the entire sensor network, gathers the data from sensors while moving, returns to the starting point, and, finally, uploads data to the data processing center. Unlike SenCar, sensors in the network are static and can be made very simple and inexpensive. They upload sensed data to SenCar when SenCar moves close to them. Since sensors can only communicate with others within a very limited range, packets from some sensors may need multihop relays to reach SenCar. We first show that the moving path of SenCar can greatly affect network lifetime. We then present heuristic algorithms for planning the moving path/circle of SenCar and balancing traffic load in the network. We show that, by driving SenCar along a better path and balancing the traffic load from sensors to SenCar, network lifetime can be prolonged significantly. Our moving planning algorithm can be used in both connected networks and disconnected networks. In addition, SenCar can avoid obstacles while moving. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed data gathering mechanism can prolong network lifetime significantly compared to a network that has only a static observer or a network in which the mobile observer can only move along straight lines.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2007.1070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302733","SenCar;wireless sensor networks;data gathering;load balancing","Energy efficiency;Large-scale systems;Spread spectrum communication;Data processing;Telecommunication traffic;Mobile robots;Battery powered vehicles;Transceivers;Base stations;Relays","","222","","28","IEEE","17 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed approach relies on the fact that transmitting an ultra-short pulse through a multipath UWB channel leads to a received UWB signal that can be approximated by a linear combination of a few atoms from a pre-defined dictionary, yielding thus a sparse representation of the received UWB signal. The key in the proposed approach is in the design of a dictionary of parameterized waveforms (atoms) that closely matches the information-carrying pulseshape leading thus to higher energy compaction and sparse representation, and, therefore higher probability for CS reconstruction. Two approaches for UWB channel estimation are developed under a data-aided framework. In the first approach, the CS reconstruction capabilities are exploited to recover the composite pulse-multipath channel from a reduced set of random projections. This reconstructed signal is subsequently used as a referent template in a correlator-based detector. In the second approach, from a set of random projections of the received pilot signal, the Matching Pursuit algorithm is used to identify the strongest atoms in the projected signal that, in turn, are related to the strongest propagation paths that composite the multipath UWB channel. A Rake like receiver uses those atoms as templates for the bank of correlators in the detection stage. The bit error rate performances of the proposed approaches are analyzed and compared to that of traditional correlator-based detector. Extensive simulations show that for different propagation scenarios and UWB communication channels, detectors based on CS channel estimation outperform traditional correlator using just 1/3 of the sampling rate leading thus to a reduced use of analog-to-digital resources in the channel estimation stage.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2007.906657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4336106","Channel estimation;compressive sensing;detection;ultra-wideband","Ultra wideband technology;Compressed sensing;Channel estimation;Detectors;Dictionaries;Signal processing;Matching pursuit algorithms;Correlators;Linear approximation;Compaction","","222","21","29","IEEE","1 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To create tomographic images from microwave measurements, it is necessary to solve a nonlinear inversion problem, for which an algorithm based on the iterative Gauss-Newton method has been developed at Dartmouth College. This algorithm determines the update values at each iteration by solving the set of normal equations of the problem using the Tikhonov algorithm. In this paper, a new algorithm for determining the iteration update values in the Gauss-Newton algorithm is presented which is based on the conjugate gradient least squares (CGLS) algorithm. The iterative CGLS algorithm is capable of solving the update problem by operating on just the Jacobian and the regularizing effects of the algorithm can easily be controlled by adjusting the number of iterations. The new algorithm is compared to the Gauss-Newton algorithm with Tikhonov regularization and is shown to reconstruct images of similar quality using fewer iterations.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2007.901993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286026","Biomedical electromagnetic imaging;cancer;electromagnetic scattering inverse problems;image reconstruction;imaging;inverse problems;microwave imaging;nonlinear equations","Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave imaging;Breast cancer;Gaussian processes;Iterative algorithms;Least squares methods;Newton method;Recursive estimation;Optical imaging;X-ray imaging","","221","8","25","IEEE","8 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Throughout the letter, we assume a fix average transmit power and consider a block-fading Rayleigh channel. First, we show that for a system with M transmit antennas and users equipped with N antennas, the sum rate scales like MloglognN for DPC, and beamforming when M is fixed and for any N (either growing to infinity or not). On the other hand, when both M and N are fixed, the sum rate of time sharing to the strongest user scales like min(M,N)loglogn. Therefore, the asymptotic gain of DPC over time sharing for the sum rate is (M/min(M,N)) when M and N are fixed. It is also shown that if M grows as logn, the sum rate of DPC and beamforming will grow linearly in M, but with different constant multiplicative factors.

During this time span, definitions and views on the meaning of product modularity proliferated to the extent that it is difficult to understand the essential traits of the concept. While definitional ambiguity is often a byproduct of academic debate, it hinders the advancement of scientific knowledge as well. This paper aims to move a step forward toward a more precise definition of product modularity, by articulating a product system modularity construct in the domain of tangible, assembled artifacts. More precisely, the paper constitutively defines product modularity in terms of component separability and component combinability. An indirect operational definition for product modularity is then proposed by operationalizing component separability and component combinability. The proposed definition is finally related to other definitional perspectives synthesized by a literature review: component commonality, function binding, interface standardization, and loose coupling. In this way, the nomological network of the product modularity construct is laid out.

Generally, storage-based standing reserve's value is driven by the amount of installed wind and by generation system flexibility. Benefits are more significant in systems with low generation flexibility and with large installed wind capacity. Storage is uniquely able to stock up generated excesses during high-wind/low-demand periods, and subsequently discharge this energy as needed.

This paper investigates distributed decode-and-forward fixed relays (infrastructure-based relaying) which are engaged in cooperation in a two-hop wireless network as a means of removing the burden of multiple antennas on wireless terminals. In contrast to mobile terminals, the deployment of a small number of antennas on infrastructure-based fixed relays is feasible, thus, the paper examines the impact of multiple antennas on the performance of the distributed cooperative fixed relays. Threshold-based maximal ratio combining (MRC) and threshold-based selection combining (SC) of these multiple antenna signals are studied and analyzed. It is found that the end-to-end (E2E) error performance of a network which has few relays with many antennas is not significantly worse than that which has many relays each with a fewer antennas. Obviously, the former network has a tremendous deployment cost advantage over the latter. It is also observed that the E2E error performance of a network in which the multiple antennas at relays are configured in SC fashion is not significantly worse than that in which MRC is used. For implementation, SC presents a significantly lower complexity and cost than a full-blown MRC.

First, we obtain a theoretical formulation for computing the throughput of network coding on any wireless network topology and any pattern of concurrent unicast traffic sessions. Second, we advocate that routing be made aware of network coding opportunities rather than, as in COPE, being oblivious to it. More importantly, our work studies the tradeoff between routing flows ""close to each other"" for utilizing coding opportunities and ""away from each other"" for avoiding wireless interference. Our theoretical formulation provides a method for computing source-destination routes and utilizing the best coding opportunities from available ones so as to maximize the throughput. We handle scheduling of broadcast transmissions subject to wireless transmit/receive diversity and link interference in our optimization framework. Using our formulations, we compare the performance of traditional unicast routing and network coding with coding-oblivious and coding-aware routing on a variety of mesh network topologies, including some derived from contemporary mesh network testbeds.

The dielectric and discharge behavior of the polymer films were investigated. The results reveal that there are strong frequency dispersions in both the dielectric and discharge behavior.

They require low and tunable endpoint impedance as well as high force capacity, and demand actuators with low intrinsic impedance, the ability to exhibit high impedance (relative to the human subject), and a high ratio of force to weight. Force-feedback control can be used to improve actuator performance, but causes well-known interaction stability problems. This paper presents a novel method to design actuator controllers for physically interactive machines. A loop-shaping design method is developed from a study of fundamental differences between interaction control and the more common servo problem. This approach addresses the interaction problem by redefining stability and performance, using a computational approach to search parameter spaces and displaying variations in performance as control parameters are adjusted. A measure of complementary stability is introduced, and the coupled stability problem is transformed to a robust stability problem using limited knowledge of the environment dynamics (in this case, the human). Design examples show that this new measure improves performance beyond the current best-practice stability constraint (passivity). The controller was implemented on an interactive robot, verifying stability and performance. Testing showed that the new controller out-performed a state-of-the-art controller on the same system","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2007.892229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4154828","Actuators;control systems;force control;haptics;man–machine systems;robots","Impedance;Actuators;Robust stability;Design methodology;Control systems;Human robot interaction;Face;Force control;Weight control;Servomechanisms","","218","3","33","IEEE","16 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the possible solutions is generating virtual frontal view from any given nonfrontal view to obtain a virtual gallery/probe face. Following this idea, this paper proposes a simple, but efficient, novel locally linear regression (LLR) method, which generates the virtual frontal view from a given nonfrontal face image. We first justify the basic assumption of the paper that there exists an approximate linear mapping between a nonfrontal face image and its frontal counterpart. Then, by formulating the estimation of the linear mapping as a prediction problem, we present the regression-based solution, i.e., globally linear regression. To improve the prediction accuracy in the case of coarse alignment, LLR is further proposed. In LLR, we first perform dense sampling in the nonfrontal face image to obtain many overlapped local patches. Then, the linear regression technique is applied to each small patch for the prediction of its virtual frontal patch. Through the combination of all these patches, the virtual frontal view is generated. The experimental results on the CMU PIE database show distinct advantage of the proposed method over Eigen light-field method.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.899195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4237190","Dense sampling;face recognition;locally linear regression (LLR);local patch;virtual frontal view","Linear regression;Face recognition;Probes;Ground penetrating radar;Geophysical measurement techniques;Degradation;Image databases;Computers;Image recognition;Linear approximation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Computer Simulation;Face;Facial Expression;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Linear Models;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Regression Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","217","1","30","IEEE","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are self-organized networks built up from moving vehicles, and are part of the broader class of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). Because of their peculiar characteristics, VANETs require the definition of specific networking techniques, whose feasibility and performance are usually tested by means of simulation. One of the main challenges posed by VANETs simulations is the faithful characterization of vehicular mobility at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, leading to realistic non-uniform distributions of cars and velocity, and unique connectivity dynamics.

Casimir forces and torques arise from quantum fluctuations of vacuum or, more generally, from the zero-point energy of materials and their dependence on the boundary conditions of the electromagnetic fields. Because the latter can be tailored, this raises the interesting possibility of designing QED forces for specific applications. After a concise review of the field in an historical perspective, high precision measurements of the Casimir force using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and applications of the latter to nonlinear oscillators are presented, along with a discussion of its use in nanoscale position sensors. Then, experiments that have demonstrated the role of the skin-depth effect in reducing the Casimir force are presented. The dielectric response of materials enters in a nonintuitive way in the modification of the Casimir-Lifshitz force between dielectrics through the dielectric function at imaginary frequencies epsiv(ixi). The latter is illustrated in a dramatic way by experiments on materials that can be switched between a reflective and a transparent state (hydrogen switchable mirrors). Repulsive Casimir forces between solids separated by a fluid with epsiv(ixi) intermediate between those of the solids over a large frequency range is discussed, including ongoing experiments aimed at its observation. Such repulsive forces can be used to achieve quantum floatation in a virtually frictionless environment, a phenomenon that could be exploited in innovative applications to nanomechanics. The last part of the paper deals with the elusive QED torque between birefringent materials and efforts to observe it.

Furthermore, urban environments are unique in that they exhibit mostly planar surfaces. These surfaces, which are often imaged at oblique angles, pose a challenge for many window-based stereo matchers which suffer in the presence of slanted surfaces. We present a multi-view plane-sweep-based stereo algorithm which correctly handles slanted surfaces and runs in real-time using the graphics processing unit (GPU). Our algorithm consists of (1) identifying the scene's principle plane orientations, (2) estimating depth by performing a plane-sweep for each direction, (3) combining the results of each sweep. The latter can optionally be performed using graph cuts. Additionally, by incorporating priors on the locations of planes in the scene, we can increase the quality of the reconstruction and reduce computation time, especially for uniform textureless surfaces. We demonstrate our algorithm on a variety of scenes and show the improved accuracy obtained by accounting for slanted surfaces.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270270","","Tellurium;Image reconstruction;Layout;Surface reconstruction;Real time systems;Stereo image processing;Hybrid integrated circuits;Electrostatic precipitators;Remotely operated vehicles;Tin","","217","10","21","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By applying the K-means algorithm, distribution of the population in the search space is clustered in each generation. A fuzzy system is used to adjust the values of px and pm. It is based on considering the relative size of the cluster containing the best chromosome and the one containing the worst chromosome.

Training a classifier requires accessing a large collection of data. Releasing person-specific data, such as customer data or patient records, may pose a threat to an individual's privacy. Even after removing explicit identifying information such as Name and SSN, it is still possible to link released records back to their identities by matching some combination of nonidentifying attributes such as {Sex, Zip, Birthdate}. A useful approach to combat such linking attacks, called k-anonymization, is anonymizing the linking attributes so that at least k released records match each value combination of the linking attributes. Previous work attempted to find an optimal k-anonymization that minimizes some data distortion metric. We argue that minimizing the distortion to the training data is not relevant to the classification goal that requires extracting the structure of predication on the ""future"" data. In this paper, we propose a k-anonymization solution for classification. Our goal is to find a k-anonymization, not necessarily optimal in the sense of minimizing data distortion, which preserves the classification structure.

Unfortunately, model derivation is still a challenging task, despite the extensive research that has been devoted to this topic. In fact, it is a common experience that modeling or simulation tasks sometimes fail, often without a clear understanding of the main reason. This paper presents the fundamental properties of causality, stability, and passivity that electrical interconnect models must satisfy in order to be physically consistent. All basic definitions are reviewed in time domain, Laplace domain, and frequency domain, and all significant interrelations between these properties are outlined. This background material is used to interpret several common situations where either model derivation or model use in a computer-aided design environment fails dramatically. We show that the root cause for these difficulties can always be traced back to the lack of stability, causality, or passivity in the data providing the structure characterization and/or in the model itself.

Our large-margin formulation for learning the distance functions is similar to formulations used in the machine learning literature on distance metric learning, however we differ in that we learn local distance functions-a different parameterized function for every image of our training set-whereas typically a single global distance function is learned.

In that work we learned the local distance functions independently, and the outputs of these functions could not be compared at test time without the use of additional heuristics or training. Here we introduce a different approach that has the advantage that it learns distance functions that are globally consistent in that they can be directly compared for purposes of retrieval and classification. The output of the learning algorithm are weights assigned to the image features, which is intuitively appealing in the computer vision setting: some features are more salient than others, and which are more salient depends on the category, or image, being considered. We train and test using the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-1630-1","10.1109/ICCV.2007.4408839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408839","","Image retrieval;Machine learning;Image recognition;Object recognition;Shape;Computer vision;Benchmark testing;Nearest neighbor searches;Vectors;Visualization","","215","26","25","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method relies on the use of a planar (or, alternatively, nonplanar) calibration grid which is captured in several images. In this way, the determination of the radial distortion is an easy add-on to the popular calibration method proposed. The method is entirely noniterative and, hence, is extremely rapid and immune to the problem of local minima. Our method determines the radial distortion in a parameter-free way, not relying on any particular radial distortion model. This makes it applicable to a large range of cameras from narrow-angle to fish-eye lenses. The method also computes the center of radial distortion, which, we argue, is important in obtaining optimal results. Experiments show that this point may be significantly displaced from the center of the image or the principal point of the camera.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4250459","Radial distortion;camera calibration;fundamental matrix.","Cameras;Lenses;Calibration;Polynomials;Iterative methods;Convergence;Cost function;Optical distortion;Transmission line matrix methods;Image analysis","","215","5","24","IEEE","25 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike beamforming, which presumes a high correlation between signals either transmitted or received by an array, the MIMO concept exploits the independence between signals at the array elements. In conventional radar, the target's radar cross section (RCS) fluctuations are regarded as a nuisance parameter that degrades radar performance. The novelty of MIMO radar is that it provides measures to overcome those degradations or even utilizes the RCS fluctuations for new applications. This paper explores how transmit diversity can improve the direction finding performance of a radar utilizing an antenna array at the receiver. To harness diversity, the transmit antennas have to be widely separated, while for direction finding, the receive antennas have to be closely spaced.

In this paper, we describe a novel method to achieve this positioning using poorly aligned examples of a class with no additional labeling. Given a set of unaligned examplars of a class, such as faces, we automatically build an alignment mechanism, without any additional labeling of parts or poses in the data set. Using this alignment mechanism, new members of the class, such as faces resulting from a face detector, can be precisely aligned for the recognition process. Our alignment method improves performance on a face recognition task, both over unaligned images and over images aligned with a face alignment algorithm specifically developed for and trained on hand-labeled face images.

The wireless mesh network is envisaged to be one of the key components in the converged networks of the future, providing flexible high- bandwidth wireless backhaul over large geographical areas. While single radio mesh nodes operating on a single channel suffer from capacity constraints, equipping mesh routers with multiple radios using multiple nonoverlap- ping channels can significantly alleviate the capacity problem and increase the aggregate bandwidth available to the network. However, the assignment of channels to the radio interfaces poses significant challenges. The goal of channel assignment algorithms in multiradio mesh networks is to minimize interference while improving the aggregate network capacity and maintaining the connectivity of the network. In this article we examine the unique constraints of channel assignment in wireless mesh networks and identify the key factors governing assignment schemes, with particular reference to interference, traffic patterns, and multipath connectivity. After presenting a taxonomy of existing channel assignment algorithms for WMNs, we describe a new channel assignment scheme called MesTiC, which incorporates the mesh traffic pattern together with connectivity issues in order to minimize interference in multi- radio mesh networks.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2007.4378326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378326","","Wireless mesh networks;Interference;Bandwidth;Aggregates;Mesh networks;Telecommunication traffic;Next generation networking;Wireless communication;Mobile communication;Channel capacity","","214","1","15","IEEE","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

First, they have to be calibrated for each user individually; second, they have low tolerance for head movement and require the users to hold their heads unnaturally still. In this paper, by exploiting the eye anatomy, we propose two novel solutions to allow natural head movement and minimize the calibration procedure to only one time for a new individual. The first technique is proposed to estimate the 3D eye gaze directly. In this technique, the cornea of the eyeball is modeled as a convex mirror. Via the properties of convex mirror, a simple method is proposed to estimate the 3D optic axis of the eye. The visual axis, which is the true 3D gaze direction of the user, can be determined subsequently after knowing the angle deviation between the visual axis and optic axis by a simple calibration procedure. Therefore, the gaze point on an object in the scene can be obtained by simply intersecting the estimated 3D gaze direction with the object. Different from the first technique, our second technique does not need to estimate the 3D eye gaze directly, and the gaze point on an object is estimated from a gaze mapping function implicitly. In addition, a dynamic computational head compensation model is developed to automatically update the gaze mapping function whenever the head moves. Hence, the eye gaze can be estimated under natural head movement. Furthermore, it minimizes the calibration procedure to only one time for a new individual. The advantage of the proposed techniques over the current state of the art eye gaze trackers is that it can estimate the eye gaze of the user accurately under natural head movement, without need to perform the gaze calibration every time before using it. Our proposed methods will improve the usability of the eye gaze tracking technology, and we believe that it represents an important step for the eye tracker to be accepted as a natural computer input device.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.895750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359993","Eye gaze tracking;gaze estimation;human computer interaction","Tracking;Calibration;Mirrors;Human computer interaction;Anatomy;Cornea;Layout;Computational modeling;State estimation;Usability","Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Eye Movement Measurements;Eye Movements;Fixation, Ocular;Head Movements;Humans;Models, Biological;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","214","11","33","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents new robust techniques for both of these steps. (i) Given pairwise relative rotations, global camera rotations are estimated linearly in least squares. (ii) Camera translations are estimated using a standard technique based on Second Order Cone Programming. Robustness is achieved by using only a subset of points according to a new criterion that diminishes the risk of chosing a mismatch. It is shown that only four points chosen in a special way are sufficient to represent a pairwise reconstruction almost equally as all points. This leads to a significant speedup. In image sets with repetitive or similar structures, non-existent epipolar geometries may be found. Due to them, some rotations and consequently translations may be estimated incorrectly. It is shown that iterative removal of pairwise reconstructions with the largest residual and reregistration removes most non-existent epipolar geometries. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on difficult wide base-line image sets.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270140","","Robustness;Cameras;Image reconstruction;Geometry;Layout;Least squares approximation;Jacobian matrices;Cybernetics;Linear programming;Buildings","","214","7","26","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No feature correspondence is needed among exemplars, just a suitable pairwise similarity measure. The approach uses a template tree to efficiently represent and match the variety of shape exemplars. The tree is generated offline by a bottom-up clustering approach using stochastic optimization. Online matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the template tree and over the transformation parameters. The main contribution of this paper is a Bayesian model to estimate the a posteriori probability of the object class, after a certain match at a node of the tree. This model takes into account object scale and saliency and allows for a principled setting of the matching thresholds such that unpromising paths in the tree traversal process are eliminated early on. The proposed approach was tested in a variety of application domains. Here, results are presented on one of the more challenging domains: real-time pedestrian detection from a moving vehicle. A significant speed-up is obtained when comparing the proposed probabilistic matching approach with a manually tuned nonprobabilistic variant, both utilizing the same template tree structure.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4250466","Hierarchical shape matching;chamfer distance;Bayesian models.","Bayesian methods;Image segmentation;Robustness;Shape measurement;Stochastic processes;Testing;Vehicle detection;Vehicles;Tree data structures;Prototypes","","214","4","30","IEEE","25 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show the strong correlation between fairness and load balancing, which enables us to use load balancing techniques for obtaining optimal max-min fair bandwidth allocation. As this problem is NP-hard, we devise algorithms that achieve constant-factor approximation. In our algorithms, we first compute a fractional association solution, in which users can be associated with multiple APs simultaneously. This solution guarantees the fairest bandwidth allocation in terms of max-min fairness. Then, by utilizing a rounding method, we obtain the integral solution from the fractional solution. We also consider time fairness and present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal integral solution. We further extend our schemes for the on-line case where users may join and leave dynamically.

In contrast, when the adversary has limited snooping capabilities, we provide algorithms that achieve the higher rate of C - zO. Our algorithms attain the optimal rate given the strength of the adversary. They are information-theoretically secure. They operate in a distributed manner, assume no knowledge of the topology, and can be designed and implemented in polynomial-time. Furthermore, only the source and destination need to be modified; non-malicious nodes inside the network are oblivious to the presence of adversaries and implement a classical distributed network code. Finally, our algorithms work over wired and wireless networks.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215660","","Network coding;Peer to peer computing;Throughput;Decoding;Network topology;Polynomials;Wireless networks;Redundancy;Communications Society;Robustness","","213","22","29","IEEE","29 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This interest is spawned from the fact that modeling nonlinear friction effects is a theoretically challenging problem, and compensating for the effects of friction in a controller has practical ramifications. If the friction effects in the system can be accurately modeled, there is an improved potential to design controllers that can cancel the effects; whereas, excessive steady-state tracking errors, oscillations, and limit cycles can result from controllers that do not accurately compensate for friction. A tracking controller is developed in this paper for a general Euler-Lagrange system that contains a new continuously differentiable friction model with uncertain nonlinear parameterizable terms. To achieve the semi-global asymptotic tracking result, a recently developed integral feedback compensation strategy is used to identify the friction effects online, assuming exact model knowledge of the remaining dynamics. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to conclude the tracking and friction identification results. Experimental results illustrate the tracking and friction identification performance of the developed controller.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2007.904254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4349203","Friction;Lyapunov methods;nonlinear systems;uncertain systems","Friction;Steady-state;Motion control;Error correction;Limit-cycles;Frequency estimation;Frequency domain analysis;Nonlinear control systems;Feedback;Nonlinear dynamical systems","","213","","35","IEEE","15 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Novel Adaptive Nonlinear Predistorters Based on the Direct Learning Algorithm","D. Zhou; V. E.

However, available adaptive nonlinear predistorters using indirect learning are sensitive to measurement noise and do not perform optimally. Other available types are either slow to converge, complicated in structure and computationally expensive, or do not consider the memory effects in nonlinear systems such as a high power amplifier (HPA). In this paper, we first propose several novel adaptive nonlinear predistorters based on direct learning algorithms - the nonlinear filtered-x RLS (NFXRLS) algorithm, the nonlinear adjoint LMS (NALMS) algorithm, and the nonlinear adjoint RLS (NARLS) algorithm. Using these new learning algorithms, we design adaptive nonlinear predistorters for an HPA with memory effects or for an HPA following a linear system. Because of the direct learning algorithm, these novel adaptive predistorters outperform nonlinear predistorters that are based on the indirect learning method in the sense of normalized mean square error (NMSE), bit error rate (BER), and spectral regrowth. Moreover, our developed adaptive nonlinear predistorters are computationally efficient and/or converge rapidly when compared to other adaptive nonlinear predistorters that use direct learning, and furthermore can be easily implemented. We further simplify our proposed algorithms by exploring the robustness of our proposed algorithm as well as by examining the statistical properties of what we call the ""instantaneous equivalent linear"" (IEL) filter.

Transactions update memory ""in place"" after saving the old value in a per-thread memory log (eager version management). Finally, a transaction commits locally by clearing its signature, resetting the log pointer, etc., while aborts must undo the log. LogTM-SE achieves two key benefits. First, signatures and logs can be implemented without changes to highly-optimized cache arrays because LogTM-SE never moves cached data, changes a blocks cache state, or flash clears bits in the cache. Second, transactions are more easily virtualized because signatures and logs are software accessible, allowing the operating system and runtime to save and restore this state. In particular, LogTM-SE allows cache victimization, unbounded nesting (both open and closed), thread context switching and migration, and paging","2378-203X","1-4244-0804-0","10.1109/HPCA.2007.346204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147667","","Hardware;Memory management;Yarn;Broadcasting;Operating systems;Protocols;Decoding;Programming profession;Acceleration","","212","32","32","IEEE","10 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The scene flow contains the 3-D displacement field of scene points, so that the 2-D optical flow can be seen as a projection of the scene flow onto the images. We propose to recover the scene flow by coupling the optical flow estimation in both cameras with dense stereo matching between the images, thus reducing the number of unknowns per image point. The use of a variational framework allows us to properly handle discontinuities in the observed surfaces and in the 3-D displacement field. Moreover our approach handles occlusions both for the optical flow and the stereo. We obtain a partial differential equations system coupling both the optical flow and the stereo, which is numerically solved using an original multi- resolution algorithm. Whereas previous variational methods were estimating the 3-D reconstruction at time t and the scene flow separately, our method jointly estimates both in a single optimization. We present numerical results on synthetic data with ground truth information, and we also compare the accuracy of the scene flow projected in one camera with a state-of-the-art single-camera optical flow computation method. Results are also presented on a real stereo sequence with large motion and stereo discontinuities. Source code and sample data are available for the evaluation of the algorithm.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-1630-1","10.1109/ICCV.2007.4409000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4409000","","Layout;Image motion analysis;Optical coupling;Cameras;Optical computing;Image sequences;Partial differential equations;Three dimensional displays;Optimization methods;Data flow computing","","212","2","22","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The major issue arises in island operation with inverter-based sources. Inverter fault currents are limited by the ratings of the silicon devices to around 2 p.u. rated current.

The mobile element, whose mobility is controlled, visits the nodes to collect their data before their buffers are full. In general, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the sensed phenomenon may require sensor nodes to collect samples at different rates, in which case, some nodes need to be visited more frequently than others. This work formulates the problem of scheduling the mobile element in the network so that there is no data loss due to buffer overflow.

Currently, it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in the large majority of clinical studies. This paper aims to motivate the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an ongoing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, we evaluated three normalization methods representing the current range of available approaches: low-dimensional normalization using the fractional anisotropy (FA), high-dimensional normalization using the FA, and high-dimensional normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the alignment of WM tracts.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2007.906784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359055","Diffusion tensor images;spatial normalization;diffusion tensor images;spatial normalization","Tensile stress;Shape;Diffusion tensor imaging;Image analysis;Diseases;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Magnetic resonance imaging;Microscopy;Water;In vivo","Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Male;Middle Aged;Nerve Fibers, Myelinated;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","211","","73","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"A flexible new technique for camera calibration","Z. Zhang","Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,"6 Aug 2002","2000","22","11","1330","1334","We propose a flexible technique to easily calibrate a camera. It only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one more step from laboratory environments to real world use.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.888718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=888718","","Cameras;Calibration;Computer vision;Layout;Lenses;Nonlinear distortion;Closed-form solution;Maximum likelihood estimation;Computer simulation;Testing","","10453","412","26","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.868688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868688","","Image segmentation;Brightness;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Bayesian methods;Coherence;Tree data structures;Filling;Partitioning algorithms","","10192","134","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multi-hop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster based station (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show the LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional outing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.","","0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926982","","Energy efficiency;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Microsensors;Energy dissipation;Routing protocols;Telecommunication network reliability;Monitoring;Spread spectrum communication;Scalability","","7449","42","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper provides a simple, but nevertheless extremely accurate, analytical model to compute the 802.11 DCF throughput, in the assumption of finite number of terminals and ideal channel conditions. The proposed analysis applies to both the packet transmission schemes employed by DCF, namely, the basic access and the RTS/CTS access mechanisms.

We assume that the information sources are mutually independent. The problem is to characterize the admissible coding rate region. This model subsumes all previously studied models along the same line. We study the problem with one information source, and we have obtained a simple characterization of the admissible coding rate region. Our result can be regarded as the max-flow min-cut theorem for network information flow. Contrary to one's intuition, our work reveals that it is in general not optimal to regard the information to be multicast as a ""fluid"" which can simply be routed or replicated. Rather, by employing coding at the nodes, which we refer to as network coding, bandwidth can in general be saved.

If the nodes are optimally placed in a disk of unit area, traffic patterns are optimally assigned, and each transmission's range is optimally chosen, the bit-distance product that can be transported by the network per second is /spl Theta/(W/spl radic/An) bit-meters per second. Thus even under optimal circumstances, the throughput is only /spl Theta/(W//spl radic/n) bits per second for each node for a destination nonvanishingly far away. Similar results also hold under an alternate physical model where a required signal-to-interference ratio is specified for successful receptions. Fundamentally, it is the need for every node all over the domain to share whatever portion of the channel it is utilizing with nodes in its local neighborhood that is the reason for the constriction in capacity. Splitting the channel into several subchannels does not change any of the results. Some implications may be worth considering by designers. Since the throughput furnished to each user diminishes to zero as the number of users is increased, perhaps networks connecting smaller numbers of users, or featuring connections mostly with nearby neighbors, may be more likely to be find acceptance.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.825799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825799","","Information rates","","6228","87","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved.

For extended sites, the system will require multiple cameras. Thus, key elements of the system are motion tracking, camera coordination, activity classification, and event detection. In this paper, we focus on motion tracking and show how one can use observed motion to learn patterns of activity in a site. Motion segmentation is based on an adaptive background subtraction method that models each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and uses an online approximation to update the model. The Gaussian distributions are then evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background process. This yields a stable, real-time outdoor tracker that reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and long-term scene changes. While a tracking system is unaware of the identity of any object it tracks, the identity remains the same for the entire tracking sequence. Our system leverages this information by accumulating joint co-occurrences of the representations within a sequence. These joint co-occurrence statistics are then used to create a hierarchical binary-tree classification of the representations. This method is useful for classifying sequences, as well as individual instances of activities in a site.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.868677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868677","","Tracking;Cameras;Monitoring;Event detection;Motion segmentation;Computer vision;Gaussian approximation;Gaussian distribution;Layout;Statistics","","2485","181","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem of localization, that is, determining where a given node is physically located in a network, is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimental results show that the accuracy for 90 percent of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However, future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments.","1558-0652","","10.1109/98.878533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878533","","Global Positioning System;Timing;Time measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Mobile robots;Receivers;Instruments;Monitoring;Soil;Costs","","2373","47","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model.

A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples.","","0-7803-5800-7","10.1109/ASSPCC.2000.882463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=882463","","Nonlinear systems;Random variables;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Filters;Sampling methods;Taylor series;Computational complexity;Performance gain;Machine learning;Neural networks","","2110","19","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there is a limitation of this approach imposed by its information representation model and the computation methods used when fusion processes are performed on linguistic values. This limitation is the loss of information; this loss of information implies a lack of precision in the final results from the fusion of linguistic information. In this paper, we present tools for overcoming this limitation. The linguistic information is expressed by means of 2-tuples, which are composed of a linguistic term and a numeric value assessed in (-0.5, 0.5). This model allows a continuous representation of the linguistic information on its domain, therefore, it can represent any counting of information obtained in a aggregation process. We then develop a computational technique for computing with words without any loss of information. Finally, different classical aggregation operators are extended to deal with the 2-tuple linguistic model.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.890332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=890332","","Information representation;Computational modeling;Decision making","","2068","","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The threshold is derived in a Bayesian framework, and the prior used on the wavelet coefficients is the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) widely used in image processing applications. The proposed threshold is simple and closed-form, and it is adaptive to each subband because it depends on data-driven estimates of the parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method, called BayesShrink, is typically within 5% of the MSE of the best soft-thresholding benchmark with the image assumed known. It also outperforms SureShrink (Donoho and Johnstone 1994, 1995; Donoho 1995) most of the time. The second part of the paper attempts to further validate claims that lossy compression can be used for denoising. The BayesShrink threshold can aid in the parameter selection of a coder designed with the intention of denoising, and thus achieving simultaneous denoising and compression. Specifically, the zero-zone in the quantization step of compression is analogous to the threshold value in the thresholding function. The remaining coder design parameters are chosen based on a criterion derived from Rissanen's minimum description length (MDL) principle. Experiments show that this compression method does indeed remove noise significantly, especially for large noise power. However, it introduces quantization noise and should be used only if bitrate were an additional concern to denoising.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.862633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862633","","Image denoising;Image coding;Noise reduction;Quantization;Bayesian methods;Wavelet coefficients;Gaussian distribution;Image processing;Parameter estimation;Bit rate","","2039","44","36","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The trees each explore space around them and also advance towards each other through, the use of a simple greedy heuristic. Although originally designed to plan motions for a human arm (modeled as a 7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 3D, and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3D workspace.

A plot of the operating characteristic shows that the authors' method reduces false positives by as much as 15 times over basic thresholding of a matched filter response (MFR), at up to a 75% true positive rate.

Pioneering studies showed that if the fades connecting pairs of transmit and receive antenna elements are independently, identically distributed, MEAs offer a large increase in capacity compared to single-antenna systems. An MEA system can be described in terms of spatial eigenmodes, which are single-input single-output subchannels. The channel capacity of an MEA is the sum of capacities of these subchannels. We show that the fading correlation affects the MEA capacity by modifying the distributions of the gains of these subchannels. The fading correlation depends on the physical parameters of MEA and the scatterer characteristics. In this paper, to characterize the fading correlation, we employ an abstract model, which is appropriate for modeling narrow-band Rayleigh fading in fixed wireless systems.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.837052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=837052","","Fading;Transmitting antennas;Rayleigh channels;Transmitters;Channel capacity;Receiving antennas;Scattering;Gallium nitride;Antennas and propagation;Joining processes","","1849","74","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An analysis of the existing work is also proposed to support this idea. A comprehensive study is given of the synthesis of differentiators with integer, noninteger, real or complex orders, and whose action is limited to any given frequency bandwidth. First, a definition, in the operational and frequency domains, of a frequency-band complex noninteger order differentiator, is given in a mathematical space with four dimensions which is a Banach algebra. Then, the determination of its synthesized form, by a recursive distribution of complex zeros and poles characterized by complex recursive factors, is presented. The complex noninteger differentiation order is expressed as a function of these recursive factors. The number of zeros and poles is calculated to be as low as possible while still ensuring the stability of the synthesized differentiator to be synthesized. A time validation is presented.

Some of the pitfalls of naive penalty methods are discussed in these terms. The new ranking method is tested using a (/spl mu/, /spl lambda/) evolution strategy on 13 benchmark problems.

But this usually implies that one has to sacrifice functionality for security. For example, if a client wishes to retrieve only documents containing certain words, it was not previously known how to let the data storage server perform the search and answer the query, without loss of data confidentiality. We describe our cryptographic schemes for the problem of searching on encrypted data and provide proofs of security for the resulting crypto systems. Our techniques have a number of crucial advantages. They are provably secure: they provide provable secrecy for encryption, in the sense that the untrusted server cannot learn anything about the plaintext when only given the ciphertext; they provide query isolation for searches, meaning that the untrusted server cannot learn anything more about the plaintext than the search result; they provide controlled searching, so that the untrusted server cannot search for an arbitrary word without the user's authorization; they also support hidden queries, so that the user may ask the untrusted server to search for a secret word without revealing the word to the server. The algorithms presented are simple, fast (for a document of length n, the encryption and search algorithms only need O(n) stream cipher and block cipher operations), and introduce almost no space and communication overhead, and hence are practical to use today.","1081-6011","0-7695-0665-8","10.1109/SECPRI.2000.848445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848445","","Cryptography;File servers;Data security;Memory;Electronic mail;Data privacy;Authorization;US Government agencies;Contracts;Postal services","","1246","59","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By combining simplicity with the compression potential of context models, the algorithm ""enjoys the best of both worlds."" It is based on a simple fixed context model, which approaches the capability of the more complex universal techniques for capturing high-order dependencies. The model is tuned for efficient performance in conjunction with an extended family of Golomb (1966) type codes, which are adaptively chosen, and an embedded alphabet extension for coding of low-entropy image regions. LOCO-I attains compression ratios similar or superior to those obtained with state-of-the-art schemes based on arithmetic coding.

By investigating these different problem features separately, it is possible to predict the kind of problems to which a certain technique is or is not well suited. However, in contrast to what was suspected beforehand, the experimental results indicate a hierarchy of the algorithms under consideration.

Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented which quickly identify all the long frequent itemsets and their subsets if required.

As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. In addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. Wattch is 1000X or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. It also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar SimpleScalar framework.","1063-6897","1-58113-232-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=854380","","Energy consumption;Power dissipation;Microprocessors;Circuits;Process design;Portable computers;Cooling;Permission;Accuracy;Embedded computing","","1105","40","32","","2 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Architecture description languages (ADLs) have been proposed as modeling notations to support architecture-based development. There is, however, little consensus in the research community on what is an ADL, what aspects of an architecture should be modeled in an ADL, and which of several possible ADLs is best suited for a particular problem. Furthermore, the distinction is rarely made between ADLs on one hand and formal specification, module interconnection, simulation and programming languages on the other. This paper attempts to provide an answer to these questions. It motivates and presents a definition and a classification framework for ADLs. The utility of the definition is demonstrated by using it to differentiate ADLs from other modeling notations. The framework is used to classify and compare several existing ADLs, enabling us, in the process, to identify key properties of ADLs. The comparison highlights areas where existing ADLs provide extensive support and those in which they are deficient, suggesting a research agenda for the future.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.825767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825767","","Software architecture;Computer architecture;LAN interconnection;Architecture description languages;Application software;Formal specifications;Computer languages;Connectors;Computer science;Computer Society","","1081","14","74","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless it is not widely deployed due to the overhead of existing protocols. In this paper we demonstrate the benefits of cache sharing, measure the overhead of the existing protocols, and propose a new protocol called ""summary cache"". In this new protocol, each proxy keeps a summary of the cache directory of each participating proxy, and checks these summaries for potential hits before sending any queries. Two factors contribute to our protocol's low overhead: the summaries are updated only periodically, and the directory representations are very economical, as low as 8 bits per entry. Using trace-driven simulations and a prototype implementation, we show that, compared to existing protocols such as the Internet cache protocol (ICP), summary cache reduces the number of intercache protocol messages by a factor of 25 to 60, reduces the bandwidth consumption by over 50%, eliminates 30% to 95% of the protocol CPU overhead, all while maintaining almost the same cache hit ratios as ICP. Hence summary cache scales to a large number of proxies.

To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper, the authors propose two automatic techniques (based on the Bayes theory) for the analysis of the difference image. One allows an automatic selection of the decision threshold that minimizes the overall change detection error probability under the assumption that pixels in the difference image are independent of one another. The other analyzes the difference image by considering the spatial-contextual information included in the neighborhood of each pixel. In particular, an approach based on Markov Random Fields (MRFs) that exploits interpixel class dependency contexts is presented. Both proposed techniques require the knowledge of the statistical distributions of the changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image. To perform an unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms that characterize these distributions, they propose an iterative method based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.843009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=843009","","Image analysis;Pixel;Remote monitoring;Multispectral imaging;Image generation;Error probability;Information analysis;Markov random fields;Statistical distributions;Iterative methods","","1010","3","38","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Sampling-50 years after Shannon","M. Unser","Biomedical Imaging Group, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",Proceedings of the IEEE,"6 Aug 2002","2000","88","4","569","587","This paper presents an account of the current state of sampling, 50 years after Shannon's formulation of the sampling theorem. The emphasis is on regular sampling, where the grid is uniform. This topic has benefitted from a strong research revival during the past few years, thanks in part to the mathematical connections that were made with wavelet theory. To introduce the reader to the modern, Hilbert-space formulation, we reinterpret Shannon's sampling procedure as an orthogonal projection onto the subspace of band-limited functions. We then extend the standard sampling paradigm for a presentation of functions in the more general class of ""shift-in-variant"" function spaces, including splines and wavelets. Practically, this allows for simpler-and possibly more realistic-interpolation models, which can be used in conjunction with a much wider class of (anti-aliasing) prefilters that are not necessarily ideal low-pass. We summarize and discuss the results available for the determination of the approximation error and of the sampling rate when the input of the system is essentially arbitrary; e.g., nonbandlimited. We also review variations of sampling that can be understood from the same unifying perspective. These include wavelets, multiwavelets, Papoulis generalized sampling, finite elements, and frames. Irregular sampling and radial basis functions are briefly mentioned.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.843002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=843002","","Sampling methods;Signal sampling;Frequency;Image reconstruction;Approximation error;Finite element methods;Hilbert space;Interpolation;Least squares approximation;Information theory","","1006","28","136","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lossless and lossy compression, embedded lossy to lossless coding, progressive transmission by pixel accuracy and by resolution, robustness to the presence of bit-errors and region-of-interest coding, are some representative features.

The device is fabricated in a silicon wafer using a double-sided KOH wet-etching technique to realize a three-dimensional channel geometry. Experiments using phenolphthalein and sodium hydroxide solutions demonstrate the ability of flow in this channel to mix faster and more uniformly than either pure molecular diffusion or flow in a ""square-wave"" channel for Reynolds numbers from 6 to 70. The mixing capability of the channel increases with increasing Reynolds number. At least 98% of the maximum intensity of reacted phenolphthalein is observed in the channel after five mixing segments for Reynolds numbers greater than 25. At a Reynolds number of 70, the serpentine channel produces 16 times more reacted phenolphthalein than a straight channel and 1.6 times more than the square-wave channel. Mixing rates in the serpentine channel at the higher Reynolds numbers are consistent with the occurrence of chaotic advection. Visualization of the interface formed in the channel between streams of water and ethyl alcohol indicates that the mixing is due to both diffusion and fluid stirring.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.846699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846699","","Microchannel;Chaos;Biochemistry;Chemicals;Silicon;Geometry;Visualization;Biochemical analysis;Drug delivery;Biological processes","","978","65","29","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we focus on the efficiency of the IEEE 802.11 standard for WLANs. Specifically, we analytically derive the average size of the contention window that maximizes the throughput, hereafter theoretical throughput limit, and we show that: 1) depending on the network configuration, the standard can operate very far from the theoretical throughput limit; and 2) an appropriate tuning of the backoff algorithm can drive the IEEE 802.11 protocol close to the theoretical throughput limit. Hence we propose a distributed algorithm that enables each station to tune its backoff algorithm at run-time. The performances of the IEEE 802.11 protocol, enhanced with our algorithm, are extensively investigated by simulation.

Optics may relieve a broad range of design problems, such as crosstalk, voltage isolation, wave reflection, impedence matching, and pin inductance. It may allow continued scaling of existing architectures and enable novel highly interconnected or high-bandwidth architectures. No physical breakthrough is required to implement dense optical interconnects to silicon chips, though substantial technological work remains. Cost is a significant barrier to practical introduction, though revolutionary approaches exist that might achieve economies of scale.

We establish novel results about the dynamics of stable nonlinear oscillators in the presence of perturbations, both deterministic and random. We obtain an exact nonlinear equation for phase error, which we solve without approximations for random perturbations. This leads us to a precise characterization of timing jitter and spectral dispersion, for computing of which we have developed efficient numerical methods. We demonstrate our techniques on a variety of practical electrical oscillators and obtain good matches with measurements, even at frequencies close to the carrier, where previous techniques break down.

The system utilizes the fact that the rare events in the oddball paradigm elicit the P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP). The BCI presents the user with a matrix of 6 by 6 cells, each containing one letter of the alphabet. The user focuses attention on the cell containing the letter to be communicated while the rows and the columns of the matrix are intensified. Each intensification is an event in the oddball sequence, the row and the column containing the attended cell are ""rare"" items and, therefore, only these events elicit a P300. The computer thus detects the transmitted character by determining which row and which column elicited the P300. The authors report an assessment, using a bootstrapping approach, which indicates that an off line version of the system can communicate at the rate of 7.8 characters a minute and achieve 80% accuracy. The system's performance in real time was also assessed. The authors' data indicate that a P300-based BCI is feasible and practical.

The master for each layer is formed on a silicon wafer using an epoxy-based photoresist (SU 8). PDMS is cast against the master producing molded layers containing channels and openings. To realize thin layers with openings, a sandwich molding configuration was developed that allows precise control of the PDMS thickness. The master wafer is clamped within a sandwich that includes flat aluminum plates, a flexible polyester film layer, a rigid Pyrex wafer, and a rubber sheet. A parametric study is performed on PDMS surface activation in a reactive-ion-etching system and the subsequent methanol treatment for bonding and aligning very thin individual components to a substrate. Low RF power and short treatment times are better than high RF power and long treatment times, respectively, for instant bonding. Layer-to-layer alignment of less then 15 /spl mu/m is achieved with manual alignment techniques that utilize surface tension driven self-alignment methods.

Unlike the models of Lakshman and Madhow (see IEE/ACM Trans. Networking, vol.5, p.336-50, 1997), Mahdavi and Floyd (1997), Mathis, Semke, Mahdavi and Ott (see Comput. Commun.

Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more time-out events than fast retransmit events. Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP send rate and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates.

Thus, the method can be used as a preliminary classifier if desired. Computational complexity is order N, where N is the number of complex baseband data samples.

HE is a useful technique for improving image contrast, but its effect is too severe for many purposes. However, dramatically different results can be obtained with relatively minor modifications. A concise description of adaptive HE is set out, and this framework is used in a discussion of past suggestions for variations on HE. A key feature of this formalism is a ""cumulation function,"" which is used to generate a grey level mapping from the local histogram. By choosing alternative forms of cumulation function one can achieve a wide variety of effects. A specific form is proposed.

This paper outlines an algorithm suitable for this task that makes use of kernel-based BRDF models. Intrinsic land surface albedos are derived, which may be used to derive actual albedo by taking into account the prevailing distribution of diffuse skylight. Spectral-to-broadband conversion is achieved using band-dependent weighting factors. The validation of a suitable BRDF model, the semiempirical Ross-Li (reciprocal RossThick-LiSparse) model and its performance under conditions of sparse angular sampling and noisy reflectances are discussed, showing that the retrievals obtained are generally reliable. The solar-zenith angle dependence of albedo may be parameterized by a simple polynomial that makes it unnecessary for the user to be familiar with the underlying BRDF model. The algorithm given is that used for the production of a BRDF/albedo standard data product from NASA's EOS-MODIS sensor, for which an at-launch status is provided. Finally, the algorithm is demonstrated on combined AVHRR and GOES observations acquired over New England, from which solar zenith angle-dependent albedo maps with a nominal spatial resolution of 1 km are derived in the visible band. The algorithm presented may be employed to derive albedo from space-based multiangular measurements and also serves as a guide for the use of the MODIS BRDF/albedo product.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.841980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841980","","Atmospheric modeling;Reflectivity;Bidirectional control;Distribution functions;Land surface;Sampling methods;Polynomials;Production;Spatial resolution;MODIS","","845","","90","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although it is possible in this way to find a three-dimensional (3D) surface representation, the distribution of the different scatterers in the height direction at a fixed range and azimuth position remains unknown. Contrary to this, tomographic techniques enable a real geometric resolution capability in the height direction and introduce new possibilities for many applications and inversion problems. Even misinterpretations in SAR images caused by layover and foreshortening effects can be solved by the tomographic processing. In this paper, the successful experimental realization of polarimetric airborne SAR tomography is demonstrated for the first time. The authors present the concept of aperture synthesis for tomographic imaging for the case of a multibaseline imaging geometry and discuss the constraints arising from the limited number of flight tracks. They propose a method for reduction of the height ambiguities associated to the irregular and undersampled spatial distribution of the imaging positions. Finally, they address the experimental requirements for polarimetric airborne SAR tomography and show experimental results using a multibaseline data set acquired in L-band by DLR's experimental SAR (E-SAR) of a test-site near Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.868873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868873","","Tomography;Synthetic aperture radar;Interferometry;Phase estimation;Surface topography;Radar scattering;Azimuth;Geometry;Radar tracking;L-band","","822","3","36","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are two major shortcomings of the traditional approaches to fingerprint representation. For a considerable fraction of population, the representations based on explicit detection of complete ridge structures in the fingerprint are difficult to extract automatically. The widely used minutiae-based representation does not utilize a significant component of the rich discriminatory information available in the fingerprints. Local ridge structures cannot be completely characterized by minutiae. Further, minutiae-based matching has difficulty in quickly matching two fingerprint images containing a different number of unregistered minutiae points. The proposed filter-based algorithm uses a bank of Gabor filters to capture both local and global details in a fingerprint as a compact fixed length FingerCode. The fingerprint matching is based on the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding FingerCodes and hence is extremely fast. We are able to achieve a verification accuracy which is only marginally inferior to the best results of minutiae-based algorithms published in the open literature. Our system performs better than a state-of-the-art minutiae-based system when the performance requirement of the application system does not demand a very low false acceptance rate. Finally, we show that the matching performance can be improved by combining the decisions of the matchers based on complementary (minutiae-based and filter-based) fingerprint information.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.841531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841531","","Matched filters;Fingerprint recognition;Biometrics;Gabor filters;Image matching;Information filtering;Information filters;Licenses;Intelligent robots;Societies","","803","17","33","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While many applications require long-term monitoring of the deployment area, the battery-powered network nodes limit the lifetime of UWA networks. In addition, shallow-water acoustic channel characteristics, such as low available bandwidth, highly varying multipath, and large propagation delays, restrict the efficiency of UWA networks. Within such an environment, designing an UWA network that maximizes throughput and reliability while minimizing the power consumption becomes a very difficult task.

This modulation is ideally suited for Rayleigh fast-fading environments, since it does not require the receiver to know or learn the propagation coefficients. Unitary space-time modulation uses constellations of T/spl times/M space-time signals (/spl Phi//sub i/, l=1, ..., L), where T represents the coherence interval during which the fading is approximately constant, and M<T is the number of transmitter antennas. The columns of each /spl Phi//sub i/ are orthonormal. When the receiver does not know the propagation coefficients, which between pairs of transmitter and receiver antennas are modeled as statistically independent, this modulation performs very well either when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high or when T/spl Gt/M. We design some multiple-antenna signal constellations and simulate their effectiveness as measured by bit-error probability with maximum-likelihood decoding. We demonstrate that two antennas have a 6-dB diversity gain over one antenna at 15-dB SNR.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.825818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825818","","Receiving antennas","","774","46","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model is based on a bistatic radar equation derived using the geometric optics limit of the Kirchhoff approximation. The waveform (i.e., the time-delayed power obtained in the delay-mapping technique) depends on a wave-slope probability density function, which in turn depends on wind. Waveforms obtained for aircraft altitudes and velocities indicate that altitudes within the interval 5-15 km are the best for inferring wind speed. In some regimes, an analytical solution for the bistatic radar equation is possible. This solution allows converting trailing edges of waveforms into a set of straight lines, which could be convenient for wind retrieval. A transition to satellite altitudes, together with satellite velocities, makes the peak power reduction and the Doppler spreading effect a significant problem for wind retrieval based on the delay-mapping technique. At the same time, different time delays and different Doppler shifts of the scattered GPS signal could form relatively small spatial cells on sea surface, suggesting mapping of the wave-slope probability distribution in a synthetic-aperture-radar (SAR) fashion. This may allow more accurate measurements of wind velocity and wind direction.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.841977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841977","","Global Positioning System;Oceans;Remote sensing;Optical scattering;Radar scattering;Wind speed;Solid modeling;Power system modeling;Bistatic radar;Equations","","758","1","34","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus far, most work on space-time coding has assumed that perfect channel estimates are available at the receiver. In certain situations, however, it may be difficult or costly to estimate the channel accurately, in which case it is natural to consider the design of modulation techniques that do not require channel estimates at the transmitter or receiver. We propose a general approach to differential modulation for multiple transmit antennas based on group codes. This approach ran be applied to any number of transmit and receive antennas, and any signal constellation. We also derive low-complexity differential receivers, error bounds, and modulator design criteria, which we use to construct optimal differential modulation schemes for two transmit antennas. These schemes can be demodulated with or without channel estimates. This permits the receiver to exploit channel estimates when they are available. The performance degrades by approximately 3 dB when estimates are not available.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.887864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887864","","Modulation","","730","11","39","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then introduce key graphs to specify secure groups. For a special class of key graphs, we present three strategies for securely distributing rekey messages after a join/leave and specify protocols for joining and leaving a secure group. The rekeying strategies and join/leave protocols are implemented in a prototype key server we have built. We present measurement results from experiments and discuss performance comparisons. We show that our group key management service, using any of the three rekeying strategies, is scalable to large groups with frequent joins and leaves. In particular, the average measured processing time per join/leave increases linearly with the logarithm of group size.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.836475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836475","","Unicast;File servers;Authentication;Access protocols;Teleconferencing;Collaboration;Scalability;Prototypes;Particle measurements;Size measurement","","719","39","28","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While maintaining a globally cylindrical shape, the McKibben muscle produces a contraction force decreasing with its contraction ratio, as does skeletal muscle. The maximum force-to-weight ratio can be surprisingly high for a limited radial dimension and for a conventional pressure range. A 50 g McKibben muscle can easily develop more than 1000 N under 5 bar pressure for an external radius varying from about 1.5 to 3 cm. Thus, robotics specialists are interested in this well-adapted artificial muscle for motorizing powerful yet compact robot arms. The basic McKibben muscle static modeling developed in the paper, which is based on the three main parameters (i.e., initial braid angle, initial muscle length, and initial muscle radius) and includes a three-parameter friction model of the thread against itself, has shown its efficiency in both isometric and isotonic contraction.","1941-000X","","10.1109/37.833638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=833638","","Muscles;Actuators;Service robots;Orthotics;Weaving;Pressure control;Valves;Fasteners;Defense industry;Rubber industry","","708","5","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In such exposition, a critical evaluation of what in the author's view are the leading ideas and emerging trends is privileged with respect to exhaustiveness of citations. The survey is focused mainly on three types of functional requirements a machine hand can be assigned in an artificial system, namely, manipulative dexterity, grasp robustness, and human operability. A basic distinction is made between hands designed for mimicking the human anatomy and physiology,and hands designed to meet restricted, practical requirements. In the latter domain, arguments are presented in favor of a -minimalistic"" attitude in the design of hands for practical applications, i.e., use the least number of actuators, the simplest set of sensors, etc., for a given task.

Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. The authors have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a may that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.836373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836373","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Standardization;Protocols;Body regions;Humans;Image segmentation;X-ray imaging;Computed tomography;Data mining;Displays","Algorithms;Brain;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Multiple Sclerosis","694","1","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important issue is the choice of adequate basis functions. The authors show that, contrary to the common belief, those that perform best are not interpolating. By opposition to traditional interpolation, the authors call their use generalized interpolation; they involve a prefiltering step when correctly applied. The authors explain why the approximation order inherent in any basis function is important to limit interpolation artifacts. The decomposition theorem states that any basis function endowed with approximation order ran be expressed as the convolution of a B spline of the same order with another function that has none. This motivates the use of splines and spline-based functions as a tunable way to keep artifacts in check without any significant cost penalty.

Part of the difficulty is that device noise undergoes multiple frequency translations to become oscillator phase noise. A quantitative understanding of this process requires abandoning the principle of time invariance assumed in most older theories of phase noise. Fortunately, the noise-to-phase transfer function of oscillators is still linear, despite the existence of the nonlinearities necessary for amplitude stabilization. In addition to providing a quantitative reconciliation between theory and measurement, the time-varying phase noise model presented in this tutorial identifies the importance of symmetry in suppressing the upconversion of 1/f noise into close-in phase noise, and provides an explicit appreciation of cyclostationary effects and AM-PM conversion. These insights allow a reinterpretation of why the Colpitts oscillator exhibits good performance, and suggest new oscillator topologies. Tuned LC and ring oscillator circuit examples are presented to reinforce the theoretical considerations developed. Simulation issues and the accommodation of amplitude noise are considered in appendixes.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.826814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826814","","Tutorial;Oscillators;Phase noise;Noise level;Circuit noise;Frequency;Transfer functions;Noise measurement;Phase measurement;Circuit topology","","672","8","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The time evolution of these PDEs seeks to minimize a cost functional which is an increasing function of the absolute value of the Laplacian of the image intensity function. Since the Laplacian of an image at a pixel is zero if the image is planar in its neighborhood, these PDEs attempt to remove noise and preserve edges by approximating an observed image with a piecewise planar image. Piecewise planar images look more natural than step images which anisotropic diffusion (second order PDEs) uses to approximate an observed image. So the proposed PDEs are able to avoid the blocky effects widely seen in images processed by anisotropic diffusion, while achieving the degree of noise removal and edge preservation comparable to anisotropic diffusion. Although both approaches seem to be comparable in removing speckles in the observed images, speckles are more visible in images processed by the proposed PDEs, because piecewise planar images are less likely to mask speckles than step images and anisotropic diffusion tends to generate multiple false edges. Speckles can be easily removed by simple algorithms such as the one presented in this paper.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.869184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869184","","Partial differential equations;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Boundary conditions;Laplace equations;Cost function;Pixel;Smoothing methods;Image enhancement;Image analysis;Level set","","666","","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The assumptions are that the channel model is quasi-static and that the base station has perfect channel information. In traditional TDMA or FDMA systems, resource allocation for each user is non-adaptively fixed, and the water-filling power spectrum is known to be optimal. Since the subchannel allocations among the users are not optimized, a group of users is likely to suffer from poor channel gains resulting from large path loss and random fading. To resolve this problem, we derive a multiuser convex optimization problem to find the optimal allocation of subchannels, and propose a low-complexity adaptive subchannel allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs almost as well as the optimal solution. Also, a higher spectral efficiency is achieved for a larger number of users in a cell due to the multiuser diversity.","1090-3038","0-7803-5718-3","10.1109/VETECS.2000.851292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=851292","","OFDM;Time division multiple access;Resource management;Fading;Frequency division multiaccess;Radio spectrum management;Frequency conversion;Throughput;Channel capacity;Maximum likelihood decoding","","665","48","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present some important concepts for system design that are likely to provide at least some of the gains in productivity postulated above. In particular, we focus on a method that separates parts of the design process and makes them nearly independent so that complexity could be mastered. In this domain, architecture-function co-design and communication-based design are introduced and motivated. Platforms are essential elements of this design paradigm. We define system platforms and we argue about their use and relevance. Then we present an application of the design methodology to the design of wireless systems.

The selection and quality of the features representing each pattern affect the success of subsequent classification. Feature extraction is the process of deriving new features from original features to reduce the cost of feature measurement, increase classifier efficiency, and allow higher accuracy. Many feature extraction techniques involve linear transformations of the original pattern vectors to new vectors of lower dimensionality. While this is useful for data visualization and classification efficiency, it does not necessarily reduce the number of features to be measured since each new feature may be a linear combination of all of the features in the original pattern vector. Here, we present a new approach to feature extraction in which feature selection and extraction and classifier training are performed simultaneously using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm optimizes a feature weight vector used to scale the individual features in the original pattern vectors. A masking vector is also employed for simultaneous selection of a feature subset. We employ this technique in combination with the k nearest neighbor classification rule, and compare the results with classical feature selection and extraction techniques, including sequential floating forward feature selection, and linear discriminant analysis.

Much of the literature has focused on developing the best uniform threshold or best basis selection. However, not much has been done to make the threshold values adaptive to the spatially changing statistics of images. Such adaptivity can improve the wavelet thresholding performance because it allows additional local information of the image (such as the identification of smooth or edge regions) to be incorporated into the algorithm. This work proposes a spatially adaptive wavelet thresholding method based on context modeling, a common technique used in image compression to adapt the coder to changing image characteristics. Each wavelet coefficient is modeled as a random variable of a generalized Gaussian distribution with an unknown parameter. Context modeling is used to estimate the parameter for each coefficient, which is then used to adapt the thresholding strategy. This spatially adaptive thresholding is extended to the overcomplete wavelet expansion, which yields better results than the orthogonal transform. Experimental results show that spatially adaptive wavelet thresholding yields significantly superior image quality and lower MSE than the best uniform thresholding with the original image assumed known.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.862630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862630","","Context modeling;Noise reduction;Statistics;Image coding;Wavelet coefficients;Random variables;Gaussian distribution;Parameter estimation;Wavelet transforms;Image quality","","628","14","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such accuracy is not easily attained due to various error sources that can affect the image formation process. Current calibration methods typically assume that the observations are unbiased, the only error is the zero-mean independent and identically distributed random noise in the observed image coordinates, and the camera model completely explains the mapping between the 3D coordinates and the image coordinates. In general, these conditions are not met, causing the calibration results to be less accurate than expected. In the paper, a calibration procedure for precise 3D computer vision applications is described. It introduces bias correction for circular control points and a nonrecursive method for reversing the distortion model. The accuracy analysis is presented and the error sources that can reduce the theoretical accuracy are discussed. The tests with synthetic images indicate improvements in the calibration results in limited error conditions. In real images, the suppression of external error sources becomes a prerequisite for successful calibration.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.879788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879788","","Cameras;Calibration","","623","15","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the psychovisual effects of frequency distortion and noise injection are independent, we decouple these two sources of degradation and measure their effect on the human visual system. We develop a distortion measure (DM) of the effect of frequency distortion, and a noise quality measure (NQM) of the effect of additive noise. The NQM, which is based on Peli's (1990) contrast pyramid, takes into account the following: 1) variation in contrast sensitivity with distance, image dimensions, and spatial frequency; 2) variation in the local luminance mean; 3) contrast interaction between spatial frequencies; 4) contrast masking effects. For additive noise, we demonstrate that the nonlinear NQM is a better measure of visual quality than peak signal-to noise ratio (PSNR) and linear quality measures. We compute the DM in three steps. First, we find the frequency distortion in the degraded image. Second, we compute the deviation of this frequency distortion from an allpass response of unity gain (no distortion). Finally, we weight the deviation by a model of the frequency response of the human visual system and integrate over the visible frequencies.

The rationale for pursuing electromagnetic methods is strong given the data in the literature, which show that the electromagnetic properties of breast malignancy are significantly different than normal in the high megahertz to low gigahertz spectral range, microwave illumination can effectively penetrate the breast at these frequencies, and the breast is a small readily accessible tissue volume, making it an ideal site for deploying advanced near-field imaging concepts that exploit model-based image reconstruction methodology. In this paper a clinical prototype of a microwave imaging system, which actively illuminates the breast with a 16-element transceiving monopole antenna array in the 300-1000 MHz range, is reported. Microwave exams have been delivered to five women through a water-coupled interface to the pendant breast with the participant positioned prone on an examination table. This configuration has been found to be a practical, comfortable approach to microwave breast imaging. Sessions lasted 10-15 min per breast and included full tomographic data acquisition at seven different array heights beginning at the chest wall and moving anteriorly toward the nipple for seven different frequencies at each array position. This clinical experience appears to be the first report of active near-field microwave imaging of the breast and is certainly the first attempt to exploit model-based image reconstructions from in vivo breast data in order to convert the measured microwave signals into spatial maps of electrical permittivity and conductivity. While clearly preliminary, the results are encouraging and have supplied some interesting findings. Specifically, it appears that the average relative permittivity of the breast as a whole correlates with radiologic breast density categorization and may be considerably higher than previously published values, which have been based on ex vivo tissue specimens.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.883861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883861","","Prototypes;Microwave imaging;Breast;Frequency;Image reconstruction;Microwave antenna arrays;Permittivity;Optical imaging;Character recognition;X-ray detection","","595","10","54","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many problems arising in motor operations are linked to bearing faults. In many cases, the accuracy of the instruments and devices used to monitor and control the motor system is highly dependent on the dynamic performance of the motor bearings. Thus, fault diagnosis of a motor system is inseparably related to the diagnosis of the bearing assembly. In this paper, bearing vibration frequency features are discussed for motor bearing fault diagnosis. This paper then presents an approach for motor rolling bearing fault diagnosis using neural networks and time/frequency-domain bearing vibration analysis.

All are pragmatic solutions implemented in advance of complete theoretical understanding. Each has strengths and flaws, and there are some surprising inter-relationships. Each maintains power system security but differs in its impact on the economics of the energy market. No clearly superior method has so far emerged.

Traffic flow is routed along shortest paths, splitting flow at nodes where several outgoing links are on shortest paths to the destination. The weights of the links, and thereby the shortest path routes, can be changed by the network operator. The weights could be set proportional to their physical distances, but often the main goal is to avoid congestion, i.e., overloading of links, and the standard heuristic recommended by Cisco is to make the weight of a link inversely proportional to its capacity. Our starting point was a proposed AT&T WorldNet backbone with demands projected from previous measurements. The desire was to optimize the weight setting based on the projected demands. We showed that optimizing the weight settings for a given set of demands is NP-hard, so we resorted to a local search heuristic. Surprisingly it turned out that for the proposed AT&T WorldNet backbone, we found weight settings that performed within a few percent from that of the optimal general routing where the flow for each demand is optimally distributed over all paths between source and destination. This contrasts the common belief that OSPF routing leads to congestion and it shows that for the network and demand matrix studied we cannot get a substantially better load balancing by switching to the proposed more flexible multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) technologies. Our techniques were also tested on synthetic internetworks, based on a model of Zegura et al., (1996), for which we did not always get quite as close to the optimal general routing.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832225","","Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Spine;Multiprotocol label switching;Throughput;Traffic control;Laboratories;Routing protocols;Load management;Testing","","584","37","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Changing cross correlations at multiple times give a sufficient set of constraints for the unknown channels. A least squares optimization allows us to estimate a forward model, identifying thus the multipath channel. In the same manner we can find an FIR backward model, which generates well separated model sources. Furthermore, for more than three channels we have sufficient conditions to estimate underlying additive sensor noise powers.

The authors derived the maximum-likelihood estimator of the feedback gain and applied it to quantify sleep depth. The estimator computes the fraction (0%-100%) of the current slow wave which continues in the near future (0.02 s later) EEG. Therefore, this percentage was dubbed slow-wave microconfinuity (SW%). It is not affected by anatomical parameters such as skull thickness, which can considerably bias the commonly used slow-wave power (SWP). In the authors' study, both of the estimators SW% and SWP were monitored throughout two nights in 22 subjects. Each subject took temazepam (a benzodiazepine) on one of the two nights, Both estimators detected the effects of age, temazepam, and time of night on sleep. Females were found to have twice the SWP of males, but no gender effect on SW% was found. This confirms earlier reports that gender affects SWP but not sleep depth. Subjectively assessed differences in sleep quality between the nights were correlated to differences in SW%, not in SWP. These results demonstrate that slow-wave microcontinuity, being based on a physiological model of sleep, reflects sleep depth more closely than SWP does.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.867928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867928","","Feedback loop;Electroencephalography;Neurofeedback;Hospitals;Biomedical measurements;Power measurement;Frequency measurement;Maximum likelihood detection;Maximum likelihood estimation;Skull","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Biomedical Engineering;Electroencephalography;Feedback;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Neurological;Neurons;Sleep","572","","31","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

New power converter topologies permit modular realization of multilevel inverters using a hybrid approach involving integrated gate commutated thyristors (IGCTs) and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) operating in synergism. This paper investigates a hybrid multilevel power conversion system typically suitable for high-performance high-power applications. This system, designed for a 4.16 kV/spl ges/100 hp load is comprised of a hybrid seven-level inverter, a diode bridge rectifier, and an IGBT rectifier per phase. The IGBT rectifier is used on the utility side as a real power flow regulator to the low-voltage converter and as a harmonic compensator for the high-voltage converter. The hybrid seven-level inverter on the load side consists of a high-voltage slow-switching IGCT inverter and a low-voltage fast-switching IGBT inverter. By employing different devices under different operating conditions, it is shown that one can optimize the power conversion capability of the entire system. A detailed analysis of a novel hybrid modulation technique for the inverter, which incorporates stepped synthesis in conjunction with variable pulsewidth of the consecutive steps is included. In addition, performance of a multilevel current-regulated delta modulator as applied to the single-phase full-bridge IGBT rectifier is discussed.

This paper reports on measurements of the mechanical quality factor Q for arrays of silicon-nitride, polysilicon, and single-crystal silicon cantilevers. By studying the dependence of Q on cantilever material, geometry, and surface treatments, significant insight into dissipation mechanisms has been obtained. For submicron-thick cantilevers, Q is found to decrease with decreasing cantilever thickness, indicating surface loss mechanisms. For single-crystal silicon cantilevers, significant increase in room temperature Q is obtained after 700/spl deg/C heat treatment in either N/sub 2/ Or forming gas.

We show that interesting classes of hybrid systems can be abstracted to purely discrete systems while preserving all properties that are definable in temporal logic. The classes that permit discrete abstractions fall into two categories. Either the continuous dynamics must be restricted, as is the case for timed and rectangular hybrid systems, or the discrete dynamics must be restricted, as is the case for o-minimal hybrid systems.

The two chambers of a single-rod actuator have different areas, so the dynamic equations describing the pressure changes in them cannot be combined into a single load pressure equation. This complicates controller design since it not only increases the system dimension but also brings in the stability issue of the added internal dynamics. A discontinuous projection-based adaptive robust controller (ARC) is constructed. The controller takes into account not only the effect of parameter variations coming from the inertia load and various hydraulic parameters but also the effect of hard-to-model nonlinearities such as uncompensated friction forces and external disturbances. It guarantees a prescribed output tracking transient performance and final tracking accuracy in general while achieving asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties. In addition, the zero error dynamics for tracking any nonzero constant velocity trajectory is shown to be globally uniformly stable. Experimental results are obtained for the swing motion control of a hydraulic arm and verify the high-performance nature of the proposed strategy. In comparison to a state-of-the-art industrial motion controller, the proposed algorithm achieves more than a magnitude reduction of tracking errors. Furthermore, during the constant velocity portion of the motion, it reduces the tracking errors almost down to the measurement resolution level.","1941-014X","","10.1109/3516.828592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=828592","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Robust control;Motion control;Hydraulic actuators;Differential equations;Tracking;Control systems;Stability;Nonlinear dynamical systems","","549","","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed decentralized overlapping control law is obtained by using the inclusion principle, i.e., by decomposing the original system model by an appropriate input/state expansion, and by applying the linear quadratic (LQ) optimization to the locally extracted subsystems. The local quadratic criteria directly reflect the desired system performance. Optimization is carried out by using a sequential algorithm adapted to the lower block triangular (LBT) structure of the closed-loop system model. Contraction to the original space provides a decentralized platoon controller which preserves the asymptotic stability and the steady-state behavior of the controller obtained in the expanded space. Conditions for eliminating the ""slinky effect"" and obtaining the strict string stability are defined; it is shown that the corresponding constraints on the controller parameters are not too restrictive. A new dynamic platoon controller structure, consisting of a reduced order observer and a static feedback map, is obtained by applying the inclusion principle to the decentralized overlapping platoon control design in the case when the information from the preceding vehicle is missing. Numerous simulation results show that the proposed methodology provides a reliable tool for a systematic and efficient design of platoon controllers within IVHS.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.865854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=865854","","Control design;Automotive engineering;Road vehicles;Intelligent vehicles;Road transportation;System performance;Asymptotic stability;Steady-state;Vehicle dynamics;Feedback","","539","1","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first consider the centralized problem and then show that this procedure can be decentralized so that greedy optimization by users yields the system optimal bandwidth allocations. We propose a distributed algorithm for implementing the optimal and fair bandwidth allocation and provide conditions for its convergence.

In this paper, a newer notion, that of integral input-to-state stability (iISS), is studied.

This work proposes an algorithm to optimally estimate the overall distortion of decoder frame reconstruction due to quantization, error propagation, and error concealment. The method recursively computes the total decoder distortion at pixel level precision to accurately account for spatial and temporal error propagation. The accuracy of the estimate is demonstrated via simulation results. The estimate is integrated into a rate-distortion (RD)-based framework for optimal switching between intra-coding and inter-coding modes per macroblock. The cost in computational complexity is modest. The framework is further extended to optimally exploit feedback/acknowledgment information from the receiver/network. Simulation results both with and without a feedback channel demonstrate that precise distortion estimation enables the coder to achieve substantial and consistent gains in PSNR over known state-of-the-art RD- and non-RD-based mode switching methods.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.848250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848250","","Video coding;Packet switching;Decoding;Computational modeling;Resilience;Propagation losses;Degradation;Quantization;Rate-distortion;Computational efficiency","","525","48","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rule generation from artificial neural networks is gaining in popularity in recent times due to its capability of providing some insight to the user about the symbolic knowledge embedded within the network. Fuzzy sets are an aid in providing this information in a more human comprehensible or natural form, and can handle uncertainties at various levels. The neuro-fuzzy approach, symbiotically combining the merits of connectionist and fuzzy approaches, constitutes a key component of soft computing at this stage. To date, there has been no detailed and integrated categorization of the various neuro-fuzzy models used for rule generation. We propose to bring these together under a unified soft computing framework. Moreover, we include both rule extraction and rule refinement in the broader perspective of rule generation. Rules learned and generated for fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy control are also considered from this wider viewpoint. Models are grouped on the basis of their level of neuro-fuzzy synthesis. Use of other soft computing tools like genetic algorithms and rough sets are emphasized. Rule generation from fuzzy knowledge-based networks, which initially encode some crude domain knowledge, are found to result in more refined rules. Finally, real-life application to medical diagnosis is provided.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.846746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846746","","Artificial neural networks;Fuzzy sets;Humans;Uncertainty;Symbiosis;Fuzzy reasoning;Fuzzy control;Network synthesis;Genetic algorithms;Rough sets","","524","2","149","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Emerging digital audio applications for network, wireless, and multimedia computing systems face a series of constraints such as reduced channel bandwidth, limited storage capacity, and low cost. These new applications have created a demand for high-quality digital audio delivery at low bit rates. In response to this need, considerable research has been devoted to the development of algorithms for perceptually transparent coding of high-fidelity (CD-quality) digital audio. As a result, many algorithms have been proposed, and several have now become international and/or commercial product standards. This paper reviews algorithms for perceptually transparent coding of CD-quality digital audio, including both research and standardization activities. This paper is organized as follows. First, psychoacoustic principles are described, with the MPEG psychoacoustic signal analysis model 1 discussed in some detail. Next, filter bank design issues and algorithms are addressed, with a particular emphasis placed on the modified discrete cosine transform, a perfect reconstruction cosine-modulated filter bank that has become of central importance in perceptual audio coding. Then, we review methodologies that achieve perceptually transparent coding of FM- and CD-quality audio signals, including algorithms that manipulate transform components, subband signal decompositions, sinusoidal signal components, and linear prediction parameters, as well as hybrid algorithms that make use of more than one signal model. These discussions concentrate on architectures and applications of those techniques that utilize psychoacoustic models to exploit efficiently masking characteristics of the human receiver. Several algorithms that have become international and/or commercial standards receive in-depth treatment, including the ISO/IEC MPEG family (-1, -2, -4), the Lucent Technologies PAC/EPAC/MPAC, the Dolby AC-2/AC-3, and the Sony ATRAC/SDDS algorithms. Then, we describe subjective evaluation methodologies in some detail, including the ITU-R BS.1116 recommendation on subjective measurements of small impairments.

The signals can achieve low probability of error by exploiting multiple-antenna diversity. Because the fading coefficients are not known, the criterion for creating and evaluating the constellation is nonstandard and differs markedly from the familiar maximum-Euclidean-distance norm. Our construction begins with the first signal in the constellation-an oblong complex-valued matrix whose columns are orthonormal-and systematically produces the remaining signals by successively rotating this signal in a high-dimensional complex space. This construction easily produces large constellations of high-dimensional signals. We demonstrate its efficacy through examples involving one, two, and three transmitter antennas.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.868472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868472","","Signal synthesis","","517","46","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The original service model was designed without a clear understanding of commercial requirements or a robust implementation strategy. The very limited number of applications and the complexity of the architectural design-which we believe is a consequence of the open service model-have deterred widespread deployment as well. We examine the issues that have limited the commercial deployment of IP multicast from the viewpoint of carriers. We analyze where the model fails and what it does not offer, and we discuss requirements for successful deployment of multicast services.","1558-156X","","10.1109/65.819174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=819174","","Web and internet services;Authorization;Multicast protocols;Robustness;Failure analysis;Operating systems;Data security;Protection;Scalability;Commercialization","","515","4","43","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The overall theme of the algorithm, called Lazy PRM, is to minimize the number of collision checks performed during planning and hence minimize the running time of the planner. Our algorithm builds a roadmap in the configuration space, whose nodes are the user-defined initial and goal configurations and a number of randomly generated nodes. Neighboring nodes are connected by edges representing paths between the nodes. In contrast with PRMs, our planner initially assumes that all nodes and edges in the roadmap are collision-free, and searches the roadmap at hand for a shortest path between the initial and the goal node. The nodes and edges along the path are then checked for collision. If a collision with the obstacles occurs, the corresponding nodes and edges are removed from the roadmap. Our planner either finds a new shortest path, or first updates the roadmap with new nodes and edges, and then searches for a shortest path. The above process is repeated until a collision-free path is returned. Lazy PRM is tailored to efficiently answer single planning queries, but can also be used for multiple queries. Experimental results presented in the paper show that our lazy method is very efficient in practice.","1050-4729","0-7803-5886-4","10.1109/ROBOT.2000.844107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844107","","Path planning;Road accidents;Orbital robotics;Mathematics;Random number generation;Joining processes;Manufacturing automation;Manufacturing processes;Mobile robots;Animation","","513","16","29","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transition between these two regimes is accomplished without a switching function. The model incorporates a hysteresis function with nonlocal memory and arbitrary transition curves. These last aspects prove essential for modeling presliding friction that is encountered in real physical situations. The model as a whole can also handle the Stribeck effect and stick-slip behavior as has been demonstrated by validation on a KUKA IR 361 robot. In this sense, this model can be considered as more complete in comparison with others found in the literature. The general friction model allows modeling of individual friction systems through the identification of a set of parameters that determine the complete behavior of the system. In this way, the model structure has been used to identify the friction behavior of a linear slide as well as that of the above mentioned KUKA robot. The results of the latter identification have been consequently used for feedforward friction compensation to obtain the most accurate tracking.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.847103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847103","","Friction;Surface topography;Control systems;Velocity control;Lubricants;Predictive models;Surface texture;Hysteresis;Robot sensing systems;Mechatronics","","507","2","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For flexibility purposes, the original image is not necessary during the ownership verification process, so it must be modeled by noise. Two tests are involved in the ownership verification stage: watermark decoding, in which the message carried by the watermark is extracted, and watermark detection, which decides whether a given image contains a watermark generated with a certain key. We apply generalized Gaussian distributions to statistically model the DCT coefficients of the original image and show how the resulting detector structures lead to considerable improvements in performance with respect to the correlation receiver, which has been widely considered in the literature and makes use of the Gaussian noise assumption. As a result of our work, analytical expressions for performance measures, such as the probability of errors in watermark decoding and the probabilities of false alarms and of detection in watermark detection, are derived and contrasted with experimental results.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.817598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817598","","Watermarking;Discrete cosine transforms;Detectors;Decoding;Copyright protection;Digital images;Image analysis;Testing;Data mining;Gaussian distribution","","507","1","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Address-events (log/sub 2/(N)-bit packets that uniquely identify one of N neurons) are used to transmit these pulses in real time on a random-access time-multiplexed communication channel. Activity is assumed to consist of neuronal ensembles-spikes clustered in space and in time. This paper quantifies tradeoffs faced in allocating bandwidth, granting access, and queuing, as well as throughput requirements, and concludes that an arbitered channel design is the best choice. The arbitered channel is implemented with a formal design methodology for asynchronous digital VLSI CMOS systems, after introducing the reader to this top-down synthesis technique. Following the evolution of three generations of designs, it is shown how the overhead of arbitrating, and encoding and decoding, can be reduced in area (from N to /spl radic/N) by organizing neurons into rows and columns, and reduced in time (from log/sub 2/(N) to 2) by exploiting locality in the arbiter tree and in the row-column architecture, and clustered activity. Throughput is boosted by pipelining and by reading spikes in parallel. Simple techniques that reduce crosstalk in these mixed analog-digital systems are described.","1558-125X","","10.1109/82.842110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842110","","Neuromorphics;Neurons;Throughput;Timing;Communication channels;Bandwidth;Design methodology;Very large scale integration;Decoding;Organizing","","499","28","59","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An electromechanical piezo model, based on physical principles, is presented in this paper. In this model, a first-order differential equation is adopted to describe the hysteresis effect, and a partial differential equation is used to describe the mechanical behavior. Since, in practice, a PEA is most often used as an actuator for positioning mechanisms, we considered the influence of such a mechanism on the overall mechanical behavior of PEA and positioning mechanism together. For a well-designed mechanism, the overall mechanical behavior practically equals that of a single mass-spring-damper system, of which the undamped eigenfrequency and the relative damping can be designed favorably. With respect to traditional voltage steering, charge steering has the advantage that no hysteresis is encountered between electrical input and elongation. Electrical steering configurations for both cases of steering are presented. Finally, for the case of charge steering, we derived the total model of a piezo-actuated positioning mechanism. This model is dominated by the mechanical model, which could be designed favorably. Therefore, this model gives a broad range of possibilities for model-based controller design.","1941-014X","","10.1109/3516.891044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891044","","Piezoelectric actuators;Hysteresis;Control systems;Voltage;Information technology;Differential equations;Partial differential equations;Damping;Distributed parameter systems","","494","","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike the conventional ADI algorithms, however, the alternation is performed in respect to mixed coordinates rather than to each respective coordinate direction, Consequently, only two alternations in solution marching are required in the 3-D formulations. Theoretical proof of the unconditional stability is shown and numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.

Information is generated in certain nodes and needs to reach a set of designated gateway nodes. Each node may adjust its power within a certain range that determines the set of possible one hop away neighbors. Traffic forwarding through multiple hops is employed when the intended destination is not within immediate reach. The nodes have limited initial amounts of energy that is consumed at different rates depending on the power level and the intended receiver. We propose algorithms to select the routes and the corresponding power levels such that the time until the batteries of the nodes drain-out is maximized. The algorithms are local and amenable to distributed implementation. When there is a single power level, the problem is reduced to a maximum flow problem with node capacities and the algorithms converge to the optimal solution. When there are multiple power levels then the achievable lifetime is close to the optimal (that is computed by linear programming) most of the time. It turns out that in order to maximize the lifetime, the traffic should be routed such that the energy consumption is balanced among the nodes in proportion to their energy reserves, instead of routing to minimize the absolute consumed power.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832170","","Routing;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Wireless sensor networks;Educational institutions;Spine;Sensor systems;Relays;Energy states;Laboratories","","482","5","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each node is at most d hops from a clusterhead. Clusterheads form a virtual backbone and may be used to route packets for nodes in their cluster. Previous heuristics restricted themselves to 1-hop clusters. We show that the minimum d-hop dominating set problem is NP-complete. Then we present a heuristic to form d-clusters in a wireless ad hoc network. Nodes are assumed to have a non-deterministic mobility pattern. Clusters are formed by diffusing node identities along the wireless links. When the heuristic terminates, a node either becomes a clusterhead, or is at most d wireless hops away from its clusterhead. The value of d is a parameter of the heuristic. The heuristic can be run either at regular intervals, or whenever the network configuration changes. One of the features of the heuristic is that it tends to re-elect existing clusterheads even when the network configuration changes. This helps to reduce the communication overheads during transition from old clusterheads to new clusterheads. Also, there is a tendency to evenly distribute the mobile nodes among the clusterheads, and evently distribute the responsibility of acting as clusterheads among all nodes. Thus, the heuristic is fair and stable. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic is better than the two earlier heuristics, namely the LCA and degree-based solutions.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832171","","Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Routing;Ambient intelligence;Packet radio networks;Spine;Bones;Concurrent computing;Multiaccess communication;Spread spectrum communication","","478","2","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We define code to be aged or decayed if its structure makes it unnecessarily difficult to understand or change and we measure the extent of decay by counting the number of faults in code in a period of time. Using change management data from a very large, long-lived software system, we explore the extent to which measurements from the change history are successful in predicting the distribution over modules of these incidences of faults. In general, process measures based on the change history are more useful in predicting fault rates than product metrics of the code: For instance, the number of times code has been changed is a better indication of how many faults it will contain than is its length. We also compare the fault rates of code of various ages, finding that if a module is, on the average, a year older than an otherwise similar module, the older module will have roughly a third fewer faults. Our most successful model measures the fault potential of a module as the sum of contributions from all of the times the module has been changed, with large, recent changes receiving the most weight.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.859533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=859533","","History;Predictive models;Software systems;Aging;Time measurement;Software measurement;Length measurement;Software development management;Statistical analysis;Degradation","","476","13","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dipolar orientation and trapped charge are two mechanisms contributing to the pyro-, piezo-, and ferroelectricity of polymers. Since the 1950s, shear piezoelectricity was investigated in polymers of biological origin (such as cellulose and collagen) as well as synthetic optically active polymers (such as polyamides and polylactic acids). Since the discovery of piezoelectricity in poled polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in 1969, the pyro-, piezo-, and ferroelectricity were widely investigated in a number of polar polymers, such as copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene, copolymers of vinylcyanide and vinylacetate, and nylons. Recent studies involve submicron films of aromatic and aliphatic polyureas prepared by vapor deposition polymerization in vacuum and the piezoelectricity of polyurethane produced by the coupling of electrostriction and bias electric fields. Gramophone pickups using a piece of bone or tendon were demonstrated in 1959. Microphones using a stretched film of polymethyl glutamate were reported in 1968. Ultrasonic transducers using elongated and poled films of PVDF were demonstrated in 1972. Headphones and tweeters using PVDF were marketed in 1975. Hydrophones and various electromechanical devices utilizing PVDP and its copolymers have been developed during the past 30 years.

Its potential for ultrahigh storage density has been demonstrated by a new thermomechanical local-probe technique to store and read back data in very thin polymer films. With this new technique, 30–40-nm-sized bit indentations of similar pitch size have been made by a single cantilever/tip in a thin (50-nm) polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) layer, resulting in a data storage density of 400–500 Gb/in.2 High data rates are achieved by parallel operation of large two-dimensional (2D) AFM arrays that have been batch-fabricated by silicon surface-micromachining techniques. The very large scale integration (VLSI) of micro/nanomechanical devices (cantilevers/tips) on a single chip leads to the largest and densest 2D array of 32 × 32 (1024) AFM cantilevers with integrated write/read storage functionality ever built. Time-multiplexed electronics control the write/read storage cycles for parallel operation of the Millipede array chip. Initial areal densities of 100–200 Gb/in.2 have been achieved with the 32 × 32 array chip, which has potential for further improvements.

Third, streamed media distribution can have high packet loss. Finally the system needs to be efficient to support fast packet rates. We propose two efficient schemes, TESLA and EMSS, for secure lossy multicast streams. TESLA (Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication), offers sender authentication, strong loss robustness, high scalability and minimal overhead at the cost of loose initial time synchronization and slightly delayed authentication.

This situation raises the question of how to perform power control for information sources other than voice. To explore this issue, we use the concepts and mathematics of microeconomics and game theory. In this context, the quality of service of a telephone call is referred to as the ""utility"" and the distributed power control problem for a CDMA telephone is a ""noncooperative game."" The power control algorithm corresponds to a strategy that has a locally optimum operating point referred to as a ""Nash equilibrium."" The telephone power control algorithm is also ""Pareto efficient,"" in the terminology of game theory. When we apply the same approach to power control in wireless data transmissions, we find that the corresponding strategy, while locally optimum, is not Pareto efficient. Relative to the telephone algorithm, there are other algorithms that produce higher utility for at least one terminal, without decreasing the utility for any other terminal. This article presents one such algorithm. The algorithm includes a price function proportional to transmitter power. When terminals adjust their power levels to maximize the net utility (utility-price), they arrive at lower power levels and higher utility than they achieve when they individually strive to maximize utility.","1558-0652","","10.1109/98.839331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839331","","Power control;Telephony;Game theory;Cellular phones;Multimedia communication;Multimedia systems;Mobile communication;Mathematics;Microeconomics;Context-aware services","","467","1","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints: either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast, we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually.

The proposed PARAFAC receiver capitalizes on code, spatial, and temporal diversity-combining, thereby supporting small sample sizes, more users than sensors, and/or less spreading than users. Interestingly, PARAFAC does not require knowledge of spreading codes, the specifics of multipath (interchip interference), DOA-calibration information, finite alphabet/constant modulus, or statistical independence/whiteness to recover the information-bearing signals. Instead, PARAFAC relies on a fundamental result regarding the uniqueness of low-rank three-way array decomposition due to Kruskal (1977, 1988) (and generalized herein to the complex-valued case) that guarantees identifiability of all relevant signals and propagation parameters.

However, any outdoor vision system is incomplete without mechanisms that guarantee satisfactory performance under poor weather conditions. It is known that the atmosphere can significantly alter light energy reaching an observer. Therefore, atmospheric scattering models must be used to make vision systems robust in bad weather. In this paper, we develop a geometric framework for analyzing the chromatic effects of atmospheric scattering. First, we study a simple color model for atmospheric scattering and verify it for fog and haze. Then, based on the physics of scattering, we derive several geometric constraints on scene color changes, caused by varying atmospheric conditions. Finally, using these constraints we develop algorithms for computing fog or haze color depth segmentation, extracting three dimensional structure, and recovering ""true"" scene colors, from two or more images taken under different but unknown weather conditions.","1063-6919","0-7695-0662-3","10.1109/CVPR.2000.855874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855874","","Layout;Light scattering;Optical scattering;Particle scattering;Atmospheric modeling;Machine vision;Atmosphere;Atmospheric waves;Physics;Computer vision","","447","7","12","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its primary advantage over tile original implementation is that it is a much faster calculation, currently requiring less than 30 sec execution time per bed position for an adult thorax, thus making clinical whole-body scatter correction more practical. The new code runs on a single processor workstation CPU instead of a vector processor array, making it highly portable. It is modular and independent of any particular reconstruction code. The computed scatter contribution is now intrinsically scaled relative to the emission image and no longer requires normalization to the scatter tails in the sinogram when all activity is contained within the field of view, making it more robust against noise. The new algorithm has been verified against the original code on both phantom and human thorax studies. Initial results indicate that scatter correction may be accurately performed following, instead of prior to, either 3D reprojection or Fourier rebinning. Some evidence is presented that the single-scatter operator, when applied to an uncorrected emission image provides reasonable compensation for multiple scatter.","1558-1578","","10.1109/23.873020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=873020","","Scattering;Positron emission tomography;Whole-body PET;Workstations;Vector processors;Image reconstruction;Noise robustness","","445","15","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key limiting physical factor is the superparamagnetic effect (thermal stability) in the recording medium. Ambient thermal energy can cause the magnetic signals to decay. The requirement for thermal stability over periods of years dictates a lower limit to the size of magnetic grains (switching units) in the recording medium. To achieve the highest areal densities, it will be necessary to use a magnetic recording configuration capable of writing and storing data on very small magnetic grains together with a signal processing system capable of recovering data reliably when each bit is recorded on very few such grains. In addition to these physical effects, there are a number of practical engineering factors that must be considered: tolerances on the head geometry, reliability of head-disk interface, track-following accuracy. In an example system, we use a perpendicular recording configuration since it appears to offer some advantage in terms of maximizing the number of stable magnetic grains per unit area. The readback signals are processed by equalization to a simple binary eye followed by soft detection of a low-rate simple parity check code. The example system approaches a density of 1 Terabit per square inch and allows 3 dB of margin against thermal decay, adjacent track interference, etc.","1941-0069","","10.1109/20.824422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824422","","Magnetic recording;Perpendicular magnetic recording;Thermal stability;Signal processing;Limiting;Thermal factors;Magnetic switching;Writing;Reliability engineering;Magnetic heads","","444","10","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experimental results showed at least a 5 log/sub 10/ CFU reduction in bacteria within a range of 50-90 s of exposure. After 10-25 s of exposure, macromolecular leakage and bacterial fragmentation were observed. Vulnerability of cell membranes to reactive oxygen species (ROC) is hypothesized. Results from several novel OAUGDP configurations are presented, including a remote exposure reactor (RER) which uses transported active species to sterilize material located more than 20 cm from the plasma generation site, and a second planar electrode configuration developed for air filter sterilization.

They tested a range of basic software engineering hypotheses relating to: the Pareto principle of distribution of faults and failures; the use of early fault data to predict later fault and failure data; metrics for fault prediction; and benchmarking fault data. For example, we found strong evidence that a small number of modules contain most of the faults discovered in prerelease testing and that a very small number of modules contain most of the faults discovered in operation. We found no evidence to support previous claims relating module size to fault density nor did we find evidence that popular complexity metrics are good predictors of either fault-prone or failure-prone modules. We confirmed that the number of faults discovered in prerelease testing is an order of magnitude greater than the number discovered in 12 months of operational use. The most important result was strong evidence of a counter-intuitive relationship between pre- and postrelease faults; those modules which are the most fault-prone prerelease are among the least fault-prone postrelease, while conversely, the modules which are most fault-prone postrelease are among the least fault-prone prerelease. This observation has serious ramifications for the commonly used fault density measure.

(1+1)-PAES is intended to be a baseline approach against which more involved methods may be compared. It may also serve well in some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or competitive with population-based methods. We introduce (1+λ) and (μ+λ) variants of PAES as extensions to the basic algorithm. Six variants of PAES are compared to variants of the Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm and the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm over a diverse suite of six test functions. Results are analyzed and presented using techniques that reduce the attainment surfaces generated from several optimization runs into a set of univariate distributions. This allows standard statistical analysis to be carried out for comparative purposes.

Many solutions that recover 3D shape from 2D image sequences have been proposed; these so-called structure-from-motion techniques usually assume that the 3D object is rigid. For example, C. Tomasi and T. Kanades' (1992) factorization technique is based on a rigid shape matrix, which produces a tracking matrix of rank 3 under orthographic projection. We propose a novel technique based on a non-rigid model, where the 3D shape in each frame is a linear combination of a set of basis shapes. Under this model, the tracking matrix is of higher rank, and can be factored in a three-step process to yield pose, configuration and shape. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model free approach that can recover from single-view video sequences nonrigid shape models.

The PicHunter project makes four primary contributions to research on CBIR. First, PicHunter represents a simple instance of a general Bayesian framework which we describe for using relevance feedback to direct a search. With an explicit model of what users would do, given the target image they want, PicHunter uses Bayes's rule to predict the target they want, given their actions. This is done via a probability distribution over possible image targets, rather than by refining a query. Second, an entropy-minimizing display algorithm is described that attempts to maximize the information obtained from a user at each iteration of the search. Third, PicHunter makes use of hidden annotation rather than a possibly inaccurate/inconsistent annotation structure that the user must learn and make queries in. Finally, PicHunter introduces two experimental paradigms to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the system, and psychophysical experiments are presented that support the theoretical claims.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.817596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817596","","Bayesian methods;Image retrieval;Psychology;Feedback;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Prototypes;Predictive models","","438","18","82","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, a hyperspectral image pixel is actually a column vector with dimension equal to the number of spectral bands and contains valuable spectral information that can be used to account for pixel variability, similarity and discrimination. We present a new hyperspectral measure, the spectral information measure (SIM), to describe spectral variability and two criteria, spectral information divergence and spectral discriminatory probability for spectral similarity and discrimination, respectively. The spectral information measure is an information-theoretic measure which treats each pixel as a random variable using its spectral signature histogram as the desired probability distribution. Spectral information divergence (SID) compares the similarity between two pixels by measuring the probabilistic discrepancy between two corresponding spectral signatures. The spectral discriminatory probability calculates spectral probabilities of a spectral database (library) relative to a pixel to be identified so as to achieve material identification. In order to compare the discriminatory power of one spectral measure relative to another, a criterion is also introduced for performance evaluation, which is based on the power of discriminating one pixel from another relative to a reference pixel. The experimental results demonstrate that the new hyperspectral measure can characterize spectral variability more effectively than the commonly used spectral angle mapper (SAM).","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.857802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=857802","","Image processing","","433","5","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, Fourier analysis provided a poor representation of signals well localized in time. In this case, it is difficult to detect and identify the signal pattern from the expansion coefficients because the information is diluted across the whole basis. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) is introduced as an alternative means of extracting time-frequency information from vibration signatures. The resulting WPT coefficients provide one with arbitrary time-frequency resolution of a signal. With the aid of statistical-based feature selection criteria, many of the feature components containing little discriminant information could be discarded, resulting in a feature subset having a reduced number of parameters without compromising the classification performance. The extracted reduced dimensional feature vector is then used as input to a neural network classifier. This significantly reduces the long training time that is often associated with the neural network classifier and improves its generalization capability.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.847906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847906","","Wavelet packets;Feature extraction;Signal analysis;Data mining;Time frequency analysis;Neural networks;Condition monitoring;Time domain analysis;Frequency domain analysis;Signal processing","","433","","26","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We devise a data structure whose space occupancy is a function of the entropy of the underlying data set. We call the data structure opportunistic since its space occupancy is decreased when the input is compressible and this space reduction is achieved at no significant slowdown in the query performance. More precisely, its space occupancy is optimal in an information-content sense because text T[1,u] is stored using O(H/sub k/(T))+o(1) bits per input symbol in the worst case, where H/sub k/(T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T (the bound holds for any fixed k). Given an arbitrary string P[1,p], the opportunistic data structure allows to search for the occurrences of P in T in O(p+occlog/sup /spl epsiv//u) time (for any fixed /spl epsiv/>0). If data are uncompressible we achieve the best space bound currently known (Grossi and Vitter, 2000); on compressible data our solution improves the succinct suffix array of (Grossi and Vitter, 2000) and the classical suffix tree and suffix array data structures either in space or in query time or both. We also study our opportunistic data structure in a dynamic setting and devise a variant achieving effective search and update time bounds. Finally, we show how to plug our opportunistic data structure into the Glimpse tool (Manber and Wu, 1994). The result is an indexing tool which achieves sublinear space and sublinear query time complexity.","0272-5428","0-7695-0850-2","10.1109/SFCS.2000.892127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892127","","Data structures;Indexing;Entropy;Costs;Tree data structures;Plugs;Computer science;Fault tolerance;Postal services;Data engineering","","432","12","28","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We found TPB was useful in explaining e-commerce service acceptance, however, acceptance motivations were significantly different from that of typical IS products. Based on a broader conceptualization of TPB's subjective norm to include both external (mass-media) and interpersonal influences, we report that subjective norm is an important predictor of e-commerce acceptance, behavioral control has minimal impact on e-commerce acceptance, and external influence is a significant determinant of subjective norm.

In this environment, as the resources are usually distributed geographically at various levels (department, enterprise or worldwide), there is a great challenge in integrating, coordinating and presenting them as a single resource to the user, thus forming a computational grid. Another challenge comes from the distributed ownership of resources, with each resource having its own access policy, cost and mechanism. The proposed Nimrod/G grid-enabled resource management and scheduling system builds on our earlier work on Nimrod (D.

Even though both generalized K distribution and homodyned K distribution can account for some of the scattering conditions that exist in tissues, the analytical complexity involved with these distributions is significant. A much simpler generalized model based on the Nakagami distribution is proposed here. This model can describe the statistics of the envelope of the backscattered echo from an ensemble of scatterers with varying number densities, varying cross sections, and the presence or absence of regularly spaced scatterers. Computer simulations and experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms have been undertaken to test the validity of the model. Results clearly show the versatility of the Nakagami distribution and its parameter to model the backscattered envelope from tissues. It is suggested that Nakagami distribution may be a good model for use in tissue characterization because of its simple analytical nature and ability to encompass different scattering conditions.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.842062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842062","","Backscatter;Rayleigh scattering;Radar scattering;Nakagami distribution;Acoustic scattering;Statistical distributions;Scattering parameters;Computer simulation;Imaging phantoms;Breast","","431","3","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A detailed simulation model with MAC and physical layer models is used to study inter-layer interactions and their performance implications. We demonstrate that even though DSR and AODV share a similar on-demand behavior the differences in the protocol mechanics can lead to significant performance differentials. The performance differentials are analyzed using varying network load, mobility and network size.

But due to the increasing levels of integration available in silicon technology and the growing requirement for digital systems to communicate with the continuous-valued external world, there is a growing need for CAD tools that increase the design productivity and improve the quality of analog integrated circuits. This paper describes the motivation and evolution of these tools and outlines progress on the various design problems involved: simulation and modeling, symbolic analysis, synthesis and optimization, layout generation, yield analysis and design centering, and test.

It is able to reduce the acoustical noise, the torque, flux, current, and speed pulsations during steady state. The DTC transient merits are preserved, while better quality steady-state performance is produced in sensorless implementation for a wide speed range. The flux and torque estimator is presented and an improved voltage-current model speed observer is introduced. The proposed control topologies, simulations, implementation data, and test results with DTC and DTC-SVM are given and discussed.

As shown in this paper, this representation can be used for a large number of processing goals such as filtering, segmentation, information retrieval and visual browsing. Furthermore, the processing of the tree representation leads to very efficient algorithms. Finally, for some applications, it may be interesting to compute the binary partition tree once and to store it for subsequent use for various applications.

Requirements engineering processes often result in goals, requirements, and assumptions about agent behavior that are too ideal; some of them are likely not to be satisfied from time to time in the running system due to unexpected agent behavior. The lack of anticipation of exceptional behaviors results in unrealistic, unachievable, and/or incomplete requirements. As a consequence, the software developed from those requirements will not be robust enough and will inevitably result in poor performance or failures, sometimes with critical consequences on the environment. This paper presents formal techniques for reasoning about obstacles to the satisfaction of goals, requirements, and assumptions elaborated in the requirements engineering process. The techniques are based on a temporal logic formalization of goals and domain properties; they are integrated into an existing method for goal-oriented requirements elaboration with the aim of deriving more realistic, complete, and robust requirements specifications. A key principle is to handle exceptions at requirements engineering time and at the goal level, so that more freedom is left for resolving them in a satisfactory way. The various techniques proposed are illustrated and assessed in the context of a real safety-critical system.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.879820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879820","","Humans;Robustness;Software systems;Software performance;Logic;Software engineering;Stress;Face;Dispatching","","419","","88","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the early days, developing CE software presented relatively minor challenges, but in the past several years three significant problems have arisen: size and complexity of the software in individual products; the increasing diversity of products and their software; and the need for decreased development time. The question of handling diversity and complexity in embedded software at an increasing production speed becomes an urgent one. The authors present their belief that the answer lies not in hiring more software engineers. They are not readily available, and even if they were, experience shows that larger projects induce larger lead times and often result in greater complexity. Instead, they believe that the answer lies in the use and reuse of software components that work within an explicit software architecture. The Koala model, a component-oriented approach detailed in this article, is their way of handling the diversity of software in consumer electronics. Used for embedded software in TV sets, it allows late binding of reusable components with no additional overhead.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.825699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825699","","Consumer electronics;Embedded software;Hardware;Application software;Software libraries;Object oriented modeling;Skeleton;Design engineering;Java;Moore's Law","","402","8","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The distortion of the image brightness values by a low-frequency bias field impedes visual inspection and segmentation. The new correction method called parametric bias field correction (PABIC) is based on a simplified model of the imaging process, a parametric model of tissue class statistics, and a polynomial model of the inhomogeneity field. The authors assume that the image is composed of pixels assigned to a small number of categories with a priori known statistics. Further they assume that the image is corrupted by noise and a low-frequency inhomogeneity field. The estimation of the parametric bias field is formulated as a nonlinear energy minimization problem using an evolution strategy (ES). The resulting bias field is independent of the image region configurations and thus overcomes limitations of methods based on homomorphic filtering. Furthermore, PABIC can correct bias distortions much larger than the image contrast. Input parameters are the intensity statistics of the classes and the degree of the polynomial function. The polynomial approach combines bias correction with histogram adjustment, making it well suited for normalizing the intensity histogram of datasets from serial studies. The authors present simulations and a quantitative validation with phantom and test images. A large number of MR image data acquired with breast, surface, and head coils, both in two dimensions and three dimensions, have been processed and demonstrate the versatility and robustness of this new bias correction scheme.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.845174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845174","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Parametric statistics;Polynomials;Image segmentation;Nonlinear distortion;Histograms;Brightness;Impedance;Inspection;Pixel","Brain;Breast;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Theoretical;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results","399","6","34","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This preconditioning method is based on first applying the loop-tree or loop-star decomposition of the currents to arrive at a Helmholtz decomposition of the unknown currents. However, the MoM matrix thus obtained still cannot be solved efficiently by iterative solvers due to the large number of iterations required. We propose a permutation of the loop-tree or loop-star currents by a connection matrix, to arrive at a current basis that yields a MoM matrix that can be solved efficiently by iterative solvers. Consequently, dramatic reduction in iteration count has been observed. The various steps can be regarded as a rearrangement of the basis functions to arrive at the MoM matrix. Therefore, they are related to the original MoM matrix by matrix transformation, where the transformation requires the inverse of the connection matrix. We have also developed a fast method to invert the connection matrix so that the complexity of the preconditioning procedure is of O(N) and, hence, can be used in fast solvers such as the low-frequency multilevel fast multipole algorithm (LP-MLFMA). This procedure also makes viable the use of fast solvers such as MLFMA to seek the iterative solutions of Maxwell's equations from zero frequency to microwave frequencies.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.899680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899680","","Integral equations;Maxwell equations;Microwave frequencies;Matrix decomposition;Moment methods;Electromagnetics;Radar antennas;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical sensors;Geometry","","399","2","29","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It covers the application of expert systems, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and fuzzy logic systems that can be integrated into each other and also with more traditional techniques. The application of genetic algorithms is considered as well. In general, a diagnostic procedure starts from a fault tree developed on the basis of the physical behavior of the electrical system under consideration. In this phase, the knowledge of well-tested models able to simulate the electrical machine in different fault conditions is fundamental to obtain the patterns characterizing the faults. The fault tree navigation performed by an expert system inference engine leads to the choice of suitable diagnostic indexes, referred to a particular fault, and relevant to build an input data set for specific AI (NNs, fuzzy logic, or neuro-fuzzy) systems. The discussed methodologies, that play a general role in the diagnostic field, are applied to an induction machine, utilizing as input signals the instantaneous voltages and currents. In addition, the supply converter is also considered to incorporate in the diagnostic procedure the most typical failures of power electronic components. A brief description of the various AI techniques is also given; this highlights the advantages and the limitations of using AI techniques.

Our algorithm is sufficiently robust to segment and track occluded vehicles at a high success rate of 93%-96%. This success has led to the development of an extendable robust event recognition system based on the hidden Markov model (HMM). The system learns various event behavior patterns of each vehicle in the HMM chains and then, using the output from the tracking system, identifies current event chains. The current system can recognize bumping, passing, and jamming.

We propose an algorithm to learn a prior on the spatial distribution of the image gradient for frontal images of faces. We proceed to show how such a prior can be incorporated into a resolution enhancement algorithm to yield 4- to 8-fold improvements in resolution (i.e., 16 to 64 times as many pixels).

The system consists of three components: a visual module; an acoustic module; and a sensor fusion module. The visual module locates and tracks the lip movements of a given speaker and extracts relevant speech features. This task is performed with an appearance-based lip model that is learned from example images. Visual speech features are represented by contour information of the lips and grey-level information of the mouth area. The acoustic module extracts noise-robust features from the audio signal. Finally the sensor fusion module is responsible for the joint temporal modeling of the acoustic and visual feature streams and is realized using multistream hidden Markov models (HMMs). The multistream method allows the definition of different temporal topologies and levels of stream integration and hence enables the modeling of temporal dependencies more accurately than traditional approaches. We present two different methods to learn the asynchrony between the two modalities and how to incorporate them in the multistream models. The superior performance for the proposed system is demonstrated on a large multispeaker database of continuously spoken digits. On a recognition task at 15 dB acoustic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), acoustic perceptual linear prediction (PLP) features lead to 56% error rate, noise robust RASTA-PLP (relative spectra) acoustic features to 7.2% error rate and combined noise robust acoustic features and visual features to 2.5% error rate.","1941-0077","","10.1109/6046.865479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=865479","","Speech recognition;Hidden Markov models;Signal to noise ratio;Acoustic noise;Noise robustness;Error analysis;Sensor fusion;Data mining;Feature extraction;Streaming media","","393","35","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the purposes of prediction however, at each time instant, the state feedback law is assumed constant. In addition, due to the large number of LMIs involved, online computation becomes intractable for anything other than small dimensional systems. Here we propose an approach that deploys a fixed state-feedback law but introduces extra degrees of freedom through the use of perturbations on the fixed state-feedback law.

As in single-robot exploration the goal is to minimize the overall exploration time. The key problem to be solved therefore is to choose appropriate target points for the individual robots so that they simultaneously explore different regions of their environment. We present a probabilistic approach for the coordination of multiple robots which, in contrast to previous approaches, simultaneously takes into account the costs of reaching a target point and the utility of target points. The utility of target points is given by the size of the unexplored area that a robot can cover with its sensors upon reaching a target position. Whenever a target point is assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored area visible from this target position is reduced for the other robots. This way, a team of multiple robots assigns different target points to the individual robots. The technique has been implemented and tested extensively in real-world experiments and simulation runs. The results given in this paper demonstrate that our coordination technique significantly reduces the exploration time compared to previous approaches.","1050-4729","0-7803-5886-4","10.1109/ROBOT.2000.844100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844100","","Collaboration;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Computer science;Costs;Mobile robots;Multirobot systems;Testing;Traveling salesman problems;Redundancy","","386","4","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The spread factor is also presented as a method of achieving hierarchical clustering of a data set with the GSOM. Such hierarchical clustering allows the data analyst to identify significant and interesting clusters at a higher level of the hierarchy, and continue with finer clustering of the interesting clusters only. Therefore, only a small map is created in the beginning with a low spread factor, which can be generated for even a very large data set. Further analysis is conducted on selected sections of the data and of smaller volume.

The head is modeled as a texture mapped cylinder. Tracking is formulated as an image registration problem in the cylinder's texture map image. The resulting dynamic texture map provides a stabilized view of the face that can be used as input to many existing 2D techniques for face recognition, facial expressions analysis, lip reading, and eye tracking. To solve the registration problem with lighting variation and head motion, the residual registration error is modeled as a linear combination of texture warping templates and orthogonal illumination templates. Fast stable online tracking is achieved via regularized weighted least-squares error minimization. The regularization tends to limit potential ambiguities that arise in the warping and illumination templates. It enables stable tracking over extended sequences. Tracking does not require a precise initial model fit; the system is initialized automatically using a simple 2D face detector. It is assumed that the target is facing the camera in the first frame. The formulation uses texture mapping hardware. The nonoptimized implementation runs at about 15 frames per second on a SGI O2 graphic workstation. Extensive experiments evaluating the effectiveness of the formulation are reported. The sensitivity of the technique to illumination, regularization parameters, errors in the initial positioning, and internal camera parameters are analyzed. Examples and applications of tracking are reported.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.845375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845375","","Lighting;Head;Target tracking;Face detection;Cameras;Image registration;Face recognition;Image texture analysis;Detectors;Hardware","","381","14","36","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conservative reordering, in which the first ready reference in a sequence is performed, improves bandwidth by 40% for traces from five media benchmarks. Aggressive reordering, in which operations are scheduled to optimize memory bandwidth, improves bandwidth by 93% for the same set of applications. Memory access scheduling is particularly important for media processors where it enables the processor to make the most efficient use of scarce memory bandwidth.","1063-6897","1-58113-232-8","10.1145/339647.339668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=854384","","Bandwidth;Processor scheduling;Random access memory;Delay;Streaming media;Out of order;Laboratories;Permission;Pipeline processing;Arithmetic","","376","14","18","","2 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) can be operated with a high collection efficiency and a low pressure drop. Recently, an ESP also has been used for cleaning indoor air. In this review, principles of electrostatic precipitation, such as particle charging, migration velocity of charged particles and collection efficiency, are described. The performance of the ESP deteriorates by abnormal phenomena, including back corona for treating high resistivity dust, abnormal re-entrainment for low resistivity dust, and corona quenching for fine dusts. To cope with these phenomena, new technologies have been developed. Pulsed energization is a technique which copes with high resistivity dusts, and this results in lower power consumption. Using pulsed energization, non-thermal plasma can be generated and chemical reactions can be promoted for treating gaseous pollutants such as NO and volatile organic compounds. Wet ESP can also remove dusts and gaseous pollutants simultaneously. These new advancements will widen the field of application of electrostatic precipitation. Some novel applications of ESP, such as removal of dioxin from incinerators, are also included in this review.","1558-4135","","10.1109/94.879357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879357","","Electrostatic precipitators;Conductivity;Corona;Pollution;Protection;Cleaning;Particle charging;Chemical technology;Energy consumption;Plasma applications","","372","1","41","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An initial fuzzy rule system is generated based on the conclusion that optimal fuzzy rules cover extrema. Redundant rules are removed based on a fuzzy similarity measure. Then, the structure and parameters of the fuzzy system are optimized using a genetic algorithm and the gradient method. During optimization, rules that have a very low firing strength are deleted. Finally, interpretability of the fuzzy system is improved by fine training the fuzzy rules with regularization. The resulting fuzzy system generated by this method has the following distinct features: (1) the fuzzy system is quite simplified; (2) the fuzzy system is interpretable; and (3) the dependencies between the inputs and the output are clearly shown.

Similarly, commonly used multilevel inverter modulation schemes generate common-mode voltages. Common-mode voltages may cause motor shaft voltages and bearing currents and conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI). Premature motor bearing failures and electronic equipment malfunctions have been reported to be directly related to bearing currents and EMI. In this paper, approaches to eliminating common-mode voltage when using multilevel PWM inverters are presented. It is shown that inverters, which have an odd number of levels, will generate zero common-mode voltage by switching among certain states. Therefore, motor bearing currents will be eliminated and conducted EMI will be reduced. Both sinusoidal PWM and space-vector modulation (SVM) schemes are discussed and detailed comparative simulation results between conventional and novel modulation schemes are provided. The value of the proposed technique is demonstrated experimentally by applying the novel SVM approach to a conventional multilevel inverter.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.887217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887217","","Voltage;Pulse width modulation inverters;Electromagnetic interference;Shafts;Stator windings;Pulse inverters;Pulse generation;Support vector machines;Electrostatics;Couplings","","371","14","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fraction of channel bandwidth used by successfully transmitted messages gives a good indication of the protocol efficiency, and its maximum value is referred to as protocol capacity. In a previous paper we have derived the theoretical limit of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol capacity. In addition, we showed that if a station has an exact knowledge of the network status, it is possible to tune its backoff algorithm to achieve a protocol capacity very close to its theoretical bound. Unfortunately, in a real case, a station does not have an exact knowledge of the network and load configurations (i.e., number of active stations and length of the message transmitted on the channel) but it can only estimate it. In this work we analytically study the performance of the IEEE 802.11 protocol with a dynamically tuned backoff based on the estimation of the network status. Results obtained indicate that under stationary traffic and network configurations (i.e., constant average message length and fixed number of active stations), the capacity of the enhanced protocol approaches the theoretical limits in all the configurations analyzed. In addition, by exploiting the analytical model, we investigate the protocol performance in transient conditions (i.e., when the number of active stations sharply changes).","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.872963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=872963","","Access protocols;Media Access Protocol;Bandwidth;Wireless LAN;Multiaccess communication;Wireless application protocol;Performance analysis;Portable computers;Wireless networks;Programmable control","","370","4","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This system operating at 1150 MHz or 450 MHz can detect the breathing and heartbeat signals of human subjects through an earthquake rubble or a construction barrier of about 10-ft thickness. The basic physical principle for the operation of a microwave life-detection system is rather simple. When a microwave beam of appropriate frequency (L or S band) is aimed at a pile of earthquake rubble covering a human subject or illuminated through a barrier obstructing a human subject, the microwave beam can penetrate the rubble or the barrier to reach the human subject. When the human subject is illuminated by a microwave beam, the reflected wave from the human subject will be modulated by tile subject's body movements, which include the breathing and the heartbeat. If the clutter consisting of the reflected wave from stationary background can be completely eliminated and the reflected wave from the human subject's body is properly modulated, the breathing and heartbeat signals of the subject can be extracted. Thus, a human subject buried under earthquake rubble or hidden behind barriers can be located. This system has been tested extensively in a simulated earthquake rubble in the laboratory and also in a field test using realistic earthquake rubble conducted by a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Task Force.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.817625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817625","","Earthquakes;Heart beat;Structural beams;System testing;Frequency;Optical modulation;Biological system modeling;Laboratories","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Equipment Design;Humans;Microwaves;Models, Theoretical;Monitoring, Physiologic;Natural Disasters;Physical Examination;Pulse;Relief Work;Respiration;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Telemetry","367","8","8","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The offset times required for class isolation when making wavelength and FDL reservations are quantified, and the upper and lower bounds on the burst loss probability are analyzed.

Input variables model both continuous and discrete control and disturbance parameters. We translate safety specifications into restrictions on the system's reachable sets of states. Then, using analysis based on optimal control and game theory for automata and continuous dynamical systems, we derive Hamilton-Jacobi equations whose solutions describe the boundaries of reachable sets. These equations are the heart of our general controller synthesis technique for hybrid systems, in which we calculate feedback control laws for the continuous and discrete variables, which guarantee that the hybrid system remains in the ""safe subset"" of the reachable set.

Faultless fabric is a repetitive and regular global texture and Fourier transforms can be applied to monitor the spatial frequency spectrum of a fabric. When a defect occurs in fabric, its regular structure is changed so that the corresponding intensity at some specific positions of the frequency spectrum would change. However, the three-dimensional frequency spectrum is very difficult to analyze. In this paper, a simulated fabric model is used to understand the relationship between the fabric structure in the image space and in the frequency space. Based on the three-dimensional frequency spectrum, two significant spectral diagrams are defined and used for analyzing the fabric defect. These two diagrams are called the central spatial frequency spectrums. The defects are broadly classified into four classes: (1) double yarn; (2) missing yarn; (3) webs or broken fabric; and (4) yarn densities variation. After evaluating these four classes of defects using some simulated models and real samples, seven characteristic parameters for a central spatial frequency spectrum are extracted for defect classification.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.871274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871274","","Fabrics;Frequency;Inspection;Monitoring;Humans;Optical filters;Fourier transforms;Textile industry;Industry Applications Society","","361","2","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a modification to the standard five element BVD model, in which a second resistor is added in series with the plate capacitance C/sub 0/. This improves the model predictions as compared to the data obtained from a network analyzer (NWA). Here, the modified model will be developed in terms of the resonant frequencies, effective coupling constant k/sub t//sup 2/, and the quality factor Q, as determined from the S parameters of an FBAR measured by the NWA. To evaluate the FBAR resonators on a routine basis, an automated data acquisition and parameter extraction method based on the Modified Butterworth-Van Dyke model (MBVD) is described. An Agilent Technologies 8753ES NWA operating under Personal Computer control is used to acquire and process FBAR data by means of a custom HPVEE/sup TM/ program, which transfers data from the NWA, and extracts the six MBVD circuit parameters. Excellent agreement is obtained between the measured data for a typical FBAR resonator and calculated ""postdictions"" obtained from the MBVD circuit. Coupled with the automated method, which takes about 10 seconds per resonator to perform a complete extraction cycle, a computer controlled probing station is used to acquire data from several hundred resonators on the wafer upon which the FBARS were fabricated. With this speed and probing capability, it is feasible to wafer map the FBARs for uniformity. Contour plots of the measured resonant frequency and coupling constant k/sub t//sup 2/ will be presented to illustrate the capability.","1051-0117","0-7803-6365-5","10.1109/ULTSYM.2000.922679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922679","","Levee;Film bulk acoustic resonators;Parameter extraction;Resonant frequency;Frequency measurement;Automatic control;Data mining;Distributed parameter circuits;Resistors;Capacitance","","358","4","12","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While hidden Markov models tend to ignore this information, recurrent neural networks (RNN) can in principle learn to make use of it. We focus on long short-term memory (LSTM) because it usually outperforms other RNN. Surprisingly, LSTM augmented by ""peephole connections"" from its internal cells to its multiplicative gates can learn the fine distinction between sequences of spikes separated by either 50 or 49 discrete time steps, without the help of any short training exemplars. Without external resets or teacher forcing or loss of performance on tasks reported earlier, our LSTM variant also learns to generate very stable sequences of highly nonlinear, precisely timed spikes. This makes LSTM a promising approach for real-world tasks that require to time and count.","1098-7576","0-7695-0619-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2000.861302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=861302","","Hidden Markov models;Recurrent neural networks;Rhythm;World Wide Web;Motor drives;Event detection;Performance loss;Humans;Pattern recognition;Delay","","357","3","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network communication, especially over a wireless network, can easily be intercepted and must be protected from eavesdroppers. Unfortunately, encryption and decryption are slow, and it is often difficult, if not impossible, to carry out real-time secure image and video communication and processing. Methods have been proposed to combine compression and encryption together to reduce the overall processing time, but they are either insecure or too computationally intensive. We propose a novel solution called partial encryption, in which a secure encryption algorithm is used to encrypt only part of the compressed data. Partial encryption is applied to several image and video compression algorithms in this paper. Only 13-27% of the output from quadtree compression algorithms is encrypted for typical images, and less than 2% is encrypted for 512/spl times/512 images compressed by the set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm. The results are similar for video compression, resulting in a significant reduction in encryption and decryption time. The proposed partial encryption schemes are fast, secure, and do not reduce the compression performance of the underlying compression algorithm.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.852023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852023","","Cryptography;Image coding;Compression algorithms;Bit rate;Wireless networks;Video compression;Hardware;Protection;Partitioning algorithms;Bandwidth","","352","78","34","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper reviews those developments and shows how demonstrated molecular devices might be combined to design molecular-scale electronic digital computer logic. The design for the demonstrated rectifying molecular diode switches is refined and made more compatible with the demonstrated wires through the introduction of intramolecular dopant groups chemically bonded to modified molecular wires. Quantum mechanical calculations are performed to characterize some of the electrical properties of the proposed molecular diode switches. Explicit structural designs are displayed for AND, OR, and XOR gates that are built from molecular wires and molecular diode switches. The diode-based molecular electronic logic gates are combined to produce a design for a molecular-scale electronic half adder and a molecular-scale electronic full adder. These designs correspond to conductive monomolecular circuit structures that would be one million times smaller in area than the corresponding micron-scale digital logic circuits fabricated on conventional solid-state semiconductor computer chips. It appears likely that these nanometer-scale molecular electronic logic circuits could be fabricated and tested in the foreseeable future. At the very least, such molecular circuit designs constitute an exploration of the ultimate limits of electronic computer circuit miniaturization.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.838115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=838115","","Computer architecture;Molecular electronics;Semiconductor diodes;Wires;Switches;Logic devices;Logic design;Adders;Logic circuits;Circuit testing","","352","14","133","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No.00CH37070),"6 Aug 2002","2000","","","1048","1058","A generalized solder joint fatigue life model for surface mount packages was previously published by the author. The model is based on correlation to measured crack growth data on BGA joints during thermal cycling. It was subsequently discovered by Anderson et. al. that the ANSYS/sup TM/ 5.2 finite element code used in the model had an error in its method for calculating plastic work. It was shown that significant error in life prediction could result by using a recent version of the code where the bug has been fixed. The error comes about since the original crack growth constants were derived based on plastic work calculations that had the bug. In this paper, crack initiation and growth constants are recalculated using ANSYS/sup TM/ 5.6. In addition, several other model related issues are explored with respect to the crack growth correlations. For example, 3D slice models were compared to quarter symmetry models. Anand's constitutive model was compared with Darveaux's constitutive model. It was shown that the crack growth rate dependence on strain energy density always had an exponent of 1.10+/-0.15. This is in the range of the original correlation, so the accuracy of relative predictions should still be within+/-25%. However, the accuracy of absolute predictions could be off by a factor of 7 in the worst case, if the analyst uses a modeling procedure that is not consistent with that used for the crack growth correlation. The key to good accuracy is to maintain consistency in the modeling procedure.","","0-7803-5908-9","10.1109/ECTC.2000.853299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=853299","","Soldering;Capacitive sensors;Fatigue;Creep;Plastics;Finite element methods;Steady-state;Packaging;Accuracy;Surface cracks","","350","","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast to the deterministic case, we allow the control and state weighting matrices in the cost functional to be indefinite. This leads to an indefinite LQ problem, which may still be well posed due to the deep nature of uncertainty involved. The problem gives rise to a stochastic algebraic Riccati equation (SARE), which is, however, fundamentally different from the classical algebraic Riccati equation as a result of the indefinite nature of the LQ problem. To analyze the SARE, we introduce linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose feasibility is shown to be equivalent to the solvability of the SARE. Moreover, we develop a computational approach to the SARE via a semi-definite programming associated with the LMIs. Finally, numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the proposed approach.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.863597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=863597","","Riccati equations;Linear matrix inequalities;Stochastic processes;Optimal control;Uncertainty;Weight control;Control systems;Stochastic resonance;Cost function;Differential algebraic equations","","349","","8","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The male sample contained 24 control subjects, 21 major depressed patients, and 22 high-risk suicidal patients.

Multivariate feature and discriminant analyses were performed on feature vectors representing the members of the control and disordered classes. Features derived from the formant and power spectral density measurements were found to be the best discriminators of class membership in both the male and female studies. AM features emerged as strong class discriminators of the male classes. Features describing F/sub 0/ were generally ineffective discriminators in both studies.

Most of the proposed training approaches are based on computational ways to efficiently obtain the gradient of the error function, and can be generally grouped into five major groups. In this study we present a derivation that unifies these approaches. We demonstrate that the approaches are only five different ways of solving a particular matrix equation. The second goal of this paper is develop a new algorithm based on the insights gained from the novel formulation. The new algorithm, which is based on approximating the error gradient, has lower computational complexity in computing the weight update than the competing techniques for most typical problems.

Because of node mobility and power limitations, the network topology changes frequently. Routing protocols therefore play an important role in mobile multihop network communications. A trend in ad hoc network routing is the reactive on-demand philosophy where routes are established only when required. Most of the protocols in this category, however, use a single route and do not utilize multiple alternate paths. We propose a scheme to improve existing on-demand routing protocols by creating a mesh and providing multiple alternate routes. Our algorithm establishes the mesh and multipaths without transmitting any extra control message.

The utility of Golay complementary sequences in solving this problem has been recognized for some time. In this paper, a powerful theory linking Golay complementary sets of polyphase sequences and Reed-Muller codes is developed. Our main result shows that any second-order coset of a q-ary generalization of the first order Reed-Muller code can be partitioned into Golay complementary sets whose size depends only on a single parameter that is easily computed from a graph associated with the coset. As a first consequence, recent results of Davis and Jedwab (see Electron. Lett., vol.33, p.267-8, 1997) on Golay pairs, as well as earlier constructions of Golay (1949, 1951, 1961), Budisin (1990) and Sivaswamy (1978) are shown to arise as special cases of a unified theory for Golay complementary sets. As a second consequence, the main result directly yields bounds on the PMEPRs of codes formed from selected cosets of the generalized first order Reed-Muller code. These codes enjoy efficient encoding, good error-correcting capability, and tightly controlled PMEPR, and significantly extend the range of coding options for applications of OFDM using small numbers of carriers.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.817512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817512","","Reed-Muller codes","","340","2","43","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This review paper gives a comprehensive survey of the present state of the measurement systems and should help a designer to find the parameters required to achieve a specified accuracy or uncertainty of measurement. Delay lines and resonators have been used, and two principles have been employed: SAW one-port devices that are directly affected by the measurand and SAW two-port devices that are electrically loaded by a conventional sensor and, therefore, indirectly affected by the measurand. For radio frequency (RF) interrogation, time domain sampling (TDS) and frequency domain sampling (FDS) have been investigated theoretically and experimentally; the methods of measurement are described. For an evaluation of the effects caused by the radio interrogation, we discuss the errors caused by noise, interference, bandwidth, manufacturing, and hardware tuning. The system parameters, distance range, and measurement uncertainty are given numerically for actual applications. Combinations of SAW sensors and special signal processing techniques to enhance accuracy, dynamic range, read out distance, and measurement repetition rate (measurement bandwidth) are presented.

To the contrary, measured data suggests realistic clutter environments appear heterogeneous and so the secondary data is no longer IID. Heterogeneity leads to mismatch between actual and estimated covariance matrices, thereby magnifying the loss between the adaptive implementation and optimum condition. Concerns regarding the impact of clutter heterogeneity on space-time adaptive processing (STAP) warrant further study. To this end, we propose space-time models of amplitude and spectral clutter heterogeneity, with operational airborne radar in mind, and then characterize expected STAP performance loss under such heterogeneous scenarios. Simulation results reveal loss in signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) ranging between a few tenths of a decibel to greater than 16 dB for specific cases.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.845251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845251","","Radar clutter;Spaceborne radar;Covariance matrix;Performance loss;Performance analysis;Airborne radar;Radar detection;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Space technology","","333","1","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that epistasis, as expressed by the dominance of the flow and distance matrices of a QAP instance, the landscape ruggedness in terms of the correlation length of a landscape, and the correlation between fitness and distance of local optima in the landscape together are useful for predicting the performance of memetic algorithms-evolutionary algorithms incorporating local search (to a certain extent).

For multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, global parameters such as the training time, network size, or the amount of weight decay are commonly used to control the bias/variance tradeoff. However, the degree of overfitting can vary significantly throughout the input space of the model. We show that overselection of the degrees of freedom for an MLP trained with backpropagation can improve the approximation in regions of underfitting, while not significantly overfitting in other regions. This can be a significant advantage over other models. Furthermore, we show that ""better"" learning algorithms such as conjugate gradient can in fact lead to worse generalization, because they can be more prone to creating varying degrees of overfitting in different regions of the input space. While experimental results can not cover all practical situations, our results do help to explain common behavior that does not agree with theoretical expectations. Our results suggest one important reason for the relative success of MLPs, bring into question common beliefs about neural network training regarding training algorithms, overfitting, and optimal network size, suggest alternate guidelines for practical use, and help to direct future work.","1098-7576","0-7695-0619-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2000.857823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=857823","","Neural networks;Backpropagation;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;National electric code;Multilayer perceptrons;Multi-layer neural network;Cost function;Polynomials;Testing","","331","1","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To produce smooth and detailed disparity maps, two assumptions that were originally proposed by Marr and Poggio (1976, 1979) are adopted: uniqueness and continuity. That is, the disparity maps have a unique value per pixel and are continuous almost everywhere. These assumptions are enforced within a three-dimensional array of match values in disparity space. Each match value corresponds to a pixel in an image and a disparity relative to another image. An iterative algorithm updates the match values by diffusing support among neighboring values and inhibiting others along similar lines of sight. By applying the uniqueness assumption, occluded regions can be explicitly identified.

These ""eigenvoice"" basis vectors are orthogonal to each other and guaranteed to represent the most important components of variation between the reference speakers. Experimental results for a small-vocabulary task (letter recognition) given in the paper show that the approach yields major improvements in performance for tiny amounts of adaptation data.

This new framework has the potential of dramatically improve the capacity and data rates. In addition, this framework presents the best trade-off between spectral efficiency and power consumption. ST codes (designed so far) come in two different types. ST trellis codes offer the maximum possible diversity gain and a coding gain without any sacrifice in the transmission bandwidth. The decoding of these codes, however, would require the use of a vector form of the Viterbi decoder. Space-time block codes (STBCs) offer a much simpler may of obtaining transmit diversity without any sacrifice in bandwidth and without requiring huge decoding complexity. In fact, the structure of the STBCs is such that it allows for very simple signal processing (linear combining) for encoding/decoding, differential encoding/detection, and interference cancellation. This new signal processing framework offered by ST codes can be used to enhance the data rate and/or capacity in various wireless applications. That is the reason many of these STC ideas have already found their way to some of the current third-generation wireless systems standards.","1558-0792","","10.1109/79.841731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841731","","Decoding;Signal processing;Bandwidth;Wireless communication;Receiving antennas;Energy consumption;Convolutional codes;Diversity methods;Vectors;Viterbi algorithm","","328","63","64","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To accomplish this goal, new pulse sequences can be developed to detect specifically the presence of a microbubble or group of microbubbles. We consider a new scheme to detect the presence of contrast agents in the body by examining the effect of transmitted phase on the received echoes from single bubbles. In this study, three tools are uniquely combined to aid in the understanding of the effects of transmission parameters and bubble radius on the received echo. These tools allow for optical measurement of radial oscillations of single bubbles during insonation, acoustical study of echoes from single contrast agent bubbles, and the comparison of these experimental observations with theoretical predictions. A modified Herring equation with shell terms is solved for the time-dependent bubble radius and wall velocity, and these outputs are used to formulate the predicted echo from a single encapsulated bubble. The model is validated by direct comparison of the predicted radial oscillations with those measured optically. The transient bubble response is evaluated with a transducer excitation consisting of one-cycle pulses with a center frequency of 2.4-MHz. The experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement and predict that the transmission of two pulses with opposite polarity will yield similar time domain echoes with the first significant portion of the echo generated when the rarefactional half-cycle reaches the bubble.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.883539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883539","","Ultrasonic imaging;Phase detection;Acoustic measurements;Equations;Predictive models;Transducers;Optical pulses;Frequency;Optical pulse generation;Pulse generation","","327","12","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Computational methods are described to combine the color and shape invariants into a unified high-dimensional invariant feature set for discriminatory object retrieval. Experiments have been conducted on a database consisting of 500 images taken from multicolored man-made objects in real world scenes. From the theoretical and experimental results it is concluded that object retrieval based on composite color and shape invariant features provides excellent retrieval accuracy. Object retrieval based on color invariants provides very high retrieval accuracy whereas object retrieval based entirely on shape invariants yields poor discriminative power. Furthermore, the image retrieval scheme is highly robust to partial occlusion, object clutter and a change in the object's pose.

It accommodates ice temperature variability through the use of radiance ratios as in the original NASA Team algorithm, and has the added advantage of providing weather-corrected sea ice concentrations through the utilization of a forward atmospheric radiative transfer model. Retrievals of sea ice concentration with this new algorithm for both the Arctic and Antarctic do not reveal the deficiencies present in either the NASA Team or Bootstrap algorithms.

For only with this insight is it possible to optimize oscillator circuits using low-quality integrated resonators to comply with the exacting phase noise specifications of modern wireless systems. In this paper we concentrate on an understanding of the popular differential LC oscillator. We introduce simple models to capture the nonlinear processes that convert voltage or current thermal noise in resistors or transistors into phase noise in the oscillator. The analysis does not require hypothetical elements, such as limiters or amplitude control loops, to fully explain phase noise. A simple expression at the end accurately specifies thermally induced phase noise, and lends substance to Leeson's original hypothesis. Next, the upconversion of flicker noise into phase noise is traced to mechanisms first identified in the 1930's, but apparently since forgotten. Unlike thermally induced phase noise, which appears as phase modulation sidebands, flicker noise is shown to upconvert by bias-dependent frequency modulation. The results are validated against SpectreRF simulations and measurements on two differential CMOS oscillators tuned by resonators with very different Q's.","","0-7803-5809-0","10.1109/CICC.2000.852732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852732","","Phase noise;Oscillators;1f noise;Circuits;Steady-state;Phase modulation;Frequency modulation;Voltage;Noise level;Additive noise","","323","4","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a vision presents great demands on mobile networks. Mobile IP represents a simple and scalable global mobility solution but lacks the support for fast handoff control and paging found in cellular telephony networks. In contrast, second- and third-generation cellular systems offer seamless mobility support but are built on complex and costly connection-oriented networking infrastructure that lacks the inherent flexibility, robustness, and scalability found in IP networks. In this article we present cellular IP, a micro-mobility protocol that provides seamless mobility support in limited geographical areas. Cellular IP, which incorporates a number of important cellular system design principles such as paging in support of passive connectivity, is built on a foundation of IP forwarding, minimal signaling, and soft-state location management. We discuss the design, implementation, and evaluation of a cellular IP testbed developed at Columbia University over the past several years.

This method uses reference patterns as items of evidence regarding the class membership of each input pattern under consideration.

This procedure can be implemented in a multilayer neural network with specific architecture consisting of one input layer, two hidden layers and one output layer. The weight vector, the receptive field and the class membership of each prototype are determined by minimizing the mean squared differences between the classifier outputs and target values. After training, the classifier computes for each input vector a BBA that provides a description of the uncertainty pertaining to the class of the current pattern, given the available evidence. This information may be used to implement various decision rules allowing for ambiguous pattern rejection and novelty detection. The outputs of several classifiers may also be combined in a sensor fusion context, yielding decision procedures which are very robust to sensor failures or changes in the system environment. Experiments with simulated and real data demonstrate the excellent performance of this classification scheme as compared to existing statistical and neural network techniques.","1558-2426","","10.1109/3468.833094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=833094","","Neural networks;Multi-layer neural network;Prototypes;Computer architecture;Uncertainty;Sensor fusion;Artificial neural networks;Pattern classification;Pattern recognition;Robustness","","319","3","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Epitaxial layer structures were designed to yield well-matched channel doping profiles after processing, allowing comparison of strained and unstrained Si surface channel devices. In spite of the high substrate doping and high vertical fields, the MOSFET mobility of the strained-Si devices is enhanced by 75% compared to that of the unstrained-Si control devices and the state-of-the-art universal MOSFET mobility. Although the strained and unstrained-Si MOSFETs exhibit very similar short-channel effects, the intrinsic transconductance of the strained Si devices is enhanced by roughly 60% for the entire channel length range investigated (1 to 0.1 /spl mu/m) when self-heating is reduced by an ac measurement technique. Comparison of the measured transconductance to hydrodynamic device simulations indicates that in addition to the increased low-field mobility, improved high-field transport in strained Si is necessary to explain the observed performance improvement. Reduced carrier-phonon scattering for electrons with average energies less than a few hundred meV accounts for the enhanced high-field electron transport in strained Si. Since strained Si provides device performance enhancements through changes in material properties rather than changes in device geometry and doping, strained Si is a promising candidate for improving the performance of Si CMOS technology without compromising the control of short channel effects.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.848284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848284","","MOSFETs","","318","152","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The physical network architecture employs wavelength-conversion-enabled wavelength-routing switches (WRS) at the routing nodes, which allow the establishment of circuit-switched all-optical wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) channels, called lightpaths. We assume packet-based traffic in the network, such that a packet travelling from its source to its destination may have to multihop through one or more such lightpaths. We present an exact integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for the complete virtual topology design, including choice of the constituent lightpaths, routes for these lightpaths, and intensity of packet flows through these lightpaths. By minimizing the average packet hop distance in our objective function and by relaxing the wavelength-continuity constraints, we demonstrate that the entire optical network design problem can be considerably simplified and made computationally tractable. Although an ILP may take an exponential amount of time to obtain an exact optimal solution, we demonstrate that terminating the optimization within the first few iterations of the branch-and-bound method provides high-quality solutions. We ran experiments using the CPLEX optimization package on the NSFNET topology, a subset of the PACBELL network topology, as well as a third random topology to substantiate this conjecture. Minimizing the average packet hop distance is equivalent to maximizing the total network throughput under balanced flows through the lightpaths. The problem formulation can be used to design a balanced network, such that the utilizations of both transceivers and wavelengths in the network are maximized, thus reducing the cost of the network equipment. We analyze the trade-offs in budgeting of resources (transceivers and switch sizes) in the optical network, and demonstrate how an improperly designed network may have low utilization of any one of these resources. We also use the problem formulation to provide a reconfiguration methodology in order to adapt the virtual topology to changing traffic conditions.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.879346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879346","","Optical fiber networks;Network topology;Optical design;Circuit topology;Optical switches;Wavelength division multiplexing;Telecommunication traffic;Transceivers;Algorithm design and analysis;Switching circuits","","316","3","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The discrete short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used for the time-frequency domain; dyadic and binary-tree wavelet filters for the time-scale domain. The theory is explained with special emphases on the analysis of voltage disturbance data. Dyadic wavelet filters are not suitable for the harmonic analysis of disturbance data. Filter center frequencies and bandwidths are inflexible, and the results do not give easy insight in the time behavior of the harmonics. On the other hand, band-pass filter outputs from discrete STFT are well associated with harmonics and are thus more useful for power system analysis. With a properly chosen window size, the discrete STFT is also able to detect and analyze transients in a voltage disturbance. Overall, the STFT is more suitable than wavelet filters for the analysis of power system voltage disturbance data.","1937-4208","","10.1109/61.891515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891515","","Time frequency analysis;Voltage;Power harmonic filters;Band pass filters;Power system harmonics;Power system transients;Wavelet analysis;Harmonic analysis;Power system analysis computing;Transient analysis","","315","5","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ex vivo electroporation provides manipulation of cells that are reintroduced into the body to provide therapy. In vivo electroporation of tissues enhances molecular transport through tissues and into their constitutive cells. Tissue electroporation, by longer, large pulses, is involved in electrocution injury.

We investigate the use of space-time coding in OFDM-based broadband systems where both spatial and frequency diversity are available. We consider a strategy which basically consists of coding across OFDM tones and is therefore called space-frequency coding. For a spatial broadband channel model taking into account physical propagation parameters and antenna spacing, we derive the design criteria for space-frequency codes and we show that space-time codes designed to achieve full spatial diversity in the narrowband case will in general not achieve full space-frequency diversity. Specifically, we show that the Alamouti (see IEEE J. Sel. Areas Comm., vol.16, p.1451-58, 1998) scheme across tones fails to exploit frequency diversity. For a given set of propagation parameters and given antenna spacing, we establish the maximum achievable diversity order.

Overcomplete codes have also been proposed as a model of some of the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Previous work has focused on finding the best representation of a signal using a fixed overcomplete basis (or dictionary). We present an algorithm for learning an overcomplete basis by viewing it as probabilistic model of the observed data. We show that overcomplete bases can yield a better approximation of the underlying statistical distribution of the data and can thus lead to greater coding efficiency. This can be viewed as a generalization of the technique of independent component analysis and provides a method for Bayesian reconstruction of signals in the presence of noise and for blind source separation when there are more sources than mixtures.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976600300015826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6789688","","","","299","1","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In this article, endmember variability is incorporated into mixture analysis by representing each endmember by a set or bundle of spectra, each of which could reasonably be the reflectance of an instance of the endmember. Endmember bundles are constructed from the data itself by an extension to a previously described method of manually deriving endmembers from remotely sensed data. Applied to remotely sensed images, bundle unmixing produces maximum and minimum fraction images bounding the correct cover fractions and specifying error due to endmember variability. In this article, endmember bundles and bounding fraction images were created for an airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) subscene simulated with a canopy radiative transfer/geometric-optical model. Variation in endmember reflectance was achieved using ranges of parameter values including leaf area index (LAI) and tissue optical properties observed In a North Texas savanna. The subscene's spatial pattern was based on a 1992 Landsat Thematic Mapper image of the study region. Bounding fraction images bracketed the cover fractions of the simulated data for 98% of the pixels for soil, 97% for senescent grass and 93% for trees. Averages of bounding images estimated fractional coverage used in the simulation with an average error of /spl les/0.05, a significant improvement over previous methods with important implications for regional-scale research on vegetation extent and dynamics.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.841987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841987","","Reflectivity;Vegetation mapping;Solid modeling;Biochemical analysis;Spectral analysis;Biochemistry;Error correction;Infrared imaging;Infrared spectra;Spectroscopy","","297","","37","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that the error in the propagation delay if inductance is neglected and the interconnect is treated as a distributed RC line can be over 35% for current on-chip interconnect. It is also shown that the traditional quadratic dependence of the propagation delay on the length of the interconnect for RC lines approaches a linear dependence as inductance effects increase. On-chip inductance is therefore expected to have a profound effect on traditional high-performance integrated circuit (IC) design methodologies. The closed-form delay model is applied to the problem of repeater insertion in RLC interconnect. Closed-form solutions are presented for inserting repeaters into RLC lines that are highly accurate with respect to numerical solutions. RC models can create errors of up to 30% in the total propagation delay of a repeater system as compared to the optimal delay if inductance is considered. The error between the RC and RLC models increases as the gate parasitic impedances decrease with technology scaling. Thus, the importance of inductance in high-performance very large scale integration (VLSI) design methodologies will increase as technologies scale.","1557-9999","","10.1109/92.831439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=831439","","Inductance;Propagation delay;Repeaters;Very large scale integration;Integrated circuit interconnections;Wires;Closed-form solution;Design methodology;Impedance;Signal design","","295","16","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we describe an architecture for evolving such subcomponents as a collection of cooperating species. Given a simple string- matching task, we show that evolutionary pressure to increase the overall fitness of the ecosystem can provide the needed stimulus for the emergence of an appropriate number of interdependent subcomponents that cover multiple niches, evolve to an appropriate level of generality, and adapt as the number and roles of their fellow subcomponents change over time.

As with all stochastic search algorithms, there are adjustable algorithm coefficients that must be specified, and that can have a profound effect on algorithm performance. It is known that choosing these coefficients according to an SA analog of the deterministic Newton-Raphson algorithm provides an optimal or near-optimal form of the algorithm. However, directly determining the required Hessian matrix (or Jacobian matrix for root finding) to achieve this algorithm form has often been difficult or impossible in practice. The paper presents a general adaptive SA algorithm that is based on a simple method for estimating the Hessian matrix, while concurrently estimating the primary parameters of interest. The approach applies in both the gradient-free optimization (Kiefer-Wolfowitz) and root-finding/stochastic gradient-based (Robbins-Monro) settings, and is based on the ""simultaneous perturbation (SP)"" idea introduced previously. The algorithm requires only a small number of loss function or gradient measurements per iteration-independent of the problem dimension-to adaptively estimate the Hessian and parameters of primary interest. Aside from introducing the adaptive SP approach, the paper presents practical implementation guidance, asymptotic theory, and a nontrivial numerical evaluation. Also included is a discussion and numerical analysis comparing the adaptive SP approach with the iterate-averaging approach to accelerated SA.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2000.880982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880982","","Stochastic processes;Perturbation methods;Parameter estimation;Acceleration;Least squares approximation;Jacobian matrices;Noise measurement;Constraint optimization;Adaptive control;Backpropagation algorithms","","288","1","45","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to obtain acceptable training speed and realistic fuzzy system structure, these features are clustered without supervision using the Basic Isodata algorithm at the beginning of the training phase, and the clustering results are used in initializing the fuzzy system parameters. Afterwards, fuzzy rules in the system are trained with the back-propagation algorithm. The fuzzy approach was compared with an artificial neural network (ANN) method on four subjects, and very similar classification results were obtained.

The difficulty of detecting targets in remotely sensed images with spatial image analysis arises from the fact that the ground sampling distance is generally larger than the size of targets of interest in which case targets are embedded in a single pixel and cannot be detected spatially. Under this circumstance target detection must be carried out at subpixel level and spectral analysis offers a valuable alternative. In this paper, the problem of subpixel spectral detection of targets in remote sensing images is considered, where two constrained target detection approaches are studied and compared. One is a target abundance-constrained approach, referred to as nonnegatively constrained least squares (NCLS) method. It is a constrained least squares spectral mixture analysis method which implements a nonnegativity constraint on the abundance fractions of targets of interest. Another is a target signature-constrained approach, called constrained energy minimization (CEM) method. It constrains the desired target signature with a specific gain while minimizing effects caused by other unknown signatures. A quantitative study is conducted to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both methods. Some suggestions are further proposed to mitigate their disadvantages.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.843007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=843007","","Object detection;Least squares methods;Spectral analysis;Remote sensing;Image processing;Image analysis;Image sampling;Pixel;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging","","286","","28","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These algorithms use a simple randomized communication mechanism to ensure robustness. Suppose n players communicate in parallel rounds in each of which every player calls a randomly selected communication partner. In every round, players can generate rumors (updates) that are to be distributed among all players. Whenever communication is established between two players, each one must decide which of the rumors to transmit. The major problem is that players might not know which rumors their partners have already received. For example, a standard algorithm forwarding each rumor form the calling to the called players for /spl Theta/(ln n) rounds needs to transmit the rumor /spl Theta/(n ln n) times in order to ensure that every player finally receives the rumor with high probability. We investigate whether such a large communication overhead is inherent to epidemic algorithms. On the positive side, we show that the communication overhead can be reduced significantly. We give an algorithm using only O(n ln ln n) transmissions and O(ln n) rounds. In addition, we prove the robustness of this algorithm. On the negative side, we show that any address-oblivious algorithm needs to send /spl Omega/(n ln ln n) messages for each rumor, regardless of the number of rounds. Furthermore, we give a general lower bound showing that time and communication optimality cannot be achieved simultaneously using random phone calls, i.e. every algorithm that distributes a rumor in O(ln n) rounds needs /spl omega/(n) transmissions.","0272-5428","0-7695-0850-2","10.1109/SFCS.2000.892324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892324","","Robustness;Computer science;Distributed databases;Computer crashes","","285","22","12","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The WDD measure is designed for comparing the distortion between original ECG signal and reconstructed ECG signal (after compression). The WDD is based on PQRST complex diagnostic features (such as P wave duration, QT interval, T shape, ST elevation) of the original ECG signal and the reconstructed one. Unlike other conventional distortion measures [e.g. percentage root mean square (rms) difference, or PRD], the WDD contains direct diagnostic information and thus is more meaningful and useful. Four compression algorithms were implemented (AZTEC, SAPA2, LTP, ASEC) in order to evaluate the WDD. A mean opinion score (MOS) test was applied to test the quality of the reconstructed signals and to compare the quality measure (MOS/sub error/) with the proposed WDD measure and the popular PRD measure. The evaluators in the WIGS test were three independent expert cardiologists, who studied the reconstructed ECG signals in a blind and a semiblind tests.

In many applications, wideband and nonstationary signals, however, often occur. One of the typical examples of such signals is chirp-type signals that are usually encountered in radar signal processing, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and inverse SAR imaging. Due to the motion of a target, the radar return signals are usually chirps, and their chirp rates include the information about the target, such as the location and the velocity. In this paper, we study discrete chirp-Fourier transform (DCFT), which is analogous to the DFT. Besides the multiple frequency matching similar to the DFT, the DCFT can be used to match the multiple chirp rates in a chirp-type signal with multiple chirp components. We show that when the signal length N is prime, the magnitudes of all the sidelobes of the DCFT of a quadratic chirp signal are 1, whereas the magnitude of the mainlobe of the DCFT is /spl radic/N. With this result, an upper bound for the number of the detectable chirp components using the DCFT is provided in terms of signal length and signal and noise powers. We also show that the N-point DCFT performs optimally when N is a prime.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.875469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875469","","Chirp;Discrete transforms;Discrete Fourier transforms;Frequency;Signal processing;Wideband;Radar signal processing;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar polarimetry;Radar imaging","","283","12","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, a load-leveling vehicle operation strategy is developed. In order to accomplish the strategy, a fuzzy logic controller is proposed. Fuzzy logic control is chosen because of the need for a controller for a nonlinear, multidomain, and time-varying plant with multiple uncertainties. Third, a novel technique for system integration and component sizing is presented. Fourth, the system design and control strategy is both simulated and then implemented in an actual vehicle. The controller examined in this study increased the fuel economy of a conventional full-sized vehicle from 40 to 55.7 mi/h and increased the average efficiency over the Federal Urban Driving Schedule from 23% to 35.4%.

The line parameter estimation algorithm is also developed to solve the uncertainty of parameters caused by aging of transmission lines. This paper also proposes a new discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based algorithm (termed the smart discrete Fourier transform, SDFT) to eliminate system noise and measurement errors such that extremely accurate fundamental frequency components can be extracted for calculation of fault detection/location index. The EMTP was used to simulate a high voltage transmission line with faults at various locations. To simulate errors involved in measurements, Gaussian-type noise has been added to the raw output data generated by EMTP. Results have shown that the new DFT based method can extract exact phasors in the presence of frequency deviation and harmonics. The parameter estimation algorithm can also trace exact parameters very well. The accuracy of both new DFT based method and parameter estimation algorithm can achieve even up to 99.999% and 99.99% respectively, and is presented in Part II.

This makes them attractive choices for robotic applications, in spite of the fact that the manipulator dynamics are not taken into account. Cubic splines are used in a framework that assures overall continuity of velocities and accelerations in the robot movement. The resulting MJ trajectory planning is shown to be a global constrained minimax optimization problem.

The lack of more general designs is in part due to the fact that the diversity advantage of a code is the minimum rank among the complex baseband differences between modulated codewords, which is difficult to relate to traditional code designs over finite fields and rings. We present general binary design criteria for PSK-modulated space-time codes. For linear BPSK/QPSK codes, the rank of (binary projections of) the unmodulated codewords, as binary matrices over the binary field, is a sufficient design criterion: full binary rank guarantees full spatial diversity. This criterion accounts for much of what is currently known about PSK-modulated space-time codes. We develop new fundamental code constructions for both quasi-static and time-varying channels. These are perhaps the first general constructions-other than delay diversity schemes-that guarantee full spatial diversity for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.825816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825816","","Modulation coding","","278","8","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The GFMM method combines supervised and unsupervised learning in a single training algorithm. The fusion of clustering and classification resulted in an algorithm that can be used as pure clustering, pure classification, or hybrid clustering classification. It exhibits a property of finding decision boundaries between classes while clustering patterns that cannot be said to belong to any of existing classes. Similarly to the original algorithms, the hyperbox fuzzy sets are used as a representation of clusters and classes. Learning is usually completed in a few passes and consists of placing and adjusting the hyperboxes in the pattern space; this is an expansion-contraction process. The classification results can be crisp or fuzzy. New data can be included without the need for retraining. While retaining all the interesting features of the original algorithms, a number of modifications to their definition have been made in order to accommodate fuzzy input patterns in the form of lower and upper bounds, combine the supervised and unsupervised learning, and improve the effectiveness of operations. A detailed account of the GFMM neural network, its comparison with the Simpson's fuzzy min-max neural networks, a set of examples, and an application to the leakage detection and identification in water distribution systems are given.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.846747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846747","","Fuzzy neural networks;Neural networks;Fuzzy sets;Pattern recognition;Clustering algorithms;Unsupervised learning;Pattern classification;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Classification algorithms","","277","","32","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

DC ZEDS is predicated on having starboard and port DC buses feeding electrical zones delineated by watertight bulkhead compartments. The main bus DC voltage is stepped down within the zone and then converted to three-phase AC and lower voltage DC by additional power converters. Due to the large interconnection of tightly-regulated power converters in a stiffly-connected system, negative input impedance effects create the possibility of unwanted resonances.

Most radiometric slope corrections remove slope effects to account for the effective scattering pixel area. However, few studies address the slope effect on the radar cross section as a function of polarization states. The authors propose two approaches to compensate for this azimuth slope effect for POLSAR data. In the first approach, the digital elevation model (DEM), obtained from interferometric SAR or from other means, is used to estimate orientation angles, and in the second approach, orientation angles are derived directly from the POLSAR data. They have developed three new methods to implement this second approach. One is based on the right-right and left-left circular polarizations, and the other two are based on Cloude's and Huynelt's decompositions. The results are compared with the original polarization signature method using the DEM-generated orientation angles as the reference. POLSAR data is then compensated using the derived orientation angles. Significant changes were observed in many elements of the coherency matrix. The compensated POLSAR data should improve the accuracy of geophysical parameter estimation techniques.

Interactions between the two actuators and nonlinear behavior of the system make the problem difficult to handle using classical control design methods. Instead, we employ a control Lyapunov function (CLF) based nonlinear control design method because it possesses a guaranteed robustness property equivalent to gain and phase margins. The CLF is constructed using input-output linearization of a reduced order diesel engine model.

The resulting low quality images greatly limit what vision can accomplish today. This paper proposes a very simple method for significantly enhancing the dynamic range of virtually any imaging system. The basic principle is to simultaneously sample the spatial and exposure dimensions of image irradiance. One of several ways to achieve this is by placing an optical mask adjacent to a conventional image detector array. The mask has a pattern with spatially varying transmittance, thereby giving adjacent pixels on the detector different exposures to the scene. The captured image is mapped to a high dynamic range image using an efficient image reconstruction algorithm. The end result is an imaging system that can measure a very wide range of scene radiance and produce a substantially larger number of brightness levels, with a slight reduction in spatial resolution. We conclude with several examples of high dynamic range images computed using spatially varying pixel exposures.","1063-6919","0-7695-0662-3","10.1109/CVPR.2000.855857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855857","","Dynamic range;Pixel;Optical imaging;Layout;Brightness;Detectors;Optical arrays;Machine vision;Sensor arrays;Image reconstruction","","273","121","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is also shown that the affine local model structure is a highly sensitive parametrization when applied in transient operating regimes. Due to the multiobjective nature of the identification problem studied here, special considerations must be made during model structure selection, experiment design, and identification in order to meet both objectives. Some guidelines for experiment design are suggested and some robust nonlinear identification algorithms are studied.

They estimate the number of Gaussian components from the number of inflection points of a smoothed copy of the laser waveform and obtain initial estimates of the Gaussian half-widths and positions from the positions of its consecutive inflection points. Initial amplitude estimates are obtained using a nonnegative least-squares method (LSM). To reduce the likelihood of fitting the background noise within the waveform and to minimize the number of Gaussians needed in the approximation, we rank the ""importance"" of each Gaussian in the decomposition using its initial half-width and amplitude estimates. The initial parameter estimates of all Gaussians ranked ""important"" are optimized using the Levenburg-Marquardt method. If the sum of the Gaussians does not approximate the return waveform to a prescribed accuracy, then additional Gaussians can be included in the optimization procedure or initial parameters can be recalculated.

One important class of visualization techniques which is particularly interesting for visualizing very large multidimensional data sets is the class of pixel-oriented techniques. The basic idea of pixel-oriented visualization techniques is to represent as many data objects as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. A number of different pixel-oriented visualization techniques have been proposed in recent years and it has been shown that the techniques are useful for visual data exploration in a number of different application contexts. In this paper, we discuss a number of issues which are important in developing pixel-oriented visualization techniques. The major goal of this article is to provide a formal basis of pixel-oriented visualization techniques and show that the design decisions in developing them can be seen as solutions of well-defined optimization problems. This is true for the mapping of the data values to colors, the arrangement of pixels inside the subwindows, the shape of the subwindows, and the ordering of the dimension subwindows. The paper also discusses the design issues of special variants of pixel-oriented techniques for visualizing large spatial data sets.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.841121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841121","","Data visualization;Multidimensional systems;Design optimization;Data mining;Information analysis;Shape;Data analysis;Statistical analysis;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence","","268","37","63","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting spatially variant impulse response and covariance are computed using 3-D Fourier transforms. A truncated Gaussian distribution is used to account for the effect on the variance of the nonnegativity constraint used in MAP reconstruction. Using Monte Carlo simulations and phantom data from the microPET small animal scanner, the authors show that the approximations provide reasonably accurate estimates of contrast recovery and covariance of MAP reconstruction for priors with quadratic energy functions. They also describe how these analytical results can be used to achieve near-uniform contrast recovery throughout the reconstructed volume.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.870259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=870259","","Positron emission tomography;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Image analysis;Smoothing methods;Energy resolution;Spatial resolution;Lesions;Detectors;Fourier transforms","Algorithms;Analysis of Variance;Animals;Brain;Haplorhini;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Theoretical;Monte Carlo Method;Normal Distribution;Phantoms, Imaging;Poisson Distribution;Tomography, Emission-Computed","268","44","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Essential features of SVM's remain, such as Mercer's condition and the fact that the output weights are a Lagrange multiplier weighted sum of the data points. The solution to recurrent least squares (LS-SVM's) is characterized by a set of nonlinear equations. Due to its high computational complexity, we focus on a limited case of assigning the squared error an infinitely large penalty factor with early stopping as a form of regularization.

The support vector machine has the advantage that a smaller number of parameters for the model can be identified in a manner that does not require the extent of prior information or heuristic assumptions that some previous techniques require. Furthermore, the optimization method of a support vector machine is quadratic programming, which is a well-studied and understood mathematical programming technique. Support vector machine simulations are carried out on nonlinear problems previously studied by other researchers using neural networks. This allows initial comparison against other techniques to determine the feasibility of using the proposed method for nonlinear detection. Results show that support vector machines perform as well as neural networks on the nonlinear problems investigated. A method is then proposed to introduce decision feedback processing to support vector machines to address the fact that intersymbol interference (ISI) data generates input vectors having temporal correlation, whereas a standard support vector machine assumes independent input vectors. Presenting the problem from the viewpoint of the pattern space illustrates the utility of a bank of support vector machines. This approach yields a nonlinear processing method that is somewhat different than the nonlinear decision feedback method whereby the linear feedback filter of the decision feedback equalizer is replaced by a Volterra filter. A simulation using a linear system shows that the proposed method performs equally to a conventional decision feedback equalizer for this problem.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.875477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875477","","Support vector machines;Neural networks;Intersymbol interference;Nonlinear filters;Decision feedback equalizers;Machine learning;Optimization methods;Quadratic programming;Mathematical programming;Neurofeedback","","265","","35","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet a general and tractable computational model of this ability to untangle the underlying factors of perceptual observations remains elusive (Hofstadter, 1985). Existing factor models (Mardia, Kent, & Bibby, 1979; Hinton & Zemel, 1994; Ghahramani, 1995; Bell & Sejnowski, 1995; Hinton, Dayan, Frey, & Neal, 1995; Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Hinton & Ghahramani, 1997) are either insufficiently rich to capture the complex interactions of perceptually meaningful factors such as phoneme and speaker accent or letter and font, or do not allow efficient learning algorithms. We present a general framework for learning to solve two-factor tasks using bilinear models, which provide sufficiently expressive representations of factor interactions but can nonetheless be fit to data using efficient algorithms based on the singular value decomposition and expectation-maximization. We report promising results on three different tasks in three different perceptual domains: spoken vowel classification with a benchmark multi-speaker database, extrapolation of fonts to unseen letters, and translation of faces to novel illuminants.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976600300015349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790155","","","","265","1","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

This paper tackles the problem of automatic external calibration of multiple cameras in an extended scene, that is, full recovery of their 3D relative positions and orientations. Because the cameras are placed far apart, brightness or proximity constraints cannot be used to match static features, so we instead apply planar geometric constraints to moving objects tracked throughout the scene. By robustly matching and fitting tracked objects to a planar model, we align the scene's ground plane across multiple views and decompose the planar alignment matrix to recover the 3D relative camera and ground plane positions. We demonstrate this technique in both a controlled lab setting where we test the effects of errors in the intrinsic camera parameters, and in an uncontrolled, outdoor setting. In the latter, we do not assume synchronized cameras and we show that enforcing geometric constraints enables us to align the tracking data in time. In spite of noise in the intrinsic camera parameters and in the image data, the system successfully transforms multiple views of the scene's ground plane to an overhead view and recovers the relative 3D camera and ground plane positions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.868678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868678","","Monitoring;Streaming media;Cameras;Layout;Calibration;Brightness;Robustness;Matrix decomposition;Transmission line matrix methods;Testing","","264","24","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In conventional tissue classification for a scalar volume, tissues of interest are characterized by an opacity transfer function defined as a one-dimensional (1D) function of the original volume intensity. To overcome the limitations inherent in conventional 1D opacity functions, we propose a tissue classification method that employs a multidimensional opacity function, which is a function of the 3D derivative features calculated from a scalar volume as well as the volume intensity. Tissues of interest are characterized by explicitly defined classification rules based on 3D filter responses highlighting local structures, such as edge, sheet, line, and blob, which typically correspond to tissue boundaries, cortices, vessels, and nodules, respectively, in medical volume data. The 3D local structure filters are formulated using the gradient vector and Hessian matrix of the volume intensity function combined with isotropic Gaussian blurring. These filter responses and the original intensity define a multidimensional feature space in which multichannel tissue classification strategies are designed. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparisons with conventional single-channel classification using both synthesized data and clinical data acquired with CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners. The improvement in image quality obtained using multichannel classification is confirmed by evaluating the contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio in the resultant volume-rendered images with variable opacity values.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.856997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=856997","","Biomedical imaging;Multidimensional systems;Filters;Data visualization;Pipelines;Transfer functions;Computed tomography;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Information filtering","","264","24","39","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We claim that the problem of dialog design can be formalized as an optimization problem with an objective function reflecting different dialog dimensions relevant for a given application. We also show that any dialog system can be formally described as a sequential decision process in terms of its state space, action set, and strategy. With additional assumptions about the state transition probabilities and cost assignment, a dialog system can be mapped to a stochastic model known as Markov decision process (MDP). A variety of data driven algorithms for finding the optimal strategy (i.e., the one that optimizes the criterion) is available within the MDP framework, based on reinforcement learning. For an effective use of the available training data we propose a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning: the supervised learning is used to estimate a model of the user, i.e., the MDP parameters that quantify the user's behavior. Then a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to estimate the optimal strategy while the system interacts with the simulated user. This approach is tested for learning the strategy in an air travel information system (ATIS) task. The experimental results we present in this paper show that it is indeed possible to find a simple criterion, a state space representation, and a simulated user parameterization in order to automatically learn a relatively complex dialog behavior, similar to one that was heuristically designed by several research groups.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.817450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817450","","Stochastic processes;Man machine systems;State-space methods;Design optimization;Costs;Stochastic systems;Training data;Supervised learning;System testing;Information systems","","263","16","36","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Non-thermal plasmas in which the mean energy of the electrons is substantially higher than that of the gas offer advantages in reducing the energy required to remove the pollutants. The electrical energy supplied into the discharge is used preferentially to create energetic electrons which are then used to produce radicals by dissociation and ionization of the carrier gas in which the pollutants are present. These radicals are used to decompose the pollutants. There are two technologically promising techniques for generating non-thermal plasmas in atmospheric gas pressure containing the pollutants, namely electron beam irradiation and electrical discharge techniques. Both techniques are undergoing intensive and continuous development worldwide. This is done to reduce the energy requirement for pollutant removal, and therefore the associated cost, as well as to obtain a better understanding of the physical and chemical processes involved in reducing the pollutants. In the present paper only electrical discharge techniques are reviewed and emphasis is given to the more recent published work. The paper summarizes the chemical reactions responsible for the removal of the major polluting constituents of NO, NO/sub 2/ and SO/sub 2/ encountered in flue gases and exhaust emissions. The constructional features of the various types of electrical discharge reactors commonly employed in the removal of gas pollutants as well as pilot systems used in industrial plants are described briefly The results on the removal efficiency of the various pollutants including hydrocarbons and volatile compounds and their dependency on the type of discharge reactor, the type and the magnitude of the applied voltage (dc, ac and pulsed), the polarity of the voltage (de and pulsed), the effect of the pulse width, the initial concentration of the pollutants, the addition of ammonia, argon and other hydrocarbons, the gas flow rate, the residence time of the pollutants in the discharge reactor, the gas temperature and on the type of the gas constituents will be reviewed. The removal of pollutants using arc plasmas will be discussed. The specific energy density which is supplied in various forms of electrical discharges to reduce the pollutants is discussed. The energy required to remove the pollutants is expected to be one of the main considerations in selecting the technology to be used to remove the pollutants and therefore it is of prime importance.","1558-4135","","10.1109/94.879361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879361","","Air pollution;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Industrial pollution;Inductors;Space vector pulse width modulation;Electrons;Hydrocarbons;Voltage;Plasma temperature;Fault location","","261","4","114","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a new type of DFRFT, which are unitary, reversible, and flexible; in addition, the closed-form analytic expression can be obtained. It works in performance similar to the continuous fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) and can be efficiently calculated by the FFT. Since the continuous FRFT can be generalized into the continuous affine Fourier transform (AFT) (the so-called canonical transform), we also extend the DFRFT into the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). We derive two types of the DFRFT and DAFT. Type 1 is similar to the continuous FRFT and AFT and can be used for computing the continuous FRFT and AFT. Type 2 is the improved form of type 1 and can be used for other applications of digital signal processing. Meanwhile, many important properties continuous FRFT and AFT are kept in the closed-form DFRFT and DAFT, and some applications, such as filter design and pattern recognition, are also discussed.

The targets are moving along a highway, with varying obscuration due to changing terrain conditions. In addition, the roads can branch, merge or cross-the scenario represents target convoys along a realistic road network with junctions, changing terrains, etc. Some of the targets may also move in an open field. This constrained motion estimation problem is handled using an IMM estimator with varying mode sets depending on the topography, The number of models in the IMM estimator, their types and their parameters are modified adaptively, in real-time, based on the estimated position of the target and the corresponding road/visibility conditions. This topography-based variable structure mechanism eliminates the need for carrying all the possible models throughout the entire tracking period as in the standard IMM estimator, significantly improving performance and reducing computational load. Data association is handled using an assignment algorithm. The estimator is designed to handle a very large number of ground targets simultaneously. A simulated scenario consisting of over one hundred targets is used to illustrate the selection of design parameters and the operation of the tracker. Performance measures are presented to contrast the benefits of the VS-IMM estimator over the Kalman filter and the standard IMM estimator, The VS-IMM estimator is then combined with multidimensional assignment to gain ""time-depth."" The additional benefit of using higher dimensional assignment algorithms for data association is also evaluated.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.826310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826310","","Target tracking;Motion estimation;Large-scale systems;Road transportation;Computational modeling;Measurement standards;Multidimensional systems;Systems engineering and theory;Traffic control;Surveillance","","258","","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a basis for algorithm development, backscattering properties of snow-free and snow-covered alpine surfaces were investigated using ERS SAR data and field measurements at test sites in the Austrian Alps. The incidence angle dependence of backscattering derived from SAR data is compared with simulations for snow-free surfaces and for surfaces covered by dry snow and wet snow. Significant seasonal changes of backscattering are observed, which are mainly caused by variations of the snow liquid water content and of the surface roughness. The importance of surface roughness for backscattering of wet snow is demonstrated by a surface roughness experiment. The algorithm for mapping wet snow applies change detection using ratios of wet snow versus snow-free or dry snow surfaces. The main steps include coregistration, speckle reduction, thresholding of ratio images, geocoding, and, optionally, combination of crossing passes to reduce the loss of information due to layover. A threshold of -3 dB was found to be appropriate for both Radarsat and ERS SAR to separate wet snow from other surfaces. Postprocessing steps, based on historic snow maps or topographic information, are used to correct for dry snow areas at high elevations. Effects of imaging geometry are investigated by comparing ERS SAR images with a look angle of 19/spl deg/ and Radarsat SAR Beam Mode S7 images with a look angle of 40/spl deg/. The comparison of snow maps from SAR and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images shows good agreement in areas of closed snow cover, whereas near the snow line/SAR tends to slightly underestimate the snow extent.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.842004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842004","","Information retrieval;Snow;Surface topography;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Backscatter;Terrain mapping;Synthetic aperture radar;Testing;Change detection algorithms","","258","","26","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the computational cost of BLAST, we develop an efficient square-root algorithm for the nulling and cancellation step. The main features of the algorithm include efficiency: the computational cost is reduced by 0.7 M, where M is the number of transmit antennas, and numerical stability: the algorithm is division-free and uses only orthogonal transformations. In a 14 antenna system designed for transmission of 1 Mbit/s over a 30 kHz channel, the nulling and cancellation computation is reduced from 190 MFlops/s to 19 MFlops/s, with the overall computations being reduced from 220 MFlops/s to 49 MFlops/s.

Various methods, such as the IEC codes, have been developed to interpret DGA results directly obtained from a chromatographer. Although these methods are widely used in the world, they sometimes fail to diagnose, especially when more than one fault exists in a transformer. This paper presents a fuzzy logic technique which can diagnose multiple faults in a transformer and quantitatively indicates the likelihood/severity of each fault. Insulation deterioration at each fault location can then be monitored closely according to its trend, which is important for a transformer in critical situation. Tests using this technique on a number of transformers have given promising results.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.867146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867146","","Dissolved gas analysis;Fault diagnosis;Power transformer insulation;Power transformers;Oil insulation;IEC;Gases;Fuzzy logic;Condition monitoring;Gas insulation","","253","","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The drawbacks of this method are the interobserver variability and inefficiency. Here, the authors present a new automated method which reduces these problems. By applying a multiscale dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, approximate vessel wall positions are first estimated in a coarse-scale image, which then guide the detection of the boundaries in a fine-scale image. In both cases, DP is used for finding a global optimum for a cost function. The cost function is a weighted sum of terms, in fuzzy expression forms, representing image features and geometrical characteristics of the vessel interfaces. The weights are adjusted by a training procedure using human expert tracings. Operator interventions, if needed, also take effect under the framework of global optimality. This reduces the amount of human intervention and, hence, variability due to subjectiveness. By incorporating human knowledge and experience, the algorithm becomes more robust. A thorough evaluation of the method in the clinical environment shows that interobserver variability is evidently decreased and so is the overall analysis time. The authors conclude that the automated procedure can replace the manual procedure and leads to an improved performance.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.836372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836372","","Dynamic programming;Arteries;Humans;Cost function;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Councils;Anthropometry;Heuristic algorithms;Robustness;Ultrasonic imaging","Carotid Artery, Common;Costs and Cost Analysis;Femoral Artery;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography","253","2","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Other problems will involve head-to-disk spacings that approach atomic dimensions, and switching-speed limitations in the head and medium. It is likely that the rate of progress in areal density will decrease substantially as we develop drives with ten to a hundred times current areal densities.

Our approach, which we call HiCuts (hierarchical intelligent cuttings), attempts to partition the search space in each dimension, guided by simple heuristics that exploit the classifier's structure. We discover this structure by preprocessing the classifier. We can tune the algorithm's parameters to trade off query time against storage requirements. In classifying packets based on four header fields, HiCuts performs quickly and requires relatively little storage compared with previously described algorithms.","1937-4143","","10.1109/40.820051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=820051","","Computer aided manufacturing;CADCAM;Data structures;Web and internet services;Routing;Intelligent structures;Access control;Channel allocation;Load management;Communication system traffic control","","252","38","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This usually involves segmenting the document into semantically meaningful units, classifying each unit into a predefined scene type, and indexing and summarizing the document for efficient retrieval and browsing. We review advances in using audio and visual information jointly for accomplishing the above tasks.

Studies of historic data from legacy software systems have identified three specific causes of this change: adding new features; correcting faults; and restructuring code to accommodate future changes. Our hypothesis is that a textual description field of a change is essential to understanding why that change was performed. Also, we expect that difficulty, size, and interval would vary strongly across different types of changes. To test these hypotheses we have designed a program which automatically classifies maintenance activity based on a textual description of changes. Developer surveys showed that the automatic classification was in agreement with developer opinions. Tests of the classifier on a different product found that size and interval for different types of changes did not vary across two products. We have found strong relationships between the type and size of a change and the time required to carry it out. We also discovered a relatively large amount of perfective changes in the system we examined. From this study we have arrived at several suggestions on how to make version control data useful in diagnosing the state of a software project, without significantly increasing the overhead for the developer using the change management system.","1063-6773","0-7695-0753-0","10.1109/ICSM.2000.883028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883028","","Reverse engineering","","251","5","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The limitations of using an information theoretic metric, which is sometimes used to justify a first-order Markov chain as a sufficient model for very slowly fading channels, are discussed. A simple method of qualitatively comparing autocorrelation functions is instead proposed. The usefulness of the first-order Markov chain in representing the flat-fading channel is examined by looking at two specific problems in wireless system applications that represent two disparate cases. The first case involves analysis over a short duration of time, relative to the inverse of the normalized Doppler frequency, while the second involves analysis over a long duration of time. Contrary to previous reports, the results indicate that first-order Markov chains are not generally suitable for very slowly fading channels. Rather, first-order Markov chains can be suitable for very slowly fading applications, which require analysis over only a short duration of time.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.891214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891214","","Fading;Rayleigh channels;Gaussian processes;Rayleigh scattering;Autocorrelation;Frequency;Markov processes;Receiving antennas;Statistical distributions;Stochastic processes","","251","","38","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Java, for example, draws heavily from object orientation and is highly suitable for extension to real-time and embedded systems. Recognizing this fit between Java and real-time software development, the Real-Time for Java Experts Group (RTJEG) began developing the real-time specification for Java (RTSJ) in March 1999 under the Java Community Process. This article explains RTSJ's features and the thinking behind the specification's design. The goal of the RTJEG, of which the authors are both members, was to provide a platform-a Java execution environment and application program interface (API)-that lets programmers correctly reason about the temporal behavior of executing software.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.846318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846318","","Java;Real time systems;Application software;Programming profession;Object oriented programming;NIST;Writing;Job shop scheduling;Processor scheduling","","250","3","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Many factors limit the general usefulness of such systems. Long reconfiguration times prevent the acceleration of applications that spread their time over many different tasks. Low-bandwidth paths for data transfer limit the usefulness of such systems to tasks that have a high computation-to-memory-bandwidth ratio. In addition, standard FPGA tools require hardware design expertise which is beyond the knowledge of most programmers.

This can cause problems both with heat dissipation and with current spikes. Compacting scan vectors greatly increases the power dissipation for the vectors (generally the power becomes several times greater). The compacted scan vectors often can exceed the power constraints and hence cannot be used. It is shown here that by carefully selecting the order in which pairs of test cubes are merged during static compaction, both average power and peak power for the final test set can be greatly reduced. A static compaction procedure is presented that can be used to find a minimal set of scan vectors that satisfies constraints on both average power and peak power.

The new definition makes it possible to theoretically analyze principal curve learning from training data and it also leads to a new practical construction. Our theoretical learning scheme chooses a curve from a class of polygonal lines with k segments and with a given total length to minimize the average squared distance over n training points drawn independently. Convergence properties of this learning scheme are analyzed and a practical version of this theoretical algorithm is implemented. In each iteration of the algorithm, a new vertex is added to the polygonal line and the positions of the vertices are updated so that they minimize a penalized squared distance criterion. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm compares favorably with previous methods, both in terms of performance and computational complexity, and is more robust to varying data models.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.841759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841759","","Probability distribution;Clouds;Feature extraction;Training data;Convergence;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Computational complexity;Robustness;Data models","","248","7","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In fast multipath fading environments we cannot assume that the channel estimates are perfect and the inevitable channel estimation errors will limit this potential gain. We study the impact of channel estimation errors on the performance of linear multiuser receivers, as well as the channel estimation problem itself. Of particular interest are the scalability properties of the channel and data estimation algorithms: what happens to the performance as the system bandwidth and the number of users (and hence channels to estimate) grows? Our main results involve asymptotic expressions for the signal-to-interference ratio of linear multiuser receivers in the limit of large processing gain, with the number of users divided by the processing gain held constant. We employ a random model for the spreading sequences and the limiting signal-to-interference ratio expressions are independent of the actual signature sequences, depending only on the system loading and the channel statistics: background noise power, energy profile of resolvable multipaths, and channel coherence time. The effect of channel uncertainty on the performance of multiuser receivers is succinctly captured by the notion of effective interference.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.868478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868478","","Radio receivers","","248","7","50","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The routes are computed in real-time and are able to take into account various mission constraints including: minimum route leg length, maximum turning angle, route distance constraint, and fixed approach vector to goal position.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.869506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869506","","Robustness;Aircraft navigation;Cost function;Leg;Turning;Intelligent transportation systems;Intelligent robots;Military aircraft;Rotors;Real time systems","","248","","12","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the input signals needed to achieve the capacity must be ""peaky"" in time or frequency. In particular, we show that if white-like signals are used instead (as is common in spread-spectrum systems), the mutual information is inversely proportional to the number of resolvable paths L/spl tilde/ with energy spread out, and in fact approaches 0 as the number of paths gets large. This is true even when the paths are assumed to be tracked perfectly at the receiver. A critical parameter L/spl tilde//sub crit/ is defined in terms of system parameters to delineate the threshold on L over which such overspreading phenomenon occurs.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.850678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850678","","Information rates","","247","2","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the widespread availability of several large software systems that have been developed using an ""open source"" development approach, we now have a chance to examine these systems in detail, and see if their evolutionary narratives are significantly different from commercially developed systems. The paper summarizes our preliminary investigations into the evolution of the best known open source system: the Linux operating system kernel. Because Linux is large (over two million lines of code in the most recent version) and because its development model is not as tightly planned and managed as most industrial software processes, we had expected to find that Linux was growing more slowly as it got bigger and more complex. Instead, we have found that Linux has been growing at a super-linear rate for several years. The authors explore the evolution of the Linux kernel both at the system level and within the major subsystems, and they discuss why they think Linux continues to exhibit such strong growth.","1063-6773","0-7695-0753-0","10.1109/ICSM.2000.883030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=883030","","Software prototyping","","246","1","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This ensures that the desired data rate which achieves good voice quality can be provided ""everywhere"". As a result, SINRs that are much larger than the target are achieved over a large portion of the cellular coverage area. For a packet data service, the larger SINR can be used to provide higher data rates by reducing coding or spreading and/or increasing the constellation density. It is straight-forward to see that cellular spectral efficiency (in terms of b/s/Hz/sector) can be increased by a factor of two or more if users with better links are served at higher data rates. Procedures that exploit this are already in place for all the major cellular standards in the world. In this article, we describe data rate adaptation procedures for CDMA (IS-95), wideband CDMA (cdma2000 and UMTS WCDMA), TDMA (IS-136), and GSM (GPRS and EDGE).","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.815453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=815453","","Signal to noise ratio;Multiaccess communication;3G mobile communication;GSM;Signal design;Interference;Web and internet services;Quality of service;Frequency;Fading","","244","33","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Our model introduces new vertices in the graph as time evolves. This captures the fact that the Web is changing with time. Our results are two fold: we show that graphs generated using our model exhibit the statistics observed on the Web graph, and additionally, that natural graph models proposed earlier do not exhibit them. This remains true even when these earlier models are generalized to account for the arrival of vertices over time.

These models describe flows based on the assumption that they are long enough to sustain many packet losses. However, most TCP transfers across today's Internet are short enough to see few, if any, losses and consequently their performance is dominated by startup effects such as connection establishment and slow start. This paper extends the steady-state model proposed in Padhye et al. (1998), in order to capture these startup effects. The extended model characterizes the expected value and distribution of TCP connection establishment and data transfer latency as a function of transfer size, round trip time, and packet loss rate. Using simulations, controlled measurements of TCP transfers, and live Web measurements we show that, unlike earlier steady-state models for TCP performance, our extended model describes connection establishment and data transfer latency under a range of packet loss conditions, including no loss.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832574","","Transport protocols","","242","6","44","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While wavelet or subband coding of images has been shown to be superior to more traditional transform coding techniques, little attention has been paid until recently to the important issue of whether both the wavelet transforms and the subsequent coding can be implemented in low memory without significant loss in performance. We present a complete system to perform low memory wavelet image coding. Our approach is ""line-based"" in that the images are read line by line and only the minimum required number of lines is kept in memory. There are two main contributions of our work. First, we introduce a line-based approach for the implementation of the wavelet transform, which yields the same results as a ""normal"" implementation, but where, unlike prior work, we address memory issues arising from the need to synchronize encoder and decoder. Second, we propose a novel context-based encoder which requires no global information and stores only a local set of wavelet coefficients. This low memory coder achieves performance comparable to state of the art coders at a fraction of their memory utilization.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.826776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826776","","Image coding;Wavelet transforms;Transform coding;Decoding;Wavelet coefficients;Performance loss;Consumer products;Printers;Digital cameras;Costs","","241","38","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These benefits make APR appear to be an ideal candidate for the bandwidth limited and mobile ad-hoc networks. However, we find that APR's potential is not fully realized in ad-hoc networks because of route coupling resulting from the geographic proximity of candidate paths between common endpoints. In multiple channel networks, coupling occurs when paths share common intermediate nodes. The coupling problem is much more serious in single channel networks, where coupling also occurs where one path crosses the radio coverage area of another path, The network's inherent route coupling is further aggravated by the routing protocol, which may provide an incomplete view of current network connectivity. Through analysis and simulation, we demonstrate the impact of route coupling on APR's delay performance in ad-hoc networks. In multiple channel environments, APR is able to provide a 20% reduction in end-to-end delay for bursty data streams. Though these gains are appreciable, they are about half what we would expect from APR with independently operating routes. Route coupling is so severe in single channel networks that APR provides only negligible improvements in quality of service.","","0-7803-6534-8","10.1109/MOBHOC.2000.869207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869207","","Load management;Ad hoc networks;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Bandwidth;Routing protocols;Performance analysis;Analytical models;Delay;Quality of service","","239","8","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Biometric features such as the face or a fingerprint can be stored on a microchip in a credit card, for example. A single feature, however, sometimes fails to be exact enough for identification. Another disadvantage of using only one feature is that the chosen feature is not always readable. Dialog Communication Systems (DCS AG) developed BioID, a multimodal identification system that uses three different features-face, voice, and lip movement-to identify people. With its three modalities, BioID achieves much greater accuracy than single-feature systems. Even if one modality is somehow disturbed-for example, if a noisy environment drowns out the voice-the ether two modalities still lead to an accurate identification. This article goes into detail about the system functions, explaining the data acquisition and preprocessing techniques for voice, facial, and lip imagery data. The authors also explain the classification principles used for optical features and the sensor fusion options (the combinations of the three results-face, voice, lip movement-to obtain varying levels of security).","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.820041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=820041","","Biometrics;Security;Fingerprint recognition;Credit cards;Distributed control;Working environment noise;Optical noise;Data acquisition;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical sensors","","238","7","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The method is generic in that it can accommodate various global motion models, from a simple translation to an eight-parameter perspective model. The algorithm is hierarchical and consists of three stages. In the first stage, a low-pass image pyramid is built. Then, an initial translation is estimated with full-pixel precision at the top of the pyramid using a modified n-step search matching. In the third stage, a gradient descent is executed at each level of the pyramid starting from the initial translation at the coarsest level. Due to the coarse initial estimation and the hierarchical implementation, the method is very fast. To increase robustness to outliers, we replace the usual formulation based on a quadratic error criterion with a truncated quadratic function. We have applied the algorithm to various test sequences within an MPEG-4 coding system. From the experimental results we conclude that global motion estimation provides significant performance gains for video material with camera zoom and/or pan. The gains result from a reduced prediction error and a more compact representation of motion. We also conclude that the robust error criterion can introduce additional performance gains without increasing computational complexity.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.826785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826785","","Robustness;Motion estimation;Video coding;Motion compensation;MPEG 4 Standard;Cameras;Video compression;Performance gain;Sprites (computer);Redundancy","","238","71","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, a nonlinear vehicle model is developed which both takes the acceleration and braking effects on the system dynamics into account and avoids using the complicated side force relation. Based on this model, a nonlinear input-output decoupling controller is first designed, by which the vehicle system can be decoupled into three two-order subsystems, i.e., the velocity subsystem controlled by the longitudinal acceleration/braking force, the lateral motion subsystem by the front steering angle, and the yaw motion subsystem by the rear steering angle, so that the load of the driver can be relieved. Especially, a new decoupling condition is derived. It is proved that a vehicle with the front wheel braking or rear wheel drive can always be decoupled provided it does not accelerate so fast or brake so hard that its front or rear wheels are lifted from the ground. Furthermore, in order to reduce the effects of the vehicle parameter variations on steering performance, a robust control scheme is proposed. The corresponding controller and observer gains can be obtained by solving two new Riccati algebraic equations. Meanwhile, by properly choosing the form of the observer, the robust controller does not destroy the decoupling structure of the longitudinal and yaw motions. The numerical simulation shows that the robust control with decoupling performance can improve safety and comfort of the vehicle driving.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.845885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845885","","Robust control;Acceleration;Motion control;Vehicle driving;Wheels;Road vehicles;Force control;Velocity control;Nonlinear control systems;Riccati equations","","237","2","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rapid progress in digital and RF technology is making possible highly compact and integrated terminal devices, and the introduction of sophisticated wireless data software is making wireless Internet access more user-friendly and providing more value. Transmission rates are currently only about 10 kb/s for large cell systems. Third-generation wireless access such as WCDMA and the evolution of second-generation systems such as TDMA IS-136+, EDGE, and CDMA IS-95 will provide nominal bit rates of 50-384 kb/s in macrocellular systems. This article discusses packet data transmission rates of 2-5 Mb/s in macrocellular environments and up to 10 Mb/s in microcellular and indoor environments as a complementary service to evolving second- and third-generation wireless systems. Dynamic packet assignment for high-efficiency resource management and packet admission; OFDM at the physical layer with interference suppression, space-time coding, and frequency diversity; as well as smart antennas to obtain good power and spectral efficiency are discussed in this proposal. Flexible allocation of both large and small resources also permits provisioning of services for different delay and throughput requirements.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.852035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852035","","Wideband;OFDM;Internet;Multiaccess communication;Resource management;Portable computers;Radio frequency;Time division multiple access;Bit rate;Data communication","","237","54","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We present a brief summary of existing results which indicates that most schemes require intermediaries (such as base stations) to monitor the TCP traffic and actively participate in flow control in order to enhance performance. Although these methods simulate end-to-end semantics, they do not comprise true end-to-end signaling. As a result, these techniques are not applicable when the IP payload is encrypted. For instance IPSEC, which is expected to be standard under IPv6, encrypts the entire IP payload making it impossible for intermediaries to monitor TCP traffic unless those entities are part of the security association. In addition, these schemes require changes (in the TCP/IP code) at intermediate nodes making it difficult for the mobile clients to inter-operate with the existing infrastructure. In this paper we explore the ""freeze-TCP"" mechanism which is a true end-to-end scheme and does not require the involvement of any intermediaries (such as base stations) for flow control. Furthermore, this scheme does not require any changes on the ""sender side"" or intermediate routers; changes in TCP code are restricted to the mobile client side, making it possible to fully inter-operate with the existing infrastructure. We then outline a method which integrates the best attributes of freeze-TCP and some existing solutions. Performance results highlight the importance of pro-active action/signaling by the mobile-host. The data indicate that in most cases, simply reacting to disconnections tends to yield lower performance than pro-active mechanisms such as freeze-TCP.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832552","","TCPIP;Base stations;Monitoring;Traffic control;Payloads;Cryptography;Sun;Security;Wireless networks;Wireless application protocol","","236","23","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the power systems field one uses the transformation applied to steady-state sinusoidal phasors in a nonunitary form for fault calculations. For time-domain calculations the real equivalent, 0, /spl alpha/, /spl beta/, is preferred, usually extended to 0, d, q-components. In network calculations, however, the application of time-dependent symmetrical components makes sense, since many net-component parameters are already available in this form. In this paper a short historical overview of the symmetrical-component transformation and the application of unitary and orthogonal transformations are presented. From these general transformations logic choices for base quantities necessary in per unit calculations are derived.

These faults correspond to a loss of actuator effectiveness or fault sensor measurements. After describing these faults, a fault estimation and compensation method was proposed. In addition to providing information to operators concerning the system operating conditions, the fault diagnosis module is especially important in fault-tolerant control systems where one needs to know exactly which element is faulty to react safely. The method's abilities to compensate for such faults are illustrated by applying it to a winding machine, which represents a subsystem of many industrial systems. The results show that once the fault is detected and isolated, it is easy to reduce its effect on the system, and process control is resumed with degraded performances close to nominal ones. Thus, stopping the system immediately can be avoided. However, the limits of this method are reached when there is the complete loss of an actuator. In this case, only a hardware redundancy is effective and could ensure performance reliability.

However, soil moisture retrieval studies based on these models have yielded inconsistent results, not so much because of the failure of the models themselves, but because of the complexity of natural surfaces and the difficulty in estimating appropriate input roughness parameters. In this paper, the authors address the issue of soil roughness characterization in the case of agricultural fields having different tillage (roughness) states by making use of an extensive multisite database of surface profiles collected using a novel laser profiler capable of recording profiles up to 25 m long. Using this dataset, the range of RMS height and correlation values associated with each agricultural roughness state is estimated, and the dependence of these estimates on profile length is investigated. The results show that at spatial scales equivalent to those of the SAR resolution cell, agricultural surface roughness characteristics are well described by the superposition of a single scale process related to the tillage state with a multiscale random fractal process related to field topography.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.841993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841993","","Soil;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface topography;Electromagnetic scattering;State estimation;Radar scattering;Scattering parameters;Electromagnetic modeling;Scanning probe microscopy","","230","1","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Physical models expressing radar observations in terms of parameters describing vegetated land surfaces are the foundation for parameter estimation techniques. Defining a general complex cross correlation enables the unified development of models for interferometry and polarimetry, including polarimetric interferometry. Three simple physical models in this paper express this complex cross correlation in terms of vegetation parameters: (1) a randomly oriented volume, (2) a randomly oriented volume with a ground return, and (3) an oriented volume. For the first two models the parameters include vegetation height, extinction coefficient, underlying topography, and another parameter depending on ground electrical properties and roughness. For the oriented volume, additional parameters depend on the refractivity, extinction coefficients, and backscattering characteristics of waves propagating along eigenpolarizations of the vegetation volume. The above models show that the interferometric cross-correlation amplitude and the polarimetric {HHHH/VVVV} ratio both change by about 1% per meter of vegetation height change, for experimental conditions typical of airborne and spaceborne interferometric radars. These vertical-structure sensitivities prompt a parameter estimation demonstration with two-baseline TOPSAR interferometric and zero-baseline polarimetric data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) Southern Study Area in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada. The demonstrations show the feasibility of measuring vegetation height to better than 4.2 m, underlying topography to better than 6.5 m, and the ratio of ground-to-volume power to better than 10%, using interferometry and polarimetry, coupled with parameter-constraining assumptions, concerning the degree of surface roughness. This paper suggests that single-baseline and multibaseline fully polarimetric interferometry have the potential to obviate the need for such assumptions, thereby making parameter estimation more robust, accurate, and realistic.","1944-799X","","10.1029/1999RS900108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7771061","","Radar polarimetry;Land surface;Surface topography;Vegetation mapping;Correlation;Vegetation","","230","","","","9 Dec 2016","","","AGU","AGU Journals"

This problem is motivated by service provider needs for fast deployment of bandwidth-guaranteed services and the consequent need in backbone networks for fast provisioning of bandwidth-guaranteed paths. Offline routing algorithms cannot be used since they require a priori knowledge of all tunnel requests that are to be routed. Instead, on-line algorithms that handle requests arriving one-by-one and that satisfy as many potential future demands as possible are needed. The newly developed algorithm is an on-line algorithm and is based on the idea that a newly routed tunnel must follow a route that does not ""interfere too much"" with a route that may be critical to satisfy a future demand. We show that this problem is NP-hard. We then develop a path selection heuristic that is based on the idea of deferred loading of certain ""critical"" links. These critical links are identified by the algorithm as links that, if heavily loaded, would make it impossible to satisfy future demands between certain ingress-egress pairs. Like min-hop routing, the presented algorithm uses link-state information and some auxiliary capacity information for path selection. Unlike previous algorithms, the proposed algorithm exploits any available knowledge of the network ingress-egress points of potential future demands even though the demands themselves are unknown.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832263","","Interference;Routing;Multiprotocol label switching;Bandwidth;Uninterruptible power systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Delay effects;Quality of service","","230","14","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key step in the procedure, which is motivated from energy-balance considerations standard in network modeling of physical systems, is to embed the system into a larger Hamiltonian system for which a series of Casimir functions can be easily constructed. Interestingly enough, for linear systems the resulting Lyapunov function is the incremental energy; thus our derivations provide a physical explanation to it. An easily verifiable necessary and sufficient condition for the applicability of the technique in the general nonlinear case is given.

System stability is analyzed by connecting the harmonic transfer functions of the different component models. This facilitates an object-oriented approach to modeling, which supports reuse of models. An analysis of the complete railway system is, of course, difficult. Several locomotives can be moving along the power distribution line at the same time, and depending on the distance between them, the interaction changes. The power consumption also changes, depending on operating modes. During normal operation, energy is consumed from the network, but as modern locomotives use electrical braking, the power flow changes direction during deceleration, and energy is delivered back to the grid. The inverter trains are not passive systems. The converters are controlled with only limited system knowledge (local measurements of currents and voltages), making analysis and control design an even bigger challenge.","1941-000X","","10.1109/37.856180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=856180","","Harmonic analysis;Object oriented modeling;Power system modeling;Frequency;Stability analysis;Joining processes;Transfer functions;Rail transportation;Power distribution lines","","228","","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Dispersion in direction can be characterized either by the direction power spectrum or by a family of spatial Doppler power spectra at the reception site. Two measures called the direction spread and the maximum spatial Doppler spread are introduced which describe the extent of channel dispersion in direction and in spatial Doppler frequency, respectively. Both measures are analogous to the delay and Doppler spreads, which are commonly employed to describe the extent of dispersion in delay and Doppler frequency, respectively. The relationships between the two approaches for characterizing spatial dispersion and especially between the direction and maximum spatial Doppler spreads are analytically established. The coherence distance at a certain level summarizes certain features of space selectivity in the radio channel which impact on the performance of communication systems. Two uncertainty relations between the direction spread and the coherence distance as well as between the maximum spatial Doppler spread and the coherence distance express the duality between direction dispersion and space selectivity. These relations are analogous to those established previously between the delay spread and the coherence bandwidth and between the Doppler spread and the coherence time. Examples relevant to mobile communications in the case where the waves propagate only horizontally illustrate the theoretical results. An application of these results to the design of uniform linear antenna arrays is also discussed.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.868476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868476","","Land mobile radio","","228","1","32","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Silicon, micromachined probes with multiple iridium oxide stimulating electrodes (400-1600 /spl mu/m/sup 2/) were implanted in guinea pig cortex. A 10-17 day post-operative recovery period was followed by five days of monopolar stimulation, two hours/electrode each day using biphasic constant current stimulation (5-100 /spl mu/A, 100 /spl mu/s/phase). EIS and CV data were taken before and after stimulation. The post stimulation impedance [at mid-range frequencies (100 Hz-100 kHz)] consistently and significantly decreased relative to prestimulation levels. Impedance magnitude increased permanently at low frequencies (<100 Hz), correlating to a change in the charge storage capacity (the area under a cyclic voltammagram). Impedance magnitude significantly increased during the recovery period, though this increase could be mostly reversed by applying small currents. A mathematical model of the electrode-tissue system impedance was used to analyze in vivo behavior. The data and modeling results shows that applying charge to the electrode can consistently reduce the impedance of the electrode-tissue system. Analysis of explanted probes suggests that the interaction between the tissue and electrode is dependent on whether chronic pulses were applied. It is hypothesized that the interface between the tissue and metal is altered by current pulsing, resulting in a temporary impedance shift.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.846685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846685","","Transistors;Electrodes;Probes;Frequency;Impedance measurement;Electric variables measurement;Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;Silicon;Mathematical model;In vivo","Animals;Biomedical Engineering;Cerebral Cortex;Electric Impedance;Electric Stimulation;Electrochemistry;Electrodes;Guinea Pigs;Iridium;Models, Neurological","228","17","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The matching system consists of two main blocks: The first allows for the extraction of essential information from the reference image off-line, the second performs the matching itself online. The information is obtained from the reference image by filtering and careful minutiae extraction procedures. The fingerprint identification is based on triangular matching to cope with the strong deformation of fingerprint images due to static friction or finger rolling. The matching is finally validated by dynamic time warping.

In the scheme, we use a path time delay estimation method to improve the accuracy of the correlation-based symbol synchronization methods, and use a delay-locked loop (DLL) to do the sampling clock synchronization. It is shown that by using this scheme, the mean square values of the symbol timing estimation error can be decreased by several orders of magnitude compared to the common correlation methods in both the AWGN and multipath fading channels. In addition, the scheme can track the symbol timing drift caused by the sampling clock frequency offsets.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.895033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895033","","Timing;Frequency synchronization;Sampling methods;Clocks;Fading;Delay effects;Delay estimation;OFDM modulation;Estimation error;Correlation","","227","29","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We start with a theoretical argument in favor of splines in the traditional formulation by showing that the optimal, curvature-constrained snake is a cubic spline, irrespective of the form of the external energy field. Unfortunately, such regularized snakes suffer from slow convergence speed because of a large number of control points, as well as from difficulties in determining the weight factors associated to the internal energies of the curve. We therefore propose an alternative formulation in which the intrinsic scale of the spline model is adjusted a priori; this leads to a reduction of the number of parameters to be optimized and eliminates the need for internal energies (i.e., the regularization term). In other words, we are now controlling the elasticity of the spline implicitly and rather intuitively by varying the spacing between the spline knots. The theory is embedded into a multiresolution formulation demonstrating improved stability in noisy image environments. Validation results are presented, comparing the traditional snake using internal energies and the proposed approach without internal energies, showing the similar performance of the latter. Several biomedical examples of applications are included to illustrate the versatility of the method.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.862624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862624","","Spline;Biomedical imaging;Convergence;Working environment noise;Application software;Physics computing;Associate members;Elasticity;Energy resolution;Image resolution","","227","9","51","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By using a survey instrument we investigate this claim further. The investigation addresses the following questions: 1) What are the components of software development risk? 2) how does risk management mitigate risk components, and 3) what environmental factors if any influence them? Using principal component analysis we identify six software risk components: 1) scheduling and timing risks, 2) functionality risks, 3) subcontracting risks, 4) requirements management, 5) resource usage and performance risks, and 6) personnel management risks. By using one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons we examine how risk management (or the lack of it) and environmental factors (such as development methods, manager's experience) influence each risk component. The analysis shows that awareness of the importance of risk management and systematic practices to manage risks have an effect on scheduling risks, requirements management risks, and personnel management risks. Environmental contingencies were observed to affect all risk components. This suggests that software risks can be best managed by combining specific risk management considerations with a detailed understanding of the environmental context and with sound managerial practices, such as relying on experienced and well-educated project managers and launching correctly sized projects.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.841112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841112","","Programming;Risk management;Environmental management;Project management;Environmental factors;Personnel;Analysis of variance;Instruments;Principal component analysis;Software performance","","227","3","48","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These are similar to the Daubechies orthonormal filters, but designed with the additional constraint that the filter group delay should be approximately one quarter of the sample period. The filters in the two trees are just the time-reverse of each other, as are the analysis and reconstruction filters. This leads to a transform, which can use shorter filters, which is orthonormal beyond level 1, and in which the two trees are very closely matched and have a more symmetric sub-sampling structure, but which preserves the key DT CWT advantages of approximate shift-invariance and good directional selectivity in multiple dimensions.","1522-4880","0-7803-6297-7","10.1109/ICIP.2000.899397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899397","","Wavelet transforms;Delay;Discrete wavelet transforms;Continuous wavelet transforms;Sampling methods;Nonlinear filters;Signal processing;Image reconstruction;Matched filters;Image analysis","","226","1","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We argue that for synthesis to be practical, it is essential to synthesize a circuit using the same simulation environment created to validate the circuit. In this paper, we develop a new numerical search algorithm efficient enough to allow full circuit simulation of each circuit candidate, and robust enough to find good solutions for difficult circuits.

Most commercial fault-tolerant computers use fully replicated hardware components to detect microprocessor faults. The components are lockstepped (cycle-by-cycle synchronized) to ensure that, in each cycle, they perform the same operation on the same inputs, producing the same outputs in the absence of faults. Unfortunately, for a given hardware budget, full replication reduces performance by statically partitioning resources among redundant operations. We demonstrate that a Simultaneous and Redundantly Threaded (SRT) processor-derived from a a Simultaneous Multithreaded (SMT) processor-provides transient fault coverage with significantly higher performance. An SRT processor provides transient fault coverage by running identical copies for the same program simultaneously as independent threads. An SRT processor provides higher performance because it dynamically schedules its hardware resources among the redundant copies. However, dynamic scheduling makes is difficult to implement lockstepping, because corresponding instructions from redundant threads may not execute in the same cycle or in the same order. This paper makes four contributions to the design of SRT processors. First, we introduce the concept of the sphere of replication, which abstract both the physical redundancy of a lockstepped system and the logical redundancy of an SRT processor. This framework aids in identifying the scope of fault coverage and the input and output values requiring special handling. Second, we identify two viable spheres of replication in an SRT processor, and show that one of them provides fault detection while checking only committed stores and uncached loads. Third, we identify the need for consistent replication of load values, and propose and evaluate two new mechanisms for satisfying this requirement. Finally, we propose and evaluate two mechanisms-slack fetch and branch outcome queue-that enhance the performance of an SRT processor by allowing one thread to prefetch cache misses and branch results for the other thread. Our results with 11 SPEC95 benchmarks show that an SRT processor can outperform an equivalently sized, on-chip, hardware-replicated solution by 16% on average, with maximum benefit of up to 29%.","1063-6897","1-58113-232-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=854375","","Fault detection;Multithreading;Hardware;Yarn;Microprocessors;Dynamic scheduling;Redundancy;Fault diagnosis;Voltage;Noise reduction","","225","33","21","","2 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The influence of different antennas (dipole, monopole, whip, and planar inverted F antenna) on the power absorption and on the consequent tissue heating has then been analyzed. The obtained results show for a radiated power of 600 mW, maximum SAR values, averaged over 1 g, from 2.2 to 3.7 W/kg depending on the considered phone. The maximum temperature increases are obtained in the ear and vary from 0.22/spl deg/C to 0.43/spl deg/C, while the maximum temperature increases in the brain lie from 0.08/spl deg/C to 0.19/spl deg/C. These steady-state temperature increases are obtained after about 50 min of exposure, with a time constant of approximately 6 min.

Basedonthe Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for infinite-horizon, discounted reward problems, we derive algorithms for estimating value functions and improving policies with the use of function approximators. The process of value function estimation is formulated as the minimization of a continuous-time form of the temporal difference (TD) error. Update methods based on backward Euler approximation and exponential eligibility traces are derived, and their correspondences with the conventional residual gradient, TD (0), and TD (λ) algorithms are shown. For policy improvement, two methods—a continuous actor-critic method and a value-gradient-based greedy policy—are formulated. As a special case of the latter, a nonlinear feedback control law using the value gradient and the model of the input gain is derived. The advantage updating, a model-free algorithm derived previously, is also formulated in the HJB-based framework. The performance of the proposed algorithms is first tested in a nonlinear control task of swinging a pendulum up with limited torque. It is shown in the simulations that (1) the task is accomplished by the continuous actor-critic method in a number of trials several times fewer than by the conventional discrete actor-critic method; (2) among the continuous policy update methods, the value-gradient-based policy with a known or learned dynamic model performs several times better than the actor-critic method; and (3) a value function update using exponential eligibility traces is more efficient and stable than that based on Euler approximation. The algorithms are then tested in a higher-dimensional task: cart-pole swing-up. This task is accomplished in several hundred trials using the value-gradient-based policy with a learned dynamic model.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976600300015961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6789455","","","","224","8","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

For each space, we use the single Gaussian model based on the Mahalanobis metric and a Gaussian mixture density model to segment faces from scene backgrounds. In the case of the mixture density model, the skin chrominance distribution is estimated by use of the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. Feature extraction is performed on the segmented images by use of invariant Fourier-Mellin moments. A multilayer perceptron neural network (NN), with the invariant moments as the input vector, is then applied to distinguish faces from distractors. With the single Gaussian model, normalized color spaces are shown to produce the best segmentation results, and subsequently the highest rate of face detection. The results are comparable to those obtained with the more sophisticated mixture density model. However, the mixture density model improves the segmentation and face detection results significantly for most of the un-normalized color spaces. Ultimately, we show that, for each chrominance space, the detection efficiency depends on the capacity of each model to estimate the skin chrominance distribution and, most importantly, on the discriminability between skin and ""non-skin"" distributions.","","0-7695-0580-5","10.1109/AFGR.2000.840612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840612","","Skin;Face detection;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Neural networks;Image analysis;Performance analysis;Humans;Layout;Feature extraction","","223","4","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The clipping is performed on the OFDM signals sampled at the Nyquist rate, followed by the ideal low-pass filter, Since the low-pass filter considerably enlarges the PAPR, there is a severe limitation in PAPR reduction capability. Thus, in order to achieve further reduction of the PAPR, the application of the adaptive symbol selection scheme is also considered. It is shown that the significant PAPR reduction with moderate complexity can be achieved by the combination of the clipping and the adaptive symbol selection. The price to be paid for PAPR reduction by this scheme is its performance degradation. The paper theoretically analyzes the bit error rate performance of the OFDM system with the Nyquist-rate clipping combined with the adaptive symbol selection, and considers the use of the forward error correction for compensation of the degradation. It is shown that even though the clipping scheme causes severe loss in required signal-to-noise ratio, the use of a powerful channel coding scheme such as turbo codes significantly alleviates the bit error rate performance degradation.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.895032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895032","","Peak to average power ratio;OFDM;Degradation;Low pass filters;Bit error rate;Error analysis;Performance analysis;Forward error correction;Signal to noise ratio;Channel coding","","222","","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It can be exploited for oceanic surface current measurements from aircraft or spacecraft. However, as already discussed in previous publications, the mean Doppler frequency of the radar backscatter from the ocean is not exclusively determined by the mean surface current, but it includes contributions associated with surface wave motion. The authors present an efficient new model for the simulation of Doppler spectra and ATI signatures. The model is based on Bragg scattering theory in a composite surface model approach. They show that resulting Doppler spectra are consistent with predictions of an established model based on fundamental electrodynamic expressions, while computation times are reduced by more than one order of magnitude. This can be a key advantage with regard to operational applications of ATI. Based on model calculations for two simple current fields and various wind conditions and radar configurations, they study theoretical possibilities and limitations of oceanic current measurements by ATI. They find that best results can be expected from ATI systems operated at high microwave frequencies like 10 GHz (X band), high incidence angles like 60/spl deg/, low platform altitude/speed ratios, and vertical (VV) polarization. The ATI time lag should be chosen long enough to obtain measurable phase differences, but much shorter than the decorrelation time of the backscattered field.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.823940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=823940","","Radar imaging;Sea surface;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry;Sea measurements;Phase measurement;Radar scattering;Current measurement;Surface waves;Velocity measurement;Doppler shift","","221","","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Bragg gratings formed in optical fibers in multimode propagation show multiple reflection peaks or multiple transmission dips in the reflection or transmission spectra, respectively. For standard graded-index multimode fiber, the number of reflection peaks of a Bragg grating depends on excitation condition of propagating modes. The number of reflection peaks of a Bragg grating at around 1.55 /spl mu/m is 19 for highly multimode excitation and 3-4 for lower order mode excitation. We analyze the phase-matching conditions of the propagating modes and identify half of the reflection peaks as the reflection to the same mode and the rest as the reflection to the neighboring modes. In dispersion-shifted fiber, a Bragg grating at around 0.8 /spl mu/m in three-mode propagation shows three reflection peaks in the reflection spectrum. The temperature dependence of each reflection peak is similar to that of a conventional Bragg grating in single-mode fiber. Polarization dependence measured on a Bragg grating in multimode graded-index fiber is negligible. An advantage of Bragg gratings in multimode fiber (MMF) and the applications are discussed.","1558-2213","","10.1109/50.822797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=822797","","Fiber gratings;Bragg gratings;Optical fibers;Optical reflection;Optical fiber polarization;Optical propagation;Frequency conversion;Optical frequency conversion;Optical fiber dispersion;Temperature dependence","","220","4","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem is motivated by the service provider needs for fast deployment of bandwidth guaranteed services. Offline routing algorithms cannot be used since they require a priori knowledge of all tunnel requests that are to be rooted. Instead, on-line algorithms that handle requests arriving one by one and that satisfy as many potential future demands as possible are needed. The newly developed algorithms are on-line algorithms and are based on the idea that a newly routed tunnel must follow a route that does not ""interfere too much"" with a route that may he critical to satisfy a future demand. We show that this problem is NP-hard. We then develop path selection heuristics which are based on the idea of deferred loading of certain ""critical"" links. These critical links are identified by the algorithm as links that, if heavily loaded, would make it impossible to satisfy future demands between certain ingress-egress pairs. Like min-hop routing, the presented algorithm uses link-state information and some auxiliary capacity information for path selection. Unlike previous algorithms, the proposed algorithm exploits any available knowledge of the network ingress-egress points of potential future demands, even though the demands themselves are unknown. If all nodes are ingress-egress nodes, the algorithm can still be used, particularly to reduce the rejection rate of requests between a specified subset of important ingress-egress pairs. The algorithm performs well in comparison to previously proposed algorithms on several metrics like the number of rejected demands and successful rerouting of demands upon link failure.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.898737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898737","","Interference;Bandwidth;Multiprotocol label switching;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service;Routing protocols;Protection;Spine","","219","9","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There exist all sorts of different demand management programs that utilities use. A critical issue is the incentive paid to the customer to participate in demand management programs and provide load relief. The utility has to design cost effective yet attractive demand management contracts. The main goal is to get load relief when needed, and to do so in a cost effective way. Customers sign up for programs when the benefits they derive in the form of up front payments, demand discounts and interruption payments exceed their cost of interruption. In order to design such contracts, mechanism design with the revelation principle is adopted from game theory and applied to the interaction between a utility and its customers. The idea behind mechanism design is to design an incentive structure that encourages customers to sign up for the right contract and reveal their true value of power (and thus, the value of power interruptibility).","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.898098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898098","","Contracts;Game theory;Pricing;Power system management;Energy management;Disaster management;Cost function;Load management;Power system security","","219","4","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective is to assign calls to wavelengths in a way that minimizes the total cost of electronic equipment [e.g., the number of SONET add/drop multiplexers (ADM's)]. We show that the general traffic grooming problem is NP-complete. However, for some special cases we obtain algorithms that result in a significant reduction in the number of ADM's. When the traffic from all nodes is destined to a single node, and all traffic rates are the same, we obtain a solution that minimizes the number of ADM's. In the more general case of all-to-all uniform frame we obtain a lower bound on the number of ADM's required, and provide a heuristic algorithm that performs closely to that bound. To account for more realistic traffic scenarios, we also consider distance dependent traffic, where the traffic load between two nodes is inversely proportional to the distance between them, and again provide a nearly optimal heuristic algorithm that results in substantial ADM savings. Finally, we consider the use of a hub node, where traffic can be switched between different wavelength, and obtain an optimal algorithm which minimizes the number of ADM's by efficiently multiplexing and switching the traffic at the hub. Moreover, we show that any solution not using a hub can be transformed into a solution with a hub using fewer or the same number of ADM's.","1558-2213","","10.1109/50.818901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=818901","","WDM networks;Telecommunication traffic;Costs;Intelligent networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;SONET;Optical fiber devices;Laboratories;Heuristic algorithms;Add-drop multiplexers","","219","3","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This representation significantly simplifies the solution to navigation problems, by eliminating any perspective effects. The nature of each navigation task is taken into account when designing the required navigation skills and environmental representations. We propose two main navigation modalities: topological navigation and visual path following. Topological navigation is used for traveling long distances and does not require knowledge of the exact position of the robot but rather, a qualitative position on the topological map. The navigation process combines appearance based methods and visual servoing upon some environmental features. Visual path following is required for local, very precise navigation, e.g., door traversal, docking. The robot is controlled to follow a prespecified path accurately, by tracking visual landmarks in bird's eye views of the ground plane. By clearly separating the nature of these navigation tasks, a simple and yet powerful navigation system is obtained.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.897802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897802","","Navigation;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Motion planning;Animals;Mobile robots;Visual servoing;Biology computing;Robustness;Insects","","218","25","34","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In analogy to projection pursuit, EP seeks to learn an optimal basis for the dual purpose of data compression and pattern classification. It should increase the generalization ability of the learning machine as a result of seeking the trade-off between minimizing the empirical risk encountered during training and narrowing the confidence interval for reducing the guaranteed risk during testing. It therefore implements strategies characteristic of GA for searching the space of possible solutions to determine the optimal basis. It projects the original data into a lower dimensional whitened principal component analysis (PCA) space. Directed random rotations of the basis vectors in this space are searched by GA where evolution is driven by a fitness function defined by performance accuracy (empirical risk) and class separation (confidence interval). Accuracy indicates the extent to which learning has been successful, while separation gives an indication of expected fitness. The method has been tested on face recognition using a greedy search algorithm. To assess both accuracy and generalization capability, the data includes for each subject images acquired at different times or under different illumination conditions. EP has better recognition performance than PCA (eigenfaces) and better generalization abilities than the Fisher linear discriminant (Fisherfaces).","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.862196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862196","","Face recognition;Principal component analysis;Testing;Pattern classification;Machine learning;Genetic algorithms;Image coding;Data compression;Lighting;Displays","","218","7","43","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, a clustering algorithm simulating a visual system may solve some basic problems in these areas of research. From this point of view, we propose a new approach to data clustering by modeling the blurring effect of lateral retinal interconnections based on scale space theory. In this approach, a data set is considered as an image with each light point located at a datum position. As we blur this image, smaller light blobs merge into larger ones until the whole image becomes one light blob at a low enough level of resolution. By identifying each blob with a cluster, the blurring process generates a family of clustering along the hierarchy. The advantages of the proposed approach are: 1) The derived algorithms are computationally stable and insensitive to initialization and they are totally free from solving difficult global optimization problems. 2) It facilitates the construction of new checks on cluster validity and provides the final clustering a significant degree of robustness to noise in data and change in scale. 3) It is more robust in cases where hyperellipsoidal partitions may not be assumed. 4) it is suitable for the task of preserving the structure and integrity of the outliers in the clustering process. 5) The clustering is highly consistent with that perceived by human eyes. 6) The new approach provides a unified framework for scale-related clustering algorithms derived from many different fields such as estimation theory, recurrent signal processing on self-organization feature maps, information theory and statistical mechanics, and radial basis function neural networks.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.895974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895974","","Signal processing algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Humans;Eyes;Noise robustness;Filtering;Pattern recognition;Image processing;Image analysis;Pattern analysis","","216","1","39","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, by input-output feedback linearization, the system is linearized and a state feedback control law is obtained by pole placement. With this control scheme, output voltage responses become faster than those in a conventional cascade control structure. For robust control to parameter variations, integrators are added to the exact feedback control law. Since the fast voltage control is feasible for load changes, it is shown that the DC electrolytic capacitor size can be reduced. In addition, the capacitor current is analyzed for size reduction of the capacitor. As is usual with PWM converters, the input current is regulated to be sinusoidal and the source power factor can be controlled at unity.

It is demonstrated that the steady-state optimization of engine emissions results in operating points where EGR and VGT actuators are in effect redundant in their effect on the variables that most directly affect the emissions.

This creates a need for an accurate instantaneous-load forecast for the next several dozen minutes. This paper presents a novel approach to very short-time load forecasting by the application of artificial neural networks to model load dynamics. The proposed algorithm is more robust as compared to the traditional approach when actual loads are forecasted and used as input variables. It provides more reliable forecasts, especially when the weather conditions are different from those represented in the training data. The proposed method has been successfully implemented and used for online load forecasting in a power utility in the United States. To assure robust performance and training times acceptable for online use, the forecasting system was implemented as a set of parsimoniously designed neural networks. Each network was assigned a task of forecasting load for a particular time lead and for a certain period of day with a unique pattern in load dynamics. Some details of this are presented in the paper.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.852131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852131","","Load forecasting;Artificial neural networks;Weather forecasting;Robustness;Power markets;Power generation;Economic forecasting;Load modeling;Predictive models;Heuristic algorithms","","214","3","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The size of these representations imposes limits on applications for which complex 3D models must be accessed remotely. Techniques for simplifying and compressing 3D models reduce the transmission time. Multiresolution formats provide quick access to a crude model and then refine it progressively. Unfortunately, compared to the best nonprogressive compression methods, previously proposed progressive refinement techniques impose a significant overhead when the full resolution model must be downloaded. The CPM (compressed progressive meshes) approach proposed here eliminates this overhead. It uses a new technique, which refines the topology of the mesh in batches, which each increase the number of vertices by up to 50 percent. Less than an amortized total of 4 bits per triangle encode where and how the topological refinements should be applied. We estimate the position of new vertices from the positions of their topological neighbors in the less refined mesh using a new estimator that leads to representations of vertex coordinates that are 50 percent more compact than previously reported progressive geometry compression techniques.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.841122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841122","","Geometry;Solid modeling;Graphics;Workstations;Aerospace industry;Inspection;Databases;Image coding;Computer Society;Shape","","214","14","38","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traffic delays and congestion, in general, increase travel time and have a negative economic impart. We analyze the kinematics of the vehicles involved in a lane changing/merging maneuver, and study the conditions under which lane changing/merging crashes can be avoided. That is, given a particular lane change/merge scenario, we calculate the minimum longitudinal spacing which the vehicles involved should initially have so that no collision, of any type, takes place during the maneuver. Simulations of a number of examples of lane changing maneuvers are used to demonstrate the results. The results of this paper could be used to assess the safety of lane changing maneuvers and provide warnings or take evasive actions to avoid collision when combined with appropriate hardware on board of vehicles.","1939-9359","","10.1109/25.901899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=901899","","Collision avoidance;Merging;Vehicle crash testing;Vehicles;Vehicle safety;Road transportation;Road accidents;Delay effects;Kinematics;Hardware","","214","3","10","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Achieving bidirectional flow of power using the same power components provides a simple, efficient and galvanically isolated topology that is specially attractive for use in battery charge/discharge circuits in DC UPS. The DC mains (provided by the AC mains), when presented, powers the down stream load converters and the bidirectional converter which essentially operates in the buck mode to charge the battery to a nominal value of 48 V. On failure of the DC mains (derived from the AC mains), the converter operation is comparable to that of a boost and the battery regulates the bus voltage and thereby provides power to the downstream converters. Small signal and steady state analyses are presented for this specific application. The design of a laboratory prototype is included. Experimental results from the prototype, under different operating conditions, validate and evaluate the proposed topology. An efficiency of 86.6% is achieved in the battery charging mode and 90% when the battery provides load power.

For example, a low-performance biometric is probably sufficient for reducing-as opposed to eliminating-fraud. Likewise, completely replacing an existing security system with a biometric-based one may require a high-performance biometric system, or the required performance may be beyond what current technology can provide.

In this paper we present a systematic analysis of such bifurcations through a normal form: the piecewise linear approximation in the neighborhood of the border. We show that there can be many qualitatively different types of border collision bifurcations, depending on the parameters of the normal form. We present a partitioning of the parameter space of the normal form showing the regions where different types of bifurcations occur.

In parallel and in the context of an accelerating trend towards deregulation of the electric industry, the unbundling of services, many grouped under ancillary services, should create a market for some of these services. This paper discusses the potential of distributed generation (DG) to provide some of these services. In particular, DG can serve locally as the equivalent of a spinning reserve and voltage support of the AC bus. The main types of distributed generation with emphasis on the power electronic interface and the configurations appropriate to provide ancillary services are reviewed. The flexibility and features provided by the power electronic interface are illustrated. In addition to control of the real power, other functions can be incorporated into the design of the interface to provide services, such as reactive power, and resources associated with power quality. These include voltage sag compensation and harmonic filtering.

GP can discover relationships and express them mathematically. GP-based techniques have an advantage over statistical methods because they are distribution-free, i.e., no prior knowledge is needed about the statistical distribution of the data. GP also automatically discovers the discriminant features for a class. GP has been applied for two-category classification. A methodology for GP-based n-class classification is developed. The problem is modeled as n two-class problems, and a genetic programming classifier expression (GPCE) is evolved as a discriminant function for each class. The GPCE is trained to recognize samples belonging to its own class and reject others. A strength of association (SA) measure is computed for each GPCE to indicate the degree to which it can recognize samples of its own class. SA is used for uniquely assigning a class to an input feature vector. Heuristic rules are used to prevent a GPCE with a higher SA from swamping one with a lower SA. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the applicability of GP for multicategory classification, and they are found to be satisfactory. We also discuss the various issues that arise in our approach to GP-based classification, such as the creation of training sets, the role of incremental learning, and the choice of function set in the evolution of GPCE, as well as conflict resolution for uniquely assigning a class.","1941-0026","","10.1109/4235.873235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=873235","","Genetic programming;Pattern classification;Satellites;Gaussian distribution;Artificial neural networks;Biomedical computing;Statistical analysis;Statistical distributions;Microprocessors;Laboratories","","209","","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rationale behind the filtering strategy and the level of averaging needed is explained in terms of the observed multitemporal behavior of forest and nonforest areas, much of this analysis is generic and applicable to a wide range of situation in which significant information is carried by multitemporal features of the data. The choice of decision rules is based on the forest observations, with the added requirement for robustness.

The paper considers BPSK signalling in flat, quasi-static channels. Rayleigh or Rice fading is assumed for the SOI, while CCI is assumed subject to Rayleigh fading. Channels associated with interference sources are assumed independent and identically distributed. Using a multivariate statistical analysis approach and assuming equal-power interference sources, analytical expressions are derived for the density function of the array output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), the outage probability, and the average probability of bit error with maximal ratio combining.

The proposed method is based on the layout optimization to minimize the series resistance of the inductor coil, taking into account both ohmic losses, due to conduction currents, and magnetically induced losses, due to eddy currents. The technique is particularly useful when applied to inductors in which the fabrication process includes integration substrate removal. However, it is also applicable to inductors on low-loss substrates. The method optimizes the width of the metal strip for each turn of the inductor coil, leading to a variable strip-width layout. The optimization procedure has been successfully applied to the design of square spiral inductors in a silicon-based multichip-module technology, complemented with silicon micromachining postprocessing. The obtained experimental results corroborate the validity of the proposed method. A Q factor of about 17 have been obtained for a 35-nH inductor at 1.5 GHz, with Q values higher than 40 predicted for a 20-nH inductor working at 3.5 GHz.

The best benign versus malignant classification of 82.1%, with an area (A/sub z/) of 0.85 under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, was obtained with the images from the MIAS database by using GCM-based texture features computed from mass margins. The classification method used is based on posterior probabilities computed from Mahalanobis distances. The corresponding accuracy using jack-knife classification was observed to be 74.4%, with A/sub x/=0.67. Gradient-based features achieved A/sub x/=0.6 on the MIAS database and A/sub z/=0.76 on the combined database. The corresponding values obtained using jack-knife classification were observed to be 0.52 and 0.73 for the MIAS and combined databases, respectively.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.887618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887618","","Spatial databases;Benign tumors;Malignant tumors;Image databases;Breast cancer;Data mining;Mammography;Biopsy;Biomedical engineering;Image texture analysis","Breast Neoplasms;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Mammography;ROC Curve;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","206","1","37","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these approaches can be, and in many cases have been, replaced by probabilistic methods that are able to respond to the actual stochastic factors that influence the reliability of the system. In the days of global, completely integrated and/or nationalized electricity supply industries, the only significant objective was the reliability seen by actual end users. Also, the system was structured in a relatively simple way such that generation, transmission, and distribution could be assessed as a series of sequential hierarchical levels. Failures at any level could cause interruptions of supply to the end user. All planning and operational criteria were intended to minimize such interruptions within economic limits. The system has been, or is being, restructured and now many individual parties are involved, often competitively, including generators, network owners, network operators, energy suppliers, regulators, as well as the end users. Each of these parties has a need to know the quality and performance of the system sector or subsector for which they are responsible. Therefore, there is now a need for a range of reliability measures; the actual measure(s) needed varying between the different system parties. This paper addresses these issues and, in particular, reviews existing approaches and how these may be used and/or adapted to suit the needs and the required indexes of the new competitive industry and the different parties associated with it.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.823995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=823995","","Power systems;Power system reliability;Power system modeling;Electricity supply industry;Power generation economics;Stochastic systems;Large-scale systems;Electronic switching systems;Power generation;Costs","","203","","52","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional techniques, such as chopping or correlated double sampling, reduce the effect of 1/f noise in electronic circuits, whereas the switched biasing technique reduces the 1/f noise itself. Whereas noise reduction techniques generally lead to more power consumption, switched biasing can reduce the power consumption. It exploits an intriguing physical effect: cycling a MOS transistor from strong inversion to accumulation reduces its intrinsic 1/f noise. As the 1/f noise is reduced at its physical roots, high frequency circuits, in which 1/f noise is being upconverted, can also benefit. This is demonstrated by applying switched biasing in a 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS sawtooth oscillator. By periodically switching off the bias currents, during time intervals that they are not contributing to the circuit operation, a reduction of the 1/f noise induced phase noise by more than 8 dB is achieved, while the power consumption is also reduced by 30%.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.848208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848208","","MOSFET circuits;Power MOSFET;Noise reduction;Energy consumption;Circuit noise;Switching circuits;Phase noise;Sampling methods;Electronic circuits;Frequency","","202","19","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) cause problems to the systems. In power grids, transformers may be saturated due to GIC resulting in harmful effects and possibly even to a collapse of the whole system, as occurred in Quebec in March 1989. Transformers may also suffer from permanent damage. In buried pipelines, GIC can enhance corrosion and interfere with corrosion control surveys. Telecommunication systems as well as railway equipment may also malfunction due to GIC. The electric and magnetic fields observed at the Earth's surface primarily depend on magnetospheric-ionospheric currents and secondarily on currents induced in the Earth. The physical background and modeling of GIC are discussed in this paper. Special attention is paid to basic principles necessarily understood to get an insight into GIC phenomena.

Most companies want to transform their applications to meet new business demands, but because legacy systems tend to be unwieldy, monolithic, and inflexible, many firms regard modernization as somewhere between improbable and impossible. Reeling from the Y2K debacle and saddled with years of application backlog, the most these companies can hope for is to keep their legacy system alive. And keeping it alive is getting more expensive. It is also becoming harder to find qualified personnel to do the maintenance. All of this makes it difficult to add new functionality and keep up with business requirements. The ideal solution is to transform legacy systems to newer, more productive platforms so that companies can exploit faster and cheaper development technologies, like Java and XML (Extensible Markup Language). The focus then shifts to functionality, not the infrastructure, which means a company can respond more quickly to its changing business requirements and technology enhancements. RescueWare, legacy transformation software from Relativity Technologies, breaks business knowledge into stand-alone pieces, or e-components. The e-components are basically collections of objects that perform specific business services, have clearly defined application program interfaces (APIs), and are accessible through modern industry-standard protocols.","1941-045X","","10.1109/6294.846201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=846201","","Companies;Enterprise resource planning;Mission critical systems;Personnel;Java;XML;Computer architecture;Encapsulation;Merging;Software performance","","202","14","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To address these limitations, in this paper we present a vigorous optimization formulation of the learning process and solve the problem in a principled way. By using Lagrange multipliers, we have derived explicit solutions, which are both optimal and fast to compute. Extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art techniques have been performed.

We address the network vulnerabilities problem with test cases, which amount to attack scenarios, generated by a model checker. We encode the vulnerabilities in a state machine description suitable for a model checker and then assert that an attacker cannot acquire a given privilege on a given host.

The parameters of the proposed simulated annealing based power system stabilizer (SAPSS) are optimized in order to shift the system electromechanical modes at different loading conditions and system configurations simultaneously to the left in the s-plane. Incorporation of SA as a derivative-free optimization technique in PSS design significantly reduces the computational burden. One of the main advantages of the proposed approach is its robustness to the initial parameter settings. In addition, the quality of the optimal solution does not rely on the initial guess. The performance of the proposed SAPSS under different disturbances and loading conditions is investigated for two multimachine power systems. The eigenvalue analysis and the nonlinear simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed SAPSS's to damp out the local as well as the interarea modes and enhance greatly the system stability over a wide range of loading conditions and system configurations.","1558-0059","","10.1109/60.875496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875496","","Robustness;Power systems;Power system simulation;Simulated annealing;Design optimization;Power system stability;Computational modeling;Power system analysis computing;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Analytical models","","200","","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important feature of the optimizing interior point LP algorithm is that it can detect infeasibility of the SCED problem reliably. This feature is particularly important in SCED applications since line overloading following a contingency often results in an infeasible schedule. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 24 bus test system and a practical 175 bus network.

Where should watermarks be embedded in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain in order for the invisible image watermarks to be robust? Though many papers in the literature agree that watermarks should be embedded in perceptually significant components, dc components are explicitly excluded from watermark embedding. In this letter, a new embedding strategy for watermarking is proposed based on a quantitative analysis on the magnitudes of DCT components of host images. We argue that more robustness can be achieved if watermarks are embedded in dc components since dc components have much larger perceptual capacity than any ac components. Based on this idea, an adaptive watermarking algorithm is presented. We incorporate the feature of texture masking and luminance masking of the human visual system into watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that the invisible watermarks embedded with the proposed watermark algorithm are very robust.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.867936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=867936","","Watermarking;Discrete cosine transforms;Discrete transforms;Humans;Visual system;Noise robustness;Image analysis;Random sequences;Image coding;Video compression","","200","4","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MCN can reduce the required number of bases or improve the throughput performance, while limiting path vulnerability encountered in ad-hoc networks. In addition, MCN and SCN are analyzed, in terms of mean hop count, hop-by-hop throughput, end-to-end throughput, and mean number of channels (i.e. simultaneous transmissions) under different traffic localities and transmission ranges. Numerical results demonstrate that the throughput of MCN exceeds that of SCN, the former also increases as the transmission range decreases.

Increasing the capacitance with a current-mode multiplier allows the circuit to occupy less silicon area and to more effectively drive capacitive loads. Reducing physical area requirements while producing the same or perhaps better performance is especially useful in complex systems where most, if not all, functions are integrated onto a single integrated circuit. Die area in such systems is a luxury. The increasing demand for mobile battery-operated devices is a driving force toward higher integration. The enhanced Miller-compensation technique developed in this paper helps enable higher integration while being readily applicable to any process technology, be it CMOS, bipolar, or BiCMOS. Furthermore, the technique applies, in general, to amplifier circuits in feedback configuration. Experimentally, the integrated linear regulator (fabricated in a 1-/spl mu/m BiCMOS process technology) proved to be stable for a wide variety of loading conditions: load currents of up to 200 mA, equivalent series resistance of up to 3 /spl Omega/, and load capacitors ranging from 1.5 nF to 20 /spl mu/E The total quiescent current flowing through the regulator was less than 30 /spl mu/A during zero load-current conditions.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.818917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=818917","","Capacitors;Frequency;Regulators;Integrated circuit technology;Impedance;Resistors;Silicon;CMOS technology;BiCMOS integrated circuits;Transconductors","","199","16","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But questions remain as to why FPGAs have been so much more successful than their microprocessor and DSP counterparts. Do FPGA architectures have inherent advantages? Or are these examples just flukes of technology and market pricing? Will advantages increase, decrease, or remain the same as technology advances?

The feedback mechanism between vehicles is the measurement of the global variables and broadcast of their integrated values. More generally, the methods presented allow the designer to determine what explicit communication strategies are sufficient for a stabilizing decentralized control to exist. Using a simplified model, we showed that it is indeed possible to regulate global variables of a platoon of autonomous underwater vehicles, in particular, the center of the platoon and the distribution of the vehicles about the center. A relatively small amount of explicit communication is required between vehicles and that no vehicle must regulate its actual position.

Subsequently, a method is proposed for computing the PAPR by minimum-distance decoding of C at many points of time. Moreover an upper bound on the error between this computed value and the true one is derived. Analogous results are established for codes defined over arbitrary signal constellations. As an application of this computational method, an approach for reducing the PAPR of C proposed by Jones and Wilkinson (1996) is revisited. This approach is based on introducing a specific phase shift to each coordinate of all the codewords where phase shifts are independent of the codewords and known both to the transmitter and the receiver. We optimize the phase shifts offline by applying our method for computing the PAPR for the coding scenario proposed by the ETSI BRAN Standardization Committee. Reductions of order 4.5 dB can be freely obtained using the computed phase shifts. Examples are provided showing that most of the gain is preserved when the computed optimal phase shifts are rounded to quantenary phase-shift keying (PSK), 8-PSK, and 16-PSK type phase shifts.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.818871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=818871","","Peak to average power ratio;Decoding;Phase shift keying;Upper bound;Constellation diagram;Computer applications;Transmitters;Optimization methods;Telecommunication standards;Standardization","","199","16","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the dynamic nature of the mobile nodes, their association and dissociation to and from clusters perturb the stability of the system, and hence a reconfiguration of the system is unavoidable. At the same time it is vital to keep the topology stable as long as possible. The clusterheads, which form a dominant set in the network, decide the topology and are responsible for its stability. In this paper, we propose a weighted clustering algorithm (WCA) which takes into consideration the ideal degree, transmission power, mobility and battery power of a mobile node. We try to keep the number of nodes in a cluster around a pre-defined threshold to facilitate the optimal operation of the medium access control (MAC) protocol, Our clusterhead election procedure is not periodic as in earlier research, but adapts based on the dynamism of the nodes. This on-demand execution of WCA aims to maintain the stability of the network, thus lowering the computation and communication costs associated with it. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of WCA in terms of the number of clusterheads, reaffiliation frequency and dominant set updates, Results show that the WCA performs better than the existing algorithms and is also tunable to different types of ad hoc networks.","","0-7803-6451-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2000.891926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891926","","Clustering algorithms;Stability;Network topology;Media Access Protocol;Spread spectrum communication;Packet radio networks;Batteries;Access protocols;Nominations and elections;Computer networks","","197","3","10","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we present the design of linearly chirped fiber gratings (reflection configurations) and linearly chirped intermodal couplers (transmission configurations) to work as real-time spectrum analyzers. The proposed systems are shown to work properly by means of simulation tools. Furthermore, we use joint time-frequency signal representations to get a better understanding of the physical processes that determine the behavior of these systems. In this way, we demonstrate that the propagation of a given signal through a chirped fiber grating (or a chirped intermodal coupler), under the temporal Fraunhofer conditions, translates into a temporal separation of the spectral components of the signal.

Published metal artifact reduction methods are based on the assumption that severe attenuation of X-rays by prostheses renders corresponding portions of projection data unavailable, hence the ""missing"" data are either avoided (in iterative reconstruction) or interpolated (in filtered back-projection with data completion; typically, with filling data ""gaps"" via linear functions). Here, the authors propose a wavelet-based multiresolution analysis method for metal artifact reduction, in which information is extracted from corrupted projection data. The wavelet method improves image quality by a successive interpolation in the wavelet domain. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the metal artifacts due to both photon starving and beam hardening can be effectively suppressed using the authors' method. As compared to the filtered back-projection after linear interpolation, the wavelet-based reconstruction is significantly more accurate for depiction of anatomical structures, especially in the immediate neighborhood of the prostheses.

In the past, they have presented three segmentation paradigms: live wire, live lane, and a three-dimensional (3-D) extension of the live-wire method. Here, they introduce an ultra-fast live-wire method, referred to as live wire on the fly for further reducing user's time compared to the basic live-wire method. In live wire, 3-D/four-dimensional (4-D) object boundaries are segmented in a slice-by-slice fashion. To segment a two-dimensional (2-D) boundary, the user initially picks a point on the boundary and all possible minimum-cost paths from this point to all other points in the image are computed via Dijkstra's algorithm. Subsequently, a live wire is displayed in real time from the initial point to any subsequent position taken by the cursor. If the cursor is close to the desired boundary, the live wire snaps on to the boundary. The cursor is then deposited and a new live-wire segment is found next. The entire 2-D boundary is specified via a set of live-wire segments in this fashion. A drawback of this method is that the speed of optimal path computation depends on image size. On modestly powered computers, for images of even modest size, some sluggishness appears in user interaction, which reduces the overall segmentation efficiency. In this work, the authors solve this problem by exploiting some known properties of graphs to avoid unnecessary minimum-cost path computation during segmentation. In live wire on the fly, when the user selects a point on the boundary the live-wire segment is computed and displayed in real time from the selected point to any subsequent position of the cursor in the image, even for large images and even on low-powered computers. Based on 492 tracing experiments from an actual medical application, the authors demonstrate that live wire on the fly is 1.331 times faster than live wire for actual segmentation for varying image sizes, although the pure computational part alone is found to be about 120 times faster.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.832960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832960","","Image segmentation;Wire;Computer displays;Object recognition;Two dimensional displays;Medical services;Biomedical equipment;Application software;Image recognition;Radiology","Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Graphics;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;User-Computer Interface","196","12","29","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Transmission of real-time video has bandwidth, delay, and loss requirements. However the current Internet does not offer any quality of service (QoS) guarantees to video transmission over the Internet. In addition, the heterogeneity of the networks and end systems makes it difficult to multicast Internet video in an efficient and flexible way. Thus, designing protocols and mechanisms for Internet video transmission poses many challenges. In this paper, we take a holistic approach to these challenges and present solutions from both transport and compression perspectives. With the holistic approach, we design a framework for transporting real-time Internet video, which includes two components, namely, congestion control and error control. Specifically congestion control consists of rate control, rate-adaptive encoding, and rate shaping; error control consists of forward error correction (FEC), retransmission error resilience, and error concealment. For the design of each component in the framework, we classify approaches and summarize representative research work. We point out there exists a design space which can be explored by video application designers and suggest that the synergy of both transport and compression could provide good solutions.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.899055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899055","","Video compression;Error correction;Web and internet services;Quality of service;Shape control;Forward error correction;Bandwidth;Delay;Propagation losses;IP networks","","195","36","67","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The diagnosis process was tested on both classical and decentralized approaches. The purpose of a decentralized architecture is to facilitate a satisfactory distributed implementation of new types of faults to the initial NN monitoring system.

Chaotic signals are nonperiodic, wideband, and more difficult to predict, reconstruct, and characterize than periodic carriers. These properties of chaotic signals make it more difficult to intercept and decode the information modulated upon them. However, many suggested chaos-based communication schemes do not provide processing gain, a feature highly desirable in spread-spectrum communication schemes. In this paper, we suggest two communication schemes that provide a processing gain. The performance of these and of the earlier proposed differential chaos shift keying is studied analytically and numerically for discrete time implementations. It is shown that, when performance is characterized by the dependence of bit error rate on E/sub b//N/sub 0/, the increase of the spreading sequence length beyond a certain point degrades the performance. For a given E/sub b//N/sub 0/, there is a length of the spreading sequence that minimizes the bit error rate.","1558-1268","","10.1109/81.899920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899920","","Performance analysis;Chaotic communication;Spread spectrum communication;Wideband;Narrowband;Interference;Bandwidth;Signal processing;Bit error rate;Working environment noise","","194","1","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The asymptotic performance of unitary root-MUSIC is analyzed and compared with that of conventional root-MUSIC. The results of this comparison show identical asymptotic properties of both algorithms in the case of uncorrelated sources and a better performance of unitary root-MUSIC in scenarios with partially correlated or fully coherent sources. Additionally, our simulations and the results of sonar and ultrasonic real data processing demonstrate an improved threshold performance of unitary root-MUSIC relative to conventional root-MUSIC.

This paper presents a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms. The proposed system consists of two main steps. First, potential microcalcification pixels in the mammograms are segmented out by using mixed features consisting of wavelet features and gray level statistical features, and labeled into potential individual microcalcification objects by their spatial connectivity. Second, individual microcalcifications are detected by using a set of 31 features extracted from the potential individual microcalcification objects. The discriminatory power of these features is analyzed using general regression neural networks via sequential forward and sequential backward selection methods. The classifiers used in these two steps are both multilayer feedforward neural networks. The method is applied to a database of 40 mammograms (Nijmegen database) containing 105 clusters of microcalcifications. A free-response operating characteristics (FROC) curve is used to evaluate the performance. Results show that the proposed system gives quite satisfactory detection performance. In particular, a 90% mean true positive detection rate is achieved at the cost of 0.5 false positive per image when mixed features are used in the first step and 15 features selected by the sequential backward selection method are used in the second step. However, one must be cautious when interpreting the results, since the 20 training samples are also used in the testing step.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.836371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836371","","Neural networks;Multi-layer neural network;Spatial databases;Breast cancer;Computer aided diagnosis;Object detection;Feature extraction;Feedforward neural networks;Image databases;Costs","Breast Neoplasms;Calcinosis;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Humans;Mammography;Neural Networks (Computer);Radiographic Image Enhancement","193","5","49","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Today's voltage regulator module (VRM) will need a large amount of extra decoupling and output filter capacitors to meet future requirements, which will basically make the existing VRM topologies impractical. As a candidate topology, the interleaved quasisquare-wave (QSW) VRM exhibits very good performance, such as a fast transient response and a very high power density. The difficulty with the application of the interleaved parallel technology is the current-sharing control. In this paper, a novel current-sensing and current-sharing technique is proposed. With this technique, current sharing can be controlled simply in parallel converters without a current transformer and current-sensing resistors. In addition, this technique can be easily integrated with an IC chip. The four-module paralleled QSW VRM is used to evaluate this technique. Experimental results verify that with this technique, the VRM has a high power density, high efficiency and a fast transient response. The concept of the current sharing technique is also generalized and extended.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.892830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892830","","Voltage control;Regulators;Microprocessors;Capacitors;Rectifiers;Transient response;Power supplies;Inductance;Filters;Topology","","193","5","5","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A powerful frequency-domain approach is therefore developed in which the average error-rate integral is transformed into the frequency domain, using Parseval's theorem. Such a transformation eliminates the need for computing (or approximating) the EGC output PDF (which is unknown), but instead requires the knowledge of the corresponding characteristic function (which is readily available). The frequency-domain method also circumvents the need to perform multiple-fold convolution integral operations, usually encountered in the calculation of the PDF of the sum of the received signal amplitudes. We then derive integral expressions for the average symbol-error rate of an arbitrary two-dimensional signaling scheme, with EGC reception in Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m (1960), and Nakagami-q fading channels. For practically important cases of second- and third-order diversity systems in Nakagami fading, both coherent and noncoherent detection methods for binary signaling are analyzed using the Appell hypergeometric function.

This energy-saving voltage injection comes at the expense of an increased voltage injection magnitude, load power swing, phase shift, and discontinuity of voltage wave-shape. For this reason, several proposed compensation strategies are examined, in terms of satisfying custom power while taking into consideration the capacity of the energy-storage device and the voltage injection constraint of dynamic voltage restorer. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategies.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.852100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=852100","","Power system restoration;Energy storage;Power quality;Reactive power;Voltage control;Voltage fluctuations;Power system control;Power systems;Impedance;Delay effects","","191","","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we describe technology-driven models for wire capacitance wire delay, and microarchitectural component delay. Using the results of these models, we measure the simulated performance-estimating both clock rate and IPC-of an aggressive out-of-order microarchitecture as it is scaled from a 250 nm technology to a 35 nm technology.

In its original form, the wavelet transform is a linear tool. However, it has been increasingly recognized that nonlinear extensions are possible. A major impulse to the development of nonlinear wavelet transforms has been given by the introduction of the lifting scheme by Sweldens (1995, 1996, 1998). The aim of this paper, which is a sequel to a previous paper devoted exclusively to the pyramid transform, is to present an axiomatic framework encompassing most existing linear and nonlinear wavelet decompositions. Furthermore, it introduces some, thus far unknown, wavelets based on mathematical morphology, such as the morphological Haar wavelet, both in one and two dimensions. A general and flexible approach for the construction of nonlinear (morphological) wavelets is provided by the lifting scheme. This paper briefly discusses one example, the max-lifting scheme, which has the intriguing property that preserves local maxima in a signal over a range of scales, depending on how local or global these maxima are.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.877211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877211","","Signal resolution;Wavelet transforms;Morphology;Image resolution;Mathematics;Computer science;Image reconstruction;Signal processing;Image processing;Laplace equations","","190","7","46","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method of ordered multiple interactions (MOMI) is used to calculate time-varying scattering from surfaces generated according to linear and nonlinear (Creamer) models for incidence angles ranging from normal to low grazing. We discuss the runtime considerations and demonstrate that combining the MOMI with a fast multipole method (FMM)-type acceleration technique makes large-scale time-varying Monte Carlo simulations possible. The average Doppler spectra of backscattered signals obtained from such simulations are compared for different incident angles, polarizations, and surface models. In particular, the simulations show a broadening of the Doppler spectra for nonlinear surfaces, especially at low grazing angles (LGA) and a separation of the vertical and horizontal polarization spectra at LGA for nonlinear surfaces. This spectral separation at LGA is not observed when the linear surfaces are used.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.851961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=851961","","Numerical simulation;Scattering;Sea surface;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Polarization;Robustness;Runtime;Acceleration;Large-scale systems","","190","","29","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, if k users collide in a given time slot, they repeat their transmission for a total of k times so that k copies of the collided packets are received. Then, the receiver has to resolve a k/spl times/k source mixing problem and separate each individual user.

ESPRIT exploits the nonspatial interrelations among the six unknown electromagnetic-field components of each source and produces from the measured data a set of eigenvalues, from which the source's electromagnetic-field vector may be estimated to within a complex scalar.

Cummer","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,"6 Aug 2002","2000","48","9","1420","1429","The ionosphere plays a role in radio propagation that varies strongly with frequency. At extremely low frequency (ELF: 3-3000 Hz) and very low frequency (VLF: 3-30 kHz), the ground and the ionosphere are good electrical conductors and form a spherical Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Many giants of the electromagnetics (EMs) community studied ELF-VLF propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, a topic which was critically important for long-range communication and navigation systems. James R. Wait was undoubtedly the most prolific publisher in this field, starting in the 1950s and continuing well into the 1990s. Although it is an old problem, there are new scientific and practical applications that rely on accurate modeling of ELF-VLF propagation, including ionospheric remote sensing, lightning remote sensing, global climate monitoring, and even earthquake precursor detection. The theory of ELF-VLP propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide is mature, but there remain many ways of actually performing propagation calculations. Most techniques are based on waveguide mode theory with either numerical or approximate analytical formulations, but direct finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling is now also feasible. Furthermore, in either mode theory or FDTD, the ionospheric upper boundary can be treated with varying degrees of approximation. While these approximations are understood in a qualitative sense, it is difficult to assess in advance their applicability to a given propagation problem. With a series of mode theory and FDTD simulations of propagation from lightning radiation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, we investigate the accuracy of these approximations. We also show that fields from post-discharge ionospheric currents and from evanescent modes become important at lower ELF (/spl lsim/500 Hz) over short distances (/spl lsim/500 km). These fields are not easily modeled with mode theory, but are inherent in the FDTD formulation of the problem. In this way, the FDTD solution bridges the gap between analytical solutions for fields close to and far from the source.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.898776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898776","","Electromagnetic modeling;Electromagnetic propagation;Electromagnetic waveguides;Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Optical propagation;Frequency;Remote monitoring;Waveguide theory;Ionosphere","","187","","43","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Feature recognition is a sub-discipline of solid modeling that focuses on the design and implementation of algorithms for detecting manufacturing information from solid models produced by computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Examples of this manufacturing information include features such as holes, slots, pockets and other shapes that can be created on modern computer numerically controlled machining systems. Automated feature recognition has been an active research area in solid modeling for many years and is considered to be a critical component for integration of CAD and computer-aided manufacturing. The paper gives an overview of the state-of-the-art in feature recognition research. Rather than giving an exhaustive survey, we focus on the three of the major algorithmic approaches for feature recognition: graph-based algorithms, volumetric decomposition techniques, and hint-based geometric reasoning. For each approach, we present a detailed description of the algorithms being employed along with some assessments of the technology. We conclude by outlining important open research and development issues.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.897789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897789","","Virtual manufacturing;Solid modeling;Computer aided manufacturing;Design automation;Shape control;Algorithm design and analysis;Automatic control;Control systems;Machining;Research and development","","187","6","96","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This concept is used to detect flight control actuator failures, where the existence of a single frequency sinusoid (which is highly time correlated) in the residual of an elemental filter within an MMAE is indicative of that filter having the wrong actuator failure status hypothesis. This technique results in a delay in detecting the flight control actuator failure because several samples of the residual must be collected before the residual correlation can be estimated. However, it allows a significant reduction of the amplitude of the required system inputs for exciting the various system modes to enhance identifiability, to the point where they may possibly be subliminal, so as not to be objectionable to the pilot and passengers.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.845216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845216","","Adaptive estimation;State estimation;Testing;Actuators;Aerospace control;History;Filter bank;Delay estimation;Frequency;Computer science","","186","1","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While local constraints are readily captured through n-gram modeling, global constraints, such as long-term semantic dependencies, have been more difficult to handle within a data-driven formalism. This paper focuses on the use of latent semantic analysis, a paradigm that automatically uncovers the salient semantic relationships between words and documents in a given corpus. In this approach, (discrete) words and documents are mapped onto a (continuous) semantic vector space, in which familiar clustering techniques can be applied. This leads to the specification of a powerful framework for automatic semantic classification, as well as the derivation of several language model families with various smoothing properties. Because of their large-span nature, these language models are well suited to complement conventional n-grams. An integrative formulation is proposed for harnessing this synergy, in which the latent semantic information is used to adjust the standard n-gram probability. Such hybrid language modeling compares favorably with the corresponding n-gram baseline: experiments conducted on the Wall Street Journal domain show a reduction in average word error rate of over 20%. This paper concludes with a discussion of intrinsic tradeoffs, such as the influence of training data selection on the resulting performance.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.880084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880084","","Natural languages;Speech recognition;Training data;Automatic speech recognition;Vocabulary;Smoothing methods;Error analysis;Speech analysis;Fasteners;Parameter estimation","","185","225","72","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present an original hierarchical segmentation procedure devoted to images given by a high-resolution sonar. The sonar image is segmented into two kinds of regions: shadow (corresponding to a lack of acoustic reverberation behind each object lying on the sea-bed) and sea-bottom reverberation. The proposed unsupervised scheme takes into account the variety of the laws in the distribution mixture of a sonar image, and it estimates both the parameters of noise distributions and the parameters of the Markovian prior. For the estimation step, we use an iterative technique which combines a maximum likelihood approach (for noise model parameters) with a least-squares method (for MRF-based prior). In order to model more precisely the local and global characteristics of image content at different scales, we introduce a hierarchical model involving a pyramidal label field. It combines coarse-to-fine causal interactions with a spatial neighborhood structure. This new method of segmentation, called the scale causal multigrid (SCM) algorithm, has been successfully applied to real sonar images and seems to be well suited to the segmentation of very noisy images. The experiments reported in this paper demonstrate that the discussed method performs better than other hierarchical schemes for sonar image segmentation.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.847834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847834","","Image segmentation;Reverberation;Sonar applications;Parameter estimation;Acoustic waves;Markov random fields;Acoustic noise;Iterative methods;Maximum likelihood detection;Maximum likelihood estimation","","185","3","38","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We refer to this window adjustment strategy as general additive increase multiplicative decrease (GAIMD). We present the (mean) sending rate of a GAIMD flow as a function of /spl alpha/, /spl beta/, loss rate, mean round-trip time, mean timeout value, and the number of packets acknowledged by each ACK. We conducted extensive experiments to validate this sending rate formula. We found the formula to be quite accurate for a loss rate of up to 20%. We also present a simple relationship between /spl alpha/ and /spl beta/ for a GAIMD flow to be TCP-friendly, that is, for the GAIMD flow to have approximately the same sending rate as a TCP flow under the same path conditions. We present results from simulations in which TCP-friendly GAIMD flows (/spl alpha/=0.31, /spl beta/=7/8) compete for bandwidth with TCP Reno flows and with TCP SACK flows, on a DropTail link as well as on a RED link. We found that the GAIMD flows were highly, TCP-friendly.

Wind directions are extracted from wind-induced streaks visible on most SAR images. Wind speeds are derived from normalized radar cross sections (NRCS) using empirical models. The models were developed for scatterometers (SCAT) operating at C-band with vertical polarization and must be modified for horizontal polarization. Several available C-band polarization ratios were considered, including theoretical and empirical forms. To verify and improve the algorithm, wind speeds were computed from several RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR images and compared to colocated measurements from the SCAT aboard the European remote sensing satellite ERS-2 and to the results of the Danish high resolution limited area model (HIRLAM). Using the colocated measurements, the polarization ratio was estimated and applied to improve the wind retrieval algorithm. In addition, the main error sources in SAR wind field extraction are discussed with respect to the RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR data.

Conventional block-based classification algorithms decide the class of a block by examining only the feature vector of this block and ignoring context information. In order to improve classification by context, an algorithm is proposed that models images by two dimensional (2-D) hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM considers feature vectors statistically dependent through an underlying state process assumed to be a Markov mesh, which has transition probabilities conditioned on the states of neighboring blocks from both horizontal and vertical directions. Thus, the dependency in two dimensions is reflected simultaneously. The HMM parameters are estimated by the EM algorithm. To classify an image, the classes with maximum a posteriori probability are searched jointly for all the blocks. Applications of the HMM algorithm to document and aerial image segmentation show that the algorithm outperforms CART/sup TM/, LVQ, and Bayes VQ.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.823977","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=823977","","Image classification;Hidden Markov models;Statistics;Data mining;Classification algorithms;Context modeling;Two dimensional displays;Probability;Parameter estimation;Image segmentation","","185","6","52","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then consider explicit congestion notification (ECN) as an alternate mechanism (instead of losses) for signaling congestion and show that ECN marking levels can be designed to nearly eliminate losses in the network by choosing the marking level independently for each node in the network.

Using wavelet decomposition to preprocess the impulse response drastically reduces the number of inputs to the neural network, simplifying its architecture and minimizing its training and processing time. The second preprocessing by principal component analysis can further reduce the dimensionality of the input space and/or select input features that minimize diagnostic errors. Input normalization removes large dynamic variances over one or more dimensions in input space, which tend to obscure the relevant data fed to the neural network. A comparison of our work with that of Spina and Upadhyaya (see ibid., vol. 44, p. 188-196, 1997), which also employs backpropagation neural networks, reveals that our system requires a much smaller network and performs significantly better in fault diagnosis of analog circuits due to our proposed preprocessing techniques.","1558-125X","","10.1109/82.823545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=823545","","Fault diagnosis;Neural networks;Circuit faults;Backpropagation;Principal component analysis;Data preprocessing;Wavelet analysis;Electrical fault detection;Fault detection;Electronic circuits","","183","1","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In 2000 the industrial competition between Asia, Europe, and America promises a very difficult path toward the definition of a unique standard for future mobile systems, although market analyses underline the trading benefits of a common worldwide standard. It is therefore in this field that the software radio concept is emerging as a potential pragmatic solution: a software implementation of the user terminal able to dynamically adapt to the radio environment in which it is, time by time, located. In fact, the term software radio stands for radio functionalities defined by software, meaning the possibility to define by software the typical functionality of a radio interface, usually implemented in TX and RX equipment by dedicated hardware. The presence of the software defining the radio interface necessarily implies the use of DSPs to replace dedicated hardware, to execute, in real time, the necessary software. In this article objectives, advantages, problem areas, and technological challenges of software radio are addressed. In particular, SW radio transceiver architecture, possible SW implementation, and its download are analyzed.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.868153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868153","","Software radio;Radio frequency;Digital signal processing chips;Hardware;Digital signal processing;Computer architecture;Signal processing;Protocols;Field programmable gate arrays;Asia","","182","9","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper is concerned with maximum likelihood array processing in non-Gaussian noise. We present the Cramer-Rao bound on the variance of angle-of-arrival estimates for arbitrary additive, independent, identically distributed (iid), symmetric, non-Gaussian noise. Then, we focus on non-Gaussian noise modeling with a finite Gaussian mixture distribution, which is capable of representing a broad class of non-Gaussian distributions that include heavy tailed, impulsive cases arising in wireless communications and other applications. Based on the Gaussian mixture model, we develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the source locations, the signal waveforms, and the noise distribution parameters. The important problems of detecting the number of sources and obtaining initial parameter estimates for the iterative EM algorithm are discussed in detail. The initialization procedure by itself is an effective algorithm for array processing in impulsive noise. Novel features of the EM algorithm and the associated maximum likelihood formulation include a nonlinear beamformer that separates multiple source signals in non-Gaussian noise and a robust covariance matrix estimate that suppresses impulsive noise while also performing a model-based interpolation to restore the low-rank signal subspace. The EM approach yields improvement over initial robust estimates and is valid for a wide SNR range. The results are also robust to PDF model mismatch and work well with infinite variance cases such as the symmetric stable distributions. Simulations confirm the optimality of the EM estimation procedure in a variety of cases, including a multiuser communications scenario. We also compare with existing array processing algorithms for non-Gaussian noise.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.887045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887045","","Array signal processing;Gaussian noise;Additive noise;Iterative algorithms;Maximum likelihood detection;Maximum likelihood estimation;Noise robustness;Gaussian distribution;Wireless communication;Position measurement","","182","","42","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The usual APA algorithms update weight estimates on the basis of multiple, unit delayed, input signal vectors. We analyze the convergence behavior of the generalized APA class of algorithms (allowing for arbitrary delay between input vectors) using a simple model for the input signal vectors. Conditions for convergence of the APA class are derived. It is shown that the convergence rate is exponential and that it improves as the number of input signal vectors used for adaptation is increased. However, the rate of improvement in performance (time-to-steady-state) diminishes as the number of input signal vectors increases. For a given convergence rate, APA algorithms are shown to exhibit less misadjustment (steady-state error) than NLMS.

The model of membrane pore formation seems to fail only for ultrashort electrical pulses, where intracellular effects, and possibly resonant effects, might dominate. This paper presents an overview of the effect of pulsed electric fields on the viability of microorganisms in liquids, In particular, the lytic effect of variations in the electrical pulse parameters, such as pulse shape, amplitude, duration, and single shot vs. repetitive operation, is described, A major application of the pulsed electric field method is 'cold' bacterial decontamination of liquid food and drinking water.

The key design objectives for the processor systems in these applications are providing the highest possible peak performance for the compute-intensive code (e.g., handwriting recognition, image decompression) while maximizing the battery life for the remaining low performance periods. If clock frequency and supply voltage are dynamically varied in response to computational load demands, then energy consumed per process can be reduced for the low computational periods, while retaining peak performance when required. This strategy, which achieves the highest possible energy efficiency for time-varying computational loads, is called dynamic voltage scaling (DVS).","0193-6530","0-7803-5853-8","10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839787","","Dynamic voltage scaling;Microprocessors;Portable computers;Time varying systems;High performance computing;Handwriting recognition;Batteries;Clocks;Frequency;Energy efficiency","","181","15","3","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the parameters [direction-of-arrival (DOA) and angular spread] of a spatially distributed source, using a uniform linear array (ULA). A two-step procedure enabling decoupling the estimation of DOA from that of the angular spread is proposed. This method combines a covariance matching algorithm with the use of the extended invariance principle (EXIP). More exactly, the first step makes use of an unstructured model for the part of the covariance matrix that depends on the angular spread. Then, the solution is refined by invoking EXIP. Instead of a 2-D search, the proposed scheme requires two successive 1-D searches. Additionally, the DOA estimate is robust to mismodeling the spatial distribution of the scatterers. A statistical analysis is carried out, and a formula for the asymptotic variance of the estimates is derived. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the method.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.847774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847774","","Direction of arrival estimation;Scattering;Mobile communication;Base stations;Mobile antennas;Antenna arrays;Parameter estimation;Linear antenna arrays;Covariance matrix;Robustness","","180","1","31","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hybrid filter consists of a small-rated active filter and a 5th-tuned passive filter. The active filter is characterized by detecting the 5th-harmonic current flowing into the passive filter. It is controlled in such a way as to behave as a negative or positive resistor by adjusting a feedback gain from a negative to positive value, and vice versa. The negative resistor presented by the active filter cancels a positive resistor inherent in the passive filter, so that the hybrid filter acts as an ideal passive filter with infinite quality factor. This significantly improves damping the harmonic resonance, compared with the passive filter used alone.

During the past decade, a variety of multiobjective EA (MOEA) techniques have been proposed and applied to many scientific and engineering applications. Our discussion's intent is to rigorously define multiobjective optimization problems and certain related concepts, present an MOEA classification scheme, and evaluate the variety of contemporary MOEAs. Current MOEA theoretical developments are evaluated; specific topics addressed include fitness functions, Pareto ranking, niching, fitness sharing, mating restriction, and secondary populations. Since the development and application of MOEAs is a dynamic and rapidly growing activity, we focus on key analytical insights based upon critical MOEA evaluation of current research and applications.

A ferroelectric memory cell consists of at least one ferroelectric capacitor, where binary data are stored, and one or two transistors that either allow access to the capacitor or amplify its contents for a read operation. Once a cell is accessed for a read operation, its data are presented in the form of an analog signal to a sense amplifier, where it is compared against a reference voltage to determine its logic level. The circuit techniques used to generate the reference voltage must be robust to semiconductor processing variations across the chip and the device imperfections of ferroelectric capacitors. We review six methods of generating a reference voltage, two being presented for the first time in this paper. These methods are discussed and evaluated in terms of their accuracy, area overhead and sensing complexity. Ferroelectric memories share architectural features such as addressing schemes and input/output circuitry with other types of random-access memories such as dynamic random-access memories. However, they have distinct features with respect to accessing the stored data, sensing, and overall circuit topology. We review nine different architectures for ferroelectric memories and discuss them in terms of speed, density and power consumption.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.849164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=849164","","Technological innovation;Ferroelectric materials;Capacitors;Voltage;Operational amplifiers;Logic devices;Robustness;Circuit topology;Memory architecture;Energy consumption","","178","63","59","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rectifier consists of a conventional single-phase PWM voltage-source rectifier, a pair of additional switches and an inductor. Hence, the proposed rectifier requires neither a large DC capacitor nor a passive L-C resonant circuit. The input current control is achieved by the conventional PWM current control technique. However, DC ripple current reduction control is difficult because one of the switching legs in the DC ripple current reduction circuit is shared with the PWM rectifier circuit. Two control methods, referred to here as the DC C inductor method and the AC inductor method, are proposed for DC ripple reduction, and the characteristics of these control methods are discussed. These control methods are implemented using a microprocessor, and the effectiveness of the circuit is confirmed experimentally. This rectifier has useful applications in uninterruptible power systems and DC power supplies, especially for cases in which the batteries are connected in parallel to the DC line.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.871292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871292","","Pulse width modulation;Voltage;Rectifiers;Inductors;Current control;Topology;Space vector pulse width modulation;Switches;Switched capacitor circuits;RLC circuits","","178","2","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose an algorithm for detecting this salient motion that is based on intermediate-stage vision integration of optical flow.

Under these conditions, the tissues of the ear region are most exposed, the tissue composition of which is complex and varies considerably from user to user. The objective of this paper is to derive head tissue equivalent dielectric parameters that enable the utilization of one generic homogeneous head for testing compliance for the entire user group, i.e., granting no underestimation, but also not greatly overestimating the actual maximum user exposure. As a primary study, a simple analytical model of an infinite half-space layered tissue model exposed to a plane wave was utilized to investigate the impact of impedance matching standing waves, etc. On the spatial-peak specific absorption rate. The tissue layers were varied in composition and thickness, representing the anatomical variation of the exposed head region covering the user group including adults and children (<10% to >90% percentile). Based on the worst-case tissue layer compositions with respect to absorption at each frequency, head tissue equivalent dielectric parameters for homogeneous modeling were derived, which result in the same spatial-peak absorption. The validity of this approach for near-field exposures was demonstrated by replacing the plane wave by different near-field sources (dipoles and generic phones) and the layered structure with magnetic-resonance-image-based nonhomogeneous human head models.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.884187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=884187","","Electromagnetic wave absorption;Humans;Frequency;Magnetic heads;Testing;Dielectrics;Cellular phones;Safety;Ear;Analytical models","","177","3","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mann","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada",IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,"6 Aug 2002","2000","9","8","1389","1406","It is argued that, hidden within the flow of signals from typical cameras, through image processing, to display media, is a homomorphic filter. While homomorphic filtering is often desirable, there are some occasions where it is not. Thus, cancellation of this implicit homomorphic filter is proposed, through the introduction of an antihomomorphic filter. This concept gives rise to the principle of quantigraphic image processing, wherein it is argued that most cameras can be modeled as an array of idealized light meters each linearly responsive to a semi-monotonic function of the quantity of light received, integrated over a fixed spectral response profile. This quantity depends only on the spectral response of the sensor elements in the camera. A particular class of functional equations, called comparametric equations, is introduced as a basis for quantigraphic image processing. These are fundamental to the analysis and processing of multiple images differing only in exposure. The ""gamma correction"" of an image is presented as a simple example of a comparametric equation, for which it is shown that the underlying quantigraphic function does not pass through the origin. Thus, it is argued that exposure adjustment by gamma correction is inherently flawed, and alternatives are provided. These alternatives, when applied to a plurality of images that differ only in exposure, give rise to a new kind of processing in the ""amplitude domain"". The theoretical framework presented in this paper is applicable to the processing of images from nearly all types of modern cameras. This paper is a much revised draft of a 1992 peer-reviewed but unpublished report by the author, entitled ""Lightspace and the Wyckoff principle"".","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.855434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855434","","Equations;Image processing;Cameras;Spatial resolution;Filters;Optical arrays;Cybernetics;Sensor arrays;Signal processing;Displays","","176","10","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Explicit solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (H-J-B) equation for optimal control of robotic systems are found by solving an algebraic Riccati equation. It is shown how the CMAC can cope with nonlinearities through optimization with no preliminary off-line learning phase required. The adaptive-learning algorithm is derived from Lyapunov stability analysis, so that both system-tracking stability and error convergence can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system. The filtered-tracking error or critic gain and the Lyapunov function for the nonlinear analysis are derived from the user input in terms of a specified quadratic-performance index. Simulation results from a two-link robot manipulator show the satisfactory performance of the proposed control schemes even in the presence of large modeling uncertainties and external disturbances.","1558-2442","","10.1109/5326.827451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=827451","","Optimal control;Robot control;Riccati equations;Nonlinear equations;Lyapunov method;Application software;Motion control;Feedback control;Digital arithmetic;Computer networks","","176","","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A response time of 1.0 s and a sensitivity of 30.0 fF/%RH have been obtained. High speed is achieved using multiple polyimide columns having diameters of a few microns and allowing moisture to diffuse into them circumferentially. Using structures that eliminate the air-gap capacitance between the columns, the simulated sensor output drifts by only 1% when the relative dielectric constant in the air region changes from 1 to 10. A polysilicon heater is used to measure relative humidity levels >80% RH. An accuracy of /spl plusmn/3% RH has been obtained using this method, with measurement errors of /spl plusmn/0.5/spl deg/C and /spl plusmn/2% RH in temperature and relative humidity, respectively. The heater also reduces the recovery time after wetting, enables the sensor to recover from contamination and aging, and allows the sensing film to be reset on demand during self-test protocols.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.830983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=830983","","Humidity transducers","","176","7","37","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our distribution reveals that the direction of the image gradient is insensitive to changes in illumination direction. We verify this empirically by constructing a distribution for the image gradient from more than 20 million samples of gradients in a database of 1,280 images of 20 inanimate objects taken under varying lighting condition.

The author presents practical applications where the fusion of uncertain data is well achieved by Dempster's rule of combination. It is essential that the meaning of the belief functions used to represent uncertainty be well fixed, as the adequacy of the rule depends strongly on a correct understanding of the context in which they are applied. Missing to distinguish between the upper and lower probabilities theory and the transferable belief model can lead to serious confusion, as Dempster's rule of combination is central in the transferable belief model whereas it hardly fits with the upper and lower probabilities theory.","","2-7257-0000-0","10.1109/IFIC.2000.862713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862713","","Mathematical model;Uncertainty;Artificial intelligence","","174","1","40","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method is based on a mathematical model of the process. In the presented work, a square-wave motor is considered. An appropriate model is derived. To be able to implement the method also on low-cost microcontroller-based control units, only the power inverter supply voltage, DC current, and the motor's angular velocity have to be measured. The parameter estimation technique provides information about the electrical resistance and the back-EMF constant as well as about the mechanical parameters. Comparing the nominal with the computed parameters, faults can be detected. The approach might be applied to both end-of-line and online fault detection. Results for simulated data demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed procedure.

In addition, the query based content filtering process is performed against the XML documents. The XWRAP wrapper generation framework has three distinct features. First, it explicitly separates tasks of building wrappers that are specific to a Web source from the tasks that are repetitive for any source, and uses a component library to provide basic building blocks for wrapper programs. Second, it provides a user friendly interface program to allow wrapper developers to generate their wrapper code with a few mouse clicks. Third and most importantly, we introduce and develop a two-phase code generation framework. The first phase utilizes an interactive interface facility to encode the source-specific metadata knowledge identified by individual wrapper developers as declarative information extraction rules. The second phase combines the information extraction rules generated at the first phase with the XWRAP component library to construct an executable wrapper program for the given Web source.

This work presents an algorithm to determine the near optimal, with respect to system losses, placement of these units on the power grid. Further, the impacts of dispersed generation at the distribution level are performed with an emphasis on resistive losses, and capacity savings. The results show the importance of placement for minimizing losses and maximizing capacity savings.","","0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926773","","Costs;Distributed power generation;Power generation;Fuel cells;Photovoltaic systems;Computer science;Power systems;Power grids;Propagation losses;Stress","","172","","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the phase error is large, such as in the locking mode, the PLL increases the loop bandwidth and achieves fast locking. On the other hand, when the phase error is small, this PLL decreases the loop bandwidth and minimizes output jitters. Based on an analog recursive bandwidth control algorithm, the PLL achieves the phase and frequency lock in less than 30 clock cycles without pre-training, and maintains the cycle-to-cycle jitter within 20 ps (peak-to-peak) in the tracking mode. A feed forward-type duty-cycle corrector is designed to keep the 50% duty cycle ratio over all operating frequency range.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.859502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=859502","","Phase locked loops;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Bandwidth;Jitter;Clocks;Signal processing algorithms;Frequency;Signal generators;Hardware","","172","11","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Efficiency analysis of multihypothesis motion-compensated prediction for video coding","B. Girod","Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,"6 Aug 2002","2000","9","2","173","183","Overlapped block motion compensation or B-frames are examples of multihypothesis motion compensation where several motion-compensated signals are superimposed to reduce the bit-rate of a video codec. This paper extends the wide-sense stationary theory of motion-compensated prediction (MCP) for hybrid video codecs to multihypothesis motion compensation. The power spectrum of the prediction error is related to the displacement error probability density functions (pdfs) of an arbitrary number of hypotheses in a closed-form expression. We then study the influence of motion compensation accuracy on the efficiency of multihypothesis motion compensation as well as the influence of the residual noise level and the gain from optimal combination of N hypotheses. For the noise-free limiting case, doubling the number of (equally good) hypotheses can yield a gain of up to 1/2 bits/sample, while doubling the accuracy of motion compensation can additionally reduce the bit-rate by up to 1 bit/sample independent of N. For realistic noise levels, it is shown that the introduction of B-frames or overlapped block motion compensation can provide larger gains than doubling motion compensation accuracy. Spatial filtering of the motion-compensated candidate signals becomes less important if more hypotheses are combined. The critical accuracy beyond which the gain due to more accurate motion compensation is small moves to larger displacement error variances with increasing noise and increasing number of hypotheses N. Hence, sub-pel accurate motion compensation becomes less important with multihypothesis MCP. The theoretical insights are confirmed by experimental results for overlapped block motion compensation, B-frames, and multiframe motion-compensated prediction with up to eight hypotheses from ten previous frames.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.821595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=821595","","Motion analysis;Video coding;Motion compensation;Frequency;Video codecs;Noise level;Video compression;ISO standards;Equations;Error probability","","172","76","32","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A straightforward solution for the restoration problem is to find two disjoint paths. However, this results in excessive resource usage for backup paths and does not satisfy the implicit service provider requirement of optimizing network resource utilization so as to increase the number of potential future demands that can be routed. We give an integer programming formulation for this problem which is new. Complete path routing knowledge is a reasonable assumption for a centralized routing algorithm. However, it requires maintenance of non-aggregated or per-path information which is not often desirable particularly when distributed routing is preferred. We show that a partial information scenario which uses only aggregated and not per-path information provides sufficient information for a suitably developed algorithm to be able to perform almost as well as the complete information scenario. In this partial information scenario the routing algorithm only knows what fraction of each link's bandwidth, is currently used by active paths, and is currently used by backup paths. Obtaining this information is feasible using proposed traffic engineering extensions to routing protocols. We formulate the dynamic restorable bandwidth routing problem in this partial information scenario and develop efficient routing algorithms. We compare there routing performance of this algorithm to a bound obtained using complete information. Our partial information-based algorithm performs very well and its performance in terms of the number of rejected requests is very close to the full information bound.","0743-166X","0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832265","","Routing;Bandwidth;Multiprotocol label switching;Spine;Uninterruptible power systems;Aggregates;Telecommunication traffic;Paper technology;Heuristic algorithms;Optical fiber networks","","172","16","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to generating a global Ku-band backscatter data set useful for a variety of climate studies, these flights will provide ocean-surface wind estimates for use in operational weather forecasting. SeaWinds employs a compact ""pencil-beam"" design rather than the ""fan-beam"" approach previously used with SASS on Seasat, NSCAT on ADEOS-I, and the AMI scatterometer on ERS-1, 2. As originally envisioned and reported, the resolution of the SeaWinds backscatter measurements were to be antenna-beamwidth limited. In order to satisfy an emerging demand for higher resolution backscatter data, however, the SeaWinds signal-processing design has been significantly modified. Here, the various options considered for improving the resolution of the SeaWinds measurements are discussed, and the selected hardware modification (the addition of deramp processing for range discrimination) is described. The radar equation specific to a rotating pencil-beam scatterometer with digital range filtering is developed, and the new challenges associated with calibrating the resulting improved resolution measurements are discussed. A formulation for assessing the variance of the measurements due to fading and thermal noise is presented. Finally, the utility of improved resolution SeaWinds measurements for land and ice studies is demonstrated by simulated enhanced-resolution imaging of a synthetic Earth backscatter scene.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.823904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=823904","","Backscatter;Sea measurements;Radar measurements;Spaceborne radar;Signal resolution;Antenna measurements;NASA;Space vehicles;Wind forecasting;Weather forecasting","","171","","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The projector should model the imaging geometry and physics as accurately as possible. Some researchers have used backprojectors that are computationally less expensive than the projectors to reduce computation time.

This information is obtained by extracting shorelines from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the European remote sensing satellites (ERS-1R), tide gauge information, and heights from a dynamic tide model. The aim of this paper is to show how coastlines can be derived from SAR images by using wavelet and active contour methods. In a first step, an edge detection method suggested by Mallat et al. (1992) is applied to ERS SAR images to detect all edges above a certain threshold. A blocktracing algorithm (BA) then determines the boundary area between land and water. A refinement is achieved by local edge selection in this coastal area and by propagation along the wavelet scales. In a final step, the refined edge segments are joined by an active contour algorithm. A model solution for land water segmentation is constructed from a SAR image by visual inspection. The error is estimated by comparing the results from the algorithms to this model solution. The area under investigation is the Elbe estuary, which is located in the intertidal zone of the German Bight. Due to high rates of sediment transport in this area, local government agencies have to spend large amounts of money to keep shipping lanes open. The demonstrated method is shown to be suitable for operational use by applying it to a data set of 24 SAR images covering a time span of approximately five years.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.868884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868884","","Image edge detection;Remote monitoring;Sediments;Tides;Active contours;Image segmentation;Radar detection;Rivers;Surfaces;Data mining","","171","","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this sense, the problem to be discussed is one of the most basic problems in the study of well-posedness for discontinuous dynamical systems. First, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for bimodal systems to be well-posed, in terms of an analysis based on lexicographic inequalities and the smooth continuation property of solutions. Next, its extensions to the multimodal case are discussed. As an application to switching control, in the case that two state feedback gains are switched according to a criterion depending on the state, we give a characterization of all admissible state feedback gains for which the closed loop system remains well-posed.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.880612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880612","","Piecewise linear techniques;Automatic control;Control system synthesis;Automata;Stability;State feedback;Computer science;Controllability;Sufficient conditions;Control systems","","171","","31","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is arguably the simplest meaningful problem one could consider. If results and rules are to be found, they ought to make themselves plain in this problem. For certain problem parametrizations (meaning the signals and correlation coefficient), optimal quantization is achievable via a single threshold applied to each observation-the same as under independence. In other cases, one observation is best ignored or is quantized with two thresholds; neither behavior is seen under independence. Further, and again in distinction from the case of independence, it is seen that in certain situations, an XOR fusion rule is optimal, and in these cases, the implied decision rule is bizarre.

The proposed induction machine consists of a standard squirrel-cage rotor and a stator with two separate windings wound for a dissimilar number of poles. Each stator winding is fed from an independent variable-frequency variable-voltage inverter. The proposed drive offers such advantages as speed sensorless operation, better reliability, and more flexibility to manipulate the resultant torque-speed curve of the motor. In the proposed drive, zero-speed operation is achieved by independently controlling the two sets of stator currents, hence, maintaining a minimum electrical frequency independent of the mechanical speed. This feature is especially important to minimize the negative impact of the stator resistance influence at low-speed operation and it greatly simplifies the implementation of speed sensorless control schemes. The drive is well suited for either constant volts per hertz or field-oriented (FO) operation.

By adopting an appropriate pricing policy and by setting prices carefully, a service provider will be able to offer the necessary incentives for each user to choose the service that best matches his⁄her needs, thereby discouraging over-allocation of resources and maximizing revenue and⁄or social welfare. In this article, we survey some of the recent research in the literature dealing with service pricing in multi-service networks. All of the work surveyed here addresses the relationship between prices and traffic management functions such as congestion control, resource provisioning, and call admission control. We summarize proposed pricing policies for the Internet and for ATM networks, as well as some studies of pricing for general QoS-enabled networks.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2000.5340797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340797","","Pricing;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Costs;Quality of service;Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Call admission control;IP networks;Asynchronous transfer mode","","170","1","43","IEEE","24 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The potential field functions for obstacles contain tunable parameters. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is utilized to identify the optimal potential field functions. Fitness functions such as goal-factor, obstacle-factor, smoothness-factor and minimum-pathlength-factor are developed for the MOEA selection criteria.

Similarly, it is demonstrated that values of the total error signal cannot generally be rendered statistically independent of one another but that their joint moments can be controlled and that, in particular, the error sequence can be rendered spectrally white. The properties of some practical dither signals are explored, and recommendations are made for dithering in audio, video, and measurement applications.

The proposed algorithms are based on a combination of multiple description scalar quantizers with techniques successfully applied to the construction of some of the most efficient subband coders. A given image is encoded into multiple independent packets of roughly equal length. When packets are lost, the quality of the approximation computed at the receiver depends only on the number of packets received, but does not depend on exactly which packets are actually received. When compared with previously reported results on the performance of robust image coders based on multiple descriptions, on standard test images, our coders attain similar PSNR values using typically about 50-60% of the bit rate required by these other state-of-the-art coders, while at the same time providing significantly more freedom in the mechanism for allocation of redundancy among descriptions.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.841528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=841528","","Image coding;Error correction codes;Computer errors;Computer science;Engineering profession;Communication switching;Robustness;Code standards;Testing;PSNR","","169","11","37","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this experiment, the stiffness (or compliance) JND turned out to be 6%. The second experiment assessed stiffness discrimination between a virtual spring and the equivalent spring in reality. In this case, the stiffness (or compliance) JND was found to be 13.4%. These results are consistent with previous outcomes on manual discrimination of compliance. Consequently, this consistency reveals that the passive apparatus that was used can, to some extent, simulate haptic information.

In these situations the analysis methods based on traditional FTA (fault-tree analysis) are inaccurate and inefficient. The inaccuracies are not consistent across the outcome events. If frequency predictions calculated in this way are then used in a risk assessment then the relative risks would be distorted and could lead to resources being used inappropriately to reduce the overall risk.

It is proposed that the power-law form of Rent's rule, which predicts the number of terminals required by a group of gates for communication with the rest of the circuit, is a consequence of a statistically homogeneous circuit topology and gate placement. The term ""homogeneous"" is used to imply that quantities such as the average wire length per gate and the average number of terminals per gate are independent of the position within the circuit. Rent's rule is used to derive a variety of net length distribution models and the approach adopted in this paper is to factor the distribution function into the product of an occupancy probability distribution and a function which represents the number of valid net placement sites. This approach places diverse placement models under a common framework and allows the errors introduced by the modeling process to be isolated and evaluated.

In this paper, a novel method is proposed by formulating an algorithm to reconfigure distribution networks for loss minimization. An efficient technique is used to determine the switching combinations, select the status of the switches, and find the best combination of switches for minimum loss. In the first stage of the proposed algorithm, a limited number of switching combinations is generated and the best switching combination is determined. In the second stage, an extensive search is employed to find out any other switching combination that may give rise to minimum loss compared to the loss obtained in the first stage. The proposed method has been tested on a 33-bus system, and the test results indicate that it is able to determine the appropriate switching-options for optimal (or near optimal) configuration with less computation. The results have been compared with those of established methods reported earlier and a comparative study is presented. With the proposed method, for any input load conditions of the system, the optimum switching configuration can automatically be identified within a reasonable computer time and hence the method can be effectively employed for continuous reconfiguration for loss reduction. The method can be effectively used to plan and design power systems before actually implementing the distribution networks for locating the tie-switches and providing the minimum number of sectionalizing switches in the branches to reduce installation and switching costs.","","0-7803-5902-X","10.1109/DRPT.2000.855672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=855672","","Minimization methods;Intelligent networks;Switches;Heuristic algorithms;System testing;Kirchhoff's Law;Multimedia systems;Power systems;Costs;Automation","","169","","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this investigation, we develop a compression scheme that is a combination of a simple but powerful phrase derivation method and a compact dictionary encoding. The scheme is highly efficient, particularly in decompression, and has characteristics that make it a favorable choice when compressed data is to be searched directly.

Both approaches have their limitations: indexing techniques are inefficient in extreme configurations, such as high-dimensional spaces, where even a simple scan may be cheaper than an index-based search. Compression techniques are not very efficient in all other situations. We propose to combine both techniques to search for nearest neighbors in a high-dimensional space. For this purpose, we develop a compressed index, called the IQ-tree, with a three-level structure: the first level is a regular (flat) directory consisting of minimum bounding boxes, the second level contains data points in a compressed representation, and the third level contains the actual data. We overcome several engineering challenges in constructing an effective index structure of this type. The most significant of these is to decide how much to compress at the second level. Too much compression will lead to many needless expensive accesses to the third level. Too little compression will increase both the storage and the access cost for the first two levels. We develop a cost model and an optimization algorithm based on this cost model that permits an independent determination of the degree of compression for each second level page to minimize expected query cost. In an experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the IQ-tree shows a performance that is the ""best of both worlds"" for a wide range of data distributions and dimensionalities.","1063-6382","0-7695-0506-6","10.1109/ICDE.2000.839456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839456","","Quantization;Cost function;US Department of Transportation;Indexing;Ear;Needles;Radio access networks;Encoding","","168","2","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The wider bandwidth provides increased multipath resolution in a time-dispersive channel, leading to higher frequency-selectivity. A generalized RAKE receiver for interference suppression and multipath mitigation is proposed. The receiver exploits the fact that time dispersion significantly distorts the interference spectrum from each base station in the downlink of a wideband CDMA system. Compared to the conventional RAKE receiver, this generalized RAKE receiver may have more fingers and different combining weights. The weights are derived from a maximum likelihood formulation, modeling the intracell interference as colored Gaussian noise. This low-complexity detector is especially useful for systems with orthogonal downlink spreading codes, as orthogonality between own cell signals cannot be maintained in a frequency-selective channel. The performance of the proposed receiver is quantified via analysis and simulation for different dispersive channels, including Rayleigh fading channels. Gains on the order of 1-3.5 dB are achieved, depending on the dispersiveness of the channel, with only a modest increase in the number of fingers. For a wideband CDMA (WCDMA) system and a realistic mobile radio channel, this translates to capacity gains of the order of 100%.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.864017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=864017","","Fading;Multipath channels;Interference suppression;Multiaccess communication;Bandwidth;Frequency;RAKE receivers;Downlink;Wideband;Fingers","","168","111","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This process is the source of inspiration for the Embryonics (embryonic electronics) project, whose final objective is the design of highly robust integrated circuits, endowed with properties usually associated with the living world: self-repair (cicatrization) and self-replication. The Embryonics architecture is based on four hierarchical levels of organization. (1) The basic primitive of our system is the molecule, a multiplexer-based element of a novel programmable circuit. (2) A finite set of molecules makes up a cell, essentially a small processor with an associated memory. (3) A finite set of cells makes up an organism, an application-specific multiprocessor system. (4) The organism can itself replicate, giving rise to a population of identical organisms. We begin by describing in detail the implementation of an artificial cell characterized by a fixed architecture, showing that multicellular arrays can realize a variety of different organisms, all capable of self-replication and self-repair. In order to allow for a wide range of applications, we then introduce a flexible architecture, realized using a new type of fine-grained field-programmable gate array whose basic element, our molecule, is essentially a programmable multiplexer. We describe the implementation of such a molecule, with built-in self-test, and illustrate its use in realizing two applications: a modulo-4 reversible counter (a unicellular organism) and a timer ( a complex multicellular organism). We describe our ongoing research efforts to meet three challenges: a scientific challenge, that of implementing the original specifications formulated by John von Neumann for the conception of a self-replicating automaton; a technical challenge, that of realizing very robust integrated circuits capable of self-repair and self-replication; and a biological challenge, that of attempting to show that the microscopic architectures of artificial and natural organisms, i.e., their genomes, share common properties.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.842998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842998","","Robustness;Embryo;Organisms;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Chemicals;DNA;Programmable circuits;Multiprocessing systems;Field programmable gate arrays","","167","3","45","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that plant nonminimum phase zeros have a negative effect on a feedback system's ability to reduce the tracking error, and that in a multivariable system this effect results in a way depending on not only the zero locations, but also the zero directions. It is also shown that if unity feedback structure is used for tracking purposes, plant nonminimum phase zeros and unstable poles can together play a particularly detrimental role in the achievable tracking performance, especially when the zeros and poles are nearby and their directions are closely aligned.

Andonovic","University of Strathclyde, UK; University of Strathclyde, UK",IEEE Communications Magazine,"6 Aug 2002","2000","38","9","116","122","Wavelength-division multiplexing is currently being deployed in telecommunications networks in order to satisfy the increased demand for capacity brought about by the explosion in Internet use. The most widely accepted network evolution prediction is via an extension of these initial predominantly point-to-point deployments, with limited system functionalities, into highly interconnected networks supporting circuit-switched paths. While current applications of WDM focus on relatively static usage of individual wavelength channels, optical switching technologies enable fast dynamic allocation of WDM channels. The challenge involves combining the advantages of these relatively coarse-grained WDM techniques with emerging optical switching capabilities to yield a high-throughput optical platform directly underpinning next-generation networks. One alternative longer-term strategy for network evolution employs optical packet switching, providing greater flexibility, functionality, and granularity. This article reviews progress on the definition of optical packet switching and routing networks capable of providing end-to-end optical paths and/or connectionless transport. To date the approaches proposed predominantly use fixed-duration optical packets with lower-bit-rate headers to facilitate processing at the network-node interfaces. Thus, the major advances toward the goal of developing an extensive optical packet-switched layer employing fixed-length packets are summarized, but initial concepts on the support of variable-length IP-like optical packets are also introduced. Particular strategies implementing the crucial optical buffering function at the switching nodes are described, motivated by the network functionalities required within the optical packet layer.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.868150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868150","","Optical packet switching;Internet;Packet switching;Optical buffering;Optical fiber networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;Optical interconnections;Explosions;IP networks;Integrated circuit interconnections","","166","16","10","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Fast converging adaptive processor or a structured covariance matrix","M. Steiner; K.

Due to this lack of knowledge of an external environment, adaptive techniques require a certain amount of data to cancel the external interference. The number of statistically independent samples per input sensor required so that the performance of the adaptive processor is close (nominally within 3 dB) to the optimum is called the convergence measure of effectiveness (MOE) of the processor. The minimization of the convergence MOE is important since in many environments the external interference changes rapidly with time. Although there are heuristic techniques in the literature that provide fast convergence for particular problems, there is currently not a general solution for arbitrary interference that is derived via classical theory. A maximum likelihood (ML) solution (under the assumption that the input interference is Gaussian) is derived here for a structured covariance matrix that has the form of the identity matrix plus an unknown positive semi-definite Hermitian (PSDH) matrix. This covariance matrix form is often valid in realistic interference scenarios for radar and communication systems. Using this ML estimate, simulation results are given that show that the convergence is much faster than the often-used sample matrix inversion method. In addition, the ML solution for a structured covariance matrix that has the aforementioned form where the scale factor on the identity matrix is arbitrarily lower-bounded, is derived. Finally, an efficient implementation is presented.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.892662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892662","","Covariance matrix;Interference;Maximum likelihood estimation;Convergence;Vectors;Radar signal processing;Signal processing;Communication systems;Niobium;Jamming","","166","1","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We also show that a restricted class of encodings is sufficient to transmit any quantum source which may be transmitted on a given channel.

We give a necessary and sufficient condition under which this approximate Pareto curve can be constructed in time polynomial in the size of the instance and 1//spl epsiv/. In the case of multiple linear objectives, we distinguish between two cases: when the underlying feasible region is convex, then we show that approximating the multi-objective problem is equivalent to approximating the single-objective problem. If however the feasible region is discrete, then we point out that the question reduces to an old and recurrent one: how does the complexity of a combinatorial optimization problem change when its feasible region is intersected with a hyperplane with small coefficients; we report some interesting new findings in this domain.

For this domain we provide clear evidence that state-of-the-art commercial fraud detection systems can be substantially improved in stopping losses due to fraud by combining multiple models of fraudulent transaction shared among banks. We demonstrate that the traditional statistical metrics used to train and evaluate the performance of learning systems (ie. statistical accuracy or ROC analysis) are misleading and perhaps inappropriate for this application. Cost-based metrics are more relevant in certain domains, and defining such metrics poses significant and interesting research questions both in evaluating systems and alternative models, and in formalizing the problems to which one may wish to apply data mining technologies. This paper also demonstrates how the techniques developed for fraud detection can be generalized and applied to the important area of intrusion detection in networked information systems. We report the outcome of recent evaluations of our system applied to tcpdump network intrusion data specifically with respect to statistical accuracy. This work involved building additional components of JAM that we have come to call, MADAM ID (Mining Audit Data for Automated Models for Intrusion Detection).

As a starting point toward answering these questions, a typical class of first-order discrete-time dynamical control systems with both unknown nonlinear structure and unknown disturbances is selected for our investigation, and some concrete answers are obtained in the paper. In particular, we find that in the space of unknown nonlinear functions, the generalized Lipschitz norm is a suitable measure for characterizing the size of the structure uncertainty, and that the maximum uncertainty that can be dealt with by the feedback mechanism is described by a ball with radius 3/2+/spl radic/2 in this normed function space.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.895559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895559","","Uncertainty;Robust control;Control systems;Automatic control;Nonlinear control systems;Adaptive control;Stochastic systems;Optimal control;Feedback loop;Concrete","","165","","47","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key aspect of our system is the use of real-time stereo vision together with a simple algorithm which is suitable for real-time processing. Since the 3D coordinates of the features on a face can be directly measured in our system, we can significantly simplify the algorithm for 3D model fitting to obtain the full 3D pose of the head compared with conventional systems that use monocular camera.

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems.

From this study, we found that there was little use of OO constructs such as inheritance, and therefore polymorphism. It was also found that there was a significant difference in the defect densities between those classes that participated in inheritance structures and those that did not, with the former being approximately three times more defect-prone. We were able to construct useful prediction systems for size and number of defects based upon simple counts such as the number of states and events per class. Although these prediction systems are only likely to have local significance, there is a more general principle that software developers can consider building their own local prediction systems. Moreover, we believe this is possible, even in the absence of the suites of metrics that have been advocated by researchers into OO technology.

We propose an approach to quality of service (QoS) that overcomes these difficulties by combining features of reservations and adaptation. In this approach, a combination of online control interfaces for resource management, a sensor permitting online monitoring, and decision procedures embedded in resources enable a rich variety of dynamic feedback interactions between applications and resources. We describe a QoS architecture, GARA, that has been extended to support these mechanisms, and use three examples of application-level adaptive strategies to show how this framework can permit applications to adapt both their resource requests and behavior in response to online sensor information.","","0-7803-6266-7","10.1109/IWQOS.2000.847954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847954","","Quality of service;Resource management;Degradation;Application software;Mathematics;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Feedback;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Bandwidth","","163","20","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The imputed signal sequences, together with their importance weights, provide a way to approximate the Bayesian estimate of the transmitted signals and the channel states. Adaptive receiver algorithms for both uncoded and convolutionally coded systems are developed. The proposed techniques can easily handle the non-Gaussian ambient channel noise. It is shown through simulations that the proposed sequential Monte Carlo receivers achieve near-bound performance in fading channels for both uncoded and coded systems, without the use of any training/pilot symbols or decision feedback.

Specifically, the complexity of calculating the time domain responses at all the nodes of an RLC tree is linearly proportional to the number of branches in the tree and the solutions are always stable. The closed-form expressions introduced here consider all damping conditions of an RLC circuit including the underdamped response, which is not considered by the Elmore delay due to the nonmonotone nature of the response. The continuous analytical nature of the solutions makes these expressions suitable for design methodologies and optimization techniques.

Subjects viewed two 10-second stereo video-sequences, in which the right-eye frames were filtered vertically (V) and horizontally (H) at 1/2 H, 1/2 V, 1/4 H, 1/4 V, 1/2 H 1/2 V, 1/2 H 1/4 V, 1/4 H 1/2 V, and 1/4 H 1/4 V resolution. Temporal filtering was implemented for a subset of these conditions at 1/2 temporal resolution, or with drop-and-repeat frames. Subjects rated the overall quality, sharpness, and overall sensation of depth. It was found that spatial filtering produced acceptable results: the overall sensation of depth was unaffected by low-pass filtering, while ratings of quality and of sharpness were strongly weighted towards the eye with the greater spatial resolution. By comparison, temporal filtering produced unacceptable results: field averaging and drop-and-repeat frame conditions yielded images with poor quality and sharpness, even though perceived depth was relatively unaffected.

Some of the schemes are based on best-effort networks, and are thus unable to provide the user with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Others build on networks with connection admission control functions and are thus able to provide individual QoS guarantees. We particularly investigate the relevant time frame over which pricing schemes are assumed to operate. The majority of the schemes work on short time frames (on the order of minutes), which makes them applicable to use pricing as an additional means for controlling congestion.

The genetic algorithm (GA) adopted in this paper is based upon symbiotic evolution which, when applied to fuzzy controller design, complements the local mapping property of a fuzzy rule. Using this Symbiotic-Evolution-based Fuzzy Controller (SEFC) design method, the number of control trials, as well as consumed CPU time, are considerably reduced when compared to traditional GA-based fuzzy controller design methods and other types of genetic reinforcement learning schemes. Moreover, unlike traditional fuzzy controllers, which partition the input space into a grid, SEFC partitions the input space in a flexible way, thus creating fewer fuzzy rules. In SEFC, different types of fuzzy rules whose consequent parts are singletons, fuzzy sets, or linear equations (TSK-type fuzzy rules) are allowed. Further, the free parameters (e.g., centers and widths of membership functions) and fuzzy rules are all tuned automatically. For the TSK-type fuzzy rule especially, which put the proposed learning algorithm in use, only the significant input variables are selected to participate in the consequent of a rule. The proposed SEFC design method has been applied to different simulated control problems, including the cart-pole balancing system, a magnetic levitation system, and a water bath temperature control system. The proposed SEFC has been verified to be efficient and superior from these control problems, and from comparisons with some traditional GA-based fuzzy systems.","1941-0492","","10.1109/3477.836377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836377","","Learning;Symbiosis;Fuzzy control;Design methodology;Fuzzy sets;Algorithm design and analysis;Temperature control;Genetic algorithms;Differential equations;Input variables","","162","","34","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While these TFTs are better than their solid-phase crystallized counterparts in many device performance measures, they suffer from higher off-state leakage current and early drain breakdown. A new technology is proposed, employing metal-induced-unilateral crystallization (MIUC), which results in the removal from the edges of and within the channel region all major grain boundaries transverse to the drain current flow. Compared to the conventional ""bilateral"" MILC TFTs, the new MIUC devices are shown to have higher field-effect mobility, significantly reduced leakage current, better immunity to early drain breakdown, and much improved spatial uniformity of the device parameters. Thus they are particularly suitable for realizing low temperature CMOS systems on inexpensive glass panels.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.822287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=822287","","Silicon","","161","3","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A typical method for doing this is to compute a packet error probability assuming a certain fading distribution without taking into account time-correlation. This paper introduces work that has been done to model the effect of small-scale fading (Rayleigh and Ricean) within the ns network simulator. It allows for the faithful simulation of a complete fading envelope. The fading models have the appropriate statistics and also time correlational properties obtained from the Doppler spectrum. An efficient implementation based on a simple table lookup is described.","1090-3038","0-7803-6507-0","10.1109/VETECF.2000.887108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887108","","Fading;Computational modeling;Rayleigh channels;Frequency;Table lookup;Hardware;Mathematical model;Large-scale systems;Analytical models;Protocols","","161","2","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method is based on the initiation of a pulsed electric discharge inside the solid dielectric material. With pulse amplitudes of /spl sim/300 kV, material layers of /spl sim/2 cm can be punctured. Specific energy deposition, of /spl lsim/100 J/cm at a GW power level, leads to pressure buildup of /spl lsim/10/sup 10/ Pa in the discharge channel. Pressure waves and radially propagating cracks are launched into the solid body, which can lead to the separation of inclusions from the matrix or to detachment at material boundaries. To induce the discharge in the solid dielectric it must be immersed in a dielectric liquid with higher breakdown strength. Most applications use water, which has excellent breakdown strength at fast ramp rates and, due to its high permittivity, leads to field concentration in the solid dielectric. Electric impulse fragmentation is a clean physical method without any environmental burden and therefore well suited for recycling applications. In this paper we consider applications in the fields of demolition debris, incineration ashes, contaminated surface layers, electric appliances, glass, and elastoplastic materials. Finally, the economy and the scaling of the technique to large material throughput are discussed.","1558-4135","","10.1109/94.879358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879358","","Dielectric materials;Solids;Recycling;Dielectric liquids;Dielectric breakdown;Composite materials;Water conservation;Permittivity;Incineration;Ash","","161","27","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem has attracted a lot of interest over the years and as a result, many coverage protocols were proposed. In this survey, we first propose a taxonomy for classifying coverage protocols in WSNs. Then, we classify the coverage protocols into three categories (i.e., coverageaware deployment protocols, sleep scheduling protocols for flat networks, and cluster-based sleep scheduling protocols) based on the network stage where the coverage is optimized. For each category, relevant protocols are thoroughly reviewed and classified based on the adopted coverage techniques. Finally, we discuss open issues (and recommend future directions to resolve them) associated with the design of realistic coverage protocols. Issues such as realistic sensing models, realistic energy consumption models, realistic connectivity models and sensor localization are covered.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2019.000005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680729","Coverage protocols;energy consumption;literature review;sensing models;survey;wireless sensor network (WSN)","Protocols;Wireless sensor networks;Switching circuits;Robot sensing systems;Monitoring;Optimization","","163","","","","2 Apr 2019","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

The air-gap and permanent magnet size can be approximately determined based on our mathematics model, which is the most important part of SPMSM design. From our method, we can know that motor's power out torque is related to the torque angle that we selected in our design and it affects the air-gap and permanent magnet size. If we choose a low torque angle, the motor or generator's overload power handing capability will increase. The embrace value has a vital place in designing a motor or generator due to its effects on air gap flux density, cogging torque, efficiency and so on. In order to avoid the knee effect, the working point of the permanent magnet we selected in the design should be bigger than 0.5. The developed 36 slots, 4 poles, surface mound permanent generator is proposed. The corresponding finite element analysis (FEA) model is built based on our design method.

During low-voltage ride through (LVRT) period, seeing from the converter terminal towards the grid, the Thévenin equivalent grid impedance becomes pretty significant, accordingly making the converter terminal voltage highly sensitive to the output current. Under such circumstances, it is challenging for the converter to resynchronize with the grid via a phase-locked loop (PLL). This paper develops a reduced-order nonlinear model to elaborate on the dynamic synchronization characteristic of the converters. By considering the impact of grid impedance and analysing spatial vector tracking relation, resynchronization principle of the converters during LVRT is revealed. Besides, the impacts of circuit parameters and controller parameters, including residual grid voltage, grid impedance, current references, and PLL parameters, on the transient stability of the converters are investigated. The results are verified by simulation and experimental results.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2019.00005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681896","Grid fault;low voltage ride through;phase-locked loop;power converter;synchronization;transient stability.","Phase locked loops;Stability analysis;Transient analysis;Power conversion;Power system stability;Impedance","","42","","","","11 Apr 2019","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

This paper addresses the power sharing characteristics and the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) conditions of a galvanically isolated three-port SRC, operated in DC-transformer mode. A mathematical model, which effectively decouples principal from circulating currents and power flows, is proposed and developed. This new mathematical framework eases the analysis; and reveals a constant power sharing characteristic tightly dominated by the resonant tank parameters even though some degrees of freedom are allowed thanks to the introduction of a differential voltage at the input terminals.

As these applications are communication-intensive, optimizing network transfer between VMs is critical to the performance of these applications and network utilization of data centers. Previous studies have addressed this issue by scheduling network flows with coflow semantics or optimizing VM placement with traffic considerations. However, coflow scheduling and VM placement have been conducted orthogonally. In fact, these two mechanisms are mutually dependent, and optimizing these two complementary degrees of freedom independently turns out to be suboptimal. In this paper, we present VirtCO, a practical framework that jointly schedules coflows and places VMs ahead of VM launch to optimize the overall performance of data center applications. We model the joint coflow scheduling and VM placement optimization problem, and propose effective heuristics for solving it. We further implement VirtCO with OpenStack and deploy it in a testbed environment. Extensive evaluation of real-world traces shows that compared with state-of-the-art solutions, VirtCO greatly reduces the average coflow completion time by up to 36.5%. This new framework is also compatible with and readily deployable within existing data center architectures.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8698217","cloud computing;data center;coflow scheduling;Virtual Machine (VM) placement","Data centers;Cloud computing;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Processor scheduling;Fabrics;Schedules","","26","","","","29 Apr 2019","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

At present, vehicle localization is generally performed using some form of vehicle-mounted global positioning system (GPS). However, GPS signals may not be always available. Various GPS-free vehicle localization techniques using the ranging information, the prior knowledge of the vehicle's position, or the special hardware have been proposed for enhancing the performance of traditional GPS-based methods. Different from the previous approaches, we propose a GPS-free vehicle localization system using roadside units (RSUs) with directional antennas without specific hardware support on the vehicle and the assumption of the prior knowledge of the vehicle. In the proposed approach, each vehicle determines its position using the information contained within beacon messages transmitted by neighboring RSUs deployed along the road only. The performance of the proposed localization scheme is evaluated by ns-2 simulations and is compared with those of recent GPS-free and GPS-assisted localization systems. The simulation results show that the proposed localization scheme achieves a higher positioning accuracy than the existing GPS-free and GPS-assisted schemes. The feasibility of the proposed system for practical applications is further investigated experimentally.

With the calculation methods, the dc bias magnetizing current can be predicted considering the inconsistency of semiconductor switches and driver signals. In other words, if the maximum permitted dc bias of the transformer is given, the range of the inconsistency of semiconductor switches and driver signals can be obtained which helps guide the selection of semiconductor devices and design of the transformer.

This issue is not of wide concern in previous studies of direct power control (DPC) of GSC. By small signal analysis, it is shown that the impedance characteristic of the conventional direct power control GSC is not compatible with the inductive grid impedance in weak grid due to its constant power load behavior. To solve the problem, instead of feeding the DPC controller with direct measured voltage and current, a Kalman filter (KF) is used to obtain filtered output current and a double second-order generalized integrator (DSOGI) is used to obtain filtered voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC). These strategies change the impedance characteristic of the GSC dramatically and make it suitable to operate in weak grid where SCR is 2, while the rapid power response is preserved.

However, since the location of harvesting nodes can be dynamically changed in mobile environments, it is difficult to obtain the exact numbers of harvesting nodes and the distance between harvesting nodes and the RF energy source in all sectors within limited time. In such a situation, the operations of the RF energy source (i.e., monitoring sectors and transmitting the RF energy) can be modeled by a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which has high complexity to be solved. As a practical solution, we propose an observationbased directional energy transmission algorithm (OB-DETA) that estimates the efficiency of energy transmission in sectors and transmits the RF energy to the selected sectors with high energy transmission efficiency (i.e., sectors with lots of non-fully-charged harvesting nodes around the RF energy source). Evaluation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of OB-DETA over the comparison schemes in terms of the RF energy transmission efficiency.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2019.000015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718094","Directional antenna;energy harvesting;partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP);radio frequency (RF) energy;wireless power transmission (WPT)","Radio frequency;Energy harvesting;Directional antennas;Batteries;Optimization;Markov processes;RF signals","","11","","","","17 May 2019","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Though many SFC algorithms were introduced, they mostly neglect the state of the underlying networking layers and infrastructure, considering static costs for the connections among the VNFs. In this paper, we apply a model that considers also the topology and current load information of the IP layer below. We formulate the problem using an integer linear program (ILP) and propose also a heuristic algorithm with the objective of avoiding link overloads in the networking layer. Thus, we solve the stated VNF-SFC problem similar to the basic traffic engineering (TE) problem in networks.

Moreover, a proper no-load operation is proved, whenever the minimum voltage gain is higher than a given threshold. Differently from previous works on current-fed resonant converters, the presented theoretical analysis includes the effect of the input filter inductors, allowing to derive a simple design procedure to meet the given specifications. According to the outlined design steps, an experimental prototype was built, rated at 42~54 V to 400 V~300 W.

We first show a negative result: the anti-information diffusion does not increase the detection probability under Maximum-Likelihood-Estimator (MLE) when the number of infected nodes are sufficiently large by passive diffusion that the anti-information starts to be spread by a special node, called the protector, after is reached by the original information. We next consider the case when the distance between the information source and the protector follows a certain type of distribution, but its parameter is hidden. Then, we propose the following learning algorithm: a) learn the distance distribution parameters under MLE, and b) detect the information source under Maximum-A-Posterior-Estimator (MAPE) based on the learnt parameters. We provide an analytic characterization of the source detection probability for regular trees under the proposed algorithm, where MAPE outperforms MLE by up to 50% for 3-regular trees and by up to 63% when the degree of the regular tree becomes large. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through numerical results, and further present the simulation results for general topologies (e.g., Facebook and US power grid networks) even without knowledge of the distance distribution, showing that under a simple protector placement algorithm, MAPE produces the detection probability much larger than that by MLE.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2019.000020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8697898","Epidemic diffusion model;information source localization;maximum likelihood estimator","Maximum likelihood estimation;Topology;Internet;Network topology;Power grids;Facebook;Infectious diseases","","8","","","","23 Apr 2019","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

We also introduce eight special features of LZ77-compressed data for detecting the presence of errors. We demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm based on simulations and evaluate it using two publicly available databases comprising the Calgary and Canterbury corpora. The error detection rate using the proposed algorithm is below those of conventional methods, but the compression ratio is better. The application of a parity bit in the algorithm improves the error detection performance. The number of redundant bits increases owing to the insertion of the parity bit, but the code rate is still greater than or equal to 0.9, whereas conventional methods obtain code rates less than 0.9. Simulations demonstrate that the algorithm obtains significant performance improvements when a parity bit is periodically inserted.

Although resembling the modular multilevel converter, quasi two-level converter operates in a different manner, leading to the completely different sizing, operating and balancing principles. So far, no publication has analyzed the transition process occurring within the quasi two-level converter leg, which can be considered crucial from the cell capacitance sizing perspective. Therefore, this paper provides thorough and generalized mathematical description of converter leg dynamics during the voltage transition process.

This paper focuses on the recovery of a CFO and the sidelink identity set information by exploiting the two primary SSS (PSSS) symbols after the symbol timing is obtained. We propose the use of detection metrics for the quantized CFO and set information by estimating a multi-path fading channel subject to unknown delay times and residual CFO (RFO) errors.

Currently, many multicast applications impose the constraint wherein multicast flows must be processed by a series of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) before reaching their destinations. Given a multicast transmission, there are usually multiple server nodes, each of which is able to host all the required VNFs. Thus, the multicast flow should be initially steered to one or a few selected server nodes that act as pseudo sources, and the destinations will then retrieve new flow from any of these pseudo sources. In this paper, we model this kind of multicast as an uncertain multicast with multiple pseudo sources, whose routing structure is usually a forest consisting of multiple isolated trees. We then characterize and construct the Delay-guaranteed Minimum Cost Forest (D-MCF) such that each path from the source to the destination satisfies the end-to-end delay constraint. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we design two efficient methods, the Partition Algorithm (PA) and the Combination Algorithm (CA), to approximate the optimal solution. Theoretical analyses and evaluations indicate that these two methods can generate the desired routing forest for any multicast transfer. Moreover, the PA method achieves a better balance between performance and time consumption than the CA method. The evaluation results show that PA-(Ω+ 20) can reduce total cost by 49:02% while consuming 12:59% more time, thus significantly outperforming the CA-(Ω+ 20) method.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8595294","uncertain multicast;network function virtualization;delay guaranteed","Forestry;Vegetation;Servers;Routing;Delays;Multicast algorithms;Approximation algorithms","","5","","","","30 Dec 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

We herein consider a fixed number of feedback bits per DL user, where each DL user reports its quantized channel direction information (CDI) of the interference channel to a serving DL base station via its dedicated feedback channel. Based on the quantized CDI feedback, we design the UL and DL transmit zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) to mitigate the interference signals caused by the coexistence of the UL and DL transmissions. To maximize the DL data rate, the challenge of interference cancellation lies in how many feedback bits are adaptively allocated for the transmission of the quantized CDI of each channel link. This paper proposes an adaptive feedback bits allocation scheme which minimizes the mean rate loss between perfect channel knowledge and limited feedback system. We also propose the UL transmit power allocation scheme under the interference power constraint from the UL user to the DL user when the number of feedback bits for the quantized CDI is given. To jointly solve the feedback bits allocation and the UL transmit power allocation problems, we use an iterative scheme to maximize the DL data rate while satisfying the constraint of interference power. Finally, we investigate how many feedback bits per DL user are required to maintain a constant mean rate loss. The simulation results show that the proposed adaptive feedback bits allocation scheme significantly increases the DL data rate compared with the conventional schemes.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2019.000009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718091","Adaptive feedback bits allocation;dynamic TDD system;limited feedback system;uplink and downlink transmit beam-forming;uplink power allocation","Interference;Array signal processing;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling;Bit rate;Receiving antennas;MISO communication","","4","","","","17 May 2019","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Two streams of innovation processes are discussed and a generalisation of one of them to determine the extent of having a comprehensive systematic innovation process model. For the purpose of this paper a short definition of innovation is given. The innovation methods, systematic innovation, creative problem solving and TRIZ are briefly discussed. Methods to analyse problems is given as adequate definitions of problems are necessary for efficient finding of solutions. Idea creation techniques are discussed as well as the evaluation and implementation of ideas. Systematic innovation for business and management and the influence of psychological factors, problem definition and solving is examined. The conclusion looks at the combination of the creative problem solving and TRIZ processes and tools as presented in the model for systematic innovation for business and management and provide an evaluation of it.

However, the application of DFIM is limited in the real systems due to the lack of self-start capability under the power take me home (PTH) mode when the main engine fails. To overcome this problem, an approach is proposed in this paper. The basic idea is first to start the machine in the induction machine (IM) mode feeding from the ship-borne power grid (SPG) and then to switch over into the DFIM mode when the speed reaches its normal speed range. The hardware scheme, start procedure and control algorithm of the start approach are presented in the paper.

This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of downlink (DL) performance of a LS-CRAN. As an asymptotic performance measure, the scaling exponent of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) is derived for interference-free (IF), maximum-ratio transmission (MRT), and zero-forcing (ZF) operations. Our asymptotic analysis reveals four fundamental operating regimes and the performances of both MRT and ZF operations are fundamentally limited by the UL transmit power for estimating user's channel state information, not the DL transmit power. We obtain the conditions that MRT or ZF operation becomes interference-free, i.e., order-optimal. As higher UL transmit power is provided, more users can be associated and the data rate per user can be increased simultaneously while keeping the order-optimality.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2019.000008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8697899","Asymptotic performance;cloud-RAN;massive-MIMO;ultra-dense network","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Antenna arrays;Next generation networking;Stochastic processes;Geometry","","1","","","","23 Apr 2019","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

In this paper, we present a full-wavefield approach, called reservoir-oriented joint migration inversion (JMI-res), to estimate the high-resolution reservoir elastic parameters from surface seismic data. As a first step in JMI-res, we reconstruct the fully redatumed data (local impulse responses) at a suitable depth above the reservoir from the surface seismic data, while correctly accounting for the overburden interal multiples and transmission losses. Next, we apply a localized elastic full waveform inversion on the estimated impulse responses to get the elastic parameters. We show that JMI-res thus provides much more reliable local target impulse responses, thus yielding high-resolution elastic parameters, compared to a standard redatuming procedure based on time reversal of data. Moreover, by using this kind of approach we avoid the need to apply a full elastic full waveform inversion-type process for the whole subsurface, as within JMI-res elastic full waveform inversion is only restricted to the reservoir target domain.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggz557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267023","Image processing;Inverse theory;Tomography;Waveform inversion;Wave scattering and diffraction","","","1","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Although this process has been largely studied, it is not clear how the injected fluid influences the rupture size of the induced events. Here we re-investigate the induced earthquakes that occurred during an injection at Soultz-sous-Forêts, France in 1993 and studied the link between the injected fluid and the source properties of the numerous induced earthquakes. We take advantage that deep borehole accelerometers were running in the vicinity of the injection site. We estimate the moment and radius of all recorded events based on a spectral analysis and classify them into 663 repeating sequences. We show that the events globally obey the typical scaling law between radius and moment. However, at the scale of the asperity, fluctuations of the moment are important while the radii remain similar suggesting a variable stress drop or a mechanism that prevents the growth of the rupture. This is confirmed by linking the event source size to the geomechanical history of the reservoir. In areas where aseismic slip on pre-existing faults has been evidenced, we observed only small rupture sizes whereas in part of the reservoir where seismicity is related to the creation of new fractures, a wider distribution and larger rupture sizes are promoted. Implications for detecting the transition between events related to pre-existing faults and the onset of fresh fractures are discussed.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267080","Fourier analysis;Earthquake source observations;Induced seismicity","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Specifically, full-wave methods enable the analysis of electrically large objects with more direct applications of Maxwell's equations, while fundamental mechanisms, such as diffractions, reflections, and ray-like behaviors, are expected to be revealed as simulation results rather than being introduced as initial assumptions. Such full-wave solvers not only supply reliable simulations for arbitrarily complex structures, but also support high-frequency techniques by providing reference results for further analyses.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2019.9117251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117251","","Erbium;Matlab","","","","2","","15 Jun 2020","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

First of all, a typical three-bus test system is used to analyze the series resonance of the branch. It is found that the branch series resonance can be identified by the port equivalent admittance formed between the bus node and the reference node. Then, by establishing the node port association matrix and using the node impedance matrix, the multi-port Thevenin equivalent impedance matrix is obtained, in other words, the equivalent admittance matrix of the port is formed, and the load branch of the node is eliminated, as well as the effect of the node load branch on the series resonance of the identification branch is eliminated. The algorithm effectively utilizes the node admittance matrix commonly used in power system. Finally, the feasibility and correctness of the three-bus system and IEEE9 network system are proved by simulation analysis.

In order to reduce the ill-posedness of the problem, the heterogeneous wave speed parameter is represented using a limited number of coefficients associated with a basis of eigenvectors of a diffusion equation, following the regularization by discretization approach. We compare several choices for the diffusion coefficient in the partial differential equations, which are extracted from the field of image processing. We first investigate their efficiency for image decomposition (accuracy of the representation with respect to the number of variables). Next, we implement the method in the quantitative reconstruction procedure for seismic imaging, following the full waveform inversion method, where the difficulty resides in that the basis is defined from an initial model where none of the actual structures is known. In particular, we demonstrate that the method may be relevant for the reconstruction of media with salt-domes. We use the method in 2-D and 3-D experiments, and show that the eigenvector representation compensates for the lack of low-frequency information, it eventually serves us to extract guidelines for the implementation of the method.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267042","Image processing;Numerical modelling;Waveform inversion;Seismic tomography;Wave propagation","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We show that lensing effects leave a recognizable signature on the observed rates, and that they can be prominent only in the presence of an extremely steep mass function (or redshift evolution) and mainly at low inferred redshifts.

As we contemplated the situation, my new bride grumbled about how much she loved that hat. Since the alligator did not seem interested in the hat (I came to this conclusion because the alligator did not pick it up and wear it), and since I was in my early twenties and nearly invincible, I ran over and got the hat for her.

In particular, it is important to understand the extent to which seismic anisotropy is due to more recent geodynamic activities in the asthenosphere, or to frozen-in deformation in the lithosphere. We show that these two endmember cases can in principle be distinguished using shear-wave splitting observations from SKS waves. This is illustrated by the simple example of pure olivine with horizontal a-axis, and differing orientations of the other two axes, namely, vertical b and vertical c. The azimuthal dependence of shear-wave splitting measurements is described by two parameters, which can provide additional information about subsurface deformation. In particular, the oscillation parameter d1 constrains the orientation of foliation. We demonstrate that shear-wave splitting in the Western and Central United States indeed shows the predicted azimuthal dependence, related to a mainly subhorizontally oriented flow plane of deformation in the upper mantle. This has important implications for asthenospheric flow.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267089","Mantle processes;North America;Numerical approximations and analysis;Seismic anisotropy;Dynamics of lithosphere and mantle;Rheology: mantle","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In the process of uncertain reasoning, as the elements in the recognition framework increase, the evidence dimension increases exponentially, The computation required also increases exponentially, which greatly affects the application of uncertainty theory in practical engineering. To solve this problem, the PCA algorithm is used to reduce the dimension of evidence in uncertain reasoning. However, in evidence theory, the focal elements in evidence are not completely independent, which is the essential difference between evidence theory and probability theory. This is also the advantage of evidence theory in dealing with uncertain data. Due to the PCA algorithm cannot be used to reduce the dimension of evidence directly. This paper proposes a generalized PCA method and gives strict mathematical proof. The traditional PCA algorithm is a special case of the generalized PCA algorithm proposed in this paper. Finally, the application of a generalized PCA algorithm in uncertainty reasoning is given in this paper, with example results showing that the generalized PCA proposed can greatly reduce the computation required and obtain good evidence combination effect.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936879","Generalized PCA;Evidence theory;Data dimensionality reduction","Principal component analysis;Dimensionality reduction;Feature extraction;Covariance matrices;Cognition","","","","","CCBY","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In particular, we propose an optimal phase shift design based on the upper bound of the ergodic spectral efficiency and statistical channel state information. Furthermore, we derive the requirement on the quantization bits of the LIS to promise an acceptable spectral efficiency degradation. Numerical results show that using the proposed phase shift design can achieve the maximum ergodic spectral efficiency, and a 2-bit quantizer is sufficient to ensure spectral efficiency degradation of no more than 1 bit/s/Hz.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2923997","National Science Foundation; Distinguished Young Scholars of China(grant numbers:61625106); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61531011); Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University(grant numbers:YBPY1860); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2221-E-110-026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8746155","Large intelligent surface;phase shift;bit quantization","Upper bound;Wireless communication;Rician channels;Degradation;Antenna arrays;Relays","","633","","9","CCBY","26 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The experiments indicate that the designed antenna can be switched between two states operating at 2.45- and 3.50-GHz band, respectively. Good agreement between the simulated and measured results is achieved, and the radiation patterns and gains are similar for the two states.

The model uses relationships between average airborne PM concentrations and dust accumulation, rain removal of accumulated dust, and the accumulated dust and transmission loss that have been developed in the literature to estimate soiling losses in a time series. Multiple model runs were performed and were compared with measured soiling data at seven locations.

Then, in the data collection phase, the sensed data of whole network are collected along a data collection tree. The data measurement matrix is utilized to compress the sensed data in each sensor node, and the data reconstruction matrix is utilized to reconstruct the original data in the sink.

Second, a feasible and effective method is applied to construct an infinite number of coexisting attractors from the new system.

It is found that the AC breakdown voltage of the C5F10O gas mixtures increases gradually with both the gas pressure and the content of C5F10O. As the partial pressure of C5F10O increases, the relative insulation strength increasing trend of the C5F10O gas mixtures becomes less obvious with the increase in the gas pressure. The AC breakdown voltage of the C5F10O/Air gas mixture is higher than that of the C5F10O/N2 gas mixture. In addition, the decomposition products of the C5F10O gas mixtures are mainly CF4, C2F6, C3F8, C4F10, and C3F7H. Under the same condition, the content of the CF4 in C5F10O/Air gas mixture is higher than that of the C5F10O/N2 gas mixture.

In fact, a single 2G MB GaN e-FET can replace the two anti-series connected conventional power semiconductors required in this inverter topology, realizing a four-quadrant (AC) switch with bidirectional voltage blocking capability and allowing controlled bidirectional current flow. Furthermore, as shown in this paper in case of three-phase (3-Φ) buck-boost (bB) current source inverter (CSI) systems comprising a DC-link current impressing buck-type DC/DC input stage and a subsequent boost-type 3-Φ current DC-link inverter output stage, a variable DC-link current control strategy, based on a Synergetic Control concept, can be applied to significantly reduce the switching losses occurring in the 3-Φ inverter. This strategy is denominated two-third pulse-width modulation (2/3-PWM), since by properly shaping the DC-link current with the input stage, the desired 3-Φ sinusoidal load phase currents can be generated by switching, in each switching period, only two out of the three phases of the output stage. Based on comprehensive circuit simulations and analytical calculations, a detailed explanation of the developed modulation and control schemes in different operating conditions is provided, and the reduction of losses enabled by 2/3-PWM is confirmed. Next, the seamless transition of the 3-Φ bB CSI system from 2/3-PWM to conventional 3/3-PWM is demonstrated. Finally, a 3.3 kW 3-Φ bB CSI system, applying 2/3-PWM and employing research samples of 2G MB GaN e-FETs in the 3-Φ inverter, is estimated to achieve an efficiency of 98.4% and a power density of 18 kW/dm3(295 W/in3) at a switching frequency of 140 kHz.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2019.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8950942","Dual-gate (2G) monolithic bidirectional (MB) gallium nitride enhancement-mode field-effect transistors (e-FETS);three-phase buck-boost current source inverter system;variable DC-link current control","Inverters;Gallium nitride;Switches;Voltage control;Switching loss;Buck converters","","56","1","","","9 Jan 2020","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

Therefore, it is very meaningful to plan a path for collision-free lane change with a vehicle in front, which strikes a balance between vehicle performance and driving comfort. In this paper, a path planning method is designed based on fifth-order Bézier curve for lane change with a vehicle in front. Firstly, the boundaries were determined to ensure the fast response to the changing environment and driving comfort. Then, a multi-objective optimization function was set up, considering the curvature at the start point, the maximum curvature, the angle between path centre and road axis (the maximum swing angle), and the lane change time. Next, the coordinates of the control points that determine the curve shape were solved, and thus the optimal path was set up based on the fifth-order Bézier curve. Simulation results show that the proposed method could output suitable collision-free paths for lane change at different vehicle velocities. The research results shed new light on the dynamic path planning in actual traffic environment and enjoy great application value.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2938179","Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China(grant numbers:2016B010132001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8819948","Intelligent vehicle;collision avoidance;path planning;Bézier curve;multi-objective optimization","Path planning;Intelligent vehicles;Acceleration;Roads;Shape;Optimization;Collision avoidance","","51","","24","CCBY","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both FSRs consist of the resistive sheet layer and the bandpass FSS layer with an air gap in the middle. The resistive sheet layer is constructed by inserting the CBSR into the center of the resistor-loaded dipole. The CBSR resonates at the transmission band of the bandpass FSS and exhibits infinite impedance, which is used to realize high-transmittance performance at the transmission band. The full wave simulation results show that the transmission band of one FSR is above the absorption band (A-T FSR), while the transmission band of another FSR is below the absorption band (T-A FSR). The transmission band of the A-T FSR and T-A FSR are separately located at 12.76 and 6.08 GHz with 0.66- and 0.13-dB insertion loss, and the corresponding absorption bands with absorption rate >90% are located at 6.10-10.98 GHz and 9.04-15.94 GHz, respectively. The CBSR used in T-A FSR (M-CBSR) is a miniaturized design of the CBSR used in A-T FSR. Comparing with the CBSR structure, the electric length of the M-CBSR's longer side is reduced to about 50%, which is only 12.2% of the wavelength of the transmission band. Two prototypes are fabricated and measured to verify the absorption/transmission performance of the proposed FSRs.

Recently, machine learning, especially deep learning techniques, have brought revolution to image super resolution reconstruction. Motivated by these achievements, in this paper, we propose a novel super resolution method for medical images based on an improved generative adversarial networks. To obtain useful image details as much as possible while avoiding the fake information in high frequency, the original squeeze and excitation block is improved by strengthening important features while weakening non-important ones. Then, by embedding the improved squeeze and excitation block in a simplified EDSR model, we build a new image super resolution network. Finally, a new fusion loss that can further strengthen the constraints on low-level features is designed for training our model. The proposed image super resolution model has been validated on the public medical images, and the results show that visual effects of the reconstructed images by our method, especially in the case of high upscaling factors, outperform state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods such as SRGAN, EDSR, VDSR and D-DBPN.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944862","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771155); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854062","Generative adversarial network;medical image reconstruction;squeeze and excitation block;super resolution","Generative adversarial networks;Medical diagnostic imaging;Training;Image reconstruction;Spatial resolution","","44","","27","CCBY","1 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, during the development of power converters, only dual principles have been adopted, such as in the study of the relationships between voltage-source converter (VSC) and current-source converter (CSC), while the isomorphic relationship between them was never discovered. This, indeed, limits the understanding of the relationships among converter topologies. In this letter, such isomorphic relationships are first revealed in the power converter field. Several topologies are discovered as isomorphic pairs, and the modulation isomorphism between single-phase N-level VSC and N-phase CSC (N = 3) is also demonstrated. The experimental results verify that the physical meaning of direct pulsewidth modulation for CSC is the modulation process of the dc-side voltage of three-phase CSC, as its isomorphic pair shows. With the aid of isomorphic transformation, the existing knowledge of VSCs can be directly transformed into corresponding CSCs to deal with problems where dual principle has difficulties, which provides another opportunity for the innovation of power converters.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2019.2895827","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; China Scholarship Council and Alberta Innovates Technology Futures scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8633427","Current-source converter (CSC);dual relationship;isomorphic graph;isomorphism;voltage-source converter (VSC)","Pulse width modulation;Topology;Monte Carlo methods;Voltage-source converters;Technological innovation;Admittance","","43","","23","OAPA","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach is first calibrated for both HEMT devices with experimentally measured data, to provide the best accuracy of the simulation. Recess gate device suffers from high potential to the channel, increased parasitic resistances, and deep level traps in barrier due to surface roughness. In addition, selective thinning of the barrier and increase parasitic resistance results in 17% reduction on the carrier concentration. The carrier mobility degradation due to surface roughness and electron velocity lessen due to high electric field result shrinkage of current density with considerable shift of the threshold voltage toward positive value. Even though transconductance does not seems to be remarkably changed for 3-nm recess gate, its value increases on deeper recess.

This controller provides extra control flexibility in terms of the current error reduction, and it gives improved steady-state tracking performance. When the coefficient of current feedforward is equal to the load resistor (K = R), the steady-state error is effectively minimized even when regulating sinusoidal variables. The total harmonic distortion is also reduced. In order to comparatively evaluate the modified PI controller, a PR controller is designed and tested.

The proposed balanced antenna consists of a balanced stepped-impedance microstrip-slotline transition structure, a driver dipole, a parasitic strip, and a bandpass filtering unit. A good differential-mode (DM) passband selectivity is formed by inserting a microstrip stub-loaded resonator (SLR) in the feed line of the quasi-Yagi antenna. This integration enables the antenna to achieve both compact size and high frequency selectivity. By controlling the dimensions of SLR, the central frequency and fractional bandwidth (FBW) can be easy to be adjusted. Meanwhile, the microstrip-slotline transition structure can achieve a good wideband common-mode (CM) suppression without affecting the DM ones, thus simplify the design procedure. The proposed antenna with low cross-polarization level and high CM rejection is found to be comparable to the conventional quasi-Yagi antenna. Furthermore, there are two radiation nulls on both sides of the passband to improve the selectivity effectively. In order to validate its practicability, the balanced antenna is designed and fabricated. The experimental results exhibit that the designed balanced filtering antenna features good filtering response, low cross-polarization level, and high CM rejection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931141","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JB180204); State Key Laboratory of Metamaterial Electromagnetic Modulation Technology(grant numbers:GYL08-1444); Xidian University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8772060","Balanced antenna;filtering antenna;CM suppression;low cross-polarization","Microstrip;Slot lines;Microstrip filters;Microstrip antennas;Resonant frequency","","34","","19","CCBY","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are suggested as an alternative platform for integrated sensors and analog circuits in extreme environments in oxidizing air atmosphere over a wide temperature range from 22°C to 400°C. An optimal biasing region, with a peak of transconductance (gm,peak) at -2.3 V with a negligible shift over the temperature range was observed. Moreover, remarkably low Vth variation of 0.9% was observed, enabling the design of analog circuits that can operate over the entire temperature range.

This paper evaluates the performance of RF fingerprinting method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD). For this purpose, VMD is used to decompose Bluetooth (BT) transient signals into a series of band-limited modes, and then, the transient signal is reconstructed from the modes. Higher order statistical (HOS) features are extracted from the complex form of reconstructed transients. Then, Linear Support Vector Machine (LVM) classifier is used to identify BT devices. The method has been tested experimentally with BT devices of different brands, models and series. The classification performance shows that VMD based RF fingerprinting method achieves better performance (at least 8% higher) than time-frequency-energy (TFED) distribution based methods such as Hilbert-Huang Transform. This is demonstrated with the same dataset but with smaller number of features (nine features) and slightly lower (2-3 dB) SNR levels.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854788","Variational mode decomposition;Bluetooth signals;specific emitter identification;feature extraction;signal classification","Transient analysis;Feature extraction;Signal to noise ratio;Fingerprint recognition;Radio frequency;Transforms;Performance evaluation","","33","","14","CCBY","2 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is based on a cascaded modulator structure, where continuous wave light from an optical source is modulated by an incoming RF signal twice. The AoA of an RF signal can be determined by the system output RF signal power. The proposed structure is capable for measuring the AoA of both narrow and broadband RF signals. This overcomes the limitation in all previously reported photonics-based AoA measurement systems, which are applicable to either a single-frequency RF signal or a broadband RF signal.

By investigating current through the FE-DE series capacitor and the gate capacitor of FeFET, we find that incomplete screening of spontaneous polarization charge results in transient NC and sub-60 mV/dec SS. Also, it should be noted that, for FeFET, small depletion layer capacitance has an important role to cause strong depolarization effect and thus steep SS.

The theoretical analysis and the calculation method for the structure parameters are presented by utilizing the equivalent circuit model. The reflector and the rasorber are designed in simple 2-D structures, consisting of only one layer of resistive sheet and a pure ground or a bandpass frequency-selective surface, respectively. Based on the analysis of the condition for realizing two-sided absorption, we found that the parameters of each element in the resistive sheet are correlative and proportional to each other. The calculation method of actual physical dimensions of the proposed structure is provided, so the element sizes of unit cell structure can be calculated and designed to approximate the desired values. Hence, based on these proposed methods, the perfect two-sided absorption FSR or reflector can be realized directly when the deduced relationship of the parameters is satisfied. Therefore, the approach of impedance matching becomes much easier. The simulation results show the two wideband absorption bands located above and beneath the reflection/transmission band. An FSR and a reflector are designed, fabricated, and measured. The measurement results match well with the simulation results and verify the designing principle.

Traditional approaches to analysis and extraction do not work well for big data because this data is complex and of very high volume. A major data mining technique known as data clustering groups the data into clusters and makes it easy to extract information from these clusters. However, existing clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical, are not efficient as the quality of the clusters they produce is compromised. Therefore, there is a need to design an efficient and highly scalable clustering algorithm. In this paper, we put forward a new clustering algorithm called hybrid clustering in order to overcome the disadvantages of existing clustering algorithms. We compare the new hybrid algorithm with existing algorithms on the bases of precision, recall, F-measure, execution time, and accuracy of results.

This study is carried out over the sub-tropical region of Durban, South Africa (29.8587°S, 31.0218°E). Utilizing the non-linear mapping capability between inputs and outputs, the backpropagation neural network is trained using rainfall data collected from 2013 to 2016 to predict rainfall rates. Long-term rain attenuation statistics arising from predicted rain rates are compared with actual and ITU-R model, and results show a relatively small margin of error between predicted rain attenuation exceeded for 0.01 % of an average year. Furthermore, analysis of predicted and actual rain attenuation within individual rain events from different rainfall regimes was carried out and results show that the proposed model can be used to predict the state of the link. This is demonstrated when the trained BPNN was tested using unseen data that was collected from January 2017 to May 2018, a period that spans through all four different climatic seasons of summer, autumn, winter and spring. Results of the test show a correlation coefficient of 0.8298.

It is challenging to scale down conventional bulk FinFETs into 5-nm technology node due to the sub-fin leakage increase. Meanwhile, bottom oxide deposition after anisotropic etching for source/drain (S/D) epi formation prevents the sub-fin leakage effectively even without the PTS doping, thus achieving better gate-to-channel controllability. Bottom oxide FinFETs also have smaller gate capacitances than do conventional FinFETs because the parasitic capacitances decrease by smaller S/D epi separated from the bottom Si layer, which reduces junction and outer-fringing capacitances. But smaller S/D epi decreases the stresses along the channel direction, and the effective widths decrease by the bottom oxide layer blocking the current paths at the bottom side of fin channels. Furthermore, increase of the interconnect resistance and capacitance parasitics down to 5-nm node diminishes the improvements of total delays as the interconnect wire length increases greatly. In spite of these drawbacks, 5-nm node bottom oxide FinFETs achieve smaller total delays than do the 7-nm node conventional FinFETs, especially for low-power applications, thus promising for the scalability of bulk FinFETs along with simple and reliable process by avoiding PTS step.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920902","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy(grant numbers:10080617); Korea Semiconductor Research Consortium Support Program for the Development of the Future Semiconductor Device; National Research Foundation of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1C1B5017795); POSTECH-Samsung Electronics Industry-Academia Cooperative Research Center; IC Design Education Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731862","5-nm node;bottom oxide;FinFETs;punch-through-stopper (PTS);intrinsic delay;total delay;sub-fin leakage","FinFETs;Delays;Capacitance;Logic gates;Doping;Resource description framework;Performance evaluation","","28","","26","OAPA","5 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The NSFETs with a crescent inner spacer and slanted source/drain (S/D) increase the physical gate lengths of bottom NS channel, but the anisotropic over-etching of substrate regions induces punchthrough effect at the bottom transistor. Bottom isolation by depositing dielectrics prior to S/D formation is effective to eliminate the punchthrough effect as well as to attain shorter RC delay by better electrostatics and parasitic capacitance reduction. In addition, the isolated S/D NSFETs without punchthrough stopper decrease parasitic and gate capacitances further at the frequency greater than 600 MHz at which the inversion carriers are not formed at the bottom transistor.

Photoplethysmogram waveform features have often been used to estimate the target volumes. For these estimations, it is necessary to acquire photoplethysmogram waveforms and changes in their derivative waveform details, for which the photoplethysmograms measured at comparatively high sampling rates have been used. The performance of smartphone cameras and wearable photoplethysmogram sensors has improved; with regard to mobile health technology, photoplethysmograms measured at lower sampling rates offer considerable advantages. These include lower computational resources, compression of accumulated data, and lower sensor power consumption. However, compared to photoplethysmograms measured at a high sampling rate, photoplethysmogram measurement at a low sampling rate will result in waveform signal degradation. This paper investigates the possibility of using photoplethysmograms measured at a low sampling rate. To this end, we statistically compared photoplethysmogram waveform features obtained from 63 male subjects free of circulatory diseases, at a sampling rate of 240 Hz, with waveform features obtained at low sampling rates (120, 60, 30, 20, and 10 Hz) through downsampling, and evaluated possible commercial use.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914498","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP16K00393); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8704947","Big data;mobile health;photoplethysmogram;waveform feature","Mobile handsets;Volume measurement;Sensors;Heart rate variability;Diseases;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","","27","","28","OAPA","2 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Feedback and resistive biasing circuits were adopted for driver and main stages to making their frequency responses as flat as possible. Optimum impedances of not only extended lower and upper-frequency corners but also center frequency, were then extracted. Such dual-frequency selective impedance matching technique was applied for extended lower and upper-frequency corners while checking the mismatch level for the center frequency.

The hot electron stress leads to the significantly positive shift of threshold voltage and the notable decrease of drain-to-source current for the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs of hydrogen poisoning. For the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs of hydrogen poisoning, the trap density increases by about one order of magnitude after the hot electron stress experiment. The physical mechanism can be attributed to electrically active traps due to the dehydrogenation of passivated point defects at AlGaN surface, AlGaN barrier layer, and heterostructure interface.

In this paper, we demonstrate—for the first time to our knowledge—distributed birefringence and hydrostatic pressure measurements based on phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) in highly birefringent photonic crystal fibers. We study the response to hydrostatic pressure of two dedicated pressure-sensitive photonic crystal fibers in the range from ∼0.8 to ∼67 bar with a 5-cm spatial resolution using a phase-OTDR approach. We find differential pressure sensitivities between the slow and fast polarization axes of the studied fibers of –219 MHz/bar and 95.4 MHz/bar.

Also detecting the faults in inverter fed IM under variable speed applications under varying load is one of the major issues in industrial drives. As the signatures of electromagnetic field contains the entire data in association with the location of rotor, stator and mechanical parts of the motor, a regular monitoring of fields in the airgap can be used to diagnose the inter-turn fault in the stator winding of IM.

The proposed pixel circuit employs a simple structure that consists of four n-channel MOSFETs and one capacitor, resulting in high resolution. In addition, this circuit compensates for the threshold voltage (Vth) variation of the driving transistor caused by the body effect, which increases the Vth as the source-to-body voltage of the driving transistor increases, thus reducing the emission current deviation, resulting in a high luminance uniformity. Moreover, the proposed pixel circuit extends the data voltage range using the capacitive coupling of the storage capacitance and the parasitic capacitance at the gate node of the driving transistor to precisely control the emission current. To verify the performance of the proposed pixel circuit, a test pattern with an array of the proposed 4T1C pixel circuits was fabricated on a single-crystalline silicon wafer as a backplane using a 110 nm standard CMOS process with 5.5 V high-voltage devices. The proposed pixel circuit occupies a unit sub-pixel area of 5.76μm × 1.92μm, which corresponds to a resolution of 4410 pixels per inch. The measurement results show that the emission current deviation error of the proposed pixel circuit ranges between -1.16% and +1.14%, which is improved from between -45.97% to +45.42% achieved in the conventional current-source type 2T1C pixel circuit, which does not compensate for the Vth variation of the driving transistor. Moreover, the measured data voltage range of the proposed pixel circuit is extended to 1.618 V, which is 8.17 times wider than that of the conventional pixel circuit. Therefore, the proposed pixel circuit is very suitable for high resolution and high luminance uniformity of OLEDoS microdisplays.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2019.2935766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8804214","OLED;OLED-on-silicon;OLEDoS;microdisplay;high resolution;high luminance uniformity;pixel circuit","Transistors;Organic light emitting diodes;Microdisplays;Threshold voltage;Logic gates;Programming;Capacitors","","25","","20","CCBY","16 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The position, orientation, and sensitivity of each magnetic sensor in a sensor array must be precisely determined for accurate magnetic source analysis. We proposed a calibration method using an array of multiple coils, which is applicable to an RT magnetic sensor array. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed calibration method, we applied it to an MR device-based magnetocardiography (MCG) system equipped with an L-shaped planar sensor array, which was newly developed for the simultaneous observation of both anterior and lateral sides of the body.

Here, we show the OPM that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a digital coherent receiver to deal with the abundance of training data required for convergence and pre-processing of input data by human engineers needed for feature (representation) extraction. To proof a concept of the OPM based on CNN, we experimentally demonstrate that a CNN can learn an accurate optical signal-to-noise-ratio (OSNR) estimation functionality from asynchronously sampled data right after intradyne coherent detection. We evaluate bias errors and standard deviations of a CNN-based OSNR estimator for six combinations of modulation formats and symbol rates and confirm that the proposed OSNR estimator can provide accurate estimation results (<0.4 dB bias errors and standard deviations). Additionally, we investigate filters in the trained CNN to reveal what the CNN learned in the training phase.

Based on 2:1 unequal Wilkinson power divider, an equal three-way power divider is obtained with energy subdivided by three-line parallel coupled line. Subsequently, a Wilkinson power divider with the wideband filtering response is realized by adding a pair of short-ended parallel coupled lines that can provide multiple transmission zeros and poles.

The temperature corrected performance ratio, normalized to a clean state, is used to derive the soiling ratio (SR). Cleaning events, caused by either rain or manual cleaning, are automatically detected by positive shifts in the running median of the SR time series. Soiling rates are then estimated by the rate of change of the SR between the cleaning events, which is determined by linear regression.

The modeling methodology provides insights into the electrical cross-coupling relationships between input and output parameters of the capacitive power transfer (CPT) systems, including the effect of distance and alignment of the coupling plates. It is revealed that, regardless of the circuit complexity or matching network order, the model core can be reduced to a basic gyrator relationship with added coefficients when required, thus obtaining a compact, closed-form relationship between the input and output terminals. The model has been validated through rigorous simulations and experiments; all found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions under changes of the air-gap, and medium capacitance. To this end, an experimental CPT prototype that operates in the MHz range has been designed and implemented while the transmitter and receiver have been realized by four 170 mm × 170 mm copper plates. In addition, to provide better insight into the capacitive interface under different structures and distances and alignments, the capacitive coupler has been methodically examined through Finite Elements Analysis (FEA) tools Maxwell (Ansys).

The proposed antenna is analyzed from a traditional slot antenna with one full-wavelength radiation mode. Subsequently, two pairs of slot stubs are symmetrically loaded along the arms of the initial antenna near the nulls of the magnetic current of the full-wavelength radiation mode. By suitably choosing the lengths of the loaded stubs, extra two radiation modes can be introduced and merged with the full-wavelength one, resulting in a wide impedance bandwidth with three resonances. Finally, the size of the ground plane and locations of stubs are investigated to suppress the sidelobes and ensure high gain within the impedance bandwidth. For validation, a prototype antenna is fabricated and its electrical performances are measured. The experimental results show that the operating fractional bandwidth (FBW) of the proposed antenna can be effectively increased to 40.8% while keeping the inherent narrow slot structure. Besides, the measured average peak gain and its corresponding ripple within the impedance bandwidth are 6.2 dBi and 1.1 dB, respectively, and the radiation patterns are maintained constant.

First, a band pass filter is applied to extract the fundamental component of the voltage so as to build a model for the implementation of the GVM-DPC method. Next, a sliding mode control (SMC) is designed to handlethe terms of the harmonic in order to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output currents. Simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SMC with GVM-DPC control strategy. It is shown that although the performance of real and reactive powers are sacrificed, the THD of the current is significantly reduced.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2019.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8889496","Distorted grid voltage;grid voltage modulated direct power control (GVM-DPC);sliding mode control;total harmonic distortion (THD);voltage source inverter","Voltage control;Reactive power;Band-pass filters;Inverters;Mathematical model;Harmonic analysis;Sliding mode control","","21","","","","4 Nov 2019","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

Four polygonal metal patches are sequentially rotated around the crossed dipoles. By tuning the electromagnetic coupling characteristic between the patches and the crossed dipoles, the axial-ratio bandwidth (ARBW) of the lower frequency band can be enhanced significantly. Furthermore, four slots are etched on the parasitic patches in a sequential rotation way, modifying the current distribution. Therefore, an extra CP mode produces at the higher band. A wide 3-dB ARBW is realized by combing three CP modes, including the basic CP mode of the cross dipole at the middle frequency band. A prototype of the proposed broadband CP antenna was manufactured and measured to verify the design principle. The measurement results illustrate that the antenna has a wide 10-dB return loss bandwidth of 99.2% (1.24-3.68 GHz) and a broad 3-dB ARBW of 72.7% (1.41-3.02 GHz) for right-hand circular polarization (RHCP).

Simulation of the GPS ceramic antenna array verifies that the OAM beams with the mode of ±1 show small divergence angle and very standard spiral phase distribution. To test the transmission capability of the proposed antenna array, a measurement system that can detect the one-dimension spatial distribution of electromagnetic characteristic for the OAM beams is set up.

Capsules can be used to represent humans and objects, including robots, in a given dynamic environment. In this scenario, it is important to calculate the minimum distance between capsules efficiently, especially for scenes (situations) that include a high number of capsules. This paper investigates the utilization of QR factorization for performing efficient minimum distance calculation between capsules. The problem is reformulated as a bounded variable optimization in which an affine transformation, deduced from QR factorization, is applied on the region of feasible solutions.

In this paper, a miniaturized groove GW (GGW) called slow-wave GGW (SW-GGW) is presented for the first time. The slow-wave feature is implemented by introducing symmetrical capacitive quasi-periodic corrugations inside the GGW. To obtain more design and manufacturing flexibility, all the four walls of the SW-GGW are separated utilizing the gap waveguide technology. A six-order iris SW-GGW band-pass filter is designed, whose length is reduced to 57.1% of the conventional iris rectangular waveguide filter with the same response.

In spite of several advantages, doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind energy systems are very sensitive to grid disturbances. DFIG system with conventional vector control is not robust to disturbances as it is based on PI controllers. The objective of this paper is to design a new vector control that is robust to external disturbances. To achieve this, inner current loop of the conventional vector control is replaced with sliding mode control. In order to avoid chattering effect and achieve finite time convergence, the control gains are selected based on positive semi-definite barrier function. The proposed barrier function adaptive sliding mode (BFASMC) is evaluated by testing it on a benchmark multi-machine power system model under various operating conditions. The simulated results show that the proposed method is robust to various disturbances.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-019-0119-3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10368159","Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG);Wind power generation;Sliding mode control;Robust control","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;PI control;Wind energy;Doubly fed induction generators;Power system stability;Benchmark testing","","20","","19","","21 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

In the presence of external feedback, a very strong stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) (~9 dB below the signal light) emerges at the output power of ~3.56 kW, where the onset of the transverse mode instability (TMI) limits further power scaling. By large angle cleaving the signal arm of the forward combiner to avoid external feedback, the maximum output power of 5.07 kW is achieved with no sign of TMI. The Raman stokes light is ~35 dB below the signal light and the M2 factor is measured to be ~1.6. To directly characterize its power stability and engineering capability, the fiber oscillator is tested for continuous 5-h operation at ~5.07 kW with power fluctuation less than 0.42%.

Results indicate that the leakage current presents a saddle-shaped curve on days without rain, and that there is a remarkable positive correlation between leakage current and humidity as well as a negative correlation between leakage current and temperature.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to enhance the contrast of remote sensing image while avoiding color distortion and detail loss. First, based on the Sobel operator strength, the local adaptive weighting parameter is obtained to penalize the fixed regularization parameter of original guided filtering. Then, the grayscale difference between flat patch and edge patch, which is caused by the fixed regularization parameter is amplified meanwhile without sacrificing the denoising performance. Finally, the Gaussian filtering of original multiscale retinex with color restoration is replaced with the guided filtering based on the Sobel edge detection operator to estimate the incident component of an image. Comparing with the previous algorithms, the proposed one can obtain more edge details and better color fidelity but with lower computational complexity and higher efficiency.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2902959","Northwestern Polytechnical University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658153","Guided filtering;MSRCR;remote sensing image;Sobel edge detection operator","Image edge detection;Filtering;Remote sensing;Image color analysis;Kernel;Image enhancement;Filtering algorithms","","18","","17","OAPA","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna is composed of a cross-coupled semi-loop (CCSL) structure with a single pole 4-throw controlled by a logic circuit for frequency tuning capability and a Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) with a coupled pattern for wideband characteristics. The operating frequency ranges are 2.5-3.6 GHz, which corresponds to Band 7 (2500-2690 MHz), Band 22 (3410-3590 MHz), Band 38 (2570-2620 MHz), Band 41 (2496-2690 MHz), and Band 42 (3400-3600 MHz). The good isolation between the two signal input ports is achieved due to the CCSL radiator which creates orthogonal current flow direction with respect to the current induced by the PIFA radiator. The parametric study results of the dual-port antenna are presented to explain the optimization process based on the simulation works and experiments.

In addition, MN2 enable the LIGBT to conduct the reverse conducting current like the freewheeling diode. In the forward-conducting state, MN2 is turned off, then the proposed LIGBT operates like a conventional one and the snap-back is avoided. The gate electrode of MN2 can be controlled synchronously by the gate signal of the LIGBT which is level-shifted by a p-i-n diode (D1) and processed by an anode-controlling circuit, and therefore, the proposed RC-LIGBT still maintains a three-terminal configuration. D1 and MN2 are embedded in the drift region and anode-side of the LIGBT, respectively, and they can be isolated by deep-oxide trenches.

The passivation layer's thicknesses and relative permittivity of high-k dielectric are varied as parameters. It is shown that in the case of double passivation layers, the breakdown voltage is enhanced significantly compared to the case of the SiN single passivation layer when the second high-k layer becomes thick. This occurs because the electric field at the drain edge of the gate is reduced. However, in the case of a relatively thin second high-k layer, the breakdown voltage can be lowered remarkably compared to the case with a high-k single passivation layer even if the first SiN layer is rather thin.

The rotor eccentricity region in the z-plane is mapped onto a uniform region in the w-plane. The magnetic field solutions are obtained by modulating the magnetic field distributions without rotor eccentricity with the relative permeance function derived from the effect of rotor eccentricity. The torque of magnetic harmonic gears is calculated from the radial and tangential components of the air-gap magnetic fields. Results of the finite element method and prototype test confirm the validity of the analytical prediction.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2019.000005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8709303","Eccentric rotor;electromagnetic torque;fractional linear transformation;magnetic harmonic gears;relative permeance function","Gears;Rotors;Harmonic analysis;Magnetic flux;Magnetic fields;Air gaps;Torque","","17","","","","9 May 2019","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

In this paper, we report a high energy noise-like pulse generation from a nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) mode-locked TDFL. By using highly efficient core-pumping at 1650 nm and intra-cavity filtering component, stable mode-locking operation at 1750 nm is realized at a pump threshold of 1.5 W. With increasing the pump power to 5 W, the pulse width is stretched from 0.8 ns to 3.7 ns, while the monitored output power is linearly increased from 50 mW to 251 mW, corresponding to a maximum pulse energy of 321 nJ at the pulse repetition rate of 782 kHz. The long-term and shot-to-shot stability of the output are characterized to be 0.11 dB and 2.8% respectively. Noise-like pulse operation of the laser is confirmed by measuring the autocorrelation trace, which demonstrates a coherent peak on top of a wide pedestal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of high energy noise-like pulse generation from a TDFL at 1.7-μm band, enabling potential applications in for example spectroscopic analysis and material processing.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2941324","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:HKU 17209018,E-HKU701/17,T42-103/16-N,HKU C7047-16G,HKU 17205215); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:N_HKU712/16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8836607","Fiber lasers;mode-locked lasers.","Laser mode locking;Erbium-doped fiber lasers;Optical fiber polarization;Laser noise;Laser excitation;Laser stability","","17","","31","CCBY","13 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The center frequencies of the four differential-mode (DM) passbands can be controlled independently by changing the electrical lengths of each FASLR. A novel interdigital coupled line is firstly proposed to enhance source-load coupling further, which contributes to a higher selectivity.

The lens consists of a dielectric disc and two parallel plates, whose vertical spacing is varied linearly to achieve a suitable effective refraction index profile for the polarization parallel to the plates. The desired refraction profile is that of the Luneburg lens. The variation in plate spacing has negligible effect on the polarization perpendicular to the plates, and therefore, the dielectric material is selected such that the circular shape of the lens approximates the dimensions of the extended hemispherical lens. This way, the lens provides focusing or collimation for both linear polarizations. The lens is fed with square waveguides supporting both polarizations. Several feeding waveguides allow beam switching over a wide angular range. The designed lens antenna was fabricated, and the simulation and measurement results agree well and show that the proposed antenna concept is a valid solution for the upcoming 5G technologies, for instance as the access-point antenna.

Siamese network-based visual object tracking approaches have recently received considerable attention for their high speed and superior performance. However, for scale and angle estimation, Siamese trackers require multiple search regions, which increases the computation time, thereby decreasing the real-time tracking performance. This paper proposes a one-shot Siamese network, named Siam-OS, for fast and efficient visual object tracking. Siam-OS uses only a single search region and estimates the scale and angle of the target bounding box. This significantly reduces the number of computations required for the deep convolutional feature extraction, and thus increases the tracking speed.

At higher μ, a triple point arises where the asymptotic solutions for FN, MG, and CL intersect.

The sharing of a single transceiver for signals with different bands ensures perfect stability and coherence among the waveforms, which makes it possible to realize a super-resolution range profile by fusion of dual-band signals without heavy computation on phase compensation. In the experiment, the radar operates in S-band with a bandwidth of 1.5 GHz and X-band with a bandwidth of 3 GHz, and results show its range resolution is up to 1.6 cm by coherent fusion processing, which is nearly corresponding to the resolution gotten by a linear frequency modulated wave with a bandwidth of 9.5 GHz ranging from 2 GHz to 11.5 GHz, much higher than the scenario when the radar is operated in the single-band mode.

This rapid reduction of SAR depending on the antenna and its location on the handset has been shown, both computationally and experimentally, regardless of the phantom model such as a flat phantom suggested for SAR compliance testing of devices in contact with the body, for a sphere phantom, and for head-shaped models used for SAR compliance testing of cell phones. Unfortunately, our observations in the past were based on SARs of only three cell phones. Expecting that the SARs for cell phones may exceed the safety limits for body contact, cell phone manufacturers have started to recommend that the devices can be used at 5-25 mm from the body even though it is difficult to see how to maintain this distance correctly under mobile conditions. The National Agency ANFR of France recently released the cell phone SAR test data for 450 cell phones that measure 10-g SARs reducing by 10%-30% for each millimeter distal placement from the planar body phantom. Their data corroborate our findings that most cell phones will exceed the safety guidelines when held against the body by factors of 1.6-3.7 times for the European/ICNIRP standard or by factors as high as 11 if 1-g SAR values were to be measured as required by the U.S. FCC.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2906017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8688629","XXXXX","Cellular phones;Safety;Telephone sets;Standards;Wireless communication;Guidelines;FCC","","16","","11","OAPA","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This large discrete gap can be divided into several partial gaps in order to reduce the air gap stray field and consequently the proximity losses in the winding. The multi-gap core, realized by stacking several thin ferrite plates and inserting a non-magnetic spacer material between the plates, however, exhibits a substan-tial increase in core losses which cannot be explained from the intrinsic properties of the ferrite. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of the scientific literature regarding machining induced core losses in ferrite, dating back to the early 1970s, is provided which suggests that the observed excess core losses could be attributed to a deterioration of ferrite properties in the surface layer of the plates caused by mechanical stress exerted during machining. However, in a first experimental analysis no structural evidence for a deteriorated layer close to the surface is identified by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Therefore, in a next step, a new calorimetric measurement setup based on temperature rise monitoring is proposed in this paper in order to quantify and differentiate between core losses associated with the bulk and the surface of the ferrite plates and therefore to pinpoint the measured excess core loss to shallow layers of ferrite with deteriorated magnetic performance. Electrical measurement of the surface related core losses utilizing the widely accepted two-winding wattmeter method with reactive power compensation is outlined in the appendix but was not employed in this work due to comparably low measurement accuracy. By means of the proposed measurement technique, the bulk and surface core loss density of the MnZn ferrite material 3F4 from FerroxCube was determined for sinusoidal flux density amplitude varying from 75 mT up to 200 mT and excitation frequencies ranging from 200 kHz to 1 MHz. The measured core loss densities (W/cm3) show good agreement with the Steinmetz model provided by the manufacturer validating the proposed calorimetric core loss measurement technique. The measured surface loss density (W/cm2) can also be well predicted with a Steinmetz model, whereby the frequency exponent α in the surface is slightly smaller and the flux density exponent β is slightly larger compared to the Steinmetz parameter of the bulk ferrite. It is shown that the ratio between surface and bulk core losses of a composite core assembled from individual plates is only a function of plate thickness and does not depend on the actual cross section area. Critical plate thickness is then defined to be reached when the total power loss in the composite core has doubled compared to a solid (single-piece) core sample. This new quantity provides a very helpful figure for multi-gap inductor designs. Besides the deteriorated surface layers, several other mechanisms potentially contributing to increased core losses in multi-gap inductors were identified and are finally discussed in the appendix of this paper: flux crowding in the core due to tolerances and imperfections in machining and assembly; deterioration of ferrite properties due to pressure buildup in the stack of plates during the curing of the employed epoxy resin; ohmic loss in the ferrite associated with the current flowing in the conduction path provided by the low impedance of the ferrite material at high frequencies and the parasitic capacitance between winding and the ferrite core.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2019.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681899","Distributed air gap;high Q inductor;machining induced loss;MnZn ferrite;multi-gap inductor;surface loss.","Ferrites;Windings;Core loss;Inductors;Magnetic cores;Loss measurement;Air gaps","","16","","","","11 Apr 2019","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

Firstly, the Equi-Potential Ring (EPR) of the termination acts as an anode and the N-Stopper/N-Collector of the termination acts as the cathode of the anti-parallel built-in diode. The N-Stopper/N-Collector is shorted to the P-Collector, and it also acts as the electric filed stopper in the breakdown state. Secondly, the N-Collector and the P-Collector are designed apart at the surface and bottom, respectively. Thus the short effect of the N-Collector of the conventional RC-IGBT is avoided, and the snapback is completely eliminated. Thirdly, the P-Collector is not replaced by the N-Collector so that the hole injection is much higher than the conventional RC-IGBT, thus the forward voltage drop (Von) can be reduced remarkably, which is favorable to the decrease of conducting energy loss. The results show that, the LDT-RC-IGBT not only eliminates the snapback but also reduces Von, it achieves a better trade-off between Von and turn-off loss Eoff.

In this study, we determined the amplitude of the acoustic pressure in the CLINIcell, an optically transparent chamber suitable for cell culture. The pressure field was characterized based on microbubble response recorded using the Brandaris 128 ultrahigh-speed camera and an iterative processing method. The results were compared to a control experiment performed in an OptiCell, which is conventionally used in microbubble studies. Microbubbles in the CLINIcell responded in a controlled manner, comparable to those in the OptiCell. For frequencies from 1 to 4 MHz, the mean pressure amplitude was -5.4 dB with respect to the externally applied field.

For the fiber knot sensor, the RH variations induce both extinction ratio change and wavelength shift. The optical spectra of the fiber knot resonator under different RH are measured, and the extinction ratio and wavelength shift sensitivity are measured to be 0.034 dB/% RH and 10 pm/% RH, respectively. The response time for the tapered fiber is 1.13 s for RH increasing from 28.6% to 53.4% and 2.27 s for the reverse operation. The microfiber knot sensor can respond in 0.8 and 1.55 s accordingly.

We have shown that the complete graph $K_{n}$ has a minimum ABC$\Pi $ index among connected simple graphs with $n$ vertices, while the star graph $S_{n-1}$ has the maximum ABC$\Pi $ index. As $S_{n-1}$ attains the maximum amongst bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices, we additionally show that the bipartite complete balanced graph $K_{\left \lfloor{ n/2 }\right \rfloor, \left \lceil{ n/2 }\right \rceil }$ attains the minimum in this class of graphs.

Four piezoelectric based fiber stretchers are placed on a ~104 km single-mode test fiber at the distances of 1 km, 10 km, 87 km and 102.7 km and used for perturbation tests. The stretchers generated vibration signals which are analyzed to quantify the system performance. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of vibration signals at the monitored distances is measured over the 12-hour recorded data within 34-second time windows considering the multi-point random interference of scattered light and fading phenomena. Using the 12-hour data, SNR histograms at four different locations are generated and mean SNR values are obtained. The signals received from 102.7 km has a maximum SNR of 24.7 dB and a mean SNR of 7.3 dB with a spatial resolution of 15 m.

This lubricating gap flow module is a numerical model based on the fluid-structure interaction algorithm in which the fluid film pressure is calculated by the Reynolds equation. The oil film height is determined by the micromotions of the piston and the deformation of both the piston and bushing interface. The micromotions of the piston are obtained from the dynamic force balance of external force and fluid force.

Recently, the notion of inverse sum indeg (henceforth, ISI) energy of graphs is introduced and is defined by  $\sum \limits _{i=1}^{n}|\tau _{i}|$ , where  $\tau _{i}$  are the  $S$ -eigenvalues. We give ISI energy formula of some graph classes. We also obtain some bounds for ISI energy of graphs. In the end, we give some noncospectral equienergetic graphs with respect to inverse sum indeg energy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765701","Energy of graphs;inverse sum indeg energy;extremal bounds;equienergetic graphs","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Indexes;Symmetric matrices;Bipartite graph;Chemical compounds","","14","","27","CCBY","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The growing field of waveguide-based Raman spectroscopy tries to solve these challenges by working toward fully integrated Raman sensors with increased interaction areas. In this letter, we demonstrate resonance Raman measurements of hemoglobin, a crucial component of blood, at 532-nm excitation using a tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) waveguide platform. We have also characterized the background signal from Ta2O5 waveguide material when excited at 532 nm.

In the design, the simulated annealing algorithm is taken to optimize the grating structure and phase difference simultaneously. We find that this non 0-π phase grating exhibits interesting properties. When the etching depth is slightly lower than the theoretical depth, the zero-order light intensity is enhanced compared to other diffraction orders. Conversely, when the etching depth is slightly greater than the theoretical depth, the zero-order light intensity is attenuated. This allows us to flexibly adjust the brightness of the zero-order diffractive light. In contrast, the deviation of the etching depth will always result in a brighter zero-order light for the conventional Dammann grating.

By switching the diode, the antenna with meander line is able to operate in single-band of 2.08-2.54 GHz and dual-bands of 1.65-1.84 GHz and 5.35-6.40 GHz, while the antenna without meander line is able to operation between two single-bands of 1.84-2.28 GHz and 4.6-6.0 GHz. All these operation bands cover the UMTS (1750 MHz-1780 MHz), ISM (2.4 GHz), WIMAX (2.5-2.69 GHz) and WLAN (2.4-2.484 GHz/5.725-5.825 GHz) applications. The radiation performance was simulated by High Frequency Structure Simulator, and the measurements were taken in an anechoic chamber to verify the simulation results. Good agreements are observed between the simulated and measured results. Moreover, the radiation patterns of the proposed antennas remain stable at different reconfigurable bands.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940610","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871071); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8830398","Frequency reconfigurable antenna;composite right/left-handed transmission line (CRLH-TL);zeroth-order resonance (ZOR)","Antennas;Integrated circuit modeling;Switches;Equivalent circuits;Resonant frequency;Dispersion;PIN photodiodes","","14","","37","CCBY","10 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By loading the ends of the posts with variable-reactance elements, quasi-elliptic-type filtering transfer functions with multiple levels of spectral adaptivity can be obtained. These reconfiguration properties include center-frequency control, bandwidth tuning, and intrinsic RF switching-off. The proposed adaptive BPF concept can be extended to high-order transfer functions shaped by 2N poles and $2N$ transmission zeros (TZs) for BPFs composed of N dual-mode resonators. To prove the experimental viability of the engineered tunable BPF concept, a two-pole/two-TZ prototype and a four-pole/four-TZ prototype with tunable transfer functions in the 1.5-3 GHz band were built and measured.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900059","University of Colorado(grant numbers:68522); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8643979","Bandpass filter;bandwidth tuning;cavity filter;dual-mode filter;tunable filter;reconfigurable filter;RF filter;substrate-integrated-waveguide (SIW) filter","Band-pass filters;Cavity resonators;Tuning;Resonant frequency;Radio frequency;Filtering theory","","14","","16","OAPA","19 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study explores a multi-categorical probabilistic approach for sharing bike demand prediction. In order to overcome the weakness of using single point measurements to describe bike usage conditions, we prepare three alternatives to capture the range, local variation, and trend of bike usage over a short-time period. The suitable indicator variables are determined based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results. The Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) is adopted to cluster homogeneous bike usage states. Then, a Markov chain model is developed based on the identified states to forecast the categorical changes of bike usage. Finally, to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the persistence model is employed as a benchmark and two measures-Percent Correct (PC) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS), are introduced to quantify categorical data prediction performance. The results show that the proposed approach is able to offer high accuracy, skill, reliability, and discrimination at suitable prediction intervals.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923766","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Natural Science Basic Research Plan, Shaanxi Province, China(grant numbers:2017JQ5033); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M620434); Shaanxi Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017BSHEDZZ38); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:300102218401,300102218404,300102218309); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741004","Gaussian mixture models;Markov chain model;sharing bike;multi-categorical forecast","Predictive models;Data models;Biological system modeling;Markov processes;Principal component analysis;Probabilistic logic;Market research","","14","","15","CCBY","19 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper is on the experimental validation of a generic electromagnetic transient-type (EMT-type) model of aggregated WTGs or wind parks suitable for transient studies. The phasor domain equivalent of the generic model, suitable for protection tools based on steady-state solvers, is also considered. The model has been validated using two sets of actual relay records for the fault response of two wind parks consisting of Type-III WTGs and connected to 115 kV and 230 kV transmission systems. The objective is to show that the generic model can reproduce the actual fault response in simulations, and protection engineers can obtain accurate models of wind parks using fault records. A distinctive characteristic of a WTG is its substantially different negative sequence fault current contribution compared to a synchronous generator. The paper shows that the generic model provides enough options to reproduce the negative sequence behavior and hence is suitable for fault studies involving negative sequence-based protection.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-019-0521-x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028823","Renewable generation;Wind turbine generator;Doubly-fed induction generator;Short-circuit analysis;Electromagnetic transient-type model;Phasor domain model","Circuit faults;Substations;Relays;Integrated circuit modeling;Voltage control;Generators;Voltage measurement","","13","","13","","9 Mar 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

This model also provides better intercarrier interference by reducing the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR). This leads to reduced crosstalk, which impacts the multi-core and multimode RoF links. Long-term evolution advanced signals of a 256-quadratic-amplitude modulation of different bandwidths are used to validate the model. We achieved an average reduction of 2.5 dB in ACLR for signal bandwidths in the range 100–300 MHz while maintaining minimum error vector magnitude (EVM).

Unfortunately, a quantitative healing assessment is not yet available in clinical practice. The aim of the paper is to prove the feasibility of the mechanical vibration method to assess bone healing in fractures treated with external fixation, in in vivo conditions. The case study was a patient with a tibial fracture treated with a monoaxial fixator. The healing process was monitored for three months through a series of five impact tests. The pins screwed into the bone were used both to excite and measure vibrations. Fracture healing was quantitatively assessed by estimating the resonant frequencies of the leg. The first frequency increased of about 4% per week during the observation period. After the hard callus formation (13 week), also other frequencies increased within the range 1%-6% per week. X-ray observations confirmed the healing progress and proved the method potentiality. In addition, the vibratory response of the leg after fixator removal was evaluated and resulted characterized by five modes in the bandwidth 0-1000 Hz. The results suggest that the vibratory response of a fractured bone treated with external fixation can be a promising indicator for quantitative healing monitoring. The mechanical vibration method could be helpful for reducing X-ray exposure of patients and could be performed more frequently, as desirable for obtaining more attentive monitoring.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2019.2901455","Università di Pisa(grant numbers:PRA 2017 (PRA_2017_62)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667865","Bone healing;experimental modal analysis;external fixator;fracture healing monitoring;mechanical vibrations","Pins;Bones;Monitoring;Resonant frequency;Legged locomotion;Vibrations;Biomedical monitoring","","13","","17","OAPA","15 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially, the corner-fed square-ring radiator is designed with one end open-circuited. The surface currents flow along the circumference of the square-ring, which excite dual-band dual-sense CP radiation with a right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) at one frequency band and a left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) at the other band. Later, a rhombic-shaped slot and an inverted V-shaped parasitic element, used to balance the surface currents in horizontal and vertical directions at the middle and low frequency regions, excite two additional LHCP bands. The proposed antenna is systematically presented through a CP generation principle, a surface current distribution, and parametric analysis. The measured results yield an impedance bandwidth (IBW) of 83.9% (2.33-5.70 GHz) and the 3-dB axial ratio bandwidths (ARBWs) of 7.3% (2.38-2.56 GHz), 9.0% (2.75-3.03 GHz), 3.7% (3.42-3.53 GHz), and 7.1% (5.16-5.54 GHz). The maximum broadside gains achieved within the axial ratio bandwidths are 2.5, 2.9, 3.4, and 2.7 dBi, respectively. Compared to other reported works considering quad-band CP radiation, the proposed antenna achieves a wider ARBW and smaller size.

While keeping the simplicity and speed advantages of the SPGD algorithm, we adopted several optimization techniques to discern the global minimum from local minima and achieve better accuracy. The enhanced SPGD algorithm includes the annealing of the learning rates, identifying and escaping of local minima with large perturbations, and comparing of the transient error function with a reference value. We were able to exactly analyze the modal content of beams from six-mode optical fibers with high precision in seconds. Calculation of the modal weight and phase percentage errors, as well as simulations of far-field evolution images, confirmed the importance of finding the global minimum in improving the accuracy and real-time analysis of MD.

The prototype is comprised of a piezoelectric actuator and a pump chamber through a conical tube that connects the pump chamber with the buffer chamber. First, the flow characteristics of the valve-less pump were performed by using COMSOL Multiphysics. According to the simulation result, the decline of flow velocity around the valve holes on the side far from the center of the pump chamber may be the reasons for the performance degradation.

The main difficulty for the GEO-LEO bistatic multi-channel HRWS SAR system is that the baseline is variant with the scene in the conventional Doppler Fourier transform domain during azimuth signal reconstruction.

However, the reported SIR wide stopband bandpass filters are limited in either stopband performance or design complexity. Here we propose an approach to improve the stopband performance and reduce the design complexity simultaneously. Two in-resonator open stubs are adopted in a SIR (with tap-feeding) to stagger the frequencies of higher-order modes (compared with other SIR) and produce two adjustable transmission zeros without affecting the fundamental properties. For a SIR filter employing such a structure, the spurious passbands are doubly deteriorated by the staggering and up to four transmission zeros. At the same time, the fundamental passband is not affected, which significantly reduces the design complexity. As a result, not only wide stopband but also high-suppression stopband can be obtained in a simple design. A prototype based on the substrate integrated coaxial line (SICL) is experimented showing an impressive stopband performance. Agreeing with the simulation well, the measured stopband is extended up to about 12 f0 with the suppression of 40 - 50 dB (f0 is the center frequency). The proposed technique could be very useful to design a bandpass filter with a wide and high-suppression stopband efficiently.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2943605","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601246,61601242); National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory of RF Integration and Micro-Assembly Technology(grant numbers:KFJJ20170201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8848370","Bandpass filter;open stub;substrate integrated coaxial line (SICL);stepped impedance resonator (SIR);wide stopband","Passband;Resonant frequency;Filtering theory;Band-pass filters;Substrates;Impedance;Q-factor","","12","","34","CCBY","25 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The focus is on high-performance microprocessors. To evaluate the progression of chip power, Intel’s Core-i7 (Intel’s highest performance consumer microprocessor manufactured in the highest performance CMOS technology node) was used as the benchmark. Core-i7 has been manufactured for eight generations starting in the 45-nm node and continuing through the 14++ node. This paper argues that in the more recent nodes, the total chip power at constant frequency (energy-per-operation) has scaled much less than that of the earlier CMOS nodes. The early 14-nm technology exhibited particularly poor power scaling, and in fact, the technology was improved by increasing the device current and relaxation of the contacted gate pitch in 14++. Early product data in 10 nm points to issue in dropping the chip power (at constant frequency) relative to the previous node (14++), which may challenge the power-performance justification for scaling to the 10 nm node and beyond. Improving chip power scaling (energy-per-operation) in upcoming nodes is critical as a key part of the value proposition for continued CMOS scaling, especially as applied to high-performance microprocessors.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8570735","Computer performance;CMOS scaling;FinFET;Moore’s law;MOSFET;power dissipation;scaling;technology node","Bridge circuits;Frequency measurement;CMOS technology;Microprocessors;Benchmark testing;Capacitance;High frequency","","12","","17","OAPA","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, a novel planar-spiral transmitter coil (TX-coil) with an outer-tight and inner-sparse configuration is proposed to achieve a high quality factor (Q-factor) and uniform magnetic field, which ensures high efficiency and improves the misalignment tolerance for several-megahertz WPT systems. Furthermore, a closed-form expression for the Q-factor is provided and analyzed for coil optimization. By using this method, a TX-coil with an outer diameter of 100 mm and a wire diameter of 1.5 mm is designed and tested at 1 MHz.

This method utilizes an indirect structure MPC and a sorting algorithm to implement current tracking and capacitor voltages balancing, considerably resulting in reduced calculation burden. In addition, different from the conventional MPC solutions, we add a simple proportional-integral (PI) controller to suppress circulating current through modifying the submodule (SM) inserted number, which is parallel to the MPC loop. This hybrid control solution combines both advantages of MPC and linear control, evidently resulting in improved performance of circulating current.

Alternatively, the diesel generator system can combine with other power supply systems to reduce the effect of greenhouse gases emitted to the environment and to improve power supply reliability. This paper aims at establishing an optimized configuration for typically powering base transceiver stations using remarkable hybrids of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) with optimal performance in cost consideration, emission, space management and adequate reliability in base-transceiver station area. The optimization was tested on the diverse set of hybrids of RESs for powering BTSs in Southwestern part of Nigeria using Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Electric Renewables (HOMER) micro grid Analysis Tool 3.8.7. The simulated results show that hybrid H2 made of Photovoltaic Cell (PV), Wind Turbine, Diesel Generator, Battery Storage and Converter has the lowest Total Net Present Cost (TNPC) in Lagos, Ogun and Oyo States while hybrid H1 made of PV and DG emerged as the best in Ondo, Ekiti and Osun States. Hybrid H2 with desired characteristics has an average TNPC reduction of 35.01 % over the present system of Diesel Generator-only. Further results revealed precisely that TNPC responds more to change in the global horizontal irradiation than any other uncontrollable variables. These notable findings will be extremely applicable for a cost-effective and environmentally friendly powering schemes that may be efficiently implemented on BTSs in different Southwestern regions of Nigeria.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2019.8643147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8643147","Environmental friendly;Green telecommunication;HOMER-3;Optimal Performance;Renewable Energy","Optimization;Wind speed;Generators;Renewable energy sources;Load modeling;Reliability;Hybrid power systems","","11","","","","3 Mar 2019","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Reciprocal underwater acoustic transmissions between two acoustic stations extracted the range-averaged temperature. Furthermore, a field experiment of high-frequency acoustic transmission was performed in the Jiulong River estuary.

The results demonstrate that the modulation format can be identified with the required optical signal-to-noise ratio not higher than the forward error correction (FEC) threshold. The advantage of our method is that it is not sensitive to phase noise, frequency offset, and nonlinearity in optical fiber communication systems.

We successfully obtained bidirectional mode-locking operations with pulse repetition frequency adjustable from 35 to 122 MHz by shortening the cavity length. Meanwhile, with the reduction of the intracavity dispersion, the number of Kelly sidebands was significantly decreased and the output energy was more concentrated on the soliton pulse. Besides, by manipulating the pump power and polarization controller, the two results of bidirectional mode-locked pulses with the same repetition frequency and differential repetition frequency were observed. We found that the repetition rate difference between the clockwise and counterclockwise pulse trains was adjustable by changing the pump power or controlling the intracavity polarization. When the pulse repetition frequency was 35 MHz and 122 MHz, the adjustment range of repetition rate difference was 764-922 Hz and 540-2000 Hz, respectively.

The CSRRs and two branches of the bow-tie patch are etched on the top and bottom metal surfaces of the substrate. The CSRRs produce a resonant frequency, which can be combined with the two resonant frequencies produced by the bow-tie patch and the feedline of the bow-tie patch. The bandwidth can then be broadened. In order to enhance the gain in the low-frequency bandwidth, the gap width g of the CSRR is decreased without destroying its broadband characteristic. By decreasing g from 1 to 0.5 mm, the minimum gain in the low-frequency bandwidth is increased from 3.4 to 5.2 dBi, and the flat gain characteristic is obtained in the whole operating frequency range. The experiment results show that the realized antenna can operate from 7.3 to 10.3 GHz with the gain of 5.1 to 6 dBi. The absolute bandwidth is about 3 GHz, and the relative bandwidth is about 34.1%.

However, with the traditional carrier-phase-shifted pulse width modulation (CPS-PWM) scheme, FFSA will be ineffective when the carrier frequency is higher than 250 Hz, where the line frequency is 50 Hz. Thus, previous works proposed a logic-processed CPS-PWM scheme to overcome this disadvantage.This paper furtherly introduces the application ranges and implementation of this logic-processed CPS-PWM scheme based capacitor voltage balancing method in detail. With a detailed mathematical analysis, the factors that influence the balancing strategy's convergence speed are obtained, i.e., modulation index and power factor angle. It is found that in the applications where the modulation index is usually higher than 0.75, the influence of the modulation index is negligible. However, when the power factor angle is closed to ±π/2, the convergence speed is almost zero. Therefore, by comparing with the traditional CPS-PWM scheme based FFSA balancing method, the application ranges of power factor angle are revealed to guarantee a high convergence speed. Meanwhile, the balancing strategy's application scope is specified. Moreover, a three-tier control architecture is demonstrated, where the logic process of driving signals and capacitor voltage sorting process are both executed in the middle-tier FPGA controller. This centralized scheme guarantees the synchronization of switching actions. And the logic process is easy and cost-effective in FPGA. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2019.00001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681892","Balancing strategy;convergence speed;FFSA;logic-processed CPS-PWM;modular multilevel converter","Capacitors;Convergence;Sorting;Frequency modulation;Reactive power;Switches","","11","","","","11 Apr 2019","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

Therefore, a multi-features fusion target tracking algorithm based on KCF is proposed. The algorithm makes the most of the illumination and rotation invariance of local binary patterns (LBP) feature, the effective capability of extracting color and contour information from the target by color Name (CN) feature and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature, respectively. The multi-features linear weighted fusion rule is established by calculating the HOG, LBP, and CN histograms of the current frame, and calculating the weighted fusion coefficients of the normalized histograms according to the variance of each histogram adaptively. On this basis, multi-scale sampling is used in the target areas and bilinear interpolation is used to adjust the sample size, which can improve the tracking robustness of the KCF algorithm to adapt to the target scale. The comparison experimental results of 50 video data sets in OTB-2015 show that the average success rate and precision of the proposed algorithm are 24.74% and 8% higher than that of the KCF tracking algorithm, respectively, and also significantly better than the other tracking algorithms ranked top ten in OTB-2015, UAV123, and LaSOT data sets, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2921581","National Key R&D Plan “Intelligent Robots” Key Project of P.R.

In this paper we present two-parameter bifurcation diagrams of such circuits and systems, obtained when two parameters vary simultaneously. Four different numerical techniques are applied to two selected dynamical systems (an active oscillating circuit with a memristive element and an electric arc circuit). The focus of this paper is on the computationally intensive calculations rather than on analytical analysis of the oscillatory responses. Two-parameter bifurcation diagrams require solving systems of nonlinear ODEs several hundred thousand (or even a few million) times (depending on the assumed resolution), plus additional work to distinguish periodic solutions from chaotic ones. Our computations are done using various combinations of the C++, Fortran/Python and Julia environments with Runge-Kutta order-4 and order-5 numerical solvers and the 0-1 test for chaos.

The improvement of the bandwidth is achieved through a combination of folding and replacing the center feed line to a lower layer away from patch radiators. By moving the center feed line to the lower layer beneath radiators, serious mutual-coupling and corresponding parasitic effect between the feed and radiators are reduced, facilitating better transmission and also resulting in better matching to the 50-Ω coaxial probe. Moreover, a vertically folded-U structure is proposed to be inserted in part of the feed line, to provide a section of a high impedance microstrip line and further broaden the impedance bandwidth. A simulation study is performed on the geometry of the center feed line to investigate how the antenna performance can be controlled. The antenna array design procedure is outlined and a prototype with over 20% bandwidth, which can fully cover the 4.8-4.99 GHz 5G spectrum band, is fabricated and measured for impedance matching, radiation pattern, and broadside gain. For both S-parameter and far-field results, good correspondence is achieved between simulation and measurement. The proposed series-fed antenna array with coaxial feed is very suitable to be deployed in base stations with 1-D beam steering capability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2904284","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871224); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8665901","Series-fed antenna;probe feeding;bandwidth improvement;5G offshore communications","Antenna arrays;Bandwidth;Impedance;Antenna measurements;5G mobile communication;Microstrip;Probes","","11","","12","OAPA","12 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This single element antenna achieves high gain by exploiting the mode superposition of TM11 + TM13 (excited by a circle of vias loading the cavity) and TM12 + TM14 (excited by the cavity itself) radiated from the two apertures, respectively. A simple feeding network, consisting of a quadrature hybrid and a couple of 90° bent branches, is used in the design to excite RHCP or LHCP mode in the antenna cavity. A capacitive disk feeding is implemented so that the antenna can be matched to the feeding network, and the super-positioned fields inside the cavity are not disturbed by the feeding pins. This approach makes the design of a dual-sense circularly polarized antenna with high gain easier since the array configuration is not needed. High gain, in combination with a dual-sense circular polarization, makes the proposed antenna particularly attractive for space applications involving small satellites. With the proposed design, it is possible to employ only one antenna rather than two (RHCP and LHCP), thus saving space on the aircraft, which is clearly a limited resource.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2921088","Innovationsfonden; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731947","Circular patch;circular polarization;high gain;sidelobes suppression;small satellites","Bibliographies;Uniform resource locators;Standards;Documentation;Databases;Sorting;Memory management","","11","","18","OAPA","5 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a gauge detection algorithm based on the methodology of geometric fitting. We first use the Sobel filters to extract edges which usually contain the shapes of gauges. Then, we propose to use line fitting under the framework of random sample consensus (RANSAC) to remove straight lines that do not belong to gauges. Finally, the RANSAC ellipse fitting is proposed to find most fitted ellipse from the remaining edge points.

Successive-cancellation (SC) and belief-propagation (BP) decoding algorithms have been applied by some researchers to polar codes. However, unlike SC-based decoders, the performance optimization of BP-based decoders has not been fully explored yet, especially in regard to the impact of the number of iterations on the decoding complexity. In this paper, a novel early stopping criterion based on partial frozen bits for belief-propagation polar code decoders is designed. The proposed criterion is based on the fact that some of the frozen bits that are known to the decoders have a higher average error probability than the information bits and can be used to terminate the decoding. Furthermore, the hardware architecture of the BP-based polar code decoder with the proposed stopping criterion is presented. The simulation results show that the proposed early stopping criterion greatly reduces the number of iterations of BP-based polar code decoders without any performance loss and reduces the hardware complexity from  $O\left ({NlogN }\right)$  to  $O\left ({N }\right)$  compared with state-of-the-art design.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940135","National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology, China(grant numbers:2014ZX03001011-002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827514","Polar codes;belief-propagation;early stopping;frozen bits","Maximum likelihood decoding;Error probability;Iterative decoding;Hardware;Complexity theory","","11","","11","CCBY","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By injecting a millimeter-wave with frequency around N times of the fundamental oscillating frequency f0 of the OEO, the injection signal can be down-converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) signal close to the oscillating frequency of the OEO. The free running OEO is synchronized with the IF signal via an injection locking mechanism. Consequently, it forms an injection-locked frequency divider as the frequency ratio between the injection signal and OEO's output signal is precisely equal to N. We carry out an experiment to divide the 45 GHz signal into 7.5 GHz and the experimental results agree well with the theoretical analysis. By changing the frequency of the injection signal, division ratio from 2 to 5 is also demonstrated on one setup.

Furthermore, to analyze the effect of the contamination of insulators due to salty fog water , a saline solution is used for staining an insulator sample by using the solid coating method. In an artificial climate chamber, the salty fog environment is simulated, and the flashover voltage for different salty fog water conductivities and surface staining are obtained. The salt-density correction coefficient K is also proposed. It provides a strong basis for the selection of railway insulators in saline-alkali areas. The results show that the salty fog water changes the original surface equivalent salt density, ρESDD, by wetting the existing fouling layer on the surface of the insulator, so that the original surface contamination layer becomes equivalent to KρESDD; the smaller is the value of ρESDD of the insulator surface, the larger is the value of K; the surface of the same insulator is dirty, and as the concentration of salty fog-water increases, K also increases.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2019.000021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8859584","Salty fog;composite insulators;flashover characteristics;COMSOL multiphysics;additional salt density","Insulators;Flashover;Conductivity;Water pollution;Surface contamination;Water","","10","","","","7 Oct 2019","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Common techniques either directly assess the movement of the chest due to breathing or are based on analyzing subtle color changes that occur as a result of hemodynamic properties of the skin tissue by means of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). However, extracting hemodynamic parameters from rPPG is often difficult especially if the skin is not visible to the camera. In contrast, extracting respiratory signals from chest movements turned out to be a robust method. However, the detectability of chest regions cannot be guaranteed in any application scenario, for instance if the camera setting is optimized to provide close-up images of the head. In such a case an alternative method for respiration detection is required.It is reasonable to assume that the mechanical coupling between chest and head induces minor movements of the head which, like in rPPG, can be detected from subtle color changes as well. Although the strength of these movements is expected to be much smaller in scale, sensing these intensity variations could provide a reasonably suited respiration signal for subsequent respiratory rate analysis.In order to investigate this coupling we conducted an experimental study with 12 subjects and applied motion-and rPPG-based methods to estimate the respiratory frequency from both head regions and chest. Our results show that it is possible to derive signals correlated to chest movement from facial regions. The method is a feasible alternative to rPPG-based respiratory rate estimations when rPPG-signals cannot be derived reliably and chest movement detection cannot be applied as well.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8856387","","Signal to noise ratio;Face;Image color analysis;Skin;Cameras;Estimation","Algorithms;Head Movements;Motion;Photoplethysmography;Respiration","10","","14","CCBY","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the dual-satellites interference source localization system, the target signal from the adjacent satellite is likely to be interfered by the normal communication signal with the same frequency. Therefore, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the target signal would become too low, and the TDOA estimation through cross-correlation processing would be unreliable or even unattainable. This paper proposes a technique based on blind separation to solve the co-channel interference problem, where separation of the mixed signal can be carried out by the particle filter (PF) algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method could achieve more accurate TDOA estimation.

Because of the limitation of the outdoor positioning technologies in indoor applications, indoor positioning is a new and promising field. At the same time, with light-emitting diodes widely adopted, visible light positioning has become a widely researched technology in indoor positioning. However, the existing methods are based on the supposition that the light for positioning is a particle, without considering the shapes of lights, which causes low accuracy to a certain degree. Therefore, in this paper, an improved algorithm for three-dimensional indoor positioning is proposed. It takes the shapes of the transmitters (lights) into consideration, thus, to ensure high indoor-positioning accuracy. In this study, simulations are conducted under the line of sight and two different kinds of noise, which shows the high accuracy performance of the proposed algorithm.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2911738","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFE0112300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8695794","Indoor positioning;visible light positioning (VLP);line of sight (LOS);shapes of lights;high precision","Receivers;Shape;Ultraviolet sources;Imaging;Light emitting diodes;Global Positioning System;Transmitters","","10","","17","OAPA","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In SFF, for each pixel location (i, j), a focus measure operator computes sharpness (focus) value on a small neighborhood of the pixel (i, j) at each image along the z-axis (optical axis). The image sensor position z that has the maximum focus value and camera parameter information provide the distance information between the lens and the object point corresponding to the pixel (i, j). In traditional SFF methods, the final focus value of each pixel is determined by an average value of the initial focus values at the neighborhood of the pixel to remove the noise effects. However, it only reduces the noise effects instead of completely removing it. In this paper, we proposed a noise filtering technique that tries to remove noises while computing the focus values. First, an initial focus measure volume is computed by applying one of the focus measures on each pixel in the image sequence. Then, the focus value at each pixel is examined whether it is corrupted by noise or not by analyzing the neighboring focus values. The noisy focus value of the pixel is re-computed from noise-free focus values of neighboring pixels.

The common used prior knowledge includes pair-wise constraints and cluster labels. In the past decades, many relevant methods are proposed to improve clustering performance of SSC by mining prior knowledge. In general, the prior knowledge is assumed to be beneficial to yielding desirable results. However, one can gather inappropriate prior knowledge in some scenarios, such as wrong cluster labels. In this case, prior knowledge can result in degenerating clustering performance. Therefore, how to raise safe semi-supervised clustering (S3C) should be investigated. A main goal of S3C is that the corresponding result is never inferior to that of the corresponding unsupervised clustering part. To achieve the goal, we propose safe semi-supervised Fuzzy c -Means clustering (S3FCM) which is extended from traditional semi-supervised FCM (SSFCM). In our algorithm, wrongly labeled samples are carefully explored by constraining the corresponding predictions to be those yielded by unsupervised clustering. Meanwhile, the predictions of the other labeled samples should approach to the given labels. Therefore the labeled samples are expected to be safely explored through a balance between unsupervised clustering and SSC. From the reported clustering results on different datasets, we can find that S3FCM can yield comparable, if not the best, performance among different unsupervised clustering and SSC methods even if the wrong ratio achieves 20%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929307","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY19F020040); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601162,61771178,61671197); Open Research Fund of Anhui Key Laboratory of Detection Technology and Energy Saving Devices, Anhui Polytechnic University(grant numbers:2017070503B026-A03); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LY17F030021,LY18F030009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764532","Unsupervised clustering;semi-supervised clustering;fuzzy c-means;wrong labels","Gallium nitride;Data mining;Tools;Data structures;Linear programming;Clustering algorithms;Prediction algorithms","","9","","28","CCBY","16 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is the most popular wind turbine, as it can play a very significant role to enhance low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability. Ancillary services such as voltage control and reactive power capability are the main topics in wind power control systems that should be handled profoundly and carefully. The lack of reactive power during fault period can result in instability in generators and/or disconnection of the wind turbine from the power system. The main aims of this study are to illustrate the most effective approaches subject to improve the efficiency, stability, and reliability of wind power plant associated with LVRT capability enhancement. This effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated by, firstly, comparison between all types of wind turbines, focusing on the ancillary services, after the existing advanced control strategies. According to the literature, there is a consensus that modifying converter-based control topology is the most effective approach to enhance LVRT capability in DFIG-based wind turbine (WT). Therefore, an advanced integrated control strategy is designed by considering the effect of the rotor side converter (RSC) and the grid side converter (GSC). A model of the wind power plant is presented based on the control objectives. MATLAB/Simulink is also used to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2019.000022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8950478","Doubly fed induction generator;low voltage ride-through;series dynamic braking resistor;reactive power","Rotors;Doubly fed induction generators;Reactive power;Power system stability;Wind power generation;Voltage control","","9","","","","9 Jan 2020","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Recent studies prove the continuous Nie-Tan (CNT) algorithms to be actually an accurate approach to calculate the centroids of interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FSs). This paper compares the sum operation in discrete NT algorithms and the integral operation in CNT algorithms. According to the alpha-planes representation theory of general type-2 fuzzy sets (GT2 FSs), both the discrete and continuous NT algorithms can be extended to compute the centroids of GT2 FSs. Four computer simulation experiments indicate that, when the centroid type-reduced sets and defuzzified values of GT2 FSs are solved, to properly increase the number of sampling points of primary variable can make the results of discrete NT algorithms exactly approach to the accurate benchmark CNT algorithms.

It is challenging due to the complex spatial-temporal correlation on road networks. Most existing research works use sequential Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to model traffic inference. However, they only focus on nodes (intersections) or edges (road segments) traffic forecasting alone. As a result, they could hardly provide a complete description of future traffic on road networks. Actually, nodes and edges traffic are interrelated. Both of them are important for traffic safety and efficiency, and neither one is negligible. In this paper, we exploit nodes and edges information together and make traffic forecasting on nodes and edges simultaneously. We propose a novel dual graph framework, called DualGraph, to model the propagation behavior of traffic on road networks. Inside our framework, we develop a DualMap block to simulate the recursive interactions between nodes and edges. The interaction process is realized by a message passing mechanism of nearby information flow. We employ the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) software to generate real-world traffic data to illustrate the effectiveness of our method. We also empirically evaluate our model on public traffic datasets. The results show that even for node or edge traffic forecasting alone, our model still outperforms compared ones, especially for long term (one hour) prediction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2958380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8928590","Graph Neural Networks;Traffic Forecasting;Time Series Regression","Forecasting;Roads;Neural networks;Message passing;Task analysis;Predictive models;Xenon","","9","","","CCBY","9 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

"A hybrid circuit breaker based on current commutation approach for multi-feeder DC railway substations","S. Hasan","Helwan University, Cairo, EG",CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems,"27 Jun 2019","2019","5","2","234","239","The paper presents an economic hybrid circuit breaker for limiting and interrupting the faults in DC railways substations. For fast fault current interruption, the hybrid breaker incorporates high speed mechanical contacts actuated by power semiconductor devices. Additionally, to avoid formation of electric arc, a commutation circuit is used to inject a counter current during fault interruption. In a real railway substation, each feeder is connected to the main DC bus through an expensive air magnetic DC circuit breaker and to an auxiliary DC bus through another expensive breaker. This leads to high cost especially in railway substation with multi feeders which are used to energize the vehicle transmission lines. In this paper, all DC breakers in DC railway substations are replaced by the suggested circuit breaker, which consists of a high speed mechanical contact with two semiconductor devices in each feeder and only one commutation circuit for injecting the counter current in all faulted feeders. The fault diagnosis is designed to detect the abnormal condition (current or voltage) in all feeders and direct the injected current from the commutation circuit to the faulted feeder only when the abnormal reaches a predetermine level. The suggested breaker is able to detect and interrupt any cascading of faults.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2017.00290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8712466","Arc-less circuit breaker operation;fault current limiting and interruption;hybrid DC circuit breaker;railway substation","Rail transportation;Circuit breakers;Fault currents;Substations;Circuit faults;Capacitors;Magnetic circuits","","9","","","","13 May 2019","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

The prepared micro particles are then assembled as single-layer all-dielectric resonators. By using a THz time-domain spectrometer, we find that various Mie resonances can be induced in these all-dielectric resonators. It is also demonstrated that the permittivity of the composite particles can be improved by being sintered at proper temperatures, thereby provides a new way for ceramic all-dielectric resonators in THz range.

The boom, namely a typical framework structure, is a core component of BWR, which affects the performance of the BWR directly. For addressing this issue, this paper proposes a self-adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) to improve the performance of the genetic algorithm (GA). The standard genetic algorithm has been improved to enhance the optimization efficiency, because the optimization problem is believed to be highly non-linear. The AGA has been verified by two framework structures, and the results of AGA are compared with the corresponding results of previous literature. Furthermore, the AGA is applied to obtain the optimal size and shape of the BWR boom by taking the BWR boom as a space framework structure, and improve BWR's performance by meeting the requirements of the intensity and rigidity. The results show that the improved genetic algorithm has a higher efficiency than the standard GA. The structure optimization of the BWR boom is performed using the AGA. From the optimization, BWR boom's weight decreases by 23.46% from the initial weight.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2910185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8685150","Bucket wheel reclaimer;framework structure;improved genetic algorithm;structural shape optimization","Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Stress;Standards;Structural beams;Force;Sociology","","9","","23","OAPA","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the higher permittivity of FRPs relative to the air, the transmission of the s-polarized waves decreases drastically with the incidence angle θi. By doping metallic strips into an FRP plate, the magnetic vectors in the plate are tilted vertically under large incidence angles, and hence, the refracted angle in the plate is increased. This is equivalent to reduce the effective permittivity of the FRP, which enables significant transmission enhancement, especially under large incidence angles. A Ku-band prototype was designed, fabricated, and measured. Both simulated and measured results verify that the metamaterial doping can achieve transmission enhancement in an ultra-wide incidence angle range θi ∈ [0, 80°].

In this light, we propose and study a novel geospatial data clustering method for multiple reference points. Given a set Q of geospatial data points, a candidate set O of reference points, and a threshold k, each data point q will be matched to its closest reference point o. The multi-reference clustering (MRC) method finds a subset A (A ⊆ O ∧ |A| ≤ k) reference points from O which define the minimum global travel distance (ΣP∀q∈Q,o∈A d(q, o)), hence the data are grouped into |A| clusters. We believe that the MRC method may benefit a lot of applications including geospatial data clustering, data classification, and data analytics in general. The MRC problem is challenging due to its high computation complexity, and there exist Σi=1k C|O|i = Σi=1k (|O|!/i!(|O|-i)! possibilities for subset A. Because the exact solution cannot be computed in real time, we develop a heuristic method to select subset A from O efficiently. The experimental results show that the accuracy of A is very close to the optimal solution. In addition, we also develop a set of optimization techniques to further enhance the efficiency.

Optimizing this process poses certain challenges, as the objectives of reaching the required disinfection effect and limiting the formation of disinfection by-products must be met simultaneously. These need adjusting the chlorine dosage in real time to cope with fluctuations in water quality and maintaining a free chlorine residual at the clear-water reservoir outlet that does not exceed regulatory limits. This paper proposes a composite control scheme that combines disturbance observer (DOB) and model predictive control (MPC) to meet the aforementioned objectives. MPC is employed for the feedback control of post-chlorine dosage, and DOB is adapted to monitor fluctuations in influent water quality. The estimated value from the DOB is applied in the feed-forward control of post-chlorine dosage. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DOB-MPC composite control scheme provides a better disturbance rejection effect against fluctuations in influent water quality than MPC-only and PID-only control schemes, and it can effectively stabilize the quality of treated water.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901059","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51708299); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8651568","Post-chlorine dosage;composite control;disturbance observer;model predictive control","Chlorine;Process control;Mathematical model;Reservoirs;Real-time systems;Feedback control","","9","","27","OAPA","25 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve this problem, the weakly conditionally stable finite-difference time-domain (WCS-FDTD) method is developed in this paper. The WCS-FDTD method uses auxiliary difference equation to represent plasma's dispersive characteristic, and removes the confinement of FSS's fine structure on time step size by using hybrid implicit-explicit (HIE) technique. So, compared with the FDTD method, the presented method can save a large number of computational time, which are validated by numerical examples.

The proposed work addresses the challenge to achieve a large beam steering angle with small gain variation and a small number of active/lumped elements by using a reconfigurable PRS superstrate only. The PRS unit cell consists of two back-to-back T-shaped strips with one PIN diode inserted between them and a pair of trapezoid patches (a rectangular patch and a pair of triangle parasitic patches). Beam steering is achieved by controlling the different states of PIN diodes. Thanks to the trapezoid patches, the proposed unit cell can generate a larger phase difference between different states, thereby leading to a larger beam steering angle. Furthermore, due to the addition of more degrees of freedom in the proposed unit cell, the phase difference can be easily manipulated. Moreover, since the T-shaped strips in each unit cell is connected with adjacent ones, the biasing network is very simple without needing a large number of lumped elements and dc biasing lines. The beam steering property is analyzed by using phased array theory. An antenna prototype with a main beam direction towards 0°, -18° and 18° operating at 5.5 GHz in the H-plane is fabricated and measured. Good agreement between the predicted simulation and measurement results for the input reflection coefficients and radiation patterns is achieved, which validates the feasibility of the design.

In this study, we employed continuous irradiation of X-rays to induce and sustain discharge inside the voids. The PD characteristics of void samples under different exposure rates of X-rays were observed. Compared with the conventional diagnosis, this continuous X-ray-induced partial discharge diagnosis enhanced the detection efficiency by eliminating the inception delays and reducing the discharge inception voltage. We focused on the changes in PD characteristics due to varying X-ray exposure rates. As the exposure rates were increased, the number of PD signals per minute increased while the average pulse height of PD signals decreased. Continuous X-ray exposure at rates between 0.5 and 294 mR/s successfully eliminated the inception delays even when the voids were as small as 1.63 mm in diameter of equivalent spherical volume.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2019.008052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8858110","partial discharge;gas insulated switchgear;X-ray exposure;epoxy resin insulator","Partial discharges;Delays;Discharges (electric);Radiation effects;Testing;Electric fields;Insulators","","8","","21","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through the processing of point cloud data obtained by the existing manned control equipment, it is found that it has a good effect on the monitoring of pavement crack damage. From the actual results obtained, it can be judged that the pavement damage of single crack and multi-crack can be determined.

It is shown that the phase shift is enhanced by a reduction of the bending radius of the fiber but can be circumvented by orienting the polarization of the injected beam either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of bending.","1941-0174","","10.1109/LPT.2019.2927046","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(grant numbers:HIPERDIAS 687880); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:GSC 262/2); Agence Nationale de la Recherche(grant numbers:Σ_LIM Labex Chaire,DGA Astrid-Maturation Plasma-PMC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756086","Fiber properties;hollow-core fibers;polarization-maintaining fibers;photonic crystal fibers","Laser beams;Integrated circuits;Polarization;Lattices;Optical fiber polarization;Numerical simulation;Surface emitting lasers","","8","","20","CCBY","5 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Combined with the advantages of two methods, the sliding mode control based on the extended observer (SMC-LESO) is applied to the control of drum water level. In the case of external disturbance and model parameter mismatch, the dynamic performance of the system is compared with that of the linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) system.

A submersible pump turbine is connected to the prototype motor in order to test under a real pump load condition by a pump test stand. The same pump used in the experiment was also tested with a commercial induction motor (IM) submersible pump motor with same power. Thus, the commercial and proposed motor are compared in terms of static head value, which is an important value in pump applications. The performance of the motor is better than the IM because it can operate at synchronous speed without slip.

By simultaneously measuring two circulating currents in a coaxial cable, a two-dimensional locus diagram is drawn. The fault criteria and database are established to detect the fault by analyzing the changes of the locus characteristic parameters. A cross-connected grounding simulation model of a high-voltage cable is developed, and several faults at different locations are simulated. Fault identification is established based on the changes in the long axis, short axis, eccentricity, and tilt angle of the track.

Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using compressive measurements has gained considerable attention due to the reduction in system complexity. In this paper, we extend this structure into two-dimensional (2D) case, where the azimuth and elevation angles are considered. A uniform rectangular array is used as the receive array. Similar to the one-dimensional case, the received signals are compressed before fed into the front-end circuit chains. Then, a DOA estimation algorithm, referred to as 2D compressive measurement-based multiple signal classification is proposed for the proposed scheme, where the azimuth and elevation angles are estimated jointly. The proposed scheme can obtain a higher estimation accuracy than the classical 2D DOA estimation structure when the number of front-end circuit chains keeps the same. On the other hand, when the number of sensors in the receive array is the same, the proposed scheme can dramatically reduce the system complexity and cost by compressing the dimension of the received signal vector. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by numerical simulations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2892085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8610378","Compressive sensing;DOA estimation;MUSIC","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Sensor arrays;Two dimensional displays;Compressed sensing;Covariance matrices","","7","","24","OAPA","11 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key is to coordinate two complementary rotors with inset stator permanent magnets (PMs) circumferentially magnetized to construct an axially complementary flux return path in machine. Different from the traditional stator-PM machines, the excitation flux is transferred between the complementary rotors, hence switched smoothly without been shorted or opened in the air gaps. As a result, the PM utilization in the proposed machine can be doubled compared to that in traditional stator PM machine. In addition, the proposed machine also contributes to reduced cogging torque, higher winding utilization factor and neglectable mutual inductance, which helps to improve its torque performance as well as fault-tolerant capability. The electromagnetic performance is evaluated by 3-D finite element analysis, and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed machine.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946249","Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Government(grant numbers:PolyU 15250916/16E); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51707171); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8862898","Axial-flux-complementary;doubly salient machine;permanent magnet utilization","Rotors;Coils;Stator windings;Windings;Torque;Switches","","7","","23","CCBY","8 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that as the number of segments used to construct the freeform surfaces increases, the output beam profile approaches the specific profile. A sparse design point freeform surface construction method is additionally proposed which allows the beam profile to approach the desirable distribution with a fewer number of segments. The proposed method is used to construct freeform lenses for producing output beams with two user-defined irradiance patterns, i.e., annular and triangular distributions.

Therefore, determining the symmetric oligomeric structure of subunits is crucial to investigate the molecular mechanism of the related processes. Due to the high cost and technical difficulties associated with many experimental methods, computational approaches, such as molecular docking, have played an important complementary role in the determination of symmetric complex structures, in which a benchmark data set is pressingly needed. In the present work, we develop a comprehensive and non-redundant benchmark for symmetric protein docking based on the structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The diverse dataset consists of 251 targets, including 212 cases with cyclic groups symmetry, 35 cases with dihedral groups symmetry, 3 cases with cubic groups symmetry, and 1 case with helical symmetry. According to the conformational changes in the interface between bound and unbound structures, the 251 targets were classified into three groups: 176 ""easy"", 37 ""medium"", and 38 ""difficult"" cases. A preliminary docking test on the targets of cyclic groups symmetry with MZDOCK indicated that symmetric multimer docking remains challenging. The benchmark will be beneficial for the development of symmetric protein docking algorithms.

However, it is difficult for conventional localization schemes based on the Gaussian fitting to locate overlapped high-density fluorescent emitters. Currently, in the spatial domain, the compressive-sensing-based algorithm (CSSTORM) can localize high-emitter-density images. However, the computational cost of this approach is extremely high, which limits its practical application. Here, we propose an alternative frequency-domain compressed sensing (FD-CS) technique for fast super-resolution imaging. Unlike the CSSTORM method, which is a measurement matrix based on the point spread function, a Fourier dictionary designed in the frequency domain and orthogonal matching pursuit is used to reliably recover the original signal. The simulation and experimental results prove that the FD-CS is 1000 times faster than CSSTORM with CVX and ten times faster than that with L1-Homotopy with almost the same localization accuracy and recall rate. This drastic reduction in computational time should allow the compressed sensing approach to be routinely applied to a super-resolution image analysis.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2884730","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700500); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB352005); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61775144,61525503,61620106016,81727804,61835009,11774242); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018A030313362,2014A030312008,2017A030310132); Shenzhen Science and Technology Planning Project(grant numbers:JCYJ20170818141701667,JCYJ20170412105003520,JCYJ20170818144012025,JCYJ20170412105003520); Shenzhen Special Funds for the Development of Strategic Emerging Industries(grant numbers:SWCYL20150331010038); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201708440486); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8556467","Fluorescence microscopy;image reconstruction techniques;multi-frame image processing;super-resolution","Frequency-domain analysis;Compressed sensing;Optical imaging;Spatial resolution;Optical sensors;Microscopy","","7","","17","OAPA","2 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Temperature changes can be introduced during these measurements either intentionally or as a result of some other process. The microwave cavity itself also has a temperature-dependent response, which can affect the results. A common method to correct is to use another resonant mode separately to the measurement mode, which is not affected by the sample. Instead of using independent modes, this paper describes a method to use split degenerate TMm10 modes of cylindrical cavities. TMm10 consists of two modes with identical field patterns with a relative rotation between them and identical resonant frequencies. A strategically placed perturbation reduces the frequency of one of the TMm10 modes and affects the coupling of both modes by reconfiguring the fields. This can be used for temperature correction by placing a sample such that both modes are equally coupled. The lower frequency, the perturbed mode is used as a measurement mode. The higher mode is used as a reference for temperature correction as it is unaffected by the sample. This technique was verified by measuring the permittivity of pure water using an aluminum microwave cavity resonator at 3.96 GHz. The temperature was swept between 20 °C and 60 °C, and the results was verified against the literature.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2018.2882480","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Science and Technology Facilities Council; Merck KGaA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567923","Cavity resonators;dielectric characterization;microwave measurement;permittivity;perturbation methods","Cavity resonators;Temperature measurement;Frequency measurement;Microwave measurement;Resonant frequency;Microwave theory and techniques;Perturbation methods","","7","","17","CCBY","7 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to traditional system integrity, additive systems need additional guarantees of part authenticity and confidentiality. When a part comes out of additive manufacture, it must be the exact desired part, without substitution or tampering. In addition, the associated files must be strongly protected from disclosure. The use of hardware roots of trust like a trusted platform module (TPM) to protect authentication and encryption keys can guarantee that the necessary authentication and encryption cannot be subverted by remote software attack. For example, if the additive machine is hardened with a TPM, the TPM can provide an encryption key pair where the private key never leaves the hardware.

A simple statistical technique is proposed to better convey the diversity of satellite observations to users whereby a multimodal log-normal distribution is fit to the distribution of data observed within each grid cell.

To ensure a safely grounded grid design, local Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) standard design constraints were used. The current distribution electromagnetic interference, grounding, and soil structure (CDEGS) software was used to compare the test results for soils with and without backfilling. Due to the high resistivity of the plot, soil with a low resistivity should be used as backfill.

One of the most popular methods -“Noisy-OR”- approximates the required relationship in many real-world situations between a set of variables that are potential causes of an effect variable. However, the Noisy-OR function has the conditional inter-causal independence (CII) property which means that `explaining away' behavior-one of the most powerful benefits of BN inference-is not present when the effect variable is observed as false. Hence, for many real-world problems where the Noisy-OR has been used or proposed, it may be deficient as an approximation of the required relationship. However, there is a very simple alternative solution, namely to define the variables as ranked nodes and to use the ranked node weighted average function. This does not have the CII property-instead, we prove it has the conditional anti-correlation property required to ensure that explaining away works in all cases. Moreover, ranked node variables are not restricted to binary states, and hence provide a more comprehensive and general solution to Noisy-OR in all cases.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2018.2873314","H2020 European Research Council(grant numbers:ERC-2013-AdG339182); Leverhulme Trust(grant numbers:RPG-2016-118); EPSRC under project(grant numbers:EP/P009964/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8481414","Knowledge representation formalisms and methods;probabilistic algorithms;Bayesian networks","Noise measurement;Gaussian distribution;Covariance matrices;Security;Correlation;Bayes methods;Computer science","","7","","13","CCBY","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Regardless of the negative threshold voltage of the TFTs, the proposed gate driver circuit in OLED panels functioned precisely, resulting from a decrease in the leakage current. The falling time of the circuit is approximately 1.6 μs, which is fast enough to drive UHD OLED displays at 120 Hz. 120 Hz is most commonly used as the operating voltage because images consisting of 12 frames per second can be quickly shown on the display panel without any image sticking.

In the present paper, typical installation defects were deliberately introduced into MV XLPE power cable terminations. Accelerated ageing under PD activity was achieved by applying voltage at elevated frequency for 900 hours. At suitable time intervals, off-line PD measurements were conducted for each test specimen at 50 Hz test voltage. The results show that the initial PD signatures in the form of Partial Discharge Phase-Resolved-Patterns (PDPRP) are unique for each defect type. The signatures in turn evolve uniquely under continuous voltage application. A modified 3-Capacitor PD model based on the physiochemical processes in the discharge area was implemented in MATLAB Simulink™. The measured initial PD characteristics and the subsequent time-dependent changes were interpreted by comparison with the computer numerical simulation results. It is confirmed that the conductivity of the discharging surface area as well as the voltage at which the cavity breaks down, both change with ageing under PD activity, are the dominant parameters that influence the time-evolution of the PD signatures. Furthermore, the geometry and ventilation of the discharge area is a function of the installation defect type and therefore each defect type gives a unique PD signature.

This paper reports on the in-situ measurements of leakage current (LC) on composite and glass insulators of the Cahora Bassa high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line in South Africa over a 6 - month period. The influence of temperature, humidity, dew, rain and the HVDC line's voltage and current on LC are investigated. The results show that the composite and glass insulator LC behaviour is similar, except in cases of high humidity or rain. At the commencement of rainfall and humidity (>90%), elevated LC levels are observed on glass insulators, while composite insulators demonstrate lower LC levels under these conditions. Under nominal weather conditions of no rain and low humidity, the LC measurements exhibit an almost square-wave behaviour with LC switching between lower (≈20 μA) and higher values (≈60 μA) with relatively short transitions on a daily basis. This phenomenon can be ascribed to condensation on the insulators, which is a primary determinant of the LC levels on contaminated insulators. The line current and voltage fluctuations do not influence the LC level.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2019.8643145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8643145","High voltage direct current;insulator;leakage current;transmission lines","Insulators;Glass;HVDC transmission;Transmission line measurements;Humidity;Current measurement;Pollution measurement","","7","","","","3 Mar 2019","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

The antenna is designed to satisfy the requirements of carrier aggregation systems (intraband non-contagious type) cell-phone applications. The three resonant frequencies are independently tunable within the low-band (0.7-1 GHz), mid-band (1.6-2.1 GHz), and highband (2.1-2.7 GHz), respectively, using varactor diodes as tuning devices. Each varactor diode represents a variable capacitor controlled by biasing dc voltage. A parallel LC harmonic-trap filter is built inside the antenna to suppress the harmonics generated by the low-band resonance, which enhances the tuning capabilities at the high-band. The antenna has a size of 375 mm2, which is considered to be a low-profile design and placed on a 100 × 66 × 3.154 mm3 RO4003C (εr = 3.55) printed circuit board.

It is demonstrated that the dominant mechanism for this stabilization effect is the strong mode coupling of the GI POF, which is closely related to the polymer-specific microscopic heterogeneities in the GI POF core material. Such mode coupling decreases correlation between the problematic reflected light field and VCSEL cavity field, increasing tolerance of the MMF link for external optical feedback. Our developed GI POF with specific microscopic heterogeneities prevents the external-optical-feedback-induced critical destabilization observed for silica GI MMFs.

The proposed device features a VLD layer inserted in the drift region, which increases the doping dose (Q) and gradient (G) compared with Uniform P-buried (UPB) SOI LIGBT. The larger capacitance effect induced by lager Q and faster depletion leads to the lower rising anode voltage and reduced storage charge in the drift region. Therefore, a considerable low turn-off loss (Eoff) can be obtained. It is worth to note that owing to reshaped electric field in the new structure, the excess carriers of the drift region could be removed more quickly. Furthermore, larger G of the VLD layer improves the tradeoff between breakdown voltage and turn-off loss.

The compact Rotman lens consists of a lens body and truncated ports with the energy distribution slots. By truncating the long triangular transitions of the traditional Rotman lens, the lengths of lens ports are reduced effectively. However, the impedance discontinuity problem is caused by truncating the triangular transition. To solve this problem, the energy distribution slots are designed between the feed lines and the truncated lens body apertures. The energy distribution slot is evolved from the 1-2 power divider, which creates a transition process for the wave energy propagating from the feed lines and realizes good impedance match between the lens body and the feed lines. To validate the proposed design, a 4×7 Rotman lens has been designed and prototyped at 10 GHz. The Rotman lens exhibits a scanning range of ±33°, 27% bandwidth for VSWR <; 2, and the isolation between beam ports better than 17.2 dB within the operation bandwidth.

As for SiGe surface modification, realizing Si-rich surface in SiGe is known to improve SiGe/high-k interface quality in advanced CMOS.

Xiaohui","Beihang University, Beijing, CN; Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, CN",Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics,"13 May 2019","2019","30","2","238","244","How to recognize targets with similar appearances from remote sensing images (RSIs) effectively and efficiently has become a big challenge. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is preferred in the target classification due to the powerful feature representation ability and better performance. However, the training and testing of CNN mainly rely on single machine. Single machine has its natural limitation and bottleneck in processing RSIs due to limited hardware resources and huge time consuming. Besides, overfitting is a challenge for the CNN model due to the unbalance between RSIs data and the model structure. When a model is complex or the training data is relatively small, overfitting occurs and leads to a poor predictive performance. To address these problems, a distributed CNN architecture for RSIs target classification is proposed, which dramatically increases the training speed of CNN and system scalability. It improves the storage ability and processing efficiency of RSIs. Furthermore, Bayesian regularization approach is utilized in order to initialize the weights of the CNN extractor, which increases the robustness and flexibility of the CNN model. It helps prevent the overfitting and avoid the local optima caused by limited RSI training images or the inappropriate CNN structure. In addition, considering the efficiency of the Näıve Bayes classifier, a distributed Näıve Bayes classifier is designed to reduce the training cost. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed system and method perform the best and increase the recognition accuracy. The results show that the distributed system framework and the proposed algorithms are suitable for RSIs target classification tasks.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2019.02.02","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710371","convolutional neural network (CNN);distributed architecture;remote sensing images (RSIs);target classification;pre-training.","Training;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Bayes methods;Task analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Remote sensing","","6","","","","13 May 2019","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The transmission distance transmitted in this experiment is also farther greater than the current free-space transmission distances transmitted over free space. The two optical frequency combs are locked to the same radio frequency reference source. The method makes measurements more flexible and reduces interference.

In this paper, the principle of signal decomposition is combined with the traditional acquisition algorithm structure, and then based on the method of reconstructing the correlation function. The method firstly gets the sub-pseudorandom noise (PRN) code by decomposing the local PRN code, then uses BOC(kn, n) and the sub-PRN code cross-correlation to get the sub cross-correlation function. Finally, the correlation peak with a single peak is obtained by reconstructing the sub cross-correlation function so that the ambiguities of BOC acquisition are removed. The simulation shows that RSCCT can completely eliminate the side peaks of BOC (kn, n) group signals while maintaining the narrow correlation of BOC, and its computational complexity is equivalent to sub carrier phase cancellation (SCPC) and autocorrelation side-peak cancellation technique (ASPeCT), and it reduces the computational complexity relative to BPSK-like. For BOC(n, n), the acquisition sensitivity of RSCCT is 3.25 dB, 0.81 dB and 0.25 dB higher than binary phase shift keying (BPSK)-like, SCPC and ASPeCT at the acquisition probability of 90%, respectively.

Traditional techniques to optimize flow-level metrics are agnostic to task-level requirements, leading to poor application-level performance. In this paper, we address the heterogeneous task-level requirements of applications and propose task-aware flow scheduling. First, we model tasks' sensitivity to their completion time by utilities. Second, on the basis of Nash bargaining theory, we establish a flow scheduling model with heterogeneous utility characteristics, and analyze it using Lagrange multiplier method and KKT condition.

It is well known that back-to-back converters and their controllers are important for the dynamic responses of the wind turbine (WT) under disturbances. However, the detailed structure and parameters of the back-to-back converters and their controllers are usually unknown to power grid operators. Hence, it is difficult to build an accurate equivalent model for the WF using the component model-based equivalent modeling method. In this paper, a transfer function based equivalent modeling method for the WF is proposed. During modeling, the detailed structure and parameters of the WF are not required. The objective of the method is reproducing the output dynamics of the WF under the variation of the wind speed and power grid faults. A decoupled parameter-estimation strategy is also developed to estimate the parameters of the equivalent model. A WF that consists of 16 WTs is used to test the proposed equivalent model. Additionally, the proposed equivalent modeling method is applied to build the equivalent model for a real WF in Northwest China. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by the real measurement data.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-018-0410-8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9158200","Wind farm;Equivalent modeling;Transfer function;Parameter estimation;Particle swarm optimization","Transfer functions;Power system dynamics;Wind speed;Mathematical model;Power grids;Power generation;Wind farms","","5","","13","","4 Aug 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

LRCs have become an important candidate in distributed storage systems due to their relatively low I/O cost. An LRC is said to be optimal if its minimum distance meets one of the Singleton-like bounds. This paper considers the optimal constructions of LRCs with locality r = 1 and r = k - 1, which involves three types: r-local LRCs, (r, δ)-LRCs and LRCs with t-availability. Specifically, we first prove that the existence of an optimal LRC with locality r = 1 is equivalent to that of an MDS code with certain parameters. Thus we can completely characterize the three types of optimal LRCs with r = 1 based on some known constructions of MDS codes. Near MDS codes is a special class of sub-optimal linear code whose minimum distance d = n - k and the i-th generalized Hamming weight achieves the generalized Singleton bound for 2 ≤ i ≤ k. For r = k - 1, we have established the connections between optimal r-local LRCs/ LRCs with t-availability and near MDS codes. Such connections can help to construct optimal LRCs with r = k - 1 from some known classes of near MDS codes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934769","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771273); Research Fund of the PCL Future Regional Network Facilities for Large-Scale Experiments and Applications(grant numbers:PCL2018KP001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794791","Distributed storage systems;erasure codes;maximum distance separable (MDS) codes;near MDS codes;locally repairable codes","Linear codes;Hamming weight;Redundancy;Parity check codes;Generators;Object recognition","","5","","22","CCBY","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is an urgent need for cost-effective devices capable of recognizing and detecting heavy metallic matters in soils. A broadband photoacoustic spectrometric (PAS) system was established for the detection of heavy metal contaminants in soil. The heavy metal element lead (Pb) was selected as a preferred detection target. The near infrared photoacoustic spectra of contaminated soil samples with various concentrations of Pb were collected and the spectroscopic relationship between the soil absorption peaks and Pb concentrations was analyzed. Four advanced spectral preprocessing methods were explored to improve the robustness of the prediction model. Based on the maximal correlation coefficient and minimal root mean square error criteria of prediction, a two-layer feed-forward network with a continuum removing preprocessing method with a correlation coefficient as 0.96 was tested as the most appropriate method for Pb concentration prediction. This fact verifies that the broadband PAS evaluation methodology, as a nondestructive testing method, can be potentially used as an alternative quantification detection method of heavy metal contaminants in soil without the involvement of complicated sample pretreatment.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2904295","111 Project(grant numbers:B17035); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61805187,61801358); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61727804,6157031319); Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8664575","Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS);non-destructive testing;heavy metal contamination;broadband absorbing evaluation","Soil;Lead;Absorption;Contamination;Broadband communication;Optical sensors","","5","","20","OAPA","10 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since a task for the device is highly dependent on the mass of handling object, an adaptive strategy is a major concern of control system design. The controller design is represented by two loops to control admittance and velocity. To reduce the response time of the device, two velocity controllers are designed and compared with the embedded one. The first is a conventional proportional-integral-derivative controller which has shown better performance than the native controller. The second is derived from the first using fuzzy logic for better handling of different manipulation scenarios.

To generate a high optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) Nyquist pulse train, the first procedure was improved by developing a high-power laser and improving the filtering process by using nonlinear effects in a highly nonlinear fiber. The second procedure also has the potential to further improve the OSNR, because an optical circuit typically causes an optical loss of 9 dB in the case of eight-multiplexing. In this study, we demonstrate optical loss reduction for multiplexing using a nonauxiliary WSS approach without an auxiliary optical circuit.

For the traditional GO/PO method, when the number of grooves reaches dozens or even hundreds, the existence of a large number of redundant intersection tests will be a main limitation to calculate the electromagnetic (EM) scattering in THz band. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, the scattered field from one of the grooves is computed using the GO/PO method and extended to obtain the scattered field of the other grooves according to their dimensional information. In this way, the computation load is effectively reduced. To demonstrate the validity of our method, the results are compared with those of MLFMM, traditional GO/PO method and experimental data. A good agreement is achieved. Meanwhile, the runtime of our method is compared with that of traditional GO/PO method, where the computational time is greatly saved.

To address the various security issues that may arise in the cloud storage accessed by a large number of users, cryptographic encryption should be considered. Currently, researches on revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) systems, which provide user revocation function and ciphertext update function by extending attribute-based encryption (ABE) systems that provide access control to ciphertexts, are actively being studied. Recently, Xu et al. proposed a new RABE scheme that combines ABE and identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes to efficiently handle ciphertext update and user revocation functionality. In this paper, we show that there is a serious security problem in Xu et al.'s RABE scheme such that a cloud server can obtain the plaintext information of stored ciphertexts by gathering invalidated credentials of revoked users. Additionally, we also show that the RABE scheme of Xu et al. can be secure in a weaker security model where the cloud server cannot obtain any invalidated credentials of revoked users.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953300","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; Korea Government, Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) (A Study on Functional Encryption: Construction, Security Analysis, and Implementation)(grant numbers:2016-6-00600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897661","Cloud storage;access control;attribute-based encryption;revocation;ciphertext update","Cloud computing;Servers;Encryption;Encoding;Access control","","5","","7","CCBY","13 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The speed of this plasma expansion depends on the plasma species, which in turn depend on the ionizable materials near the initial electrostatic discharge (ESD) site. Based on laboratory experiments undertaken as part of the U.S. round-robin experiments on plasma propagation speed, a scenario for arc plasma propagation and arc current profiles is presented. It is found that the complex arc current profiles invariably seen in laboratory arcs are due to a multicomponent plasma, where each plasma species expands away from the arc-site supersonically and with approximately constant velocity. Apparent slowing of the arc plasma seen in high-speed video cameras is caused by the density depletion of the lightest (most rapid) plasma component first and heavier (slower) plasma components later. Electron currents onto surfaces originate at the arc-site, and the conductive arc plasma is a conduit for these currents. Sudden, simultaneous onset of arc currents at all distances from the arc-site is the result of blowoff currents, making all surfaces more positive, which then attract ambient electrons. Sudden, simultaneous cutoff of arc currents at all distances from the arc-site is the result of collapse of the plasma due to conditions at the arc-site. The ionization at the arc-site during the arc is seen to be rapidly variable, with variations on the nanosecond timescale. This model not only makes the varied plasma velocities reported in the literature understandable, but it also makes predictions about the arc radio-frequency interference (RFI), contamination produced by the arcs, and the total charge in an arc possible. Arc-site materials are suggested which, being hard to ionize and with massive ions, minimize arc currents and maximize arc current rise times.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2019.2905524","U.S. Air Force; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8686118","Arc plasmas;flashover;plasma propagation velocities","Current measurement;Plasma measurements;Velocity measurement;Ions;Temperature measurement;Plasma temperature","","5","","31","USGov","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Interestingly, though the proposed structure possesses no symmetry property, the effects are nearly the same for x- and y-polarization incidences. We analyze the electric field distributions at the breaking frequency and attribute the phenomena to plasmonic analogue of electromagnetically induced reflectance (EIR-like) effect for x-polarization incidence and direct back scattering for y-polarization incidence. The dependence of the breaking window on the BDS rod length shows that, for both x- and y-polarization incidences, the breaking characteristic is mainly determined by the dipole resonance on the BDS rod. Moreover, the breaking window can be independently and dynamically manipulated by changing the Fermi energy of the BDS rods.

Most studies focus on routing problems in idealized network environments without considering social properties. Communication devices are carried by individuals in many DTNs; therefore, DTNs are unique social networks to some extent. To design efficient routing protocols for DTNs, it is important to analyze their social properties. In this paper, a more accurate and comprehensive metric for detecting the quality of the relationships between nodes is proposed, by considering the contact time, contact frequency, and contact regularity. An overlapping hierarchical community detection method is designed based on this new metric, and a tree structure is built. Furthermore, we exploit the overlapping community structure and the tree structure to provide message-forwarding paths from the source node to the destination node. The simulation results show that our Routing method based on Overlapping hierarchical Community Detection (ROCD) achieves better delivery rate than SimBet and Bubble Rap, the classic routing protocols, without affecting the average delay.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8526505","Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN);social properties;overlapping community;hierarchical routing","Routing;Routing protocols;Detection algorithms;Image edge detection;Clustering algorithms;Time-frequency analysis","","5","","","","8 Nov 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

High-temperature vulcanized (HTV) SRs with different alumina trihydrate (ATH) filler contents were adopted as the test specimens. For the test of a single water droplet, the vibration and elongation of the water droplet caused a flashover, and the flashover voltage decreased with increasing ATH content. In the first cycle of the salt-fog test, the leakage current increased with increasing ATH content. The relatively higher hydrophobicity of the specimen with a low ATH content than the specimen with a high ATH content had an inhibitory effect on the initial leakage current development. In the last cycle of the salt-fog test, the heat from dry band arc discharge became the dominant factor affecting the surface aging after the loss of hydrophobicity, and the specimen with a higher ATH content inversely had a better inhibitory effect on leakage current development. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis results, when the energized SR was exposed to a moist environment, the heat from dry band arc discharge and the hydrolysis reaction caused a change in the binding state between Si and O, which is considered the mechanism responsible for material degradation. During this process, the higher content of ATH had a remarkable effect on alleviating surface aging.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957405","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:16KJB470015); Scientific Research Foundation of Taizhou University of China(grant numbers:QD2016053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920043","Moist environment;silicone rubber;hydrophobicity;dry band arc discharge;aging performance","Leakage currents;Aging;Flashover;Insulators;Electrodes;Arc discharges;Surface discharges","","5","","27","CCBY","3 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it has been ignored or treated as a trivial problem for a long time, since most of the hand pose estimation works suppose the hand part is given or can be easily segmented by a depth threshold, which is not practical in many realistic scenarios (e.g., side/egocentric view). In order to perform the robust hand segmentation in various scenarios, we propose a Soft Proposal Segmentation Network (SPS-Net). A key difference from existing hand segmentation methods is that the SPS-Net can utilize the temporal information on depth videos. As a benefit, significant performance gains over the existing methods can be obtained, as demonstrated on two popular public datasets with diverse camera viewpoints and background.

An inverse kinematic modeling based on elastokinematic analysis is analyzed and deduced. The elastokinematic analysis considers the elastic deformation of the large-stroke flexure hinges in movement process, and improves the positioning accuracy of the compliant parallel platform in applications.

However, in this paper, we first point out that Esfahani et al.'s swapping technique is not essential for the TPA security, because the underlying non-swapping homomorphic MAC scheme has been secure against TPA and the process of swapping only improves the TPA security with a non-negligible factor. More importantly, we find that the security proof of Esfahani et al. is incorrect and misguided. In particular, according to Esfahani et al. suggestion, one should enlarge the number of neighbor nodes to reduce the probability of the TPA.

The method rests on the selection of quasi-random subsets (mini-batches) of sources, used to approximate the misfit and the gradient of the complete data set. The size of the mini-batch is dynamically controlled by the desired quality of the gradient approximation. Within each mini-batch, redundancy is minimized by selecting sources with the largest angular differences between their respective gradients, and spatial coverage is maximized by selecting candidate events with Mitchell's best-candidate algorithm. Information from sources not included in a specific mini-batch is incorporated into each gradient calculation through a quasi-Newton approximation of the Hessian, and a consistent misfit measure is achieved through the inclusion of a control group of sources. By design, the dynamic mini-batch approach has several main advantages: (1) The use of mini-batches with adaptive size ensures that an optimally small number of sources is used in each iteration, thus potentially leading to significant computational savings; (2) curvature information is accumulated and exploited during the inversion, using a randomized quasi-Newton method; (3) new data can be incorporated without the need to re-invert the complete data set, thereby enabling an evolutionary mode of full-waveform inversion. We illustrate our method using synthetic and real-data inversions for upper-mantle structure beneath the African Plate. In these specific examples, the dynamic mini-batch approach requires around 20 per cent of the computational resources in order to achieve data and model misfits that are comparable to those achieved by a standard full-waveform inversion where all sources are used in each iteration.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267110","Inverse theory;Waveform inversion;Computational seismology;Seismic tomography","","","4","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The benefits of their combinations are investigated: The combination of dual-system and three-system can reduce the average value of GDOP to 1.0–1.5, which can make the user positioning have better performance.

The influence of the stiffness and damping of insulator on the noise of the braking system was analyzed by establishing a mathematical model for the 6-DOF braking system with internal and external insulators. It is proposed that the insulator with a multilayered structure of different materials has a better restraining effect on brake squeal. Four different insulator schemes were designed, the test results of which were compared with those of the original scheme. The comparative analysis shows that the stiffness and damping of insulator have an important influence on the braking system noise, which can be reduced by improving the material parameters of the structure layer of the insulator. The test results show that the insulator with one layer of rubber and one layer of steel has a good effect on restraining the low-frequency noise, while the insulator with two layers of rubber and one layer of steel has a good inhibition on the high-frequency noise around 7~8 kHz. The final conclusion shows that a rubber-steel-rubber structure insulator made of a 0.5-mm-thickness steel sheet can reduce the overall incidence of the brake system noise from 19.27% to 1.27%.

As OGs are typical non-linear load, different models are presented to analyze the characteristic of OGs and the models of OGs have proven to be an effective tool to design power supplies for OGs. However, most of the models are only applicable to nominal conditions and not suitable for a wide working range at present. Considering that almost all of the series resonant inverters use resonant tanks operating in resonance or near of it, the current through OGs can be substituted by a sinusoidal current source with variable amplitude and frequency. According to the concept, a wide-range frequency model composed of an equivalent resistance in series of an equivalent capacitance for OGs is proposed. Because the equivalent resistance and the equivalent capacitance are closely related to switching frequency of inverter and the current through OGs, the model can be used in the wide working range. Based on the model, the characteristic of OGs is analyzed and a methodology for power supplies is developed. Through a combination of the proposed model and the four limit parameters of ozone generators and power supplies in the methodology, the main circuit parameters of the power supply for maximizing the ability of OGs are obtained. To validate the wide-range frequency model and the design methodology, an ozone generation system powered by a 14-kW series resonant inverter is built. The differences between the experimental results and the analytical results show that the proposed model has satisfying accuracy in a wide working range. Compare to the conventional methodology for power supplies, the main circuit parameters of the power supply can be obtained conveniently regardless of the heavy-load condition and light-load condition of OGs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901718","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51207026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658234","Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD);model;series resonant inverters;design methodology","Discharges (electric);Integrated circuit modeling;Resonant inverters;Resonant frequency;Analytical models;Power supplies","","4","","19","OAPA","4 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the accurate and precise prediction of the leading phase operation capacity of a large hydro-generator has always been a formidable challenge to engineers and academicians because it is extremely hard to compute the eddy currents and losses as well as the local overheating in the pressure plate and finger. To address this problem, a full three dimensional (3D) finite element model and method of the coupled eddy current and temperature fields in the end region of a large hydro-generator are developed. The equivalent medium parameters used in the computations are comprehensively discussed.

One of the two possible architectures, called the SCS1 switching fabric, was previously considered. In this paper, the second architecture, called the SCS2 switching fabric, is presented. Similarly to the previous study, this paper considers a more general case in which conversion in the middle-stage switches can be made for one of the different domains (frequency, time, etc.). Moreover, m-slot connections are a basis for the presented theory. For the S-C-S switching fabrics discussed in this paper, we derive and prove strict-sense nonblocking conditions for asymmetrical SCS2 switching fabrics when m-slot connections are set up in which mmin ≤ m ≤ mmax.

The simulations have been carried out on an individual basis for the top and bottom illuminated nanodimers with a plane wave and a focused Gaussian beam. Only one peak has been observed in the near-field spectra of free-standing and nano-scale substrate-supported nanodimers, due to the constructive coupling of fundamental modes of nanoshells at the nanogap. The wavelength location of the peak has been slightly red shifted in the presence of the nano-scale dielectric substrate. But, the obtained spectra have been found nearly independent with the type and direction of propagation of excitation light (kexc). However, multiple peaks have been noticed in the near-field spectra in the presence of microscale substrates due to the constructive coupling of lower as well as higher order modes (multipolar modes) of nanoshells at the nanogap. In contrast, the near-field spectra have been found sensitive to all dimensions of the substrate, the type of excitation light, and the direction of (kexc). Moreover, the far-field scattering spectra of a microscale substrate supported nanodimers have also been found sensitive to the direction of (kexc).","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2894655","Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India(grant numbers:EMR/2015/000143); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India(grant numbers:03(1406)/17/EMR-II); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636948","Finite dielectric substrate;near-field;localized surface plasmon resonance;far-field scattering;finite element method;single core-shell nanodimer;multipolar plasmon modes;Mie scattering resonances","Substrates;Plasmons;Dielectric substrates;Silicon compounds;Electric fields;Nanoparticles","","4","","34","OAPA","7 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this respect, in this paper, we demonstrate that the limiting efficiency lies in-between, without the absolute limiting efficiency of single gap solar cells being exceeded. However, in spite of this result, we find that the open-circuit voltage of heterojunction solar cells can exceed the bandgap (divided by the electron charge) of the low-bandgap semiconductor, something that is not possible in single gap solar cells.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2019.2932626","Project 2GAPS(grant numbers:TEC2017-92301-EXP); Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades; MADRID-PV2-CM(grant numbers:P2018/EMT-4308); Comunidad de Madrid; GRECO(grant numbers:787289 H2020); European Commission; European Open Science Policy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807186","Heterojunctions;limiting efficiency;photovoltaics;solar cells","Photovoltaic cells;Heterojunctions;Limiting;Photonic band gap;Charge carrier processes;Sun;Photonics","","4","","15","CCBY","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The demand response opportunities associated with residential water heating as well as plug-in electric vehicles are included in order to demonstrate demand-side flexibility options. Supply-side options are based on existing and optimally deployed new-build generation technologies. The scenario based results indicate that the combination of cost reductions in wind, solar PV and stationary storage (batteries), results in economic deployment of batteries in South Africa. Battery storage complements flexibility provided by demand response and supply-side options. A notable outcome is the displacement of gas-fired turbines by batteries when assuming cost reductions for batteries in the future. Finally, despite the extensive deployment of battery storage, a significant 55 TWh of energy from solar PV and wind is curtailed. Therefore, effective sector-coupling could make extensive use of this curtailed energy in a number of ways to be identified as part of future research.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2019.8732763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732763","Integrated Resource Planning;Energy Sector Coupling;Energy Storage;Demand Response;Electric Vehicles","Batteries;Couplings;Generators;Renewable energy sources;Power systems;Water heating","","4","","","","6 Jun 2019","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

This instability is a direct result of beam-electron ionization of residual background gas, and the growth rate is proportional to the ion density. In a typical accelerator vacuum, there is little ion density decay between beam pulses, and the instability will grow throughout the pulse train. We have simulated this effect, taking into account ion density decay due to recombination and channel expansion. These simulations were done for the new 2-kA, 20-MeV Scorpius multipulse LIA presently being developed.

The resonance peaks were observed in both photocurrent spectrum and absorption spectrum due to the microcavity formed by the bottom mirror of Pt/Au layer and the flat GaAs/air interface. The peak wavelength of the photocurrent spectrum in all four QDIPs on Si samples shows a good agreement with the simulated absorption spectrum. The bias-dependent photocurrent was also measured to study the microcavity effects more in depth. The ratio of the increased photocurrent under bias condition shows higher value in the microcavity QDIPs, showing that the microcavity contributes to generate photocurrent effectively.

Continuous measurements of the magnetic flux density in the return yoke are not possible and the usual practice uses software modeling of the magnetic system with special 3-D computer programs. The 10000 t flux-return yoke of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) magnet encloses a 3.8 T superconducting solenoid with a 6 m diameter by 12.5 m length free bore and consists of five dodecagonal three-layered barrel wheels around the coil and four endcap disks at each end. The yoke steel blocks, up to 620 mm thick, serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection system. A magnetostatic 3-D model of the CMS magnet has been developed to describe the magnetic field outside the solenoid volume, which was measured with a field-mapping machine. To verify the magnetic flux distribution calculated in the yoke steel blocks, direct measurements of the magnetic flux density with 22 flux loops installed in the selected regions of the yoke were performed during the CMS magnet test in 2006 when four “fast” discharges of the CMS coil (190 s time constant) were triggered manually to test the magnet protection system. No fast discharge of the CMS magnet from its operational current of 18.2 kA, which corresponds to a central magnetic flux density of 3.8 T, has been performed at that time. For the first time, in this paper, we present measurements of the magnetic flux density in the steel blocks of the return yoke based on the several standard linear discharges of the CMS magnet from the operational magnet current of 18.2 kA. To provide these measurements, the voltages induced in the flux loops (with amplitudes of 20-250 mV) have been measured with six 16 bit data acquisition modules and integrated offline over time. The results of the measurements during magnet linear ramps performed with a current rate as low as 1-1.5 A/s are presented and discussed.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2018.2868798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8472903","Electromagnetic modeling;flux loops;Hall effect devices;magnetic field measurement;magnetic flux density;measurement techniques;superconducting magnets","Superconducting magnets;Magnetic flux;Magnetostatics;Density measurement;Discharges (electric);Current measurement;Steel","","4","","13","CCBY","26 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The pace of introducing power spot markets in a number of provinces are now being accelerated. In power spot market, the transaction clearing results are closely coupled with power grid dispatching operations, and the power grid structure could deeply affect market members' earnings. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a method for evaluating transmission power grid performance in the context of power spot market. To this end, this paper presents a novel method for evaluating the operation efficiency of a transmission grid based on locational marginal prices (LMP). Firstly, the main characteristics of power spot market is introduced and the influence mechanism of transmission power grid on the market clearing outcomes is analyzed. The market operation efficiency of the transmission grid is calculated by comparing the market clearing results with or without considering the operational constraints of the transmission grid. Besides, an efficient computing method based on reinforcement learning is proposed to calculate the index. Finally, a case study based on the IEEE-33 bus system shows that this method can quantify the influence of transmission grid operational constraints on the transaction clearing results in spot market. The transmission grid performance index could be useful both in power market trading information disclosure and as a reference index for transmission expansion planning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8896018","Power spot market;transmission grid;locational marginal price;transmission network expansion planning;market performance evaluation","Power grids;Planning;Power markets;Indexes;Analytical models;Mathematical model","","4","","15","CCBY","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the pose of the target is estimated in the real time by the high-resolution range profile, and then, the pose is added to the target measurement equation. Because the relationship between the pose and the motion parameters of the targets is nonlinear, the extended Kalman filter algorithm aided by the pose of target (Pose-EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter algorithm aided by the pose of target (Pose-UKF) are proposed. The results of simulation demonstrate that compared with the traditional extended Kalman filter algorithm (EKF) and the traditional Unscented Kalman filter algorithm (UKF), the proposed algorithm can greatly improve the target tracking accuracy (position precision and velocity precision) and the convergence speed. The pose measurement error has a little effect on the tracking performance. The difference in the tracking accuracy between Pose-EKF and Pose-UKF is very little. But the Pose-EKF is better than Pose-UKF in terms of computation time, but Pose-EKF fails and Pose-UKF is effective when the pose is critical.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2890981","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:K5051202047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8604001","Target tracking;pose measure;the extended Kalman filter;the unscented Kalman filter;the high resolution range profile","Target tracking;Radar tracking;Kalman filters;Mathematical model;Signal processing algorithms;Radar cross-sections","","4","","24","OAPA","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

And the fastest response time of both build-up and self-erasure of hologram can be up to 0.1 ms, which means the material has the ability to realize a smooth holographic video-rate display.

"Root Identification Tool for Arabic Verbs","B. Azman","College of Computer and Information Technology, Sana’a University, Sana’a, Yemen",IEEE Access,"15 Apr 2019","2019","7","","45866","45871","Numerous Arabic morphology systems have been devoted toward morphed requirements of words that are required by other text analyzers. Term rooting is an essential requirement in those systems, yet rooting module in the state-of-the-art morphology systems insufficiently meet that requirement, especially verb term. Consequently, due to termination in stemming term rather than a rooting term. Since the stem of the verb is not the root of the verb, it is not feasible to generate or inference verb's derivations and whole it's surface forms (patterns) such tense, number, mood, person, aspect, and others of verb irregular patterns. Therefore, we propose a new model for identifying the verb's root produced in a tool (RootIT) in order to overcome verb root extraction without disambiguation out of traditional methods, applied in current morphology systems. A major design goal of this system is that it can be used as a standalone tool and can be integrated, in a good manner, with other linguistic analyzers. The adopted approach is a mapping surface verb with full-scale derivative verbs discharged previously in the relational database. Moreover, the proposed system is tested on the adopted dataset from PATB verbs extracted from CoreNLP system. The extracted dataset, containing more than (7950) distinguishes verbs belonging to (1938) different roots.

Our present-day dependence on satellite-based communication and navigation has led to a resurgence of interest in the prediction of ionospheric scintillations, which degrade the performance of such systems. In the low-latitude ionosphere, the genesis of intermediate-scale (∼100 m to a few km) irregularities, which cause the most severe scintillations on VHF to L-band trans-ionospheric radio signals, is in the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) plasma instability on the bottom-side of the post-sunset equatorial F layer. Theoretical developments and observations by various ground-based instruments, as well as in-situ measurements by instruments onboard rockets and satellites, have identified several parameters of the ambient ionosphere that play key roles in the occurrence of these irregularities over the dip equator. However, the presence of basic conditions for the linear growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability fails to explain the large day-to-day variability in the characteristics of these irregularities, which determines the latitudinal distribution and strength of scintillations, and is a result of the nonlinear evolution of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In this paper, the present status of the efforts at prediction of low-latitude scintillations on the basis of a multitude of observations and numerical simulation of the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the equatorial ionosphere are reviewed. In particular, this review describes how observations of ionospheric scintillations may be used to obtain information about the nonlinear evolution of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability under different ambient conditions, which is yet to be explored through numerical simulation of the phenomenon. Such studies have pointed out important gaps in our knowledge about the evolution of equatorial ionospheric irregularities that are responsible for producing scintillations on L-band signals recorded in the equatorial and low-latitude regions around the globe.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2019.9117241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117241","","Iron","","3","","48","","15 Jun 2020","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

The N-buffer between all these components above forms a 3-D L-shaped extraction path. The L-shaped extraction path not only makes the device area-efficient but also increases the anode distributed resistance (RSA). Therefore, the snapback effect could be suppressed, and the tradeoff between the on-state voltage (Von) and turn-off energy (Eoff) is improved effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed device eliminates the snapback effect with 63% and 77% reduction of the anode region area compared with the segmented trenches in the anode region (STA) LIGBT and the separated shorted anode (SSA) LIGBT, respectively. At the same Von, the LEP LIGBT reduces the turn-off time (toff) and Eoff by 40% and 28%, respectively, compared with the STA LIGBT.

However, with the proper selection of fractional order, the first technique has a high bit error rate (BER) performance in the frequency-time selective channels. This paper performs further analysis of CE-FrFT-OFDM by examining its spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) and compare to the famous OFDM and FrFT-OFDM techniques. Analytical and comprehensive simulations conducted show that, the CE-FrFT-OFDM has five times the EE of OFDM and FrFT-OFDM systems with a slightly less SE. Increasing CE-FrFT-OFDM's transmission power by increasing its amplitude to 1.7 increases its SE to match that of the OFDM and FrFT-OFDM systems while slightly reducing its EE by 20% to be four times that of OFDM and FrFTOFDM systems. OFDM and FrFT-OFDM's amplitude fluctuations cause rapid changing output back-off (OBO) power requirements and further reduce power amplifier (PA) efficiency while CE-FrFTOFDM stable operational linear range makes it a better candidate and outperforms the other techniques when their OBO exceeds 1.7.

The appearance of the new generation standards greatly relieves the dilemma but increases the coding complexity dramatically. Motion estimation is considered as the module with a relatively high computational complexity. In this paper, a parallel motion estimation implementation is proposed, which includes pre-motion estimation, integer motion estimation, and fractional motion estimation. They are highly accelerated on GPU based on AVS2, which is one of the new generation standards. A rapid mapping table algorithm is introduced to improve the efficiency of data access.

However, it has yet to be determined how gate control, including threshold voltage, of 2-D NC-FETs is impacted by gate dielectric composition, along with dielectric and ferroelectric layer thicknesses. Here, we show the threshold voltage shifts positively under increasing ferroelectric thickness and negatively with increasing dielectric thickness. This shifting behavior is observed in devices without an interfacial metal layer between the ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrO2 or HZO) and dielectric. Because the interface between the ferroelectric and dielectric is critical in driving NC behavior, we also study 2-D NC-FETs with 4 nm HZO paired with different dielectrics. These results reveal that the HZO/Al2O3 interface is more favorable than either the HZO/ZrO2 or HZO/HfO2 interfaces. Finally, the impact of an interfacial metal layer is discussed by comparing the 2-D NC-FET performance of similar devices with and without this layer.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2019.2922441","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1656240,EPMD-1508573,GRFP-1508573); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735840","Negative capacitance;two-dimensional;2D;NC;2D FET;NC-FET;hafnium zirconium oxide;ferroelectricity","Dielectrics;Capacitance;Two dimensional displays;Hafnium compounds;Threshold voltage;Logic gates;Performance evaluation","","3","","28","OAPA","12 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A total of 416 load profiles are produced containing 208 sets of horizontal and vertical aggregated profiles for comparison. Two factors are varied, (1) total EWH population from 1 to 1 million in various increments and (2) peak time window for initiating EWH draws ranging from 1 to 12 hours, where a Gaussian distribution is applied to the times each EWH starts participating on the grid. The resulting aggregated load profiles show that EWHs in the vertical orientation produce a higher aggregated maximum demand whereas the horizontal orientation can have a much lower aggregated maximum demand to a ratio of 0.58. A maximum demand ratio Ph/Pv of 0.80 is determined for a scenario similar to normal grid operation for a peak time window of 4 hours. The significance of this work is to quantify the difference in maximum power demand of a population of EWHs due to tank orientations in a controlled simulated environment.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2019.8732788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732788","Domestic hot water;electric water heater;power demand;load aggregation;tank orientation;electrical grid","Water heating;Power demand;Resistance heating;Loss measurement;Steady-state;Temperature measurement","","3","","","","6 Jun 2019","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

The electrical field of the optical signal can be retrieved via the beating between the pilot and optical signal in one photodetector at the receiver side, which facilitates the digital compensation of chromatic dispersion effect. To enable real value signal processing, digital carrier regeneration is proposed to mitigate the phase noise fluctuation in the proposed scheme. To further improve the performance, the digital signal processing including Kramers-Kronig field reconstruction and Volterra equalizer are applied to reduce the signal-to-signal beat noise and nonlinear distortions after fiber transmission. The experimental results for both 56- and 64-Gb/s PAM-4 signal transmission cases show that the performances can be significantly improvement based on the proposed scheme and DSP methods.

Massive heat flux generated at the tool-chip interface, and high tool temperature can induce severe tool wear in cutting Inconel 718 with cemented carbide tool. Determining the generated heat flux and tool temperature in the cutting process is crucial to illustrate the tool wear mechanism. However, there is a shortage of method for integrated estimation of the heat flux generated at the tool-chip interface and temperature distribution within the tool in cutting Inconel 718. In the current study, the one-dimensional inverse heat conduction model was proposed for the integrated prediction of generated heat flux and tool temperature. First, the heat flux generated at the tool-chip interface was inversely calculated with the measured rake face temperature. The heat flux generated at tool-chip interface and heat flux dissipated into tool were increased with cutting speed. Then, the temperature distribution within the cemented carbide tool was determined with the derived analytical solution. Temperature interval between rake face temperature and reverse surface temperature was increased with cutting speed. Finally, the predicted heat flux values were verified accurate with the relative error of less than 3% compared with the research results from the modified Merchant's chip formation model.

We show how chromatic dispersion, skew, carrier frequency offset, timing error, and the state of polarization can be mitigated with a single filtering stage in the frequency domain. The error estimation in the frequency domain is based on the modified Godard algorithm, which calculates the clock tone with less than two samples per symbol and small timing jitter. The synchronization in the frequency domain is independent of the modulation format and therefore a good candidate for higher order modulation formats and so the synchronization of probabilistic shaped (PS) signals based on a high cardinality rectangular QAM format. We show the synchronization of PS polarization-division multiplexed (PDM)-64QAM signals with a symbol rate of 42.7 GBd in the frequency domain. The simulative results for the influence of the FFT size and the number of FFT blocks used for the error estimation are shown.

Owing to limited data sources, traditional methods cannot extract traffic density directly. In the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) environment, the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) interaction technologies create better conditions for collecting the whole time-space and refined traffic data, which provides a new approach to solving this problem. Design/methodology/approach - On that basis, a real-time traffic density extraction method has been proposed, including lane density, segment density and network density. Meanwhile, using SUMO and OMNet++ as traffic simulator and network simulator, respectively, the Veins framework as middleware and the two-way coupling VANET simulation platform was constructed. Findings - Based on the simulation platform, a simulated intersection in Shanghai was developed to investigate the adaptability of the model. Originality/value - Most research studies use separate simulation methods, importing trace data obtained by using from the simulation software to the communication simulation software. In this paper, the tight coupling simulation method is applied. Using real-time data and history data, the research focuses on the establishment and validation of the traffic density extraction model.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-01-2019-0003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999198","Traffic density;VANET simulation;Vehicular ad hoc network","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Roads;Adaptation models;Veins;Software;Real-time systems;Load modeling","","3","","","","26 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, ARP5107B also requires that the loss of thrust control (LOTC) rate error calculated by applying the single-fault MM must be less than 5% when performing airworthiness certification. Firstly, the sources of accuracy errors in three kinds of MM are analyzed and specified through a case study of the general FADEC system, and secondly a two-fault MM considering maintenance policy is established through analyzing and calculating the expected repair time when two related faults happen. Finally, a specific FADEC system is given to study on the influence factors of accuracy error in the single-fault MM, and the results show that the accuracy error of the single-fault MM decreases with the increase of short or long prescribed dispatch time, and the range values of short time (ST) and long time (LT) are determined to satisfy the requirement of accuracy error within 5%.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2019.05.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8868311","full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system;Markov model (MM);accuracy analysis;loss of thrust control (LOTC)","Maintenance engineering;Engines;Markov processes;Analytical models;Aircraft;Aircraft propulsion","","3","","","","17 Oct 2019","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

In order to predict the statistical behavior of the complex adaptive filter after converging, this paper analyzes the steady-state mean-square deviation (MSD) performance of ZA-CLMS with circular Gaussian input. For mathematical tractability, in the analysis, the unknown system weights are divided into two sets according to their values and some statistical assumptions are used.

In this light, we propose and study novel diversified routing (DR) queries that discover the most convenient routes in dynamic road networks, where travel time, congestion probability, and global travel cost are taken into account. Given a dynamic transportation network, a source, a destination, a travel time threshold τt, a congestion probability threshold τp, and a global travel cost threshold Tg, the DR query finds: 1) the route with the minimum travel time whose global travel cost does not exceed τg; 2) the route with the minimum congestion probability whose global travel cost does not exceed τg; and 3) the route with the minimum global travel cost whose travel time does not exceed τt and congestion probability does not exceed τp. Such types of queries are very useful in many mobile applications, such as travel planning and recommendation, urban computing, intelligent transportation, and location-based services in general. The DR queries face two challenges: 1) how to model the dynamic road networks and to define the travel time, congestion probability, and global travel cost practically and 2) how to prune the search space effectively and to return the query results in the real time. To overcome the challenges and to process the DR queries efficiently, we develop a search framework based on network expansion. A series of optimization techniques is developed to further enhance the query efficiency.

After positive bias stress, an abnormal gate current leakage decrease appears in both dipole-doped and normal N-type MOSCAPs under short term stress. Analysis of capacitance and gate current measurements indicate that electron trapping and defect generation cause the change in gate current after positive bias stress. Generally, devices with higher gate leakage have more severe degradation after PBTI.

However, actual performance of Tensor Core is usually limited by the bandwidth of shared memory or global memory. In addition, only lower-precision data types are supported in the current API for Tensor Core. Therefore, we have to prevent a decline in accuracy in the computation.

Thus, the doping concentration of the carrier-stored layer (Ncs) can be significantly improved without compromising the breakdown voltage. Hence, an ultra-low on-state voltage drop (Von) can be obtained. Besides, the two series-connected diodes clamp the drain-to-source voltage of the intrinsic n-MOS in the TLIGBT, which leads to an ultra-low saturation current and improves the short-circuit withstand capability.

However, existing landmark evaluation methods cannot determine the error range of landmarks. Therefore, a street-level landmark evaluation algorithm that can estimate the upper bound of landmark error is proposed. Firstly the city of candidate landmarks are verified by IP location databases. Secondly, candidate landmarks are grouped through their last-hop routers, and then divided into several clusters by E-Apriori algorithm based on their location. Thirdly, the Land-mark reliability probability model is used to calculate the probability of the last-hop router location range. Finally the upper error bound of the landmark is determined by the position of the last-hop router. By verifying 503 reliable land-marks evaluated by the algorithm in Hong Kong, we find that the algorithm can determine the upper error bound of landmarks, and the accuracy reaches 100%. We test the algorithm based on 100 accurate landmarks and 400 unreliable landmarks, and find that our algorithm can evaluate 84 accurate landmarks and 1 invalid landmark, i.e., it achieves an accuracy of 98.8%. Finally, we take landmark evaluation experiment based on 50,000 candidate landmarks in Hong Kong and Zhengzhou respectively.

This is referred to as the ultra-thin once coating (UTOC)-MOD process. This process improves the in-field performance. The UTOC-MOD process also has the advantage of uniformity of 2-dimensional Jc-distribution, which was determined using a scanning hall-probe microscopy analysis. Improvement of the Jc uniformity was also confirmed based on scribed tapes. A smaller dispersion of the filament-critical current values in the UTOC-MOD tape was determined based on a comparison with the results for obtained by a conventional process. With respect to the mechanical strength, it was established that the dispersion of the delamination strength, which was evaluated using stud-pull equipment, was suppressed. Microstructural analysis revealed that, the UTOC films were pore-free, although large pores are present in the films when conventional MOD is utilized.

Also, the presence of the higher air content in the antenna body lowers the effective dielectric constant of the RDRA, leading to a wideband configuration. For demonstration, the proposed antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured results show that the proposed antenna radiates in the broadside direction with a high gain of 9 dB. Also, a wide impedance bandwidth of 15.3% from 3.57 to 4.16 GHz is achieved. In addition, the radiation efficiency of more than 90% over the whole bandwidth is attained.

The parameters of the 20-nm-thick G-SPPWs were chosen based on our previous simulation results. The excited input SPPs propagate, jump over the gaps with low coupling losses, and propagate again, despite a 9-μm-long gap in the G-SPPWs. The coupling losses of the gap were experimentally determined to be less than 0.7 dB with various gap lengths up to 9 μm. The insertion losses of the straight G-SPPW with 8 μm × 2 μm (gap length × SPPW width) and the tapered G-SPPW with 8 μm × 2 μm (gap length × SPPW width) and a 6 μm × 3 μm (taper width × taper length) were determined to be ~1.03 and ~0.74 dB, respectively. The tapered structure increases the tunneling efficiency in the gap of the G-SPPW by reducing the insertion loss. In the 2.5-Gbps optical signal transmission experiment, the proposed G-SPPW exhibited excellent eye opening and transferred the carrier wave as well as the data signal.

In order to avoid signal delays and to allow boost converter topology, the appropriate relationship between Rr and Rcom is presented. The GaN transistor used has an input capacitance of 43 pF and a feedback capacitance of 11 pF at zero drain-source voltage. Owing to these low parasitic capacitances, the comparator can drive the transistor, and this multi-functional comparator configuration also reduces control signal delays. These effects enable the boost converter to operate at a switching frequency of 25 MHz, allowing Vout to conform to the envelope of a long term evolution signal with a 4-MHz bandwidth.

However, the biological mechanisms underlying these interactions are not fully understood. Understanding the interface features between protein and nucleic acids may offer insights into how proteins are coupled with nucleic acids. There is a lack of tools that insight into the features of interface in a protein at present. In this work, we developed the InPrNa tool, a graphical tool for protein-nucleic acids complexes that works seamlessly within the PyMOL and gives quick results including 3D visualization for the residue's structure. InPrNa provides three distinct visualization modes to highlight interface, detecting interface residues with different distance between protein and nucleic acid, marking physicochemical properties of the interface residues, and displaying three spatial structures of the interface residues. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of InPrNa's algorithm by contrast DNA binding proteins (DBPs) and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). These results show that DBPs and RBPs have significant differences in amino acids distribution and structural distribution. InPrNa may help for analysis the interface characteristics of proteins-nucleic acids in PyMOL, and can be particularly useful in rapidly pinpointing the interaction mode of proteins-nucleic acids interface.

While TiN is commonly used as the electrode of choice owing to its thermodynamic stability with HfO2, its work function (WF) (=4.8eV) results in reduced memory window (MW), and higher interlayer field (EIL) in bulk Ferroelectric FETs (FeFETs). This is attributed to the built-in electric-field that arises from the WF difference between the metal and the semiconductor. This effectively reduces the ferroelectric hysteresis, and thus, the MW at the read current. Optimizing the MW and the EIL would entail changing the WF, and thus, the capping electrode-essential to retaining the desired ferroelectric properties. We, therefore, propose using the silicon on insulator (SOI)-FeFET architecture which provides an additional knob-back-gate bias (Vbg)-to optimize the MW while reducing the EIL. Further, we show that unlike the bulk FeFET, where a small deviation from the optimal WF dramatically shrinks the MW, the SOIFeFET facilitates a relatively constant MW over a wide range of Vbg. Thus, the SOI-FeFET simplifies the MW & EIL optimization and provides an improved MW versus EIL trade-off in comparison to the bulk FeFET.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2019.2906834","University of Virginia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8672462","Ferroelectric FET (FeFET);interlayer field (EIL);memory window (MW);silicon on insulator (SOI);non-volatile memory (NVM)","Tin;Logic gates;Hysteresis;Electrodes;Computer architecture;Silicon-on-insulator","","3","","28","OAPA","21 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to find out whether the test data of the whole leader channels are accuracy to represent the leader propagation paths, a discharge test of a 4 m rod-plane air gap subjected to switching impulse voltage is carried out. And an observation platform is set up to synchronously record the voltage waveforms, the discharge currents, the leader propagation processes and the whole leader channels. A new method is proposed to subtract the final-jump part from the whole leader channel by identifying the leader tip height at the initiation of the final jump (LTH for short) from the CCD image. Then the test data of LTH and the leader propagation path are statistically obtained. And probability density functions (PDFs for short) of three different angles between consecutive segments of the leader propagation path are used to quantitatively describe the leader tortuosity. According to the analysis of the results, the mean value of LTH is nearly half the gap length in the gap axial direction. And an obvious difference can be discovered when comparing PDFs of the leader propagation paths with those of the whole leader channels. A conclusion to account for the difference is deduced that the leader paths during the final jump are much straighter than those during leader propagation. In the end, the present work recommends that the final-jump part should be subtracted from the whole leader channel when the test data of leader tortuosity are used in the numerical model for positive long air discharge.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8907892","Air discharge;design of long air gap dimension;leader tortuosity;long rod-plane air gaps;50% breakdown voltage;leader propagation;final jump","Discharges (electric);Air gaps;Cameras;Atmospheric modeling;Corona;Switches;Charge coupled devices","","3","","31","CCBY","20 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The optimization in this method consists of a simultaneous minimization of two objective functions, resulting in a bilevel optimization problem with SNMF (BiSNMF), where conventional methods approximately solve this optimization. To strictly solve BiSNMF, we introduce a new algorithm with the following two features: (a) conversion of the optimization constraint into a penalty term and (b) optimization of the reformulated problem on the basis of a multiplicative steepest descent, ensuring the nonnegativity of variables. Experiments on music signal separation show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2019.2909079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681100","Discriminative training;bilevel optimization;supervised NMF;audio signal separation","Optimization;Linear programming;Training;Source separation;Signal processing algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Spectrogram","","2","","25","OAPA","3 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The disruption of these oscillatory processes is associated with the symptoms of several brain disorders. While conventional therapeutic high-frequency deep brain stimulation can perturb neuronal oscillations, manipulating the timing of oscillatory activity between areas more precisely could provide a more efficient and effective method of modulating these activities. Here we describe a prototype circuit for synchronizing the clocks between an active implantable and an external sensing and stimulation system that could be used to achieve this goal. Our specific focus is on synchronizing the systems for paired-associative stimulation. The ability to repetitively drive two brain regions with a fixed latency has specific implications for neural plasticity.

To determine a more accurate center of a near infrared star, this paper proposes a method to detect the star's saliency area and calculate the star's centroid via the pixels only in this area, which can greatly decrease the effect of the radiation. During saliency area detection, we calculated the boundary connectivity and gray similarity of every pixel to estimate how likely it was to be a background pixel. Aiming to simplify and speed up the calculation process, we divided the near infrared starry sky image into super pixel maps at multi-scale by Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). Second, we detected the saliency map for every super pixel map of the image. Finally, we fused the saliency maps according to a weighted coefficient that is determined by the least square method. For the images used in our experiment, we set the multi-scale super pixel numbers to 100, 150, and 200. The results show that our method can obtain an offset variance of less than 0.27 for the center coordinates compared to the labelled centers.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8620948","near infrared;starry star;saliency;Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC)","Navigation;Charge coupled devices;Saliency detection;Image segmentation;Least mean squares methods;Detectors;Interference","","2","","","","24 Jan 2019","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The design flow started with developing an isolation-enhancement network for the MIMO antenna that did not disturb the RCS reduction process. An incident- and polarization-angle-insensitive frequency-selective surface (FSS) was next designed. The conventional ground plane of the MIMO antenna was replaced by an FSS array. The designed FSS was introduced in such a way that the antenna's characteristics and isolation among the antenna ports were preserved by achieving the RCS reduction of an antenna at the bandpass frequency of the FSS. The proposed FSS was angularly stable, and hence an almost constant RCS reduction was found for most of the incident angles. The final proposed low-RCS MIMO antenna was fabricated and measured to validate the simulation results.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2019.9117243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117243","","","","2","","23","","15 Jun 2020","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

First, many holes can accumulate in the p-drift region in the on-state, which provides a low-resistance path for hole conduction. Second, a paralleled n-LDMOS is, meanwhile, automatically triggered to form a new path for electrons. Electrons have higher mobility than holes; thus, the device performance is further improved. Based on a simulation comparison with the previous p-LDMOS at the same BV of 300 V, the Ron,sp of the proposed p-LDMOS decreased by 78% and the figure of merit (FOM) increased approximately 3.4 times.

Finally, we present similar results for an O-band VOA design.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2930503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8770078","Silicon nanophotonics","Heating systems;Power demand;Substrates;Attenuation;Optical attenuators;Bandwidth;Metals","","2","","25","CCBY","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But non-dominated solutions cannot spread uniformly, since the Pareto front shows different features, such as concave and convex. To improve the distribution uniformity of non-dominated solutions, a bidirectional decomposition based approach that constructs two search directions is proposed to provide a uniform distribution no matter what features problems have. Since two populations along two search directions show differently on diversity and convergence, an adaptive neighborhood selection approach is presented to choose suitable parents for the offspring generation. In order to avoid the problem of the shrinking search region caused by the close distance of the ideal and nadir points, a reference point update approach is presented. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated with four state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm on all considered test problems.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2019.02.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710380","many objective optimization;bidirectional decomposition;reference update;evolutionary algorithm.","Sociology;Convergence;Search problems;Pareto optimization;Systems engineering and theory","","2","","","","13 May 2019","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

It is based on the Poisson statistics algorithm and a double time windows technique with a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) and a field programmable gate array (FPGA). It measures the mean incident photoelectron number of pulsed light with zero peak statistics of the Poisson distribution to reduce the influence of the correlation noises and the dark count rate (DCR) fluctuation. The linear measurement ranges from ~10-4 MPEs to ~10 MPEs (i.e., ~97 dB) were demonstrated with double 35-ns time windows at room temperature. Its upper detection limit is determined by the availability for the zero peak counts of the Poisson distribution, and the lower detection limit is mainly determined by the DCR of the SiPM. By narrowing the time window to ~550 ps or decreasing the operating temperature of SiPM to -30 °C, the detection limit can be further decreased to ~10-5 MPEs. This method, with capability to record the arrival time of incident photons, demonstrated an instrument response function (IRF) of ~214.9 ps (FWHM), showing its compatibility to the time correlated photon counting (TCPC) technique and the time of flight (TOF) measurement.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2019.2929674","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11875089); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765781","Low-level light detection;Poisson statistics;silicon photomultiplier (SiPM);field programmable gate array (FPGA);time correlated photon counting (TCPC)","Photonics;Field programmable gate arrays;Temperature measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Time measurement;Detectors;Photomultipliers","","2","","22","CCBY","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, generation of such narrow sampling pulse is difficult or usually need complex setup configure at the receiver side, which would cause ineffective cost in application scenarios such as short-reach optical communication or PON applications. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate demultiplexing of N-OTDM signal based on temporal magnification followed by coherent optical sampling to enable broader sampling pulsewidths while reducing the ISI. The target tributary of the N-OTDM signal is temporally magnified and further demultiplexed through coherent optical sampling using Gaussian-shaped or Nyquist-shaped pulses. With the aid of temporal magnification based on a time-lens, the sampling window can be extended during the coherent detection progress at the receiver side. Gaussian sampling pulses with a pulsewidth up to 10.4 ps are enabled for the demultiplexing of a 160 Gbaud N-OTDM signal. Compared with demultiplexing based on Nyquist pulses (i.e., coherent matched sampling) without temporal magnification, the proposed scheme features a better performance with pulsewidths greater than 6 ps. If temporal magnification is combined with coherent matched sampling, Nyquist sampling pulses with a pulsewidth up to 12.4 ps are made possible for the demultiplexing. Therefore, the proposed scheme based on temporal magnification could significantly release the pulsewidth requirement for N-OTDM demultiplexing while mitigating the ISI.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2929213","National High-tech Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2015AA015503); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61505011,61475022,61331008,61307055); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2014CB340100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765390","Optical communications;coherent communications.","Optical pulses;Optical receivers;Demultiplexing;Optical filters;Optical polarization;Lenses;Phase modulation","","2","","14","CCBY","17 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our Bluetooth-based wetness and bleeding detector consist of a wetness sensor, microcontroller, Bluetooth transceiver microcontroller, and GSM modem or computer. Two or four fine conductors between sheets of medical bandage or diaper layers comprise the wetness sensor. Wires connect to a pair of pressing studs protruding from one end of the diaper or gauze. When the wires are wet, the conductance between the studs drops exceeding a pre-established threshold, initiating the alarm.

The first sequence began in July with an Mw 6.4 event near Lombok, culminating in an Mw 7.0 event 8 d later. This was then followed by a nearby Mw 6.9 event 12 d later. Approximately 1000 km to the northeast, a separate sequence began several weeks later near Palu where an Mw 7.5 event occurred that triggered a tsunami. In this study, we present hypocentre relocations for both earthquake sequences as well as all other regional earthquakes in eastern Indonesia. The relocations were performed using a teleseismic double-difference relocation method and arrival times for P and S waves from stations at local, regional, and teleseismic distances. The catalogue and phase data were taken from the Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) of Indonesia and the International Seismological Centre (ISC) for the period of April 2009 through November 2018. The relocated catalogue provides an improved view of seismicity in eastern Indonesia over the study period, sharpening locations and interpretations of seismogenic features throughout the region. In the Lombok area, the relocated earthquakes clearly show a backarc thrust to the north of the Sunda-Banda Arc transition zone. The relocated aftershocks show that the destructive Mw 7.0 and Mw 6.9 earthquakes of the Lombok sequence ruptured two different regions: The Mw 7.0 earthquake propagated westward, whereas the Mw 6.9 earthquake propagated eastward. The entire sequence of Lombok earthquakes was most likely started by the Mw 6.4 event as the initial event or foreshock, which then triggered backarc thrusts on both sides. Several weeks later and far to the northeast, the Mw 7.5 Palu earthquake occurred along the Palu-Koro Fault, filling a seismic gap that had not ruptured in an Mw 6.0 event or larger since at least 1900. The distribution of aftershocks indicates that the northern part of the Palu-Koro Fault has lower relative seismicity rates than the southern part at shallow depths, and that off fault aftershocks are mostly located to the east of the Palu-Koro Fault.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267140","Aftershocks;Seismicity;Earthquakes","","","2","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, it has not yet achieved quantitative control of coupling effects in metamaterial designs, which is important for advanced engineering applications such as artificial intelligence antenna and reconfigurable camouflage. In this paper, all dielectric left-handed metamaterial operating in THz band based on the deep coupling of higher mode Mie resonance is presented. Distinguished from those designs published before, this left-handed metamaterial is composed only by one same structure, not two separated parts providing negative permittivity and permeability, respectively. By utilizing different Mie resonant modes, negative permittivity and permeability are accomplished via high order Mie resonant modes and the coupling between cubes.

Mechanical failure of the insulation could be a precursor to an electrical failure that could damage the TF inner leg central column, which is more difficult to repair. The shear stress in these bonded layers is proportional to the TF outer-leg out-of-plane (OOP) bending. This is a part of a larger program at National Spherical Tokamak Upgrade to instrument and monitor the structural performance of the machine. Components of the instrumentation plan are shown in this study. Bending of the outer leg due to out-of-plane loads is supported partly by shear in the bond between the three conductors that are bonded together to form the outer leg. Bending stress in the outer conductors provides an indication of the integrity of the shear bond. As a part of the orderly planned increase in operational parameters to 0.8 T (as of Feb 2016 it was at 0.61 T). Ten new FISO gauges were purchased and installed in March 2016. They yielded useful data prior to the forced shut-down due to the failure of PF1aUpper coil. The analytic process used to split out the thermal, in-plane and out-of-plane bending strains is described and compared with the measured results. The measured results provide reasonable benchmarks for the analysis. Ultimately, the main purpose of the instrumentation is to compare coil-to-coil behavior, to watch for consistency. If a coil starts to deviate from the others, the coil can be inspected for possible debonding between the three conductors that make up the outer leg. To properly monitor the full TF system, more channels are needed than Fabry-Pérot systems can provide. The planned fiber-Bragg grating (FBG) system is introduced in this paper. Monitoring and evaluation of the TF outer leg strains are also related to computed quantities that are monitored and protected by the digital coil protection system. Currently, the bending strain is expected to be adequately represented by upper-outer leg global moment sums. This relationship is discussed in this paper.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2019.2924620","U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC02-09CH11466); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765835","Fusion diagnostics;fusion magnets","Legged locomotion;Strain;Strain measurement;Stress;Monitoring;Bragg gratings;Instruments","","2","","4","CCBY","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The inverter has a higher voltage gain and good characteristics when the inductor L1 is operated in discontinuous mode (DCM) and the nonpolarized capacitor can be chosen as bus capacitor, which makes the volume smaller and the service life of the inverter is increased. The inverter consists of live switches in which only two switches are operated at high frequency state and a monopole sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) strategy is used.

The study on the reaction kinetics of electrical aging is an important basis of improving the reliability of DC cable. Free energy increment (FEI) under electric field reflects the reaction rate of electrical aging, which is very useful to analyze the aging characteristics of materials. However, there is no direct way to get the FEI, which causes that the FEI stays at the stage of theoretical analysis and cannot be obtained by experiment. In this paper, an easy method including experiment and calculation to get the FEI is proposed, and a simulation method to obtain the FEI is also introduced. The experiment and simulation both show that the FEI of crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) is proportional to the degree of polymerization, is approximately linear with the electric field, and grows with the temperature. According to the FEI obtained, we find that the molecular branches of the XLPE whose plane of carbons is perpendicular to electric field are more likely to age. Improving molecular chain orientation and reducing the length of branches are two of the methods to improve the aging characteristics of the XLPE.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920685","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB0900701); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8730415","XLPE cable;electrical aging;Gibb’s free energy;molecular simulation;step stress test","Aging;Stress;Electric fields;Polyethylene;Cable insulation","","2","","17","OAPA","4 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is possible to provide ancillary services via VESS by exploiting the flexibility and thus much research has been proposed on the optimization of the VESS scheduling. In general, the charging and discharging efficiencies of VESS are different and there can be only one status at a time slot. To achieve the optimal schedule while considering the constraints above, binary terms should be introduced into the optimization problem which end up with a nonconvex problem. In this paper, a complimentary mathematical proof is given for the convexification of this mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem so that the linear programming (LP) method can be applied instead if the objective function is linear.

T1-weighted, T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MR sequences were combined to create a three-channel image as input data. A conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) was trained using image patches. The image quality was evaluated using voxel-wise mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the CT number. For the dosimetric evaluation, 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were generated using the original CT set and recalculated using the sCT images. The isocenter dose and dose–volume parameters were compared for 3D-CRT and VMAT plans, respectively. The equivalent path length was also compared.

The overall equivalent path length was shorter than that for real CT by 0.6 ± 1.9 mm. A treatment planning study using generated sCT detected only small, clinically negligible differences.

The standard passive monitoring seismic interferometry technique based on coda waves is robust but recovering accurate and properly localized P- and S-wave velocity temporal anomalies at depth is intrinsically limited by the complexity of scattered, diffracted waves. In order to mitigate this limitation, we propose a complementary, novel, passive seismic monitoring approach based on detecting weak temporal changes of velocities of ballistic waves recovered from seismic noise correlations. This new technique requires dense arrays of seismic sensors in order to circumvent the bias linked to the intrinsic high sensitivity of ballistic waves recovered from noise correlations to changes in the noise source properties. In this work we use a dense network of 417 seismometers in the Groningen area of the Netherlands, one of Europe's largest gas fields. Over the course of 1 month our results show a 1.5 per cent apparent velocity increase of the P wave refracted at the basement of the 700-m-thick sedimentary cover. We interpret this unexpected high value of velocity increase for the refracted wave as being induced by a loading effect associated with rainfall activity and possibly canal drainage at surface. We also observe a 0.25 per cent velocity decrease for the direct P-wave travelling in the near-surface sediments and conclude that it might be partially biased by changes in time in the noise source properties even though it appears to be consistent with complementary results based on ballistic surface waves presented in a companion paper and interpreted as a pore pressure diffusion effect following a strong rainfall episode. The perspective of applying this new technique to detect continuous localized variations of seismic velocity perturbations at a few kilometres depth paves the way for improved in situ earthquake, volcano and producing reservoir monitoring.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggz440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267062","Seismic interferometry;Body waves;Seismic noise;Wave propagation","","","2","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The continuity of tangential electromagnetic fields along the interface of neighboring regions is enforced by the Galerkin's matching process and a matrix equation is thus derived. The cutoff wavenumbers of the T-waveguide are then found from the matrix. The results are in good agreement with those obtained by CST Microwave Studio.

For a cruising HEV, the state-of-charge Pulse and Glide (SOC-PnG) is known to be the optimal charging-discharging pattern. The optimal charging-discharging profiles of the SOC-PnG strategy can be obtained using the optimization algorithms, such as dynamic programming and Pontryagin's minimum principle. These methods are general tools for optimal control problems but they demand too much computing resources. This paper proposes a problem-specific optimization method that can solve an optimal control problem of the SOC-PnG with less computing resources than the general optimization algorithms. The problem is formulated in the SOC-SOC rate domain, which simplifies the optimization problem and removes many constraints. This approach transforms the necessary conditions for the optimality from one with a path function to one with a point function. An optimization algorithm based on the point function can obtain the optimal solutions about 100 times faster than dynamic programming. This fast optimization is possible because the algorithm exploits the specific cost structure and problem properties. Therefore, this algorithm cannot be applied to all optimization problems but it can accelerate the recursive and time-consuming system design or control design processes in HEV research.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2925139","National Research Foundation of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1A2C1003103); Industry Core Technology Development Program; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology(grant numbers:10076309); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8746084","Fuel efficiency;hybrid vehicle;optimization;state-of-charge Pulse and Glide (SOC-PnG)","State of charge;Batteries;Engines;Fuels;Gears;Optimal control;Hybrid electric vehicles","","2","","17","CCBY","26 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A recently proposed method based on the Marchenko equation enables removal of the entire overburden-related scattering by means of calculating an inverse transmission response. However, the method relies on time windowing and can thus be inexact in the presence of short-period internal scattering. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the impact of band-limitation on the Marchenko method. We show the influence of an incorrect first guess, and that adding multidimensional energy conservation and a minimum phase principle may be used to correctly account for both long- and short-period internal multiple scattering. The proposed method can currently only be solved for media with a laterally invariant overburden, since a multidimensional minimum phase condition is not well understood for truly 2-D and 3-D media. We demonstrate the virtue of the proposed scheme with a complex acoustic numerical model that is based on sonic log measurements in the Middle East. The results suggest not only that the conventional scheme can be robust in this setting, but that the ‘augmented’ Marchenko method is superior, as the latter produces a structural image identical to one where the finely layered overburden is missing. This is the first demonstration of a data-driven method to account for short-period internal multiples beyond 1-D.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267068","Theoretical Seismology;Wave propagation;Wave Scattering and Diffraction;Inverse Theory;Image processing","","","1","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In addition, we sought to assess whether the therapist and patients would find the sEMG BFB relevant and useful. To achieve this objective, we examined the effect of visual sEMG BFB system in improving muscle activation and therapeutic outcomes during experimental sessions that mimicked conventional slings therapy sessions with a research therapist providing the therapy.

Inspired by the fact that natural scenes exhibit unique degenerated structures in the low-dimensional subspace, we propose to take advantage of such local prior via convolutional sparse coding to implement high fidelity SPI. Specifically, we can represent the target scene via convolving with a set of statistically learned kernels, with the convolution coefficient matrix being sparse. We introduce the above local prior into conventional SPI framework to promote the final reconstruction quality.

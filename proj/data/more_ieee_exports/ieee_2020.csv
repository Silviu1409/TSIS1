However, most studies on complex networks focus on the properties of a single network and seldom on classification, clustering, and comparison between different networks, in which the network is treated as a whole. Conventional methods can hardly be applied on networks directly due to the non-Euclidean properties of data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Complex Network Classifier (CNC) by integrating network embedding and convolutional neural network to tackle the problem of network classification. By training the classifier on synthetic complex network data, we show CNC can not only classify networks with high accuracy and robustness but can also extract the features of the networks automatically. We also compare our CNC with baseline methods on benchmark datasets, which shows that our method performs well on large-scale networks.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8954863","complex network;network classification;DeepWalk;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","Complex networks;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Deep learning;Convolutional neural networks;International trade;Principal component analysis","","121","","","","13 Jan 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The conventional association-based multi-target tracking (MTT) methods suffer from high computational complexity and limited usage in the presence of MRFT jamming. In order to solve the above problems, an efficient and adaptable probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is proposed. Based on the gating strategy, the obtained measurements are firstly classified into the generalized newborn target and the existing target measurements. The two categories of measurements are independently used in the decomposed form of the PHD filter. Meanwhile, an amplitude feature is used to suppress the dense clutter. In addition, an MRFT jamming suppression algorithm is introduced to the filter. Target amplitude information and phase quantization information are jointly used to deal with MRFT jamming and the clutter by modifying the particle weights of the generalized newborn targets. Simulations demonstrate the proposed algorithm can obtain superior correct discrimination rate of MRFT, and high-accuracy tracking performance with high computational efficiency in the presence of MRFT jamming in the dense clutter.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247413","multi-range-false-target (MRFT) jamming;multi-target tracking (MTT);probability hypothesis density (PHD);target amplitude feature;gating strategy","Jamming;Clutter;Target tracking;Radar tracking;Pediatrics;Quantization (signal);Radio frequency","","27","","","","3 Nov 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Besides others, the computation of aerodynamic forces and torques is difficult. Usually, wind tunnel experimentation and potential flow theory are used for their calculations. However, the limitations of these methods pose difficulties in their accurate calculation. In this work, an online estimation scheme based on unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is proposed for their calculation. The proposed method introduces six auxiliary states for the complete aerodynamic model. UKF uses an extended model and provides an estimate of a complete state vector along with auxiliary states. The proposed method uses the minimum auxiliary state variables for the approximation of the complete aerodynamic model that makes it computationally less intensive. UKF estimation performance is evaluated by developing a nonlinear simulation environment for University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila (UETT) airship. Estimator performance is vali dated by performing the error analysis based on estimation error and 2-σ uncertainty bound. For the same problem, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is also implemented and its results are compared with UKF. The simulation results show that UKF successfully estimates the forces and torques due to the aerodynamic model with small estimation error and the comparative analysis with EKF shows that UKF improves the estimation results and also it is more suitable for the under-consideration problem.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316412","airship;unscented Kalman filter (UKF);extend Kalman filter (EKF);state estimation;aerodynamic model estimation","Atmospheric modeling;Aerodynamics;Mathematical model;Modeling;Estimation;Kalman filters;Computational modeling","","25","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The filter presented uses the MM method to accommodate the multiple motions that a maneuvering target may travel under by adding a random variable representing the motion model to the target state. To strengthen the efficiency performance of the filter, the target existence variable is separated from the target state and the existence probability is calculated in a more efficient way. To examine the performance of the MM based approach, a typical track-before-detect (TBD) scenario with a maneuvering target is used for simulations.

The SSLKF provides a highly accurate and fast estimation of grid frequency and the fundamental components (FCs) of the input signals. The Kalman filter is designed using an optimized filtering technique and intrinsic adaptive bandwidth architecture, and is easily integrated into a multiple model system. Therefore, the Kalman state estimator is fast and simple. The fundamental positive sequence components (FPSCs) of the grid voltages in a UPQC system are estimated via these SSLKF-FLL based filters. The estimation of reference signals for a UPQC controller is based on these FPSCs. Therefore, both active filters of a UPQC can perform one and more functions towards improving power quality in a distribution network. In addition to the SSLKF-FLL based algorithm, a bat optimization algorithm (based on the echolocation phenomenon of bats) is implemented to estimate the value of the proportional integral (PI) controller gains. The bat algorithm has a tendency to automatically zoom into a region where a promising alternative solution occurs, preventing the solution from becoming trapped in a local minima.

To solve this problem, we first dissect the principles and characteristics of LoRa physical layer. And it suggests that the capture effect among the signals with the same spreading factor (SF) and different SFs can be adequately leveraged to improve performance. Based on the capture effect, we develop a new receiver structure that enables the superposed LoRa signals with different odd/even SFs to be demodulated simultaneously. A suitable novel MAC protocol exploiting such concurrent transmissions is further presented.

As a result, spectrum efficiency improvement models based on spectrum sensing and sharing models have attracted a lot of research attention in recent years, including CR learning models, network densification architectures, and massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), and beamforming techniques. This paper provides a survey of recent CR spectrum efficiency improvement models and techniques, developed to support ultra-reliable low latency communications that are resilient to surges in traffic and competition for spectrum. These models and techniques, broadly speaking, enable a wide range of functionality ranging from enhanced mobile broadband to large scale Internet of Things (IoT) type communications. In addition and given the strong correlation between the typical size of a spectrum block and the achievable data rate, the models studied in this paper are applicable in ultra-high frequency band.

With this platform, large input data are divided into data partitions. Each data partition is processed by multiple computation tasks concurrently. Outputs of these computation tasks are transferred among multiple computers via the network. However, such a distributed computing framework suffers from system overheads, inevitably caused by communication and disk I/O operations. System overheads take up a large proportion of the Job Completion Time (JCT). We observed that excessive computational resources incurs considerable system overheads, prolonging the JCT. The over-allocation of individual jobs not only prolongs their own JCTs, but also likely makes other jobs suffer from under-allocation. Thus, the average JCT is suboptimal, too. To address this problem, we propose a prediction model to estimate the changing JCT of a single Spark job. With the support of the prediction method, we designed a heuristic algorithm to balance the resource allocation of multiple Spark jobs, aiming to minimize the average JCT in multiple-job cases. We implemented the prediction model and resource allocation method in ReB, a Resource-Balancer based on Apache Spark. Experimental results showed that ReB significantly outperformed the traditional max-min fairness and shortest-job-optimal methods.

In this paper, the distributed secondary regulation of frequency and voltage is implemented for model predictive-controlled (MPC) voltage source converters (VSCs) in an AC microgrid (MG). A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) provides inertia-emulation to reduce the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) that arises from sudden load changes. First, a small-signal stability analysis for parallel-connected VSG-based inverters in a MG is analyzed. Next, the secondary control of voltage and frequency in a distributed AC MG (with parallel-connected inertia-emulating VSCs) is realized. In addition, for the applied load changes in this study it is shown that the proposed control scheme effectively reduces the load change-induced ROCOF by up to 89% and also has very fast and accurate dynamic response that supports robust and rapid recovery from perturbations to MG stability.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2020.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316320","AC microgrid;inertia emulation;model predictive control;power converter;rate of change of freguecy (ROCOF);small­signal stability;virtual synchronous generator","Voltage control;Microgrids;Power system stability;Inverters;Frequency control;Power conversion;Emulation","","16","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

With the advent and proliferation of microgrids, however, these subjects need to be revisited as traditional philosophies are no longer sufficient to cope with reduced short circuit levels of distributed energy resources (DERs). A DER dominated microgrid will experience a limitation in the functionality of traditional overcurrent elements. This can degrade protection coordination and selectivity and requires a philosophy that is nonstandard in distribution systems. Furthermore, with most DERs operating as constant current sources and not naturally supplying ground current, performance grounding also becomes a fundamental problem of microgrids. Additional ground sources are required and must be appropriately sized for the needs of the microgrid. This paper proposes a practical protection and grounding scheme for an isolated microgrid that is being retrofitted with a large solar facility and a battery energy storage system (BESS). Much of the theory was developed tailored for this system and serves to reinforce the need for new philosophies that consider practical aspects of real systems.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2020.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9226055","Distributed energy resources;inverter-based generation;microgrids;power system protection;temporary overvoltage","Microgrids;Grounding;Generators;Distributed power generation;Power industry;Reliability","","16","","","","15 Oct 2020","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

Belief reliability is a new reliability metric that takes the impact of epistemic uncertainty into consideration and belief reliability distribution is fundamental to belief reliability application. This paper develops a new method called graduation formula to construct belief reliability distribution with limited observations. The developed method constructs the belief reliability distribution by determining the corresponding belief degrees of the observations. An algorithm is designed for the graduation formula as it is a set of transcendental equations, which is difficult to determine the analytical solution.

Firstly, based on the undirected graph theory, a new finite-time consensus protocol on the LOS direction is derived to guarantee relative distances reach consensus. And the value of acceleration command is positive, which is beneficial for engineering realization. Secondly, the acceleration command on the normal direction of the LOS is designed based on motion camouflage and finite-time convergence, which can ensure the missiles reach the target with the desired angle and satisfy the motion camouflage state.

Scalability and modularity come with the price of increased control complexity, compared to the other multilevel converter topologies, in a sense that the submodules within the converter have to maintain their voltage level around some predefined value. Intra-arm voltage balancing methods aim to equally distribute charge among the submodules within a single arm, whereas total energy content within each arm has to correspond to the reference value. While most of the literature explores control methods aiming to balance energies among the converter arms, this paper sets the theoretical foundation for the independent control of arm-energies, and presents generalized control concepts that can be applied for the purpose of arm energy control. Proposed control schemes aim to minimize the current stress imposed on the converter, offer easy implementation and be general in a sense of their application to different types of modular multilevel converters. Moreover, they are valid for both balanced and unbalanced grid conditions, as well as in case of failure of one or several submodules within an arm.

Three types of HF pumping experiments were carried out by the Russian team at EISCAT. The first type of experiments was related to the modification of the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling by HF pumping into the nightside ionosphere auroral E and F regions. The second type of experiments was concerned with investigations of geophysical phenomena by using the EISCAT HF heating facility and multi-instrument diagnostics. Most of the experiments were closely related to radio science and nonlinear plasma experiments (a third type of experiment). The main attention was paid to the investigation of artificial ionospheric turbulence in the upper ionosphere (F region) induced by the extraordinary (X-mode) HF pump waves. A great number of X-mode experiments, carried out by the Russian team at EISCAT, clearly demonstrated for the first time that an X-polarized HF pump wave was able to produce various HF-induced phenomena in the high-latitude ionospheric F region, which could be even much stronger than the O-mode effects. We found for the first time that the powerful X-mode HF radio waves, injected into the high-latitude ionospheric F2 layer towards the magnetic zenith, were capable of generating artificial field-aligned irregularities, radio-induced optical emissions in the red (630 nm) and green (557.7 nm) lines, strong electron acceleration leading to Ne enhancements, ion-acoustic and Langmuir electrostatic waves, and spectral components in the narrowband stimulated electromagnetic emission observed at a large distance from the HF heater.

During the training phase, subtarget features are extracted based on the template database, which is established through simulation or data acquisition, and the features are fed to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to obtain the classifier parameters. In the test phase, the weighted-MS algorithm is exploited to extract the HRRP of each subtarget. Then, the features of the subtarget HRRP are extracted and used as input in the SVM classifier to be recognized. Compared to the traditional group target recognition method, the proposed method has the advantages of requiring only a small amount of computation, setting parameters automatically, and having no requirement for target motion.

Relay selection performs especially well when the source node has accurate and timely Channel State Information (CSI). However, since perfect CSI knowledge is rarely available, research of relay selection with partial (statistical) CSI is of paramount importance. In this paper, relay selection for RA networks with statistical CSI is formulated as a Multiple-Decision (MD) problem. And, the cost of obtaining the CSI is also considered in the formulated problem. Two relay selection schemes, Maximal Selection Probability (MSP) and Maximal Spectrum Efficiency Expectation (MSEE), are proposed to solve the formulated MD problem under different optimal criteria assumptions based on the optimal stopping theory. The MSP scheme maximizes the probability that the Best Assisted Relay Candidate (BARC) can be selected, whereas the MSEE scheme provides the maximal expectation of the spectrum efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes effectively improve the spectrum efficiency, and the MSEE scheme is more suitable for stable communication cases. Meanwhile, the MSP scheme is more suitable for burst communication cases.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821522","Relay-Assisted (RA) network;relay selection;optimal stopping","Relays;Protocols;Probability;Wireless communication;Signal to noise ratio;Gaussian noise;Channel state information","","11","","","","2 Sep 2019","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Such measures facilitate comparing designs not only for rated conditions, but also allow to analyze their performance in the presence of unevitable tolerances. Consequently, by additionally considering reliability or robustness as objectives compared to conventional optimization scenarios, designs featuring low parameter sensitiveness can be obtained. The analysis of the design's reliability as part of solving optimization problems involves a significant increase in required numerical evaluations. To minimize the associated prolongation of the runtime, an approach featuring a design of experiments based reduction of required computations and a consequent surrogate modeling technique is presented here. After successful training, the metamodel can be applied for fast evaluating lots of different parameter combinations. A test problem is defined and analyzed. Based on the observed findings, the necessity of incorporating robustness evaluations to machine design optimization becomes evident. In addition, the derived models allow for studying the impact of any tolerance-affected parameter on the machine performance in detail.

Many of the published cross-range scaling algorithms are based on the fast Fourier transformation (FFT). However, the FFT technique is resolution limited, so that the FFT-based algorithms will fail in the rotation velocity (RV) estimation of the slow rotation target. In this paper, we propose an accurate cross-range scaling algorithm based on the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method. We first select some range bins with the mono-component linear frequency modulated (LFM) signal model. Then, we dechirp the signal of each selected range bin into the form of sinusoidal signal, and utilize the super-resolution MUSIC technique to accurately estimate the frequency. After processing all the range bins, a linear relationship related to the RV can be obtained. Eventually, the ISAR image can be scaled. The proposal can precisely estimate the small RV of the slow rotation target with low computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposal can also be used in the case of cross-range scaling for the sparse aperture data. Experimental results with the simulated and raw data validate the superiority of the novel method.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247417","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging;cross-range scaling;multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method;slow rotation target;sparse aperture","Estimation;Proposals;Multiple signal classification;Signal resolution;Radar imaging;Radar;Signal processing algorithms","","7","","","","3 Nov 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Contrast to lossy linear laser drivers, switched mode laser drivers can achieve higher efficiency. However, many challenges have been proposed, such as fast pulse edge, low current ripple. This paper proposes a multiphase interleaved pulse power supply with energy recovery and inductive storage (MIEF-PPS). The basic concept of the topology is the inclusion of a multiphase converter with pulse forming circuits to the converter system, which decouples the current slew rate and current ripple. Using an inductive storage technology and pulse forming circuits, a shorter pulse current rising time is obtained. The inductor energy is fed back to the input source not discharged to the load, resulting in a fast pulse trailing edge and energy saving. Thus the pulse current response observed when using this proposed technique is found to be much faster when compared to the conventional interleaved buck driver. Moreover, a pre-charge method is proposed to overcome the challenge of digitally controlling the inductive storage. The proposed topology was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and validated against the experimental results of a laboratory prototype, 360 W dual-interleaved pulsed power supply.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2020.00005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9062666","Energy recovery;fast response;multiphase interleaved;precharge control;pulse power supply","Inductors;Topology;Switches;Laser modes;Power supplies;Power lasers;Semiconductor lasers","","7","","","","13 Apr 2020","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

The strong impact interference caused by the large lateral thrust produced by the thrusters on the KKV is a main factor that affects the measurements on the LOS angle. A method to estimate the impact interference and the LOS rate together via a Kalman filter is proposed to improve the estimation precision of the LOS rate. The observability of the system describing the missile-target relative motion model and the impact interference model is proved, and then a Kalman filter is designed. In the Kalman filter design, the continuous-discrete and two-stage filtering techniques are used because the system model is time-variant and high-order. Numerical simulation results show that by estimating the impact interference, the estimation precision of the LOS rate is increased, and so the miss distance of the KKV under the strong impact interference is reduced. The proposed continuous-discrete two-stage Kalman filter shows higher estimation precision and lower computational cost than the naive discrete augmented state Kalman filter.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316407","guidance;impact interference;linear time-variant system;observability;continuous-discrete Kalman filter;two-stage Kalman filter","Interference;Kalman filters;Filtering;Missiles;Estimation;Modeling;Filtering algorithms","","6","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

In the case where two output ports are activated, the network is also able to control the phase relationship between the signals, enabling in-phase and 180°-out-of-phase signal configurations. To test the developed theory, a prototype in microstrip technology, designed to operate in the recently released sub-6 GHz 5G 3.4 GHz to 3.8 GHz band, was manufactured, confirming adequate behavior of the network. The proposed circuit was then connected to a four-element antenna cube where it was used to generate twelve different beams: eight equally-spaced beams over 360° with maximum gain in their broadside direction, which enabled a uniform coverage of the azimuthal plane, and four equally-spaced beams with nulls in their broadside direction, useful in applications such as interference removal and radio localization.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2020.9318432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318432","","Antenna radiation patterns;Butler matrices;Phase shifters;Antenna arrays;Switches;Array signal processing;Mathematical model","","6","","","","8 Jan 2021","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

Due to the low droop slope for the harmonic controller in DGs, traditional harmonic droop control methods can lead to significant harmonic sharing errors. Also, very limited work has been carried out in literature so far to identify the DGs' compensation priorities according to their locations and power rating. To address this issue, a novel priority-driven, droop-based, selective harmonic compensation scheme is developed in this work. The proposed control scheme improves the harmonic sharing accuracy. The compensation priority design and the way to integrate with droop control is studied. To ensure stability, a virtual impedance modelbased stability analysis is also discussed.

This can be solved by methods such as split-phase control, which was developed to address charge redistribution in Dickson SC converters by controlling the charging and discharging of the circuit's flying capacitors, such that the equivalent branch voltages line up when the circuit switches states. However, split-phase control is most effective at compensating for charge redistribution when all the circuit's flying capacitors are matched in capacitance value. Differences between the capacitance values of the circuit flying capacitors may result in split-phase control not being able to fully compensate for charge redistribution, due to the different charge/discharge rates of the flying capacitors. The work presented in this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the sensitivity of the split-phase Dickson converter to mismatches in flying capacitor values, as well as discussions regarding the design considerations and prototype test results of a split-phase Dickson converter for high-current loads.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2020.000028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316850","Switched-capacitor converter;Dickson converter;split-phase control;capacitor mismatch","Capacitors;Switches;Switching circuits;Equivalent circuits;Capacitance;Voltage control;Integrated circuit modeling","","4","","","","8 Jan 2021","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Based on the CM transformer, a new passive filter topology is proposed, this filter uses the coupling function of the CM transformer to suppress the CM voltage and the leakage inductance of the CM transformer as the DM filter inductor, which can effectively suppress the dv/dt values of the DM and CM voltages, it can also effectively reduce the RMS value of the CM voltage. In this paper, the winding method of CM transformer windings is improved, each winding is divided into two parts in series and distributed symmetrically on the iron core, which makes the leakage inductance and coupling coefficient between the windings of the transformer more symmetrical, which enhances the filtering effect.

First, given orbital parameters and a manoeuvre moment, the solution model of the landing footprint of a space-to-ground vehicle under finite thrust is established. Second, given arbitrary orbital parameters and an arbitrary manoeuvre moment, a fast computational model for the landing footprint of a space-to-ground vehicle based on BP neural networks is provided. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that under the premise of ensuring accuracy, the proposed method can quickly determine the landing footprint of a space-to-ground vehicle with arbitrary orbital parameters and arbitrary manoeuvre moments.

Recently, SNMR has been adapted to investigate also the shallow unsaturated zone with small surface loop setups. Due to the decreased volume, a pre-polarization (PP) field prior to the classical spin excitation is applied to enhance the measured response signal. Depending on the strength and orientation of the applied PP-field, the enhancement can often reach several orders of magnitude in the vicinity of the PP-loop. The theoretically achievable enhancement depends on the assumption of an adiabatic, that is perfect, switch-off of the corresponding PP-field. To study the effect of imperfect switch-off, we incorporate full spin dynamics simulations into the SNMR forward modelling. The affected subsurface volume strongly depends on the chosen PP switch-off ramp and the geometry of the loop setup. Due to the imperfect switch-off, the resulting SNMR sounding curves can have significantly decreased signal amplitudes. For comparison, the signal amplitudes of either a 1 ms exponential or linear switch-off ramp are reduced by 17 and 65 per cent, respectively. Disregarding this effect would therefore yield an underestimation of the corresponding subsurface water content of similar magnitude.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267553","Hydrogeophysics;Electromagnetic theory;Numerical modelling","","","4","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

One approach for estimating the crustal stress field is based on the focal mechanisms of earthquakes. This study investigated the focal mechanisms of approximately 110 000 microearthquakes in the area of the Japanese islands that occurred at a depth shallower than 20 km, based on the first-motion polarities picked by a simple neural network model. The model was first trained using a data set of mainly moderate to large earthquakes throughout Japan. Following on, the model was re-trained using a data set of microearthquakes in two regions of Japan. The threshold of the confidence score from the neural network model was chosen to maximize the overall quality of the focal mechanism solutions. The P- and T-axes of the numerous focal mechanism solutions provided more detailed distributions of the crustal stress field. For example, in the Chugoku region, small differences were observed in the trend of P-axes azimuths between the northern and southern areas, spatially corresponding to geodetic observations. The results of this study are useful for revealing the crustal stress field, and, as such, for assessing past and current tectonic activities and potential future earthquake generation.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267749","Japan;Neural networks, fuzzy logic;Earthquake source observations;Seismicity and tectonics","","","3","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Given that production decisions are made based on accessible market capacity, we explain how a company enters the market, and we draw an evolutionary path of the optimal company size. The results show that in the early expansion stage of accessible market capacity, a firm's optimal size keeps increasing; after reaching a peak, the change in a firm's optimal size depends on its cost management. When the accessible market capacity reaches a threshold, the firm will no longer be in the market, and may no longer exist.

Furthermore, the ongoing digitalisation allows an efficient controlling of the flexibility of these appliances. These developments make detailed investigations of the future electricity demand and flexibility potentials of private households inevitable. For this purpose, a Bottom-Up simulation method has been developed and is presented in this study. Using time use data of household members, activity profiles are derived based on a time-dependent Markov-chain model. Based on these activity profiles, different submodels for the simulation of electric appliances, lighting, heating and electric vehicles are used.

Under the current paradigm, DER hosting capacity can be limited or costly grid upgrades may be required due to potential, but infrequent, worst-case conditions. DER management systems (DERMS) can enable additional DER to be interconnected as a managed resource that is curtailed to avoid violations under the infrequent worst-case conditions. This scheme, referred to as flexible interconnection, allows the interconnection of more DER while resulting in a minimal reduction in productivity to DER owners. This study assesses the techno-economic value of flexible interconnection for PV enabled by DERMS through detailed modelling and analysis of a real North American distribution feeder. It focuses on using DERMS to avoid distribution system upgrades due to thermal overloads and illustrates the economic value of a flexible interconnection arrangement across a range of PV system capacities. Findings indicate that the value of a flexible interconnection arrangement diminishes for PV systems with larger DC/AC ratios and as interconnected PV capacity increases, given increased amounts of curtailment.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583062","","","","1","","5","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This study presents an analytical methodology to evaluate the network impact of EV growth and the effectiveness of smart EV charging solutions. The process uses digital resources to forecast potential EV growth on the network and creates network models. These low voltage and high voltage models, with EV growth applied, are then analysed to ensure demand growth is maintained within hosting capacity in line with DNO policy. Where hosting capacity is exceeded, reinforcement options are appraised to satisfy escalating levels of constraint exceedance. Finally, smart EV charging solutions are defined and evaluated as options to mitigate reinforcement requirements. The outputs from the presented analytical process provide valuable input to DNO long-term planning and cost–benefit analysis over discrete time horizons.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582920","","","","1","","3","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In the simulation, the fitness of an entity is measured by a series of one-on-one competitions in the Immigration Game, a two-player variation of Conway's Game of Life. Mutation, reproduction, and symbiosis are implemented as operations that are external to the Immigration Game. Because these operations are external to the game, we can freely manipulate the operations and observe the effects of the manipulations. The simulation is composed of four layers, each layer building on the previous layer. The first layer implements a simple form of asexual reproduction, the second layer introduces a more sophisticated form of asexual reproduction, the third layer adds sexual reproduction, and the fourth layer adds symbiosis. The experiments show that a small amount of symbiosis, added to the other layers, significantly increases the fitness of the population.

This study discusses the additional considerations and analytics that distribution planners need to perform at various stages of the general distribution planning process when considering ES as an NWA for distribution capacity. These discussions are related to defining the planning criteria and inputs, assessing the distribution system capacity needs, designing the ES NWA solution, stacked services, and economic comparison of ES NWA designs and conventional distribution capacity solutions. Streamlining the use of planning resources with the aid of screening criteria and methods is also discussed.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583116","","","","1","","3","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This consequently reduces connections, maintenance and operation costs for the customers. The development of intelligence at the field devices is key to the safe operation of the network and management of customer's connections. In view of that, the UK Power Networks has designed, developed and trialled a remote terminal unit (RTU) logic with fail-to-safe that integrates with the centralised smart applications and the distributed controllable devices. Therefore, customers will not only be controlled by a centralised system but also locally by an on-site RTU, which acts as a smart communication gateway with embedded intelligence to execute failsafe actions locally. These fail-to-safes are particularly important in the absence of a central control system which can then reduce the unnecessary curtailment of generators by introducing additional time and safe operating limits for them to export the power to the grid.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582996","","","","1","","2","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"
"Application of IEC 61850 standard to the integration of DER with the electricity network","D.

Jemena, a distribution network service provider (DNSP) in the state of Victoria, Australia has been progressing on the adoption of this standard since the early 2010s. Although penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in Jemena electricity network is at relatively lower levels as compared to some other utilities, Jemena acknowledged the need for integrating the larger sized DERs. This study focuses on an IEC 61850 standard based solution implementation wherein intelligent electronic devices at Jemena and DER ends were set up to exchange generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) information. The use of the IEC 61850 standard at the substation provides a future proof platform for the DNSPs to integrate DERs with the overall protection and control scheme of the electricity network. This application further establishes the IEC 61850 standard as a future-proof enabler of the smart grid that consists of the DER-integrated agile power system. More importantly, such implementations set the tone for evolving roles of DSOs as active, real-time managers of a flexible, resilient grid based on real-time visibility of the DERs' domain.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582998","","","","1","","8","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In Helsinki, Finland, the EV penetration has risen rapidly during the past years. In addition to home charging, charging at working places is an appealing option. In this research, models of EV charging in office buildings were created and loadings at the metering point were analysed. Uncontrolled EV charging may result in undesirable high demands of power. For the customer, this means a higher distribution price payment if the grid tariff includes a price component based on a monthly peak power. For the distribution system operator, the grid experiences higher loadings and losses. Additionally, investments in new network capacity may be needed. A smart charging scheme can be effectively utilised in order to reduce peak powers. The case study is a real office with eight EV charging points and an office-scale battery energy storage system (BESS). In this demonstration case, the BESS's peak shaving application was also successfully applied to cut the increased power demands.

There is a general consensus that in this context, a high share of renewable power generation will be photovoltaic- and wind-based. This has two implications for the power market functioning: (i) the energy system becomes necessarily more decentralised while current markets, based on a zonal representation of the transmission network, are not able to capture this dimension. This study provides an overview on key choices to be made when designing local markets. (ii) Also the study raises the question whether markets dominated by intermittent renewable energy source can be organised in a decentral way (current reference in European power markets) or whether some level of centralisation (as typically in most of US markets) is required to coordinate market and network operation.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583130","","","","1","","9","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, for high-resolution aerial images, there are usually problems such as long time, mismatching and sparse feature pairs using traditional algorithms. Therefore, an algorithm is proposed to realize fast, accurate and dense feature matching. The algorithm consists of four steps. Firstly, we achieve a balance between the feature matching time and the number of matching pairs by appropriately reducing the image resolution. Secondly, to realize further screening of the mismatches, a feature screening algorithm based on similarity judgment or local optimization is proposed. Thirdly, to make the algorithm more widely applicable, we combine the results of different algorithms to get dense results. Finally, all matching feature pairs in the low-resolution images are restored to the original images. Comparisons between the original algorithms and our algorithm show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the matching time, screen out the mismatches, and improve the number of matches.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316395","feature matching;feature screening;feature fusion;aerial image;three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Image resolution;Transforms;Image restoration;Systems engineering and theory;Software","","1","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

However, integration of TSCAOI configured 3-phase cage induction machines into single-phase distributed power systems is yet to be investigated. This paper therefore presents a model to investigate the behaviour of grid-connected TSCAOI generator systems and proposes a control strategy to regulate the amount of electricity generation at unity power factor under different operating conditions. Additionally, for further simplifying the overall system, a slip estimation method is proposed to enable the speed-sensorless operation of the generator. In order to validate the system feasibility, a prototype grid-connected TSCAOI generator is to be regulated, with balanced operation, to generate electricity to the grid at unity power factor. Good agreement between theoretical and experimental results under various operating conditions indicates that the generator can be successfully regulated by the proposed control scheme and are expected to be suitable for applications, such as small-scale wind and micro-hydro distributed generation systems.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2020.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316323","Grid-connected mode;renewable energy conver­sion;small-scale induction generator","Generators;Windings;Voltage control;Fossil fuels;Distributed power generation;Reactive power;Steady-state","","1","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

This evolutionary inversion rests on a reinterpretation of stochastic Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS), which randomly exploits redundancies to achieve convergence without ever considering the data set as a whole. Specifically for seismological applications, we consider a dynamic mini-batch stochastic L-BFGS, where the size of mini-batches adapts to the number of sources needed to approximate the complete gradient. As an illustration we present an evolutionary FWI for upper-mantle structure beneath Africa. Starting from a 1-D model and data recorded until 1995, we sequentially add contemporary data into an ongoing inversion, showing how (i) new events can be added without compromising convergence, (ii) a consistent measure of misfit can be maintained and (iii) the model evolves over times as a function of data coverage. Though applied retrospectively in this example, our method constitutes a possible approach to the continuous assimilation of seismic data volumes that often tend to grow exponentially.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9339569","Inverse theory;Waveform inversion;Computational seismology;Seismic tomography","","","1","","","","28 Jan 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Traditional syntactic means of ensuring conservativity, like definitional extensions or positive occurrences guaranteeing exsitence of fixed points, emerge as special cases.","1368-9894","","10.1093/jigpal/jzaa054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716982","first-order logic;conservative extension;graph normal form;digraph kernel;kernel semantics","","","","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

DSO acquires a huge amount of data from smart meters and section switches with voltage and current sensors. We have developed the improvement method for voltage regulators by using these sensor data. The developed method improves an estimation function of SVR and accurately regulates voltages in the power distribution system by using the sensor data. However, the estimation function for the voltage regulation requires a heavy calculation load by applying a huge amount of sensor data. Extraction method for the enormous data is necessary to reduce the calculation load and eliminate unnecessary data. We have developed the extraction method based on clustering method and Cluster Validity Index (CVI). The proposed method divides all the sensor data to plural clusters considering each specification of data such as heavy load, light load, etc. Optimum cluster number is automatically determined by CVI evaluating clusters. We verified that the proposed method extracted the efficient data for the voltage regulation from sensor data. The proposed method significantly reduced the constructed data of the database compared with the ideal method.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582921","","","","","","3","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, co-ordinated operation of flexible devices results in coincident changes in demand on adjacent low-voltage (LV) networks, and can therefore lead to a coupling of voltages between circuits. In this work, water heating temporal flexibility and space heating vector flexibility (from hybrid gas–electric heat pumps) are enabled across a network service area, and the voltage changes measured using the proposed ‘flexibility voltage modulation’ index. It is demonstrated that integrated medium-voltage (MV)–LV modelling increases the mean voltage modulation threefold and the variance of the voltage modulation by 70% when compared to results from an isolated LV model. The work, therefore, demonstrates the crucial role of MV networks in LV circuit simulation.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582885","","","","","","8","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Journal of Petrology 59, 881–900]. The new model is better able to predict the phase relations and melting of ultramafic rocks, in particular the abundance of orthopyroxene in the residue and the concentration of silica in the melt. In addition, improvements in modelling Cr-spinels mean that the model is now able to reproduce Cr-content of garnet and spinel above and below the solidus without modification to the knorringite free energy. Model calculations indicate that, for peridotite composition KR4003, the spinel to garnet transition intersects the solidus at 22·1–24·8 kbar and orthopyroxene disappears from the solidus at 29·1 kbar. Below the solidus, the model is able to reproduce the abundances and compositions of phases in experimental studies and natural samples spanning a range of compositions, allowing it to be used for investigating subsolidus equilibration during mantle cooling and pressurisation/decompression. The liquid model provides a good fit to experimental data and is able to replicate the position of the solidus and the composition of both melt and residue at and above the solidus for a range of peridotite compositions. The model may, therefore, be used to investigate fractional mantle melting and basalt generation in modern geodynamic regimes, and also to explore equilibrium mantle melting in the early Earth. The model can also be used to explore liquid and residue compositions for melting of non-pyrolitic mantle, for which there is a paucity of experimental data. We demonstrate the scope of the model using two case studies investigating the subsolidus evolution and melting of a silica-rich cratonic peridotite from the Kaapvaal craton.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egab012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9432983","modelling;peridotite;mantle;phase equilibria;basalt","","","","","","","17 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this work, a novel event-triggered D-PMU-based frequency controller is proposed to amend this limitation. The proposed controller is able to meaningfully reduce communication network usage, allowing D-PMU monitoring applicability in networks with a large number of DERs.

The FLMP algorithm is not complex but does not utilise a horizon with information on future consumption and generation. This study demonstrates a performance comparison between the FLMP and Horizon Marginal Pricing (HMP) algorithm. HMP is an algorithm that combines the simplicity of the FLMP algorithm with the time horizon possibilities of the RHC algorithm. The HMP algorithm uses the predicted generation profile to adjust the bid curves, such that consumption shifts to moments with more renewable generation available. Simulations are carried out to compare the performance between the HMP and FLMP algorithms. The results show comparable performance between the FLMP and HMP, whereas the FLMP computes the simulation faster and requires less bandwidth.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582889","","","","","","6","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

We show that such cost functions can be cast as a variational bound on model evidence under an implicit generative model. Using generative models based on partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDP), we show that neural activity and plasticity perform Bayesian inference and learning, respectively, by maximizing model evidence. Using mathematical and numerical analyses, we establish the formal equivalence between neural network cost functions and variational free energy under some prior beliefs about latent states that generate inputs. These prior beliefs are determined by particular constants (e.g., thresholds) that define the cost function. This means that the Bayes optimal encoding of latent or hidden states is achieved when the network's implicit priors match the process that generates its inputs. This equivalence is potentially important because it suggests that any hyperparameter of a neural network can itself be optimized—by minimization with respect to variational free energy. Furthermore, it enables one to characterize a neural network formally, in terms of its prior beliefs.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco_a_01315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234794","","","","","","","Open Access","21 Oct 2020","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In the literature, the different approaches to abstract argumentation that were refined over the years are typically evaluated from a formal logics perspective; an analysis that is based on models of economically rational decision-making does not exist. In this paper, we work towards addressing this issue by analysing abstract argumentation from the perspective of the rational man paradigm in microeconomic theory. To assess under which conditions abstract argumentation-based decision-making can be considered economically rational, we derive reference independence as a non-monotonic inference property from a formal model of economic rationality and create a new argumentation principle that ensures compliance with this property. We then compare the reference independence principle with other reasoning principles, in particular with cautious monotony and rational monotony. We show that the argumentation semantics as proposed in Dung’s seminal paper, as well as other semantics we evaluate, with the exception of naive semantics and the SCC-recursive CF2 semantics, violate the reference independence principle. Consequently, we investigate how structural properties of argumentation frameworks impact the reference independence principle and identify cyclic expansions (both even and odd cycles) as the root of the problem. Finally, we put reference independence into the context of preference-based argumentation and show that for this argumentation variant, which explicitly models preferences, reference independence cannot be ensured in a straight-forward manner.","1465-363X","","10.1093/logcom/exab003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426557","formal argumentation;economic rationality;non-monotonic reasoning","","","","","","","7 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A load of low-voltage grids is strongly asymmetrical due to the inherent system. This reduces their transmission capacity. Single-phase and two-phase charging electric vehicles significantly exacerbate this situation. The optimum distribution of such asymmetrical charging processes, on the other hand, can even increase the transmission capacity of low-voltage grids. The network expansion can be minimised without there being any restrictions for customers due to power restrictions or shutdown times. A field test has already demonstrated the effectiveness of the method and technology to use asymmetric charging for network balancing.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583089","","","","","","4","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

EV charging could be autonomous, be subject to remote demand-side response (DSR) control or be managed by a local system sensing LV loads. EV types included mixes of dumb, Smart and Smart vehicle to grid, with charger disconnectors to halt overloads. Autonomous EV charging caused LV overloads, exacerbated by remote DSR. The local manager reduced overloads, eliminated when using disconnectors. EVs experienced raised kWh consumption in Winter and a noticeable increase in destination charging.

For this purpose, coupled PV-ESS residential storage systems were developed in six European Mediterranean countries, through the EU StoRES project. In Sardinia (Italy), 13 pilots have been selected for the implementation of ESS, which consists of typical residential premises with existing rooftop PV systems under the net-metering scheme. The aim of this study is to provide the technical and economic assessment of the coupled PV-ESS systems, based on real data measured within the StoRES project monitoring phase (1 year). The analysis is supported by well-established indicators, employed to quantify the variation of the prosumer's electrical behaviour due to the integration of the electrical storage. Other outputs related to roundtrip efficiency shed light on battery real field operation.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582929","","","","","","5","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

These traditions include Cambridge school's mathematical physics, Göttingen's mathematical physics, laboratory-based experimental physics, and Humboldtian-style terrestrial physics.

The authors present a steering technology which was developed further in the scope of the research consortium WindNODE, promoted by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in the scope of the ‘Smart Energy Showcase’ (SINTEG). The new steering tool facilitates high data safety and security and can be reached via radio communication as well as via the controllable loads channel of the smart meters. The authors present the challenges and success factors when integrating the flexibility into the system and focus on how to coordinate the signals of market players such as network operators and energy suppliers. This is a complex task because the behaviour of one specific customer must be taken into account as well as the aggregated effects of groups of customers when evaluating if signals are critical for the network.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582968","","","","","","7","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

More renewable energy will be seen in future power grids. Power electronic converters, as the intermediate stage, are of importance and they are becoming more active in grid regulations, and now are more being integrated with energy storage devices. This leads to and requires grid-friendly power conversion. Design, operation, and control of such grid-friendly power converters are imperative to reduce the cost of energy by addressing the efficiency, reliability, and stability issues in power systems with a high penetration of power electronics. As expected, more power electronics are being used in modern energy conversion along with the development of emerging power semiconductors, control and communication technologies, and data storage, and driven by the demand of environmental-friendly and sustainable energy paradigms. Power electronics enable efficient and flexible power conversion in de-carbonization. However, the ""digitalized"" power conversion with fast dynamics imposes challenges to the conventional grid. It thus calls for grid-friendly power electronic converters underpinned by advanced control. Hence, we organized this Special Issue on Grid-Friendly Power Converter Systems to bring together researchers and experts from both power electronics and power systems communities to tackle the technological challenges in future ultracomplex power systems with more power electronic devices.","2475-742X","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316316","","Power electronics;Renewable energy sources;Power system stability;State of charge;Special issues and sections;Frequency conversion;Stability analysis","","","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

In March 2013, Nicole visited a workshop at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna, 120 km north of the polar circle, for five days. To her disappointment, the magnetometer lines were very straight, indicating no geomagnetic activity. However, late on the last night, a faint green auroral arc started to drift from the northern sky and intensify. We saw this from a car and had to stop. I remember Nicole standing there with the aurora as background in her very elegant long stocking cap in the −20° C cold to follow all the substorm phases forever. Fortunately, the rest of us could stay indoors, but felt worried about her.

"Seismic event coda-correlation's formation: implications for global seismology","S. Wang; H. Tkalčić","Research School of Earth Sciences, The Australian National University, Canberra 2601, Australia; sheng.wang@anu.edu.au; Research School of Earth Sciences, The Australian National University, Canberra 2601, Australia",Geophysical Journal International,"23 Nov 2020","2020","222","1","1283","1294","The seismic-event-coda correlograms are characterized by many prominent features, which, if understood thoroughly, could supply valuable information on the internal structure of the Earth. To further refine our knowledge and be able to utilize that information, all-embracing comprehension of coda-correlation's formation apart from a conjecture, is a pre-requisite. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis that aims at a quantitative ‘dissection’ of the formation mechanism of coda correlation. Our analysis presents relevant implications for global seismology. We demonstrate that coda correlation is dominated by a few contributions, most of which arise from the late-coda time window, 3 hr after the earthquake origin time. Our identification analysis confirms that the contributions are cross-terms between body waves. That represents an observational proof of the conjecture that coda-correlation features are formed due to body waves arriving at a pair of receivers with the same slowness. We further quantify the relationship between body-wave cross-terms and event-receiver geometries and Earth structure, which has significant practical implications. Our analysis demonstrates that body-wave cross-terms that contribute to the same coda-correlation feature sample the Earth along fundamentally different paths. They are significantly different depending on event locations, although the resulting time variation is quite small if the late coda (e.g. 3–9 hr after event origin time) is used. That explains why the late coda is more effective than an earlier time window in producing relatively stable features, as empirically suggested by previous studies. Our study enables quantitative and practical understanding of coda-correlation features in terms of their formation progress, and this opens a way to distill valuable information about Earth structure from coda correlation.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267587","Body waves;Coda waves;Seismic interferometry","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To deal with uncertainties in the generation planning of an urban microgrid, this study presents a storage control strategy for reserve provision in a multi-objective scenario-based stochastic optimisation algorithm. Power reserve allocation is optimised while uncertainties from renewable energy and load demand are taken into account. Results confirm that the presented algorithm ensures that storage-hybridised RESs contribute to the primary source of reserve capacity, and the performance in terms of security level is highlighted.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582941","","","","","","7","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Traditionally, network planning ensured that the future system would meet reliability standards based on meeting peak demand, with the assumption that all other demand scenarios will therefore be satisfied. However, given the magnitude and uncertainty of changes to network power flows due to decarbonisation, this method may not always be the best approach in the future. To meet evolving customer needs, distribution network operators (DNOs) are developing smarter, more flexible network solutions to help mitigate the need for traditional reinforcement and reduce costs for the customers. This includes the use of third-party flexibility services to help manage distribution power flows. This study outlines the process adopted by SP Energy Networks, a UK DNO, to assess flexibility services as an alternative to traditional network reinforcements.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582976","","","","","","5","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Over the years, the potential of this technique has been mainly investigated for wind scatterometry and sea-surface altimetry, resulting in mission concepts and prototypes currently in orbit or under study. More recently, the potential of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has attracted significant scientific and industrial interest, especially for land applications. The possibility of retrieving soil moisture and vegetation biomass by means of GNSS reflections, originally demonstrated through theoretical models and simulations, has been confirmed through the analysis of ground-based and airborne measurements. Even if these campaigns significantly contributed to consolidating the physics that is behind the interaction between navigation signals and some important geophysical parameters of the illuminated surface, a complete understanding of the experiments still needs further scientific efforts, especially for satellite observations. In this work, we review the main progress that has recently been made at two universities of Rome, Sapienza and Tor Vergata, as well as by some other research groups. Current challenges and modeling approaches are summarized, focusing the attention on the potential offered by GNSS reflectometry with respect to more established passive and active remote-sensing techniques.

But the fraction of stars in stellar multiples as a function of mass, their likely initial periods and distribution of mass ratios are all known empirically from observations only in the local Universe. Each has associated uncertainties. We explore the impact of these uncertainties in binary parameters on the properties of integrated stellar populations, considering which properties and time-scales are most susceptible to uncertainty introduced by binary fractions and whether observations of the integrated light might be sufficient to determine binary parameters. We conclude that the effects of uncertainty in the empirical binary parameter distributions are likely smaller than those introduced by metallicity and stellar population age uncertainties for observational data. We identify emission in the He II 1640 Å emission line and continuum colour in the ultraviolet–optical as potential indicators of a high-mass binary presence, although poorly constrained metallicity, dust extinction, and degeneracies in plausible star formation history are likely to swamp any measurable signal.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/staa1166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267491","methods: numerical;binaries: general;stars: evolution;galaxies: stellar content","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Based on transient thermal modeling we conclude that the accelerated gas activity can be explained assuming that the active area fraction near the south pole is increased.

The authors consider the Sustainable Powering of Off-grid REgions (SPORE) microgrid which encompasses Singapore's largest wind turbine, photovoltaic panels, batteries and a power-to-power hydrogen system for powering fuel cell electric vehicles. To achieve a higher efficiency of the energy system and increase the interaction between different energy carriers, ENGIE Lab Crigen has developed an optimisation model for multifluid microgrids operating in island mode. Operational objectives are to minimise the net operating cost of the microgrid while satisfying the demand in electricity and hydrogen and enhancing the flexibility in terms of power supply. Nonlinear dispatch models are linearised to fit the mixed-integer linear programming framework used for higher computational efficiency. To assess the validity of the multifluid optimisation and show efficient interactions between electricity, hydrogen and transportation, standard operating scenarios have been simulated, allowing a day-ahead energy planning.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582912","","","","","","4","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The most convenient way to include normal mode constraints in global tomographic models is by using splitting functions or structure coefficients, which describe how the frequency of a specific mode varies regionally. Splitting functions constrain 3-D variations in velocity, density structure and boundary topography. They may also constrain anisotropy, especially when combining information from spheroidal modes, which are mainly sensitive to P–SV structure, with toroidal modes, mainly sensitive to SH structure. Spheroidal modes have been measured extensively, but toroidal modes have proven to be much more difficult and as a result only a limited number of toroidal modes have been measured so far. Here, we expand previous splitting function studies, by focusing specifically on toroidal-mode overtone observations. We present splitting function measurements for 19 self-coupled toroidal modes of which 13 modes have not been measured before. They are derived from radial and transverse horizontal component normal mode spectra up to 5 mHz for 91 events with MW ≥ 7.4 from the years 1983–2018. Our data include the Tohoku event of 2011 (9.1MW), the Okhotsk event of 2013 (8.3MW) and the Fiji Island event from 2018 (8.2MW). Our measurements provide new constraints on upper- and lower-mantle shear wave velocity structure and in combination with existing spheroidal mode measurements can be used in future inversions for anisotropic mantle structure. Our new splitting function coefficient data set will be available online.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9434260","Mantle processes;Seismic anisotropy;Seismic tomography;Surface waves and free oscillations","","","","","","","18 May 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This study presents the results of studies investigating the impact of using DER reactive power services on distribution network losses. By using year-round optimal power flow analysis, a spectrum of studies on a number of distribution network areas in the southeast of Great Britain was performed to calculate distribution losses under different control scenarios. The studies demonstrate that the use of DERs to provide reactive services to the transmission system may increase distribution network losses. On the other hand, DER reactive services can also be optimised to minimise distribution losses. The studies also analysed the impact of optimising tap changing transformer settings on the distribution network losses reduction.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583110","","","","","","5","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

"Gaussian Width Bounds with Applications to Arithmetic Progressions in Random Settings","J. Briët; S.

The point sets are formed by the image of the $n$-dimensional Boolean hypercube under a mapping $\psi :\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^k$, where each coordinate is a constant-degree multilinear polynomial with 0-1 coefficients. We show the following applications of our bounds. Let $[\mathbb{Z}/N\,\mathbb{Z}]_p$ be the random subset of $\mathbb{Z}/N\,\mathbb{Z}$ containing each element independently with probability $p$. $1) $ A set $D\subseteq \mathbb{Z}/N\,\mathbb{Z}$ is $\ell $-intersective if any dense subset of $\mathbb{Z}/N\,\mathbb{Z}$ contains a proper $(\ell +1)$-term arithmetic progression with common difference in $D$. Our main result implies that $[\mathbb{Z}/N\,\mathbb{Z}]_p$ is $\ell $-intersective with probability $1 - o(1)$ provided $p \geq \omega (N^{-\beta _\ell }\log N)$ for $\beta _\ell = (\lceil (\ell +1)/2\rceil )^{-1}$. This gives a polynomial improvement for all $\ell \ge 2$ of a previous bound due to Frantzikinakis, Lesigne, and Wierdl, and reproves more directly the same improvement shown recently by the authors and Dvir (here we avoid the theories of locally decodable codes and quantum information). $2) $ Let $X_k$ be the number of $k$-term arithmetic progressions in $[\mathbb{Z}/N\,\mathbb{Z}]_p$ and consider the large deviation rate $\rho _k(\delta ) = \log \textrm{ Pr}[\,X_k \geq (1+\delta )\mathbb{E}X_k\,]$. We give quadratic improvements of the best-known range of $p$ for which a highly precise estimate of $\rho _k(\delta )$ due to Bhattacharya, Ganguly, Shao, and Zhao is valid for all odd $k \geq 5$. In particular, the estimate holds if $p \geq \omega (N^{-c_k}\log N)$ for $c_k = (6k\lceil (k-1)/2\rceil )^{-1}$. We also discuss connections with the above-mentioned error correcting codes (locally decodable codes) and the Banach-space notion of type for injective tensor products of $\ell _p$-spaces.","1687-0247","","10.1093/imrn/rny238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519263","","","","","","","","19 Aug 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Given a grid of nanoparticles, the general aim is to reach a configuration by keeping/deleting nanoparticles such that the final structure operates as desired. In the case of nano-optical couplers, the designed configurations provide efficient transmission of electromagnetic waves through sharp bends and corners, while they also allow for diverse transmission options at junctions. Despite their geometric simplicity, such couplers can hence enable the construction of complex nano-optical networks. In the case of nano-arrays, similar nanoparticle configurations are used for beam shaping, particularly to obtain directional radiation from isotropic sources. On the other hand, in all these cases easy-to-define geometrical properties and design specifications turn out to be remarkably challenging computational problems. Using surface integral equations, the numbers of unknowns can be maintained at reasonable levels; however, large numbers of possible configurations make it impossible to test each candidate design to find the best design. For this reason, an in-house implementation of genetic algorithms was used in [1–3] to limit the number of simulations, while reaching satisfactory results. It was shown that successful coupler and array designs can be obtained via several thousands (instead of billions) of trials per optimization.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2020.9240102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9240102","","Optimization;Couplers;Density measurement;Power system measurements;Nanoparticles;Genetic algorithms","","","","","","26 Oct 2020","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

Moreover, the two interfaces are initiated at different locations. In addition, the thermal and mechanical problems are found to decouple and it is possible to solve the first ahead of the second.

With the existing network infrastructure, there are minimal to no measurements available in the distribution grid which help the DSOs to control the network in real-time. Owing to this lack of availability of distributed measurements, with the huge integration of RESs, the day-to-day operation becomes more arduous for the DSOs. The project i-Automate deals with creating a unified platform for the provision of protection and control options in the distribution network. The platform chosen for the implementation of these functions is a power quality measurement device. These measurement devices are distributed across the electrical network. The devices communicate with a central master device, located at the central substation with which the DSO gets the overall network state in real-time. The optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm is also one such algorithm implemented on the device. This study focuses on the OPF implementation on the hardware device and the experimental verification of the implemented algorithm on a real-time simulator in a hardware-in-the-loop setup.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582990","","","","","","8","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This has been achieved by diversifying the energy mix through the deployment of large volumes of distributed renewable generation. The reducing reliance on large conventional generation has led to reduced inertia on the electricity system with the result that the transmission system operator (TSO) is required to procure large volumes of ancillary services to maintain system stability in the event of a grid disturbance. The TSO achieves this through the operation of a central system services market for flexibility resources connected both at the transmission and distribution networks. Many distributed energy resources (DERs) that are connected to the Northern Ireland Electricity Networks distribution system are participating in this market, but the coordinated response of multiple DERs to a system event has the potential to adversely impact the wider customer base connected to the distribution system. This study describes how a solution has been developed to ensure that distribution network constraints are considered and the safety, security and quality of supply of the distribution network customers are safeguarded, while at the same time embracing flexibility resources to support the whole system","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583041","","","","","","7","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

We also show that any $T_g$ operator that can be approximated in the operator norm by an operator $T_h$ with bounded symbol $h$ is quasi-nilpotent. In the converse direction, we establish an equivalent condition for the function $g \in \textbf{BMOA}$ to be in the $\textbf{BMOA}$ norm closure of $H^{\infty }$. This condition turns out to be equivalent to quasi-nilpotency of the operator $T_g$ on the Hardy spaces.

The MADE Project unlocks this potential by controlling low carbon technologies in a fully optimised way that balances the needs of the consumer and the energy networks. MADE is a UK Network Innovation Allowance (NIA) project partnering Western Power Distribution, PassivSystems, Delta-EE, Everoze and Imperial College. The project has modelled and tested at a small scale (5 homes), the impact of predictive demand control technology provided by PassivSystems, on coordinated domestic Electric Vehicle (EV) charging with hybrid heat pumps (HHP, air-source heat pumps supplemented with domestic gas boilers), solar photovoltaic (PV) generation and storage. The project has explored advanced strategies for exploiting demand flexibility to create new value propositions and manage peak load. Householder trust is a prerequisite for the success of new technologies and business models; trialists will be provided with tools to understand the operation of the hybrid heat pump and manage their heating bills.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583006","","","","","","4","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Virtual power plants (VPPs) are trying to improve their forecasting technologies for managing this risk and increasing their expected profit. However, in this study, the authors would choose another approach to reduce the risk. To minimise the variance of a sum of outputs of all distributed renewable energy resources (DRESs), the covariance between the output of each DRES should be minimised. This covariance depends on the correlation between the outputs of DRESs. If the DRESs in the same area are aggregated as a single VPP unit, the correlation would be high and the variance of the VPP will be large, accordingly. On the other hand, if the DRESs in separated regions are collected as one VPP unit, the correlation between DRESs and the variance of the VPP may be smaller than in the former case. Using this feature, in this study, the authors would find the optimal combinations of VPP compositions with a minimum weighted average of variance of m VPP units among N DRESs based on historical output data.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582847","","","","","","5","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The increasing number of distributed generators results in new constrains on the distribution systems and traditionally would have resulted in the installation of more network infrastructure. This project investigates the potential to control the reactive power of existing generators within the distribution network to increase the available capacity for new connections as a potential flexibility service. This study presents a potential service using an optimisation algorithm to determine the optimum generator reactive power to reduce either voltage, reactive power flow or a combination of both. The optimisation algorithm makes use of a particle swarm optimisation to test multiple different reactive power set-points and find the global optimum. Time series results are presented showing that optimising for voltage or reactive power reduction increases generation connection capacity, but no single method is suitable for all generation and load conditions. The combined method trialled in this study does not achieve a balance between voltage and thermal headroom to increase the connection capacity through the use of a weighting factor calculated prior to optimisation.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583149","","","","","","3","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

These EVs are dependent on charging infrastructure and since most charging will happen at home this will bring challenges to the low-voltage distribution network. The main challenge addressed in this study is the available grid capacity and what could be done to prevent the massive request of residential buildings grid connection reinforcements, which represents significant costs to consumers, large waiting times, which are not compatible with the rising necessities for charging EV and a general oversizing of the distribution network, which will drive the already low utilisation factors even lower. The presented solution for this challenge is to introduce a flexible power grid connection, which takes advantage of smart charging technology and the applications of flexible power contracts to allow the charging of 5–7 times more EV in the common garages of residential buildings without any building grid connection reinforcement and for a fraction of the cost. The distribution system operator (DSO) will represent a key role in the implementation of this solution, not only regarding the technical aspects but also regarding the onboarding of the consumers.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583008","","","","","","6","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

On the demand side, DSOs could count on the predictable electricity demand profile that characterises the manufacturing industry and effectively represents a baseload for the grid. The necessity to decrease the environmental impact of the industry sector is driving manufacturing facilities towards on-site renewable energy generation, affecting the predictability of the net demand profile. An on-site VRE system has been simulated for an existing manufacturing plant in Ireland to investigate the effects of on-site energy generation on the variability of the net demand. It is shown that on-site VRE generation increases not only the amplitude but also the occurrence of rapid fluctuations in the net demand during the year. The integration of a flexible technology such as a gas turbine for combined heat and power presents only limited benefits. Adding battery storage to the on-site system does improve the variability of the on-site integrated system but a high variability is still present. The manufacturing facility remains a net consumer in all the analysed cases.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582924","","","","","","3","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Flexibility services will facilitate the renewable energy sources (RES) integration into the grid. Market-based procurement will be used consistently with the Clean Energy Package, and Enedis opted for a pragmatic two-step approach to procure these services: first, assess the capacity and appetite of market players through an innovative Request For Information (RFI) platform. Second, launch competitive tendering while ensuring a level playing field and the development of competition. Market-based flexibility services for distribution system operators (DSOs) do not exist so far. Acting as a market enabler, Enedis chose to build the market in cooperation with its stakeholders, aiming at a mutual understanding of each other's needs and expectations. The major themes of work are the following: identification and quantification of flexibility opportunities, tendering, contracts, measurement, settlement, operation processes, transmission system operator and DSO cooperation etc. They reflect the challenges associated with the use of market mechanisms to conclude flexibility contracts. Flexibility services market characteristics (remuneration of flexibility, tests, penalties etc.) will thus reflect the requirements of all stakeholders.

Two groups of customers are determined: a panel of those involved in flexibility mechanisms for which assessment of the load reduction is required (interest group), and a panel of other residential customers (mirror group). The model fits, through a Lasso regression, a load made from an aggregate of loads of the mirror panel to one of the interest groups on a learning period (with no load reduction). This estimator is then used to determine what the load of the interest group would have been should no load reduction had happened. This method allows for high accuracy of the estimates, simplifies calculations and data collection (not all individual data is needed thanks to sampling), and observations and assessment of other effects, such as anticipation and post-reduction effects, or postponed consumption. Robustness of methods used for assessment of load reduction is essential for stakeholders to take part in flexibility mechanisms for residential customers.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582963","","","","","","3","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The VERSIM workshop aims to bring together scientists from all across the globe to present and discuss topics related to the excitation, propagation, and effects of electromagnetic waves in the ELF/VLF (300 Hz – 30 kHz) range. The VERSIM group was established as a joint URSI/IAGA work group in 1975. It has been the main scientific body to specifically focus on whistlers in the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere (whistler waves were one of the first electromagnetic signals detected by ground instruments, and gave important clues about the Earth's active space environment). The scope of this group has grown substantially over the years. It has grown particularly in recent years with the recognition that whistler-mode chorus and hiss waves play a particularly important role in shaping the dynamics of the Earth's high-energy radiation belts (particularly topical in light of the continuing successful operation of the Van Allen Probes and the Arase (ERG) spacecraft). Whistler waves are also known to be intimately involved in the magnetic reconnection process (which is currently very topical due to the launch of the MMS satellite) and solar flaring. In addition to the traditional VERSIM topics, results of recent space missions, such as Arase, MMS, and the Van Allen Probes, were presented.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2020.9663141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663141","","Conferences;Magnetosphere;Probes;Earth;Web sites;Space vehicles;Space radiation","","","","","","24 Dec 2021","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

Frequency will only give information about the overall supply/demand on the wider network, and load current gives no insight into what other customers in the locality are doing. Local voltage, as a single data point, also has limited value. However, if under normal smart grid operations, each customer's energy management system records the local supply voltage and the voltage step change caused when loads are switched, it can build up a pattern identifying the lowest acceptable local supply voltage and the impact of switching each appliance. Hence, in the absence of smart grid control or communications, it would be able to measure the local voltage and take actions based on comparing this with the lowest acceptable voltage. Such a system could provide a level of protection against the loss of communications, or the smart grid controller being compromised.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583014","","","","","","1","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, if a grid-connected community wants to gain the full benefits of the local market and all its potential revenue streams, the trading mechanisms and information exchange procedures must be designed to be compatible with the external markets.

Mathematically, this means that the contrast parameter, the ratio of a specific material property of the host and the wedge scatterer, is assumed small. The relevant material property depends on the physical context and is different for acoustic and electromagnetic waves for example. Based on this assumption, a new asymptotic iterative scheme is constructed. The solution to the penetrable wedge is written in terms of infinitely many solutions to (possibly inhomogeneous) impenetrable wedge problems. Each impenetrable problem is solved using a combination of the Sommerfeld–Malyuzhinets and Wiener–Hopf techniques. The resulting approximated solution to the penetrable wedge involves a large number of nested complex integrals and is hence difficult to evaluate numerically. In order to address this issue, a subtle method (combining asymptotics, interpolation and complex analysis) is developed and implemented, leading to a fast and efficient numerical evaluation. This asymptotic scheme is shown to have excellent convergent properties and leads to a clear improvement on extant approaches.","1464-3634","","10.1093/imamat/hxaa011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9266846","wave diffraction;penetrable wedge","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Furthermore, there are several costs incurred by this type of generation during a year of energy supply. The Berlenga Project aims for a more sustainable solution for the energy supply of the island while guaranteeing a cost-effective solution and compliance with all its environmental protection measures, as well as adapting the regulatory framework, which was defined before European unbundling directives, forbidding the DSO of having generation activities. Though various solutions and mixed renewables systems were considered, the supply system chosen for the island was a solar + storage + backup diesel off-grid solution, which best responded to the major concerns regarding environmental issues and presenting itself as the most cost-effective solution when in comparison with a submarine cable (both in investment and maintenance).","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583126","","","","","","3","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This trend can not only be expected to continue but to rise rapidly into the future. It is expected that the systemic change in capabilities provided by this renewable energy to transmission and distribution system operation will be delivered, but the necessary associated network development to optimise their use has not. The lack of societal acceptance and the scale of the works have seen system development severely delayed. Consequently, better utilisation of existing assets will be required to continue to meet the increasingly challenging higher levels of decarbonisation measures in networks. Modular static synchronous series compensators (MSSSCs) offer a potential solution to this problem. From a simple lack of active and reactive power capacities to complex dynamic stability and power quality issues, MSSSCs act as a platform to provide a range of responsive measures. MSSSCs are versatile, compact, lightweight and redeployable. They offer a fast, flexible and cost-effective solution, which is justifiable to a society facing increasing uncertainty of future needs.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582967","","","","","","6","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

We calculate the temporal variations of the dynamical pressure at the surface of the core associated with core flow models inverted from geomagnetic observations. From these we compute predictions of the changes in Earth's topography in response to elastic deformations in the mantle. We show that at decadal periods, the predicted changes in Earth's topography are at most of the order of 0.3 mm. Focused at interannual periods between 4 and 9.5 yr, the predicted topography variations are smaller than 0.05 mm, at least an order of magnitude smaller than the reported observations. These amplitudes are only weakly sensitive to the choice of hypothesis used to reconstruct fluid motions at the core surface. We conclude that surface deformations induced by dynamical pressure changes in the core are below the detection level at present-day. Alternative geophysical sources must be sought to explain the observed millimetric interannual variations of the planetary scale topography, and its associated gravity variations. We currently see no justification for a physical relationship between interannual fluctuations of the geomagnetic field and of Earth's observed deformations. We conjecture that the largest gravity signal of core origin is potentially associated with decadal longitudinal oscillations of the inner core. It might be detectable as longer series will become available.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9339563","surface deformations;core dynamics;elastic mantle;geomagnetic secular variation","","","","","","","28 Jan 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This decentralized architecture brings reduced pollution and increased network efficiency and reliability. To handle the intermittent power generation and bidirectional power flows, the concept of grid-tied microgrid has been accepted to be the key to organize the distributed renewable sources and energy storages, which are interfaced with the microgrid through distributed power converters. Meanwhile, for increasing reliability, microgrids should be able to operate in standalone mode and disconnected from utility grid when utility fails. Under this circumstance, the microgrid bus voltage quality and the power sharing among these distributed power converters are crucial for the safe and reliable system operation. Besides, seamless transfer between grid-tied and standalone modes of microgrids is also significant in order to reduce the voltage or current spike and shorten the time during the mode transition. Furthermore, microgrids are prone to suffering transient and stability issues due to the interactions among multiple distributed power converters, and therefore stability study and stabilization control of microgrids have become a critical topic.","2475-742X","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9226050","","Microgrids;Power electronics;Energy storage;Power system stability;Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters","","","","","","15 Oct 2020","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

In situ measurement of compaction is therefore relevant for seismic hazard assessment. In this study, we investigated the potential of passively recorded deep borehole noise data to detect temporal variations in the Groningen reservoir. Train signals recorded by an array of 10 geophones at reservoir depth were selected from the continuous noise data for two 5-month deployments in 2015. Interferometry by deconvolution was applied to the high-frequency train signals that acted as stable, repetitive noise sources. Direct intergeophone P and S wave traveltimes were then used to construct the P- and S-wave velocity structure along the geophone array. The resulting models agree with independently obtained velocity profiles and have very small errors. Most intergeophone P wave traveltimes showed decreasing traveltimes per deployment period, suggestive of compaction. However, the retrieved traveltime changes are very small, up to tens of microseconds per deployment period, with uncertainties that are of similar size, about 10 microseconds. An unambiguous interpretation in terms of compaction is therefore not warranted, although the 10 μs error per 5-month period is probably smaller than can be achieved from active time-lapse seismic surveys that are commonly used to measure reservoir compaction. The direct P-wave amplitudes of the train-signal deconvolutions were investigated for additional imprints of compaction. Whereas the P-wave amplitudes consistently increased during the second deployment, suggestive of compaction, no such trend was observed for the first deployment, rendering the interpretation of compaction inconclusive. Our results therefore present hints, but no obvious effects of compaction in the Groningen reservoir. Yet, this study demonstrates that the approach of deconvolution interferometry applied to deep borehole data allows monitoring of small temporal changes in the subsurface for stable repetitive noise sources such as trains.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267728","Induced seismicity;Seismic interferometry;Seismic noise","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The demand clearing house (DCH) mitigates the situation of actual or anticipated grid congestion between the restrictions set by the DSOs and the effected CSOs using a unified interface. By using the DCH DSOs will be empowered to allocate available flexibility to charging EVs in order to comply with local grid-related restrictions while open up market optimisation to incorporate EV driver's needs. On the foundation of flexible charging, existing grid planning and grid operation procedures can be updated and take limited grid usage into account. By doing this the macroeconomic cost of integrating EVs will be minimised.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582903","","","","","","6","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Two Vs discontinuities at ∼15 and ∼60 km depths are revealed beneath volcanic islands, which are interpreted as the Moho discontinuity and the Gutenberg (G) discontinuity. Between the north and south islands, obvious high-Vs anomalies exist in the uppermost mantle down to a depth of ∼100–150 km beneath the Atlantic Ocean, whereas obvious low-Vs anomalies exist in the uppermost mantle beneath the volcanic islands including the active Fogo volcano.

For residual electricity supply, utilities in the industrial sector or flexible biogas plants may be suitable flexibility options. To describe and rate different technologies or utilities in terms of their ability to provide flexibility, a definition of flexibility and an innovative method to describe flexibility considering the grid requirements is elaborated. The method is based on a solid definition of flexibility indicators suitable for all technologies. For an increased flexibility, in many cases, it is reasonable to add supporting technologies like a storage to a utility or biogas combined heat and power (CHP). Such utility configurations can also be described with the elaborated method. The method can also make a valuable contribution to all distribution systems or utility system modellers as it can be taken as a basis for the modelling.

In this study, a possible control architecture for the proposed method is illustrated. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the influence of two parameters, preset and total time, on the performance of the proposed control method.

In the PoC, a schedule with a resolution of 15 min was updated daily by ewz and transmitted to the charging infrastructure. In the successful implementation of two test cases, the behaviour of various EVs was investigated for blocked charging (test case 1) and at reduced charging current (test case 2). The PoC demonstrated that it is possible to retrofit controllability to EV chargers using a cost-effective hardware platform. In addition, it was found that the behaviour of the EVs varied widely in the case of complete blocking and that the EVs react more predictably if the charging current is only reduced rather than blocked. Moreover, a significant deterioration of the power factor cos(φ) was found with a reduced charging current.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582881","","","","","","1","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Its practical implementation on a large scale is possible through the use of the LINK-based holistic architecture. The latter has a standardised architecture structure with three main components: Electricity producer, storage and grid. They operate on a decentralised basis at transmission and distribution levels. Customer plants that transform from consumers to prosumers operate as virtual vertical integrated utilities. End-use and cross-vector sector coupling is integrated into the LINK-based holistic architecture via the storage component. Different storage technologies are categorised from the perspective of the power grid. The optimisation of the electricity system and other sectors is realised by coordinating and adapting the locally optimised systems. Various use cases for price-driven power to X response are described. The storage integration through the sector coupling may positively affect the way ancillary services are provided and traded through market mechanisms.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583111","","","","","","8","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

It is well known that the resulting inverse seismic model is relative to an unknown vertically varying reference model. If jointly inverting data obtained with networks in the vicinity of each other but operating at different times, the relative velocity anomalies in different areas of the model may have different reference levels, possibly introducing large-scale biases in the model that may compromise the interpretation. This is very unfortunate as we have numerous examples of asynchronous network deployments which would benefit from a joint analysis. We show here how a simple improvement in the formulation of the sensitivity kernels allows us to mitigate this problem. Using sensitivity kernels that take into account that data processing implies a zero mean residual for each event, the large-scale biases that otherwise arise in the inverse model using data from asynchronous station deployment are largely removed. We illustrate this first with a very simple 3-station example, and then compare the results obtained using the usual and the relative kernels in synthetic tests with more realistic station coverage, simulating data acquisition at two neighbouring asynchronous networks.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9339577","Inverse theory;Body waves;Seismic tomography;Theoretical seismology","","","","","","","28 Jan 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Therefore, the aim of this study is to derive an analytical solution of the slip rate distribution of antiplane self-similar crack growth under distance-weakening friction that mimics slip-weakening friction. To satisfy the condition that the slip rate starts from zero at the rupture front, a trade-off relationship among rupture velocity, process zone size and breakdown stress-to-stress drop ratio is proposed. The peak slip rate, slip-weakening distance and fracture energy obtained using the proposed model provide a possible mechanism for the determination of the rupture velocity and the estimation of the fracture energy of the self-similar crack growth, based on the seismic observables.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggaa392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267744","Friction;Earthquake dynamics;Rheology and friction of fault zones;Theoretical seismology;Dynamics and mechanics of faulting;Mechanics, theory, and modelling","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A simple feed structure and strategy are therefore in high demand for dual-polarized high-gain planar antennas. Directed at this requirement, we first present a series-fed dual-polarized slot array with a single-layered substrate. Two orthogonal magnetic-current arrays were positioned at the opposite sides of a single-layered substrate, leading to high gain and high port isolation. A novel scheme to achieve dual-polarized, high-gain, and low-profile antennas using the higher-order-mode microstrip antenna was then demonstrated. By loading half-wavelength slots at the electric-field nulls of a higher-order-mode microstrip antenna, a multiple-element in-phase magnetic-current array was constructed within a low-profile cavity with a simple feeding strategy. As a proof of the concept, two dual-polarized high-gain microstrip magnetic-current array antennas, utilizing the TM50 and TM90 modes of a microstrip antenna were investigated. These magnetic-current array antennas had the merits of having a low profile, simple feeding, and high isolation, promising a huge potential in diversity and MIMO applications.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2020.9523802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9523802","","Microstrip antennas;Antenna arrays;Microstrip;Dipole antennas;Slot antennas;Microstrip antenna arrays;Magnetoelectric effects","","","","","","26 Aug 2021","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

Power electronics circuit topologies are centered around capacitors, inductors, or combinations of capacitors and inductors. Conventional multilevel converters are capacitor centered and have their advantages and limitations. For example, the neutral point clamped (NPC) multilevel converters and flying capacitor multilevel converters can be back-back connected but are not easily scalable to achieve higher voltage. The cascade multilevel converter has modular structure and good scalability but cannot be back-to-back connected. Compared to these three types of multilevel converters, MMC indeed is a remarkable hybrid circuit that has both capacitors centered sub-modules and arm inductors. It achieves good scalability and is feasible for backback connections. In the last two decades, MMC has already been widely implemented in utility applications. Recently, medium voltage megawatt level MMC with 1.7 kV rated Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices has also been successfully demonstrated for motor drive applications. Nevertheless, MMC still presents many research challenges and opportunities in terms of circuit topology variations, sub-module capacitor reduction in all types of applications, integration of medium voltage wide bandgap power devices, electromagnetic interference and compatibility, implementation in solid state transformer to achieve high step down ratio and frequency multiplication, etc.","2475-742X","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9135024","","Capacitors;Multilevel converters;Inductors;Medium voltage;Silicon carbide;Photonic band gap","","","","","","7 Jul 2020","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

We manipulated the expected probe time in a delayed change-detection task and report that temporal expectation can have a profound influence on memory-guided behavioral performance. EEG measurements corroborated the utilization of temporal expectations: demonstrating the involvement of a classic EEG signature of temporal expectation—the contingent negative variation—in the context of working memory. We also report the influence of temporal expectations on 2 EEG signatures associated with visual working memory—the lateralization of 8- to 12-Hz alpha activity, and the contralateral delay activity. We observed a dissociation between these signatures, whereby alpha lateralization (but not the contralateral delay activity) adapted to the time of expected memory utilization. These data show how temporal expectations prepare visual working memory for behavior and shed new light on the electrophysiological markers of both temporal expectation and working memory.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_01626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9246933","","","","","","","Open Access","2 Nov 2020","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

"Deep reinforcement learning for dynamic computation offloading and resource allocation in cache-assisted mobile edge computing systems","S. Nath; J.

In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic caching, computation offloading, and resource allocation in cache-assisted multi-user MEC systems with stochastic task arrivals. There are multiple computationally intensive tasks in the system, and each Mobile User (MU) needs to execute a task either locally or remotely in one or more MEC servers by offloading the task data. Popular tasks can be cached in MEC servers to avoid duplicates in offloading. The cached contents can be either obtained through user offloading, fetched from a remote cloud, or fetched from another MEC server. The objective is to minimize the long-term average of a cost function, which is defined as a weighted sum of energy consumption, delay, and cache contents' fetching costs. The weighting coefficients associated with the different metrics in the objective function can be adjusted to balance the tradeoff among them. The optimum design is performed with respect to four decision parameters: whether to cache a given task, whether to offload a given uncached task, how much transmission power should be used during offloading, and how much MEC resources to be allocated for executing a task. We propose to solve the problems by developing a dynamic scheduling policy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method. A new decentralized DDPG algorithm is developed to obtain the optimum designs for multi-cell MEC systems by leveraging on the cooperations among neighboring MEC servers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other existing strategies, such as Deep Q-Network (DQN).","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2020.0014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9310745","Mobile Edge Computing (MEC);caching;computation offloading;resource allocation;Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL);Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG);multi-cell","Task analysis;Servers;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling;Reinforcement learning;Heuristic algorithms;Delays","","146","","","","30 Dec 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The existence of partially shaded conditions leads to the presence of several peaks on PV curves, which decrease the efficiency of conventional techniques. Hence, the proposed algorithm, which is based on the modified particle-swarm optimization (MPSO) technique, increases the output power of PV systems under such abnormal conditions and has a better performance compared to other methods. The proposed method is examined under several scenarios for partial shading condition and non-uniform irradiation levels using Matlab, and to investigate its effectiveness adequately, the results of the proposed method are compared with those of the neural network technique. The experimental results show that the proposed method can decrease the interference of the local maximum power-point to cause the PV system to operate at a global maximum power-point. The efficiency of the MPSO is achieved with the least number of steady-state oscillations under partial shading conditions compared with the neural network method.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2020.000035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316857","Photovoltaic(PV);maximum power point tracking(MPPT);step-up converter;artificial neural networks (ANNs);particle-swarm optimization (PSO)","Radiation effects;Particle swarm optimization;Tracking;Solar system;Solar energy;Resistors;Photovoltaic systems","","78","","","","8 Jan 2021","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

However, effective slicing of Radio Access Network (RAN) is very challenging due to the diverse QoS requirements and dynamic conditions in the 6G networks. In this paper, we propose a self-sustained RAN slicing framework, which integrates the self-management of network resources with multiple granularities, the self-optimization of slicing control performance, and self-learning together to achieve an adaptive control strategy under unforeseen network conditions. The proposed RAN slicing framework is hierarchically structured, which decomposes the RAN slicing control into three levels, i.e., network-level slicing, next generation NodeB (gNodeB)-level slicing, and packet scheduling level slicing. At the network level, network resources are assigned to each gNodeB at a large timescale with coarse resource granularity. At the gNodeB-level, each gNodeB adjusts the configuration of each slice in the cell at the large timescale. At the packet scheduling level, each gNodeB allocates radio resource allocation among users in each network slice at a small timescale. Furthermore, we utilize the transfer learning approach to enable the transition from a model-based control to an autonomic and self-learning RAN slicing control. With the proposed RAN slicing framework, the QoS performance of emerging services is expected to be dramatically enhanced.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2020.0019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314166","Radio Access Network (RAN);network slicing;network resource management;intelligent network","Quality of service;Network slicing;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Radio access networks;Dynamic scheduling;Cloud computing","","77","","","","5 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Methods: The approach is based on complexity of neuromotor coordination across speech subsystems involved in respiration, phonation and articulation, motivated by the distinct nature of COVID-19 involving lower (i.e., bronchial, diaphragm, lower tracheal) versus upper (i.e., laryngeal, pharyngeal, oral and nasal) respiratory tract inflammation, as well as by the growing evidence of the virus’ neurological manifestations. Preliminary results: An exploratory study with audio interviews of five subjects provides Cohen's d effect sizes between pre-COVID-19 (pre-exposure) and post-COVID-19 (after positive diagnosis but presumed asymptomatic) using: coordination of respiration (as measured through acoustic waveform amplitude) and laryngeal motion (fundamental frequency and cepstral peak prominence), and coordination of laryngeal and articulatory (formant center frequencies) motion. Conclusions: While there is a strong subject-dependence, the group-level morphology of effect sizes indicates a reduced complexity of subsystem coordination. Validation is needed with larger more controlled datasets and to address confounding influences such as different recording conditions, unbalanced data quantities, and changes in underlying vocal status from pre-to-post time recordings.","2644-1276","","10.1109/OJEMB.2020.2998051","Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering(grant numbers:FA8702-15-D-0001); NIH; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(grant numbers:T32 DC000038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103574","Asymptomatic;COVID-19;respiration;vocal subsystems;motor coordination","Viruses (medical);Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Frequency measurement;Correlation;Complexity theory;Stability analysis;Feature extraction;COVID-19","","72","","19","CCBY","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the current contributions in computation offloading and resource allocation are inefficient; moreover, they merely consider the static communication mode, and the increasing demand for low latency services and high throughput poses tremendous challenges in F-RANs. A joint problem of mode selection, resource allocation, and power allocation is formulated to minimize latency under various constraints. We propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based joint computation offloading and resource allocation scheme that achieves a suboptimal solution in F-RANs. The core idea of the proposal is that the DRL controller intelligently decides whether to process the generated computation task locally at the device level or offload the task to a fog access point or cloud server and allocates an optimal amount of computation and power resources on the basis of the serving tier. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly minimizes latency and increases throughput in the system.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2020.0020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314163","fog radio access networks;computation offloading;mode selection;resource allocation;distributed computation;low latency;deep reinforcement learning","Task analysis;Resource management;Cloud computing;Servers;Internet of Things;Reinforcement learning;Delays","","62","","","","5 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Methods: Our scheme identifies at-risk regions using existing cellular network functionalities—handover and cell (re)selection—used to maintain seamless coverage for mobile end-user equipment (UE). The frequency of handover and cell (re)selection events is highly reflective of the density of mobile people in the area because virtually everyone carries UEs. Results: These measurements, which are accumulated over very many UEs, allow us to identify the at-risk regions without compromising the privacy and anonymity of individuals.

However, it is difficult to determine the amplitude and phase of each antenna element from the desired pattern in an environment where inter-element coupling exists. For this purpose, 6,859 radiation pattern samples for a 4×1 array patch antenna were generated by changing the phases of the antenna elements, and those patterns were leveraged to train the proposed DNN with low complexity. The radiation patterns of the ideal square and triangular array shapes, which are practically infeasible to implement, were used as inputs to the DNN. It was confirmed that the radiation pattern generated from the output signals of the DNN was very similar to the input radiation pattern.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045464","Education and Research Promotion Program of KOREATECH in 2020; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9296770","Antenna;deep learning;neural network;radiation patterns;synthesis","Antenna radiation patterns;Couplings;Phased arrays;Arrays;Training;Deep learning;Patch antennas","","56","","16","CCBY","17 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transmission quality between the transmitter and the end users has to be optimum for the best performance out of any device. Besides, the presence of coverage hole is also an ongoing issue for operators which cannot be ignored throughout the whole operational stage. Any coverage hole in network operators' coverage region will hamper the communication applications and degrade the reputation of the operator's services. Presently, there are techniques to detect coverage holes such as drive test or minimization of drive test. However, these approaches have many limitations. The extreme costs, outdated information about the radio environment and high time consumption do not allow to meet the requirement competently. To overcome these problems, we take advantage of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Q-learning to autonomously detect coverage hole in a given area and then deploy UAV based base station (UAV-BS) by considering wireless back-haul with the core network and users demand. This machine learning mechanism will help the UAV to eliminate human-in-the-loop (HiTL) model. Later, we formulate an optimisation problem for 3D UAV-BS placement at various angular positions to maximise the number of users associated with the UAV-BS. In summary, we have illustrated a cost-effective as well as time saving approach of detecting coverage hole and providing on-demand coverage in this article.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2020.000034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321160","6G;Autonomous coverage hole detection;minimization of drive test (MDT);Q-learning;UAV-BS;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);wireless backhaul","Unmanned aerial vehicles;Base stations;Wireless communication;Three-dimensional displays;Cellular networks;6G mobile communication;Quality of service","","53","","","","12 Jan 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

It largely limits the application of AGVs. Some AGVs relies on highly accurate Light Laser Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) devices for navigation. The paper presents a low-cost localization approach for indoor AGVs with the localization accuracy up to centimetres. The proposed method not only allows an AGV to move precisely without any predefined paths, but also reduces the cost largely. The Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology is used in our approach. In the paper, a gradient decent method cooperated with a least square method is developed to deal with the nonlinearity of UWB ranging data. An optimal localization result is achieved within a small amount of iterations. The positioning results are also compared to a high-accuracy Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) satellite system.

One of the emerging demands is the frequency regulation, including the virtual inertia control (VIC) and the frequency damping control (FDC). To achieve the full-range frequency regulation, i.e., to deal with under-frequency and over-frequency issues, power reserve is necessary for PV systems, which should be properly utilized to realize optimal frequency support. In this context, a novel coordination strategy for the VIC and the FDC in PV systems is proposed in this paper. According to relevant grid codes, the key indices to evaluate the frequency quality are identified at first, i.e., the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), the frequency nadir, and the recovery frequency. Then, the impact of the inertia constant and damping gain on the frequency quality is explored. Accordingly, the coordination strategy of the VIC and the FDC is designed to achieve optimal frequency support with a certain amount of power reserve.

Because of the single control condition and any change in the external environment, the first step response of the converter duty cycle of the traditional MPPT incremental conductance algorithm is not accurate, resulting in misjudgment. To improve the efficiency and economy of PV systems, an improved incremental conductance algorithm of MPPT control strategy is proposed. From the traditional incremental conductance algorithm, this algorithm is simple in structure and can discriminate the instantaneous increment of current, voltage and power when the external environment changes, and so can improve tracking efficiency. MATLAB simulations are carried out under rapidly changing solar radiation level, and the results of the improved and conventional incremental conductance algorithm are compared. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively identify the misjudgment and avoid its occurrence.

In both cases, typically a DC/DC stage is attached to a three-phase DC/AC stage in order to enable buck-boost functionality and/or a wide input-output voltage operating range. However, a two-stage solution leads to a high number of switched bridge-legs and hence, results in high switching losses, if the degrees of freedom available for controlling the overall system are not utilised. If the DC/DC stage is used to vary the DC link voltage with six times the AC-side frequency, a pulse width modulation (PWM) of always only one phase of the DC/AC stage is sufficient to achieve three-phase sinusoidal output currents. The clamping of two phases (denoted as 1/3 PWM) leads to a drastic reduction of the DC/AC stage switching losses, which is further accentuated by a DC link voltage which is lower than for the conventional modulation schemes. This paper details the operating principle of a three-phase buck-boost converter system using 1/3 PWM and outlines an appropriate control system design. Subsequently, the switching losses and the voltage/current stresses on the converter components are analytically derived. There, a more than 66% reduction of the DC/AC stage switching losses is calculated without any increase of the stress on the remaining converter components. The theoretical considerations are finally verified on a hardware demonstrator, where the proposed modulation strategy is experimentally compared against several conventional modulation techniques and its clear performance advantages are validated.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2020.00004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9062665","Battery charger;control system design;modulation strategy;variable-speed drives;wide input-output voltage range","Pulse width modulation;Batteries;Switching loss;Voltage control;Switches;DC motors;Clamps","","38","","","","13 Apr 2020","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

With the rapid increase of IoT devices and applications, the backhaul or backbone networks, which transmit IoT traffic to various in-network clouds, will experience a predicted explosion in the volume of carried traffic. To guarantee the QoS of IoT cloud services and improve the network performance, it is crucial for network operator to implement efficient routing optimization strategies for IoT traffic. As a promising networking paradigm, software-defined networking (SDN) has flexible and programmable control capability for fine-grained flows. The emergence of SDN paves a way for implementing high-performance routing optimization in networks. In SDN networks, the routing strategies are realized through flow rules, which are usually stored in TCAM with very limited capacity. However, the number of IoT flows are enormous. Thus, in this paper, we address the routing optimization problem in SDN-based IoT with TCAM capacity constraint. We first formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming problem and prove the problem is NP-hard. Then to solve the problem efficiently, we propose several approximate algorithms, which solve the problem in two stages. In the first stage, the algorithms calculate the routing strategies for flows without considering the TCAM capacity constraint. To meet the TCAM capacity constraint, the algorithms using different strategies to adjust the paths of some flows in the second stage. Extensive simulations are conducted on both real ISP and synthetic topologies to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. The simulation results verify that the algorithms can achieve promising load balancing performance in SDN-based IoT, where the capacity of TCAM in SDN switches is very limited.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2020.000006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091290","Internet of things;routing optimization;software-defined networking;ternary content-addressable memory","Routing;Cloud computing;Approximation algorithms;Optimization;Control systems;Internet of Things;Quality of service","","37","","","","11 May 2020","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

The results indicate that radiation has little effect on BFS when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large enough. However, since radiation will lead to radiation-induced attenuation, the amplitude of BGS will decrease accordingly. And if the SNR becomes small enough, the accurate BFS cannot be obtained.

This paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network, LiraNet, which combines the idea of dense connections, residual connections and group convolution, including stem blocks and extractor modules. The designed stem block uses a series of small convolutions to extract the input image features, and the extractor network adopts the designed two-way dense connection module, which further reduces the network operation complexity. Mounting LiraNet on the object detection framework Darknet, this paper proposes Lira-you only look once (Lira-YOLO), a lightweight model for ship detection in radar images, which can easily be deployed on the mobile devices. Lira-YOLO's prediction module uses a two-layer YOLO prediction layer and adds a residual module for better feature delivery. At the same time, in order to fully verify the performance of the model, mini-RD, a lightweight distance Doppler domain radar images dataset, is constructed. Experiments show that the network complexity of Lira-YOLO is low, being only 2.980 Bflops, and the parameter quantity is smaller, which is only 4.3 MB. The mean average precision (mAP) indicators on the mini-RD and SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) reach 83.21% and 85.46%, respectively, which is comparable to the tiny-YOLOv3. Lira-YOLO has achieved a good detection accuracy with less memory and computational cost.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9215072","lightweight;radar images;ship detection;you only look once (YOLO)","Modeling;Convolution;Marine vehicles;Radar imaging;Radar detection;Feature extraction","","35","","","","6 Oct 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The microstrip-to-paired strips balun is designed to yield good performance in the return loss, insertion loss, and amplitude and phase imbalances which are of great necessity for low axial ratio. The cavity is employed to obtain unidirectional radiation patterns and prevent external signal interference. However, it is found that the originally-designed cavity-backed antenna does not work properly near 1.35 GHz due to resonance phenomena in the cavity. In this work, the cavity is modified to tackle this problem.

And a quasi-elliptic characteristic can be obtained at the boresight gain direction. By changing the length of perturbation slot and the strength of electric coupling and magnetic coupling, the position of radiation nulls can be controlled independetly. Compared to conventional filtenna, the proposed SIW filtenna has no extra filtering circuit to increase the dimension and complexity. Two resonant modes in the passband can be excited through loading electric and magnetic mixed coupling structure in one SIW cavity. The measured results are in good agreement with simulated results. The good frequency selectivity and out-of-band rejection are achieved. The proposed antenna exhibits a maximum realized gain of 5.8 dBi at the operating bandwidth.

The system power loss and node voltage excursion can be effectively reduced, by taking measures of time-of-use (TOU) price mechanism bonded with the reactive compensation of energy storage devices. Firstly, the coordinate charging/discharging load model for EV has been established, to obtain a narrowed gap between load peak and valley. Next, a multi-objective optimization model of the distribution grid is also defined, and the active power loss and node voltage fluctuation are chosen to be the objective function. For improving the efficiency of optimization process, an advanced genetic algorithm associated with elite preservation policy is used. Finally, reactive compensation capacity supplied by capacitor banks is dynamically determined according to the varying building loads. The proposed strategy is demonstrated on the IEEE 33-node test case, and the simulation results show that the power supply pressure can be obviously relieved by introducing the coordinated charging/discharging behavior of EV; in the meantime, via reasonable planning of the compensation capacitor, the remarkably lower active power loss and voltage excursion can be realized, ensuring the safe and economical operation of the distribution system.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-020-0154-0","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2017JJ5044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10371378","Distribution network;Electric vehicles;Multi-objective optimization;Coordinated dispatch;Advanced J genetic algorithm","Voltage measurement;Voltage fluctuations;Fluctuations;Power supplies;Buildings;Capacitors;Distribution networks","","33","","15","","22 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) have emerged as a promising tool for low-cost, unobtrusive gait analysis. However, large varieties of IMU gait analysis algorithms and the lack of consensus for their validation make it difficult for researchers to assess the reliability of the algorithms for specific use cases. In daily life, individuals adapt their gait patterns in response to changes in the environment, making it necessary for IMU gait analysis algorithms to provide accurate measurements despite these gait variations. In this paper, we reviewed common types of IMU gait analysis algorithms and appropriate analysis methods to evaluate the accuracy of gait parameters extracted from IMU measurements. We then evaluated stride lengths and stride times calculated from a comprehensive double integration based IMU gait analysis algorithm using an optoelectric walkway as gold standard. In total, 729 strides from five healthy subjects and three different walking patterns were analyzed. Correlation analyses and Bland-Altman plots showed that this method is accurate and robust against large variations in walking patterns (stride length: correlation coefficient (r) was 0.99, root mean square error (RMSE) was 3% and average limits of agreement (LoA) was 6%; stride time: r was 0.95, RMSE was 4% and average LoA was 7%), making it suitable for gait evaluation in daily life situations.

This paper, i.e., Part A of a discussion of The Essence of the Little Box Challenge, documents all important R&D activities and engineering considerations of the authors endeavor to implement the world's most compact inverter; Part B is intended to convey the main findings and lessons learned from the participation in the GLBC. First, the key technical challenges of the GLBC are discussed and the technologies and concepts selected by the authors among different options are described in detail. Relevant design considerations, such as constant frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) or triangular current mode (TCM) operation of the bridge-legs, selection of power semiconductor technology, interleaving of bridge-legs, sizing of the power buffer capacitor, limitation of ground/leakage currents, etc., to achieve an ultra-compact implementation are discussed. Based on this overview, two promising inverter concepts to tackle the GLBC, (i) an H-bridge based inverter with DC-link referenced output filter and (ii) a DC/|AC| buck-stage with series-connected low-frequency (LF) |AC|/AC unfolder inverter, are then analyzed in detail.

The only difference between rasorber and absorber is that rasorber has a transmission window with low loss. Therefore, a wideband absorber is proposed at the first step. Then, four split-ring resonators (SRRs) are introduced to the absorber, which makes the electromagnetic (EM) energy could be reflected at the certain frequency band. The state (on/off) of SRRs and absorber can be controlled by the chemical potential of graphene. To find a new pathway for this part of the reflected energy, metal ground of the absorber is replaced by a reconfigurable graphene-based frequency selective surface (FSS). The proposed FSS could be switched between FSS and metal plate by controlling the chemical potential of graphene ring embedded in the bottom metal layer. Therefore, the proposed multi-functional device could be obtained by combing the absorber with SRRs and reconfigurable FSS.

However, fuses and arc fault detection devices (AFDD) struggle to detect series arc faults in DC systems, because the series arc fault induces small current variation between the normal and abnormal conditions. In addition, switching noise from the grid-connected inverter makes detecting arc fault conditions even more difficult. This paper proposes arc fault detection algorithm based on the relative comparison of current variability in terms of frequency spectrum and time series. The operational principle of the proposed algorithm is analyzed to detect the arc fault condition. In addition, the investigation of arc fault impedance using the small-signal modeling can obtain the resonant frequency of arc fault condition at low frequency range. From the impedance model, the frequency analysis range can be designed to avoid the switching noise of inverter. The performance of proposed arc fault detection algorithm is verified with a 3.8 kW grid-connected PV system and arc fault generator.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027869","Research and Development Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Research(grant numbers:C0-2411); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209997","Arc fault;fault diagnosis;dc-ac inverter;digital signal processor","Circuit faults;Impedance;Fault detection;Resonant frequency;Resistance;Inverters;Frequency-domain analysis","","29","","25","CCBY","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper introduces a Smart Transformer (ST)-based Medium Voltage (MV) grid support by means of active power control in the ST-fed Low Voltage (LV) grid. The aim of the proposed strategy is to improve the voltage profile in MV grids before the operation of On-Load Tap Changer in the primary substation transformer, which needs tens of seconds. This is realized through reactive power injection by the AC/DC MV converter and simultaneous decrease of the active power consumption of voltage-dependent loads in ST-fed LV grid, controlling the ST output voltage. The last feature has two main effects: the first is to reduce the active power withdrawn from MV grid, and consequently the MV voltage drop caused by the active current component. At the same time, higher reactive power injection capability in the MV converter is unlocked, due to the lower active power demand. As result, the ST increases the voltage support in MV grid. The analysis and simulation results carried out in this paper show improvements compared to similar solutions, i.e. the only reactive power compensation. The impact of the proposed solution has been finally evaluated under different voltage-dependence of the loads in the LV grid.","2096-3564","","10.30941/CESTEMS.2020.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312757","Smart Transformer;Solid State Transformers;Load Control;Voltage Support","Voltage control;Reactive power;Sensitivity;Substations;Voltage measurement;Voltage fluctuations;Power demand","","29","","","","4 Jan 2021","","","CES","CES Journals"

For aerospace multiphase PMSM system, besides external load disturbance and system parameter perturbation, there inevitably exists the electromagnetic torque ripple in fault transient process, which can degrade the system performance and even cause the system instability. To cope with this issue, the electromagnet torque ripple of the multiphase PMSM system in fault transient process is first analyzed. Then, by considering the electromagnet torque fluctuation caused by fault transient as a system uncertainty, a novel adaptive robust speed control scheme is proposed, while the adaptive law is constructed to emulate the total system uncertainty bound, which include the load disturbance, the parameter variation, and the electromagnetic torque fluctuation due to fault transient. The resulting control can ensure the speed control performance even in fault transient process regardless of the uncertainty, in which no prior estimation of the uncertainty bound is required. In addition, the proposed adaptive robust speed control is demonstrated by a six-phase PMSM experimental platform.

We design dynamic executable scripts that record and perform manual operations to customize the execution path of the target application. Our dynamic executable scripts can replace most manual operations, simplify the analysis process, and further verify the corresponding security vulnerabilities. We successfully statically analyze 5547 malwares in Drebin and 10151 real-world applications. The average analysis time of each application in Drebin is 4.52 s, whereas it reaches 92.02 s for real-word applications. Our system can detect all the labeled vulnerabilities among 56 labeled applications. Further dynamic verification shows that our static analysis accuracy approximates 95% for real-world applications.

In order to reduce the leakage current in the single-phase low-power PV inverters, a five-level transformer-less inverter is proposed in this paper. A total of eleven switches are required, while six of them only withstand a quarter of the dc-bus voltage, so the costs for them are low. Another four switches are turned on or off at the power line cycle, the switching losses for them are ignored. In addition, the flying-capacitors (FCs) voltages are only a quarter of the dc-bus voltage, and they are balanced at the switching frequency, which further reduces the system investment. The experimental results based on a 1 kW prototype show that the proposed modulation strategy can balance the FCs voltages at Vdc/4 very well. And the leakage current can be reduced to about 27 mA under both active and reactive operations, which satisfies the VDE 0126-1-1 standard.","2096-3564","","10.30941/CESTEMS.2020.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312762","Leakage current;multilevel inverter;pulse width modulation","Inverters;Topology;Leakage currents;Power harmonic filters;Network topology;Modulation;Capacitors","","26","","","","4 Jan 2021","","","CES","CES Journals"

We address this literature gap by collecting the first on-state voltage dRon measurements at multi-MHz frequencies, with a focus on the zero-voltage-switching conditions that are predominantly employed at high frequency. On the selected commercially-available HEMT with a breakdown voltage below 200 V, the dynamic contribution asymptotes above ≈ 2 MHz, a finding predicted by the slow time constants of the traps that cause dRon.

In this letter, a protection strategy based on converter-embedded double-thyristors is proposed to address these issues. The double-thyristors are installed in parallel with each SM in the lower arms of the converter. By triggering the double-thyristors, the SPG fault is converted into a three-phase short-circuit that ensures current zero-crossings in the grid-side ACCB. Moreover, as the voltages of converter ac buses are clamped by the ground through the triggered double-thyristors, the upper arm overvoltage is mitigated.

The phenomenon, hereafter called Temporary Read Errors (TRE), is not due to a permanent change of cell threshold voltage between the program verify and the following read operations, but to its transient instability occurring during the idle phase and the first read operations performed on a block. The experimental analysis has been performed on off-the-shelf gigabit-array products to characterize the dependence on the memory operating conditions.

However, this simple strategy cannot cope with complex environmental changes and autonomously optimize decision-making problems. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a new deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for the attack area fitting of UCAVs in the future battlefield. Simulation results show that the autonomy and environmental adaptability of UCAVs in the future battlefield will be improved based on the new DDPG algorithm and the training process converges quickly.

The impact of cycling induced intercell trapped charge on two primary charge loss mechanisms (vertical and lateral charge loss) was studied in this work. According to experimental analysis and TCAD simulation, it is found that, in vertically scaled 3D NAND, the vertical charge loss is deteriorated not only by the cycling induced tunnel oxide degradation (introducing interface/oxide traps), but also by the cycling induced intercell trapped charge (enhancing word-lines edge electric field), on account of the enhanced Poole-Frenkel effect and tunneling effect. On the other hand, the cycling induced intercell trapped charge can also suppress lateral charge migration. Therefore, the vertical charge loss, rather than the lateral charge migration, still can be the dominant factor for post-cycling retention characteristics in scaling Lg/Ls 3D NAND flash memory.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2019.2963473","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1107700); National Science and Technology Major Project of China(grant numbers:2017ZX02301002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8948038","3D NAND flash memory;data retention;intercell trapped charge;PE cycling","Three-dimensional displays;Flash memories;Simulation;Electric fields;Tunneling;Logic gates;Degradation","","23","","13","CCBY","1 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a simulation model based on traction inverter topology is built, and various voltage fault signal waveforms are simulated based on the IGBT inverter open-circuit fault classification. Second, compressive sensing theory is used to sparsely represent the voltage fault signal and make it a fault signal. The new method has a high degree of sparseness and builds an overcomplete dictionary model containing the feature vectors of voltage fault signals based on a double sparse dictionary model to match the sparse signal characteristics. Finally, the space vector transform is used to represent the three-phase voltage scalar in the traction inverter as a composite quantity to reduce the redundancy of the fault signals and data-processing capabilities. A G-LS-SVM fault diagnosis model is then built to diagnose and identify the voltage fault signal feature vector in an overcomplete dictionary. The simulation results show that the accuracy of this method for various types of IGBT tube fault diagnosis is over 98.92%. Moreover, the G-LS-SVM model is robust and not affected by Gaussian white noise.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2020.000004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9058594","Traction inverter;voltage fault signal;compressed sensing;over-complete dictionary;G-LS-SVM;fault diagnosis","Dictionaries;Inverters;Fault diagnosis;Circuit faults;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Support vector machines;Electron tubes","","23","","","","9 Apr 2020","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

AOA measurement errors can be reduced by operating the optical modulator at a different transmission point for a different range of microwave signal AOA. The system also has the ability to remove the incoming microwave signal amplitude dependence in the AOA measurement. Measured results demonstrate 0°−81.5° AOA measurement with less than ±2° errors over the 0°−30° and 30°−81.5° AOA measurement range when the optical modulator is biased at the minimum and maximum transmission point respectively.

Firstly, a control-oriented dynamics model is essential in control algorithm design and code realization. Unlike a numerical algorithm, an analytical approach is suggested. Using a general and a quasi-coordinate Lagrangian formulation, the kinematics and dynamics equations are derived. Then, an impedance control algorithm is developed which allows coordinated control of the multiple manipulators to capture a target. Through enforcing a reference impedance, end-effectors behave like a mass-damper-spring system fixed in inertial space in reaction to any contact force between the capture hands and the target. Meanwhile, the position and the attitude of the base are maintained stably by using gas jet thrusters to work against the manipulators' reaction.

In the simulation, the minimum subthreshold swing (SS) reduced to 40 mV/decade with negligible hysteresis, and the on-current amplified by approximately three times. The N-DIBL effect was analyzed by building a model, and the results indicated that the N-DIBL is negatively correlated with the SS. Hence, it is indispensable to make trade-offs between the N-DIBL and SS in NC NWFET applications. Moreover, the Miller effect of a NCFET-based inverter was investigated for the first time. The Miller effect of the NC NWFET-based inverter was considerably improved owing to a high on-current and negative internal gate voltage (when external gate voltage is set to 0V), which is beneficial for high-speed circuit building based on NC NWFETs. The overshoot of the NC NWFET-based inverter is ~43.1% less than that of the NWFET-based inverter, and the propagation delay of the NC NWFET-based inverter is ~73.1% less than that of the NWFET-based inverter at ferroelectric thickness  $\text{T}_{\mathrm{ FE}}=3$ nm.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2020.3015492","Academy of Integrated Circuit Innovation(grant numbers:Y7YC01X001); NSFC(grant numbers:91964202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9163417","Negative capacitance;nanowire FETs;SPICE model;negative DIBL;miller effect","Logic gates;Capacitance;Mathematical model;Inverters;Integrated circuit modeling;Semiconductor device modeling;SPICE","","21","","24","CCBY","10 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This research attempts to propose a multi-objective integrative control scenario that can simultaneously solve these problems satisfactorily in a unitary nonlinear control framework. Firstly, a dynamic mathematical model of PMSM is built under stator current vector orientation, and then the model of PMSM is combined with the vibration model of STS to establish the overall system model of STS driven by PMSM with considering motor's electrical loss. Then, a backstepping control principle-based multi-objective integrative control approach is proposed to realize the suppression of flexible load's vibration and the reduction of PMSM's torque ripple and electrical loss concurrently. Meanwhile, this research also designs a wide range speed identification method based on the least square algorithm with a forgetting factor.

Cost was modelled using different parameters, and the measurement of customer interruption cost (CIC) was acquired through surveys. Rotational load shedding, as experienced during more than a decade in South Africa, shares many characteristics with chronic interruptions and large system collapse scenarios. Since CIC data are based on electricity customers' valuations of their impacts from electricity interruptions, and allow only for a bottom-up estimation of the economic cost of large electricity interruption events (without considering sectoral interdependencies), an alternative assessment of the cost using a suitable macroeconomic model that employs less subjective data allows for a validation of CIC-based results and a determination of a plausible range of estimates of the cost of large electricity interruptions. We test this proposition using a combination of a time-dependent probabilistic CIC model based on CIC survey data, and a dynamic inoperability input-output model (DIIM) that accounts for sectoral interdependencies, economic resilience and the temporal variation of electricity interruption impacts.

To fulfill the requirements of high-speed operation and pursue further enhanced efficiency and power density of the inverter for the next-generation EAP drives, Silicon Carbide(SiC) semiconductor devices are considered for implementing the 5L-ANPC inverter. However, the large commutation loops associated with certain switching states of the inverter lessen the benefits of configuring all the switches as SiC devices. As a result, a hybrid Si/SiC 5L-ANPC inverter is developed with a synchronous optimal pulse(SOP) width modulation strategy for controlling the switches in cell 2 and finite-control-set model predictive controller(FCS-MPC) for those in cell 3 of the inverter. Consequently, in the proposed topology, the SiC devices are merely used for the high-frequency switches in cell 3 and the rest of the low-frequency switches are configured with Si IGBTs.

However, despite of stator leakage flux, high rare-earth PM usage, PMFSM is subjected to slot effects due to presence of both PM and CAW in stator and partial saturation due to double salient structure which generates cogging torque (Tcog), torque ripples (Trip) and lower average torque (Tavg). To overcome aforesaid demerits, this paper presents Partitioned PM (PPM) Consequent Pole Flux Switching Machine (PPM-CPFSM) with flux barriers to enhance flux modulation, curtail PM usage and diminish stator leakage flux which reduces slotting effects and partial saturation to ultimately reduces Tcog and Trlp. In comparison with the existing state of the art, proposed PPM-CPFSM reduces 46.53% of the total PM volume and offer Tavg higher up to 88.8%, suppress Trlp maximum up to 24.8%, diminish Tcog up to 22.74% and offer 2.45 times Tden and Pden. Furthermore, torque characteristics of proposed PPM-CPFSM is investigated utilizing space harmonics injection i.e. inverse cosine, inverse cosine with 3rd harmonics and rotor pole shaping techniques i.e., eccentric circle, chamfering and notching. Detailed electromagnetic performance analysis reveals that harmonics injection suppressed Tcog maximum up to 83.5%, Trip up to 40.72% at the cost of 4.71% Tavg. Finally, rotor mechanical stress analysis is utilized for rotor withstand capability and 3D-FEA based Coupled Electromagnetic-Thermal Analysis (CETA) for thermal behavior of the developed PPM-CPFSM.

This paper proposes a modeling and control method for an SST with magnetic integration and mixed-frequency modulation. A mathematical model based on dual d-q references is deduced, and then a cascaded control system is designed according to the model.

There are three key properties to consider when designing an efficient and effective prefetcher: timeliness, coverage, and accuracy. Timeliness is an essential property, as bringing instructions too early increases the risk of the instructions being evicted from the cache before their use while requesting them too late can lead to the instructions arriving past their designated execution time. Coverage is important to reduce the number of instruction cache misses (there is enough prefetching), and accuracy to ensure that the prefetcher does not pollute the cache or interacts negatively with the other hardware mechanisms (there is not too much prefetching). This letter presents the Entangling instruction prefetcher that entangles instructions to provide timeliness. The prefetcher works by finding which instruction should trigger the prefetch for a subsequent instruction, accounting for the latency of each cache miss. The prefetcher is carefully adjusted to account for both coverage and accuracy. Our evaluation shows that the Entangling I-prefetcher increases performance by 29.3 percent on average, with a coverage of 94.9 percent and accuracy of 77.4 percent.","1556-6064","","10.1109/LCA.2020.3002947","European Research Council(grant numbers:819134); Ramón y Cajal Research(grant numbers:RYC2018-025200-I); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119076","Instruction prefetcher;timely prefetching;performance","Prefetching;History;Magnetic heads;Timing;Computers;Hardware;Data structures","","19","","7","CCBY","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stability of the diode was investigated by exposing the sample to high temperature cycles (up to 873 K) for more than 10 times (totaling up to 120 hours), which exhibited no change between the I-V characteristics measured in each cycle. The dependence of ideality factor and Schottky barrier height on temperature along with an extracted Richardson's constant much smaller than the theoretical value (0.0461 A/cm2.K2), motivated us to study the possible reason for this anomaly. A modified thermionic emission model following Tung's analysis was used to explain the experimental observations.

For the transradial amputee, we also quantified the just-noticeable difference of intraneural microstimulation pulse frequency via chronically implanted Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays. We demonstrate that intensity discrimination is similar across conditions: intraneural microstimulation of the residual nerves, electrocutaneous stimulation of the reinnervated skin on the residual limb, and electrocutaneous stimulation of intact hands. We also show that intensity discrimination performance is significantly better at lower pulse frequencies than at higher pulse frequencies - a finding that's unique to electrocutaneous and intraneural stimulation and suggests that supplemental sensory cues may be present at lower pulse frequencies.

The investigated area is characterized by heterogeneous land cover types made up of natural and agricultural lands. To identify different levels of fire severity without using fixed thresholds, we applied SOM to the three spectral indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), and burned area index for sentinel (BAIS) used to enhance burned areas. This is a particular critical issue because fixed threshold values are generally not suitable for fragmented landscapes, vegetation types, and geographic regions different from those for which they were devised. To cope with this issue, the methodological approach herein proposed is based on three steps: 1) indices computation; 2) maps of the difference of the three indices computed using the data acquired from prefire and postfire occurrences; and 3) unsupervised classification obtained processing all the difference maps using the SOM.

The filtering slot antenna is composed of a dumbbell-shaped slot, two parasitic patches, eight slot-stubs and a feeding line with a pair of step impedance resonator (SIR) stubs. An additional resonance is generated to increase the bandwidth and a gain null is produced at the upper band-edge to improve the frequency selectivity by loading parasitic patches in the dumbbell-shaped slot. Eight slot-stubs adjacent to the dumbbell-shaped slot are etched to enhance the impedance matching. In addition, the bandwidth is further broadened and two gain nulls are realized at both band-edges by adding a pair of SIR stubs. Moreover, the gain nulls can be adjusted individually by the length of parasitic patches or SIR stubs. As a result, the gain curve of the proposed filtering slot antenna has good flatness and the frequency selectivity for both band-edges is significantly improved. A prototype has been manufactured and measured to verify the validity of the design. The measured impedance bandwidth of |S11| <; -10 dB is 62.5% (2.2 GHz - 4.2 GHz).

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based energy-efficient IoT video transmission scheme that protects against interference, in which the base station controls the transmission action of the IoT device including the encoding rate, the modulation and coding scheme, and the transmit power. A reinforcement learning algorithm state-action-reward-state-action is applied to choose the transmission action based on the observed state (the queue length of the buffer, the channel gain, the previous bit error rate, and the previous packet loss rate) without knowledge of the transmission channel model at the transmitter and the receiver. We also propose a deep reinforcement learning based energy-efficient IoT video transmission scheme that uses a deep neural network to approximate Q value to further accelerate the learning process involved in choosing the optimal transmission action and improve the video transmission performance. Moreover, both the performance bounds of the proposed schemes and the computational complexity are theoretically derived. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can increase the peak signal-to-noise ratio and decrease the packet loss rate, the delay, and the energy consumption relative to the benchmark scheme.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2020.0021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314164","Internet-of-Things (IoT);video transmission;reinforcement learning;energy efficiency","Streaming media;Encoding;Modulation;Interference;Base stations;Delays;Distortion","","18","","","","5 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Compared with its peers from the same class of inverters, the proposed one features an equal or lower components count referred to the boost factor. And, it presents an additional advantage: each voltage level can be obtained by using different capacitors in the discharging phase, such that the decreasing part of the staircase output waveform can be synthesized with different switching topologies than those used in the increasing part. As a consequence, all the capacitors are discharged at the same voltage value at the end of each half-cycle, allowing for the use of smaller capacitors of equal values. When the capacitors are connected in parallel in the charging phase, there is no need to equalize their voltages, so no additional current spikes appear. This also implies less electromagnetic emission (EMI). Two types of modulation strategies are proposed. A half-height fundamental switching frequency modulation strategy allows for reaching the desired peak of the output voltage during the highest voltage level operation. It is advantageous in application of the inverter as a front end of a grid supplied by green sources of energy. A high frequency (fs=200 kHz) modulation strategy accompanied by a duty-cycle control is advantageous for applications which require miniaturization. A 9-level switched-capacitor multi-level inverter (SCMLI) is analyzed and designed. The power losses are calculated. The experimental results for a 9-level inverter with Vin=40 V, Vout=110 Vrms 50 Hz, 200 W confirm the theoretical expectations.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2020.000029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316851","Switched-capacitor;multi-level inverter;half-height frequency modulation","Capacitors;Switches;Topology;Multilevel inverters;Voltage control;Switching circuits;Frequency modulation","","18","","","","8 Jan 2021","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Conventional imaging techniques such as CT, MRI provide critical information for diagnosis and treatment planning, but are less practical due to either technical complexity or ionizing radiation-related safety. Microwave-pumped thermoacoustic imaging (MTAI) is a promising alternative to real-time bioimaging due to its deep imaging depth, high resolution and minimal biological hazards. More importantly, by mapping the distribution of microwave absorbers, this method can also provide a new perspective for noninvasively observing the anatomy and functional structure of the target. In this work, we introduce a concept of in situ MTAI guidance by combining MTAI and an accurate spatial definition of invasive apparatus used in potential procedures. By mounting tiny MTAI beacons on the apparatus, it is possible to accurately reconstruct the relative position of the device to the target tissue for either real time visual guidance or as the foundation for potential automated procedures. The image quality including its applicable depth and resolution, the accuracy of the device localization is analyzed and tested with simulated breast tumor to demonstrate the capacity of the proposed technique.

The optimized linear correlation with stable Vth variability is obtained except for the “unbalance region” affected by the combination of grain boundaries and positions with these grain size mean and sigma values resulting in the slightly shrinking Vth variability.

It uses a Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) placed between two different antennas. For one antenna, the FSS acts as an electromagnetically transparent structure, so the electromagnetic wave will penetrate the FSS and radiates into the free space. For the other one, the FSS acts as an artificial magnetic conductor, reflecting the incoming energy. With this design, two adjacent antennas could keep their individual performance especially radiation patterns normal. It is worth noting that although the FSS has been used in many aspects, such as reducing antenna's radar cross section or reducing the coupling between the identical antennas, its application in the field of `different antennas decoupling' is the first time. An embodiment is displayed in this paper for verification. Two antennas worked at different bands of 5G are placed very close with an FSS structure inserted. It turns out that the whole antenna has good electrical and radiation properties over the working band. This decoupling strategy can be very useful in 5G Massive MIMO application.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012665","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901321,61627901); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151940","Dual-polarized antenna;decoupling method;fifth generation mobile communication","Frequency selective surfaces;5G mobile communication;Radar antennas;Feeds;MIMO communication;Antenna radiation patterns","","16","","13","CCBY","29 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, it will bring severe challenges to the stable operation of the power grid. In order to mitigate those problems, the power ramp rate control (PRRC) is required by some utilities. Generally, the PRRC can be achieved by using two methods: energy storage systems (ESS) or active power curtailment. However, there is a lack of comparison of those methods on economic performance. Usually, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) index is adopted to quantify and compare the cost for different methods. In previous work, an ideal value of ESS lifetime is mostly set to analyze the LCOE. However, the different ESS methods may require the battery to operate at different regimes (i.e., number of cycles and depth of discharger), which directly affects the lifetime. Thus, the battery aging is necessarily introduced to compare the LCOE. In order to fill this gap, this work demonstrates an evaluation of aging through the annual simulations using actual irradiance data. This is done for the LCOE of different PRRCs to determine which is the most cost-effective method.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2020.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316319","Active power curtailment;energy storage system;levelized cost of energy;photovoltaic (PV) energy;power ramp rate control","Batteries;Aging;Smoothing methods;Photovoltaic systems;Layout;Economics;Predictive models","","16","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

It is found that with different cost function and attack budget, the best attack strategy changes. When the budget is low and attacking hubs costs much more than attacking an unimportant node, then the high-degree attack (HDA) strategy performs worse than the low-degree attack (LDA) strategy. On the contrary, HDA is always a better strategy when the budget is high. Therefore, there is an intersection before and after that different attack strategies perform better.

The controller controls the voltage and maintains the frequency within the limits while working with both linear and nonlinear loads for varying wind speeds. The admittance algorithm is simple and easy to implement and works very efficiently to generate the triggering signals for the controller of the WPHU. The wind power harnessing unit comprising of a squirrel cage induction generator, a star-delta transformer, a battery storage system and the control unit are modeled using Matlab/Simulink R2019. An isolated transformer with a star-delta configuration connects the load and the generator circuit with the controller to reduce the dc bus voltage and mitigate current in the neutral line. The response of the system during the dynamic loading depends on the best possible compensator proportional-integral (PI) gains. The antlion optimization algorithm is compared with particle swarm optimization and grey wolf optimization and is found to have the advantages of good convergence, high efficiency and fast calculating speed. It is therefore used to extract the optimal values of frequency and voltage PI gains. The simulation results of the control algorithm for the WPHU are validated in a real-time environment in a dSpace1104 laboratory set up. This algorithm is proven to have a quick response, maintain the required frequency, suppress the current harmonics, regulate voltage, help in balancing the load and compensating for the neutral current.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2020.000022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9215146","Wind power harnessing unit;induction generator;admittance based control algorithm;ant lion optimization algorithm;voltage and frequency control;battery energy storage system","Wind power generation;Voltage control;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Power quality;Induction generators","","15","","","","6 Oct 2020","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

This method involves the improved physical model of semiconductor devices, which discards the non-physical feedback parameter introduced by some previous research. At the same time, through the decoupling of the submodule and the bridge arm circuit, the order of the large-scale system is reduced so that the sub-modules can be calculated in parallel, greatly reducing the overall calculation burden of the model and accelerating the nonlinear small time-step simulation. The wideband characteristics of the converter valve tower are fully considered, with each of the bridge arms regarded as a two-port network with independent sources. The parameter integration and distribution process can also achieve complete parallel calculation.

The electron leakage arises from the unbalanced electron and hole injection efficiencies. The correlation between the efficiency droop and the electron leakage can be numerically calculated by manipulating the conduction band barrier height of the p-AlGaN electron blocking layer (p-EBL) for the proposed DUV LEDs. For the purpose of demonstrating that the efficiency droop for DUV LEDs can be experimentally decreased by reducing the electron leakage, a p+-GaN/In0.15Ga0.85N/n+-GaN tunnel junction on DUV LED is grown by using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technology. The tunnel junction helps to enhance the hole injection, thus decreasing the electron leakage and the efficiency droop. Moreover, the parasitic emission in the p-type hole injection layer is no longer observed thanks to the decreased electron leakage level.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2020.2997343","National Key R & D Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0400800,2016YFB0400801); Graduate Innovation Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:CXZZBS2020027); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:F2017202052); Program for Top 100 Innovative Talents in Colleges and Universities of Hebei Province(grant numbers:SLRC2017032); Program for 100-Talent-Plan of Hebei Province(grant numbers:E2016100010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099624","DUV LED;efficiency droop;electron leakage;Auger recombination","Light emitting diodes;Radiative recombination;Junctions;Charge carrier processes;Current density;Aluminum gallium nitride","","15","","32","CCBY","25 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two rectangular slots are etched on the top surface of the SIW cavity, which are used to interfere the original current flow of one particular mode and generate radiation. These orthogonal dual-modes are used to obtain a filtering response. Their resonance frequencies are close to each other leading to field rotation and interaction with a radiation null generated outside the passband. The radiation and filtering function are achieved simultaneously by the dual-mode cavity, therefore only one cavity is required, resulting in a compact and simple antenna configuration.

However, the large number of semiconductor devices utilized in the FCML inverters degrades the hardware reliability, which may constrain such converters from being applied in safety-critical applications. Targeting at open-circuit switching faults, a fast online fault diagnostic method for FCML inverters is presented. Conventional phase-shifted PWM (PSPWM), which can naturally balance the voltage across flying capacitors, is used as the modulation method in this work. Hence, to retain the simplicity feature of the PSPWM, the proposed diagnostic method is developed so that it does not require any voltage measurements of flying capacitors. Only the output AC voltage and current data along with the switching PWM signals from the microcontroller are needed to detect an open-circuit switching fault, and all such sensory data is typically available in the inverter, requiring no additional sensors or hardware for the implementation of this diagnostic method. The detection process takes 5% of the fundamental period of the inverter output signals to diagnose the faulty switch. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic method.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2020.000030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316852","Open-circuit;fault diagnosis;flying capacitor;multilevel inverter;wide bandgap devices;PSPWM","Capacitors;Switches;Voltage measurement;Inverters;Circuit faults;Switching circuits;Pulse width modulation","","14","","","","8 Jan 2021","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Assessing CVR with fMRI, we can measure the change in the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response induced by a change in CO2 pressure (%BOLD/mmHg). However, there exists a temporal offset between the recorded CO2 pressure and the local BOLD response, due to both measurement and physiological delays. If this offset is not corrected for, voxel-wise CVR values will not be accurate. In this paper, we propose a framework for mapping hemodynamic lag in breath-hold fMRI data. As breath-hold tasks drive task-correlated head motion artifacts in BOLD fMRI data, our framework for lag estimation fits a model that includes polynomial terms and head motion parameters, as well as a shifted variant of the CO2 regressor (±9 s in 0.3 s increments), and the hemodynamic lag at each voxel is the shift producing the maximum total model R2 within physiological constraints. This approach is evaluated in 8 subjects with multi-echo fMRI data, resulting in robust maps of hemodynamic delay that show consistent regional variation across subjects, and improved contrast-to-noise compared to methods where motion regression is ignored or performed earlier in preprocessing.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176225","","Hemodynamics;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Optimization;Task analysis;Delays;Blood;Physiology","Brain;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Hemodynamics;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Oxygen","14","","20","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A three-way decision-based model is proposed for adaptive scheduling of phased radar dwell time. Using the model, the threat posed by a target is measured by an evaluation function, and therefore, a target is assigned to one of the three possible decision regions, i.e., positive region, negative region, and boundary region. A different region has a various priority in terms of resource demand, and as such, a different radar resource allocation decision is applied to each region to satisfy different tracking accuracies of multi-target. In addition, the dwell time scheduling model can be further optimized by implementing a strategy for determining a proper threshold of three-way decision making to optimize the thresholds adaptively in real-time. The advantages and the performance of the proposed model have been verified by experimental simulations with comparison to the traditional two-way decision model and the three-way decision model without threshold optimization. The experiential results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model has a certain advantage in detecting high threat targets.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127912","phased array radar resource scheduling;three-way decision;threat assessment","Radar tracking;Modeling;Adaptation models;Target tracking;Phased arrays;Decision making","","14","","","","29 Jun 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

This study proposes a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm based on the selected high-density areas by automatic fuzzy-DBSCAN (AFD) which works with the initialization of two parameters. AFD, by using fuzzy and DBSCAN features, is modeled by the selection of high-density areas and generates two parameters for merging and separating automatically. The two generated parameters provide a state of sub-cluster rules in the Cartesian coordinate system for the dataset. The model overcomes the problems of clustering such as morphology, overlapping, and the number of clusters in a dataset simultaneously. In the experiments, all algorithms are performed on eight data sets with 30 times of running. Three of them are related to overlapping real datasets and the rest are morphologic and synthetic datasets. It is demonstrated that the AFD algorithm outperforms other recently developed clustering algorithms.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316405","clustering;density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN);fuzzy;overlapping;data mining","Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Morphology;Modeling;Meters;Adaptation models;Unsupervised learning","","14","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

In order to solve these problems, a novel resonant frequency tracking control for linear compressor based on model reference adaptive system (MRAS) is proposed in this paper, and the parameter adaptive rate is derived by the Popov's hyperstability theory, so that the system resonant frequency can be directly calculated through the parameter adaptive rate. Furthermore, the traditional algorithm needs to calculate the piston stroke signal by integrating the back-EMF, which has the problem of integral drift.

The FSS is designed by etching the conductive pattern on a single layer substrate. Two fractal slots are designed to increase the spatial efficiency of the pattern and provide two isolated resonances. For the dual-band FSS, the miniaturization should work for both of the resonances to keep the frequency ratio. Therefore, the slots are convoluted as different principles and twisted with each other to keep the miniaturization and isolation. With the third-order fractal pattern, two pass-bands are achieved at 1.04 GHz and 1.49 GHz with the frequency ratio of 1.42. The dimension of the element is as compact as 0.039λ× 0.039λ where λ is the wavelength of low frequency resonance. Moreover, benefiting from the miniaturized element, the angular stability is very good that the resonances keep stable when the incident angle increasing from 0° to 60°.

In the neutral-type neural networks, the states of the neurons involve multiple time-varying delays and time derivative of states of neurons include discrete time delays. We note that the neutral-type neural network cannot be expressed in the vector-matrix form due to multiple time-varying delays and discrete neutral delays, which leads to linear matrix inequality approach can not be employed to obtain stability conditions of this type of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Therefore, it is difficult for stability analysis of this type of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks to find suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and effective method. This paper constructs an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employs M-matrix property to derive new sufficient conditions ensuring the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point of the neutral-type Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with multiple time-varying delays in the states and discrete delays in the time derivative of the states. The obtained stability conditions are easy to validate by testing basic matrix property. A constructive example is presented to indicate applicability of the obtained stability criteria.

Few publications aims to extract more bits out of one PUF-cell, but struggle with non-uniform distributions. In this brief multi-valued symbol extraction is presented as a method to extract more bits of information out of each individual RO. A new post-processing approach is introduced to produce close-to-ideal uniformly distributed responses independent of the underlying physically probability distribution. To eliminate bias, caused by placement inequalities, multiple methods of normalization are utilized and analyzed by means of area and complexity. Based on metrics for symbol transmission, the Euclidean-distance and entropy are used as metrics to evaluate the uniqueness and reliability of multi-valued PUFs.

First, the Caputo fractional difference is used to discretize the model, and the least square method is used to solve the parameters. The orders of accumulations and differential equations are determined by using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, the analytical solution of the model is obtained by using the Laplace transform, and the convergence and divergence of series in analytical solutions are also discussed. Finally, the CFGMC(q, N) model is used to predict the municipal solid waste (MSW). Compared with other competition models, the model has the best prediction effect.

The previous models were mainly adopted by the Beer-Lambert law, or by classical Monte Carlo simulation combined with the fog drop size distribution. Unfortunately, the estimation deviation was eventually not fall within the acceptable range for FSO link budget analysis. We established a link attenuation model based on Monte Carlo simulation and Kim formula.

The oxygen flow can suppress the oxygen vacancy density, but introduce shallow states near the conduction edges. The electron can tunnel into gate oxide via these shallow states. As a result, the IGZO channel with oxygen flow has more electrons trapped in the gate oxide than the channel without oxygen flow, leading to more positive VT shift after positive bias temperature instability. The IGZO without oxygen flow create oxygen vacancy (VO) in the channel. The hole generated by impact ionization during the hot electron injection can be trapped in VO to form VO2+. The VO2+ leads to less positive VT shift for IGZO channel without oxygen flow than with the oxygen flow. Since the impact ionization occurs near the drain, the positive VT shift of the reverse measurement (VSD > 0) is smaller than the forward measurement (VDS > 0) after hot electron injection.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2020.2993018","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 108-2622-8-002-016,MOST 108-2218-E-002-027); Ministry of Education, Taiwan(grant numbers:NTU-CC-109L891601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089236","Amorphous InGaZnO;thin film transistor;positive bias temperature instability;hot carrier injection;reliability;oxygen flow;ionized oxygen vacancies","Stress;Logic gates;Human computer interaction;Electron traps;Temperature measurement;Current measurement;Thin film transistors","","12","","26","CCBY","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two data representation methods, namely, recurrence plot (RP) and Gramian angular field (GAF), are used to transform the raw time series to a 2D matrix for establishing the temporal correlations between different time intervals and extracting the structural patterns from the time series. Then an improved DAE is proposed to reconstruct the missing values from the 2D representation of time series. A comprehensive comparison is conducted amongst the different representations on standard datasets. Results show that the 2D representations have a lower reconstruction error than the raw time series, and the RP representation provides the best outcome.

However, validation of these novel technologies against PSG is required. The current study aims to evaluate the sleep staging performance of the radar-based Circadia Contactless Breathing Monitor (model C100) and proprietary Sleep Analysis Algorithm, both in a home and sleep lab environment, on cohorts of healthy sleepers. The C100 device was initially used to record 17 nights of sleep data from 9 participants alongside PSG, with a subsequent 24 nights of PSG data for validation purposes. Respiration and body movement features were extracted from sensor data, and a machine learning algorithm was developed to perform sleep stage prediction. The algorithm was trained using PSG data obtained in the initial dataset (n=17), and validated using leave- one-subject-out cross-validation. An epoch-by-epoch recall (true positive rate) of 75.0 %, 59.9 %, 74.8 % and 57.1 %, was found for `Deep', `Light', `REM' and `Wake' respectively. Highly similar results were obtained in the independent validation dataset (n=24), indicating robustness of results and generalizability of the sleep staging model, at least in the healthy population. The device was found to outperform both a consumer and medical grade wrist-worn monitoring device (Fitbit Alta HR and Philips Respironics Actiwatch) on sleep metric estimation accuracy. These results indicate that the developed non-contact monitor forms a viable alternative to existing clinically used wrist-worn methods, and that longitudinal monitoring of sleep stages in a home environment becomes feasible.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175419","","Performance evaluation;Sleep;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Standards;Prediction algorithms","Algorithms;Humans;Polysomnography;Respiration;Sleep;Sleep Stages","12","","11","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been speculated that gaze estimation accuracy might be improved by using the vestibulo-ocular reflex. This involuntary reflex results in slow, compensatory eye movements, opposing the direction of head motion. We therefore hypothesised that leaving the head to move freely during eye tracking must produce more accurate results than keeping the head fixed, only allowing the eyes to move. The purpose of this study was to create a low-cost eye tracking system that incorporates the vestibulo-ocular reflex in gaze estimation, by keeping the head freely moving. The instrument used comprised a low-cost head-mounted webcam which recorded a single eye. Pupil detection was fully automatic and in real time with a straightforward hybrid colour-based and model-based algorithm, despite the lower-end webcam used for recording and despite the absence of direct illumination. A model-based algorithm and an interpolation-based algorithm were tested in this study. Based on mean absolute angle difference in the gaze estimation results, we conclude that the model-based algorithm performed better when the head was not moving and equally well when the head was moving. With most deviations of the points of gaze from the target points being less than 1° using either algorithm when the head is moving freely, it can be concluded that our setup performs fully within the 2° benchmark from literature, whereas deviations when the head was not moving exceeded 2°. The algorithms used were not previously tested under passive illumination. This was the first study of a low-cost eye-tracking setup taking into account the vestibulo-ocular reflex.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2020.9142605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142605","Pupil tracking;video-oculography;eye position mapping;VO reflex","Head;Estimation;Magnetic heads;Lighting;Gaze tracking;Webcams;Eye protection","","12","","35","","16 Jul 2020","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Using a 10 s window starting at the earthquake origin time, we find that the CNN is capable of accurately predicting IMs at stations far from the epicentre which have not yet recorded the maximum ground shaking. The CNN IM predictions do not require previous knowledge of the earthquake source (location and magnitude). Comparison between the CNN model predictions and those obtained with the Bindi et al. GMPE (which requires location and magnitude) shows that the CNN model features similar error variance but smaller bias. Although the technique is not strictly designed for earthquake early warning, we find that it can provide useful estimates of ground motions within 15–20 s after earthquake origin time depending on various setup elements (e.g. times for data transmission, computation, latencies). The technique has been tested on raw data without any initial data pre-selection in order to closely replicate real-time data streaming.

However, the SR-based image fusion algorithm has the characteristics of high computational complexity and neglecting the local features of an image, resulting in limited image detail retention and a high registration misalignment sensitivity. In order to overcome these shortcomings and the noise existing in the image of the fusion process, this paper proposes a new signal decomposition model, namely the multi-source image fusion algorithm of the gradient regularization convolution SR (CSR). The main innovation of this work is using the sparse optimization function to perform two-scale decomposition of the source image to obtain high-frequency components and low-frequency components. The sparse coefficient is obtained by the gradient regularization CSR model, and the sparse coefficient is taken as the maximum value to get the optimal high frequency component of the fused image. The best low frequency component is obtained by using the fusion strategy of the extreme or the average value. The final fused image is obtained by adding two optimal components. Experimental results demonstrate that this method greatly improves the ability to maintain image details and reduces image registration sensitivity.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127909","gradient regularization;convolution sparse representation (CSR);image fusion","Image fusion;Dictionaries;Convolution;Modeling;Image registration;Optimization;Symmetric matrices","","12","","","","29 Jun 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

A major limitation of our prior work is that BMA volume increases significantly as the low cutoff frequency is reduced. This is particularly troublesome for into-body applications where low operating frequencies are needed to penetrate deep into the tissues. Here, we overcome this challenge via a novel design that extends the BMA's conducting flares along the tissue surface. In doing so, the antenna's lowest operating frequency is reduced, while its volume remains unaltered. For an example BMA of 1161.3 mm3 in volume, our new approach results in lowering the cutoff frequency from 1.9 GHz to 830 MHz. Additional novelties brought forward include: (a) the first testing of BMAs through stratified tissue models (as opposed to homogeneous models explored in the past), and (b) the smallest volume BMA reported to date, which also exhibits the lowest frequency cutoff as well as comparable or better transmission loss vs. previous designs.","2637-6431","","10.1109/OJAP.2020.2988133","Consortium on Electromagnetics and Radio Frequencies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9068212","Biomedical telemetry;engineered dielectrics;into-body antenna;wearable antenna","Cutoff frequency;Broadband antennas;Dielectrics;Muscles;Skin;Propagation losses","","11","","28","CCBY","15 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Notably, the biasing wires, which are generally used in designing reconfigurable antennas, are not necessary in the proposed design. Thus, the undesirable effects of the biasing wires on the antenna's operating characteristics can be eliminated.

We compared the prediction accuracies of the conventional method and long short-term memory (LSTM) using non-invasive MEG signals. This is the first study that applied LSTM to predict arm movements from non-invasive neural signals. The coefficients of correlation between real signals and signals predicted by the MLR on the x-, y-, and z-axes were 0.677 ± 0.139 (mean ± SD), 0.689 ± 0.140, and 0.785 ± 0.103, respectively.

The low frequency of the shaft-rate magnetic field provides long propagation distance, high stability, and low interference by sea conditions and other noises. The magnetic field signal has an important role in target and location detection. In the developed model, the magnetic moment of the rotating magnetic dipole is decomposed into three orthogonal magnetic moments indicated by  $m_{p},m_{f}$  and  $m_{l}$ . The mentioned moments can be obtained through a three-component integration of the measured magnetic field of the rotating dipole at a point. The relation between the eigenvectors of these orthogonal magnetic moments and the coordinates of the observation position is employed to obtain the coordinates and the magnetic target position. In the simulation, the relative and absolute errors of the location method are analyzed, while the measurement noise confines the positioning distance. Finally, the rotating magnetic field of 80 points is measured, and the feasibility of the rotating magnetic model is verified. Besides, the relative mean error of 80 points is equal to 3.7%, demonstrating the feasibility of the location method.

A study is conducted in the present paper of potential improvements to the performance of artificial neural network (ANN) models in terms of efficiency and stability. Generally, current ANN models have been developed by considering exclusively the meteorological information of the wind farm reference station, in addition to selecting a fixed number of time periods prior to the forecasting. In this respect, new ANN models are proposed in this paper, which are developed by: varying the number of prior 1-h periods (periods prior to the forecasting hour) chosen for the input layer parameters; and/or incorporating in the input layer data from a second weather station in addition to the wind farm reference station. It has been found that the model performance is always improved when data from a second weather station are incorporated. The mean absolute relative error (MARE) of the new models is reduced by up to 7.5%. Furthermore, the longer the forecasting horizon, the greater the degree of improvement.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2018.000792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9082068","Artificial neural networks (ANN);wind power forecasting;model performance;wind power output","Forecasting;Predictive models;Wind farms;Wind power generation;Mathematical model;Data models;Artificial neural networks","","11","","32","","29 Apr 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Recently, advances in sensor technology enable the production of printed sweat sensors applicable for the use in wearable devices. However, the remaining challenge is the determination of the physiological correlation between blood and sweat components. In this study, we conducted ammonia measurements in blood and sweat during a stepwise incremental cycle ergometer test in 40 subjects under completely controlled conditions in a clinical environment to determine the correlation between the ammonium concentrations in blood and sweat. Samples were taken for each workload step separately. Sweat was sampled directly from the upper body, blood was taken from an indwelling cannula at the end of each workload step, respectively. For meaningful classification of the measured quantities, blood lactate and heart rate were monitored additionally. The results for blood ammonium concentration show increasing behavior in good accordance with the established indicators for physical exhaustion, whereas sweat ammonium concentration seems to decrease with workload. This is found to be due to dilution, as sweat rate increases. The presented results provide insight in the correlation between blood and sweat parameters and therefore are of high importance for further development of wearable devices.Clinical Relevance-Sweat sensing opens up new possibilities for non-invasive, continuous in-situ monitoring of physiological parameters for healthcare and sports science applications.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175434","","Blood;Protocols;Biomedical monitoring;Heart rate;Correlation;Monitoring","Ammonia;Ammonium Compounds;Humans;Sports;Sweat;Wearable Electronic Devices","11","","18","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yeh proposed a transaction scheme based on a certificateless signature scheme for IoT-based mobile payments implementing on Android Pay.

The finite-element method (FEM) is used to predict the electromagnetic characteristics of the designed motor with improved performance. Two topologies are investigated, namely the integral-slot and distributed-windings method and the fractional-slot and double-layer concentrated windings method. Both motors are analyzed and optimized. FEM reveals that, compared with the integral-slot motor, the fractional-slot motor offers significantly enhanced performance, including reduced cogging torque, improved back electromotive force (back EMF), and decreased magnetic flux leakage.

However, analyzing chest X-ray images may be tedious, time-consuming and requiring expert knowledge that might not be available in less-developed regions. therefore, computer-aided diagnosis systems are needed. Recently, many classification systems based on deep learning have been proposed. Despite their success, the high development cost for deep networks is still a hurdle for deployment. Deep transfer learning (or simply transfer learning) has the merit of reducing the development cost by borrowing architectures from trained models followed by slight fine-tuning of some layers. Nevertheless, whether deep transfer learning is effective over training from scratch in the medical setting remains a research question for many applications. In this work, we investigate the use of deep transfer learning to classify pneumonia among chest X-ray images. Experimental results demonstrated that, with slight fine-tuning, deep transfer learning brings performance advantage over training from scratch. Three models, ResNet-50, Inception V3 and DensetNet121, were trained separately through transfer learning and from scratch. The former can achieve a 4.1% to 52.5% larger area under the curve (AUC) than those obtained by the latter, suggesting the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for classifying pneumonia in chest X-ray images.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175594","","Lung;Diseases;Training;X-rays;Testing;Computational modeling;Biomedical imaging","Deep Learning;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Humans;Pneumonia;Radiography;X-Rays","10","","20","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quality of the training dataset is critical to run-time performance, but it is difficult to label hand kinematics accurately after the hand has been amputated. We quantified the accuracy and precision of labeling hand kinematics for two different training approaches: 1) assuming a participant is perfectly mimicking predetermined motions of a prosthesis (mimicked training), and 2) assuming a participant is perfectly mirroring their contralateral hand during identical bilateral movements (mirrored training). We compared these approaches in non-amputee individuals, using an infrared camera to track eight different joint angles of the hands in real-time. Aggregate data revealed that mimicked training does not account for biomechanical coupling or temporal changes in hand posture. Mirrored training was significantly more accurate and precise at labeling hand kinematics. However, when training a modified Kalman filter to estimate motor intent, the mimicked and mirrored training approaches were not significantly different. The results suggest that the mirrored training approach creates a more faithful but more complex dataset. Advanced algorithms, more capable of learning the complex mirrored training dataset, may yield better run-time prosthetic control.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175388","","Kinematics;Training;Electromyography;Couplings;Biomechanics;Timing;Training data","Amputees;Artificial Limbs;Electromyography;Hand;Humans;Supervised Machine Learning","10","","14","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A single rectangular DR operating at TE1δ1 and TE1δ3 modes can be differentially fed by the coplanar strip line (CPS) and then is used as a driver, which functions as a dual-mode magnetic dipole (M-dipole) resulting from the TE1δ1 and TE1δ3 modes. Thus, a dual-band quasi-Yagi antenna with two close operation frequencies can be designed, meanwhile, the two bands can be independently controlled. Based on this, a wide-band quasi-Yagi antenna is introduced by adding two metal directors with different sizes on the top and bottom layers of the supporting substrate. The two directors provide two additional resonant frequencies, turning dual-band antenna into a wide-band one. To verify the design concepts, two prototypes of dual- and wide-band antennas are fabricated and measured. Good agreement between the simulated and measured results can be observed. The wide-band antenna has a measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth of 21.7 % (9.33 - 11.6 GHz).

An important aspect of such efforts is the real-time performance consideration since power systems are bound by the rules of physics and all control/communication tasks need to be completed in a certain time frame. Security schemes for substation communication have been proposed in the recent literature. However, they must be improved to ensure a full security solution. Recently published IEC 62351 standard aims to fill this gap. Node authentication is vital for substation communication networks based on IEC 61850 to mitigate a variety of attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

Since the ballbot is an underactuated system, previous studies have designed controllers using a hierarchical strategy and/or multi-loop approach. However, multi-loop control systems require several controllers and the hierarchical strategy has a local minimum problem that does not guarantee the convergence of all errors globally. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a virtual angle and design a sliding mode controller with a single-loop control system. As a result, the proposed controller is simple and can achieve simultaneous tracking and balancing of the ballbot. From Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that the tracking and balancing errors of the ballbot are uniformly ultimately bounded and can be made arbitrarily small. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the proposed control system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3020091","Korea Government(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1A2C1087552); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9179759","Ballbot;trajectory tracking;balancing;underactuated system;virtual angle","Trajectory tracking;Convergence;Robustness;Uncertainty;Wheels;Trajectory","","9","","20","CCBY","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The focus of this paper is to demonstrate the fading independence between space and frequency diversity GNSS signals. In harsh urban environments, multipath components arrive to the mobile receiver antenna with different phases and Doppler shifts, therefore giving rise to the discontinuity of code and Doppler observations and large tracking errors. In this paper, an empirical model of fading GNSS signals is constructed, including power fluctuations and spread metrics. Based on this model, real BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) signals from two GNSS dual-frequency antennas are characterized, at both information and signal level. The block processing algorithm is utilized for signal investigation. Results show that: (1) a high proportion of asynchronous loss-of-lock (around 16%) is experienced by observations of diversity signals; and (2) power fluctuations of fading signals are uncorrelated in frequency separated branches unconditionally, yet for space diversity signals the independency exists in dynamic fading channels only. The results above corroborate the significant potential gain of diversity reception, and could be further implemented in researches of diversity combined GNSS parameter estimation in dense fading conditions.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821521","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS);space/frequency diversity reception;power fluctuation;fading characterization","Fading channels;Global navigation satellite system;Satellites;Doppler effect;Receivers;Diversity reception;Frequency diversity","","9","","","","2 Sep 2019","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

A maximum pump-to-idler conversion efficiency of 19.6% was achieved when the number of intra-burst sub-pulses was set to be 240. By increasing the number of intraburst sub-pulses to be about 480, the maximum average output power of 7.9 W at 3.8 μm was realized under pump power of 45.3 W. The corresponding pump-to-idler conversion efficiency was computed to be about 17.5%. The experimental results show an improvement of 40% in pump-to-idler conversion efficiency for this quasi-synchronously pumped OPO when compared with the conventional long laser pulse pumped OPO.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2984339","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61405174); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY18F050010); Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:2015C33160); Science and Technology Foundation of Wenzhou City(grant numbers:G20180022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9050715","Mid-infrared;optical parametric oscillator;quasi-synchronously pumped;burst-mode fiber laser","Pump lasers;Optical pumping;Fiber lasers;Optical pulses;Optical fibers","","9","","19","CCBY","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transition is formed by two halves, minimizing the manufacturing complexity and the loss contact. A sequential procedure has been followed in the design process. Initially, a port directly feeding the planar structure has been considered, obtaining a simulated return loss level better than 25 dB in the whole operation band. Afterward, feeding through an SubMiniature version A (SMA) coaxial connector, a simulated return loss level better than 20 dB has been obtained.

From the perspective of system-of-systems, this paper proposes a unified framework called structure-oriented weapon system portfolio selection (SWSPS) to solve the weapon system portfolio selection problem based on structural invulnerability. First, the types of equipment and the relationship between the equipment are sorted out based on the operation loop theory, and a heterogeneous combat network model of the weapon equipment system is established by abstracting the equipment and their relationships into different types of nodes and edges respectively. Then, based on the combat network model, the operation loop comprehensive evaluation index (OLCEI) is introduced to quantitatively describe the structural robustness of the combat network. Next, a weapon system combination selection model is established with the goal of maximizing the operation loop comprehensive evaluation index within the constraints of capability requirements and budget limitations. Finally, our proposed SWSPS is demonstrated through a case study of an armored infantry battalion. The results show that our proposed SWSPS can achieve excellent performance in solving the weapon system portfolio selection problem, which yields many meaningful insights and guidance to the future equipment development planning.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316403","heterogeneous combat network;structural robustness;weapon system portfolio selection;equipment development planning","Weapons;Portfolios;Robustness;Complex networks;Planning;Indexes;Correlation","","9","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

To avoid connection requests being unnecessarily delayed or even rejected, distribution companies need to adequately assess the extent to which LV networks can host solar PV. This study proposes a smart meter-driven methodology to quickly estimate the hosting capacity of LV networks without the need for complex and detailed network studies or the adoption of generic assumptions. Using smart meter data, a simple – yet practical – univariate regression model is trained to estimate the average (diversified) active power per customer that can lead to voltages outside the upper statutory limit. This value, in turn, can be used to calculate the additional PV capacity that can be hosted by the LV network. The proposed methodology is adopted considering smart meter data produced from realistic simulations of progressive PV penetrations on a real Australian HV feeder supplying 79 LV networks. Findings show that the proposed analytical technique provides adequate estimations of hosting capacity, making it a faster and simpler alternative to model-based approaches.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583010","","","","9","","4","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

As interleaved radar pulses become more complex and denser, intelligent classification of radar signals has become very important. The self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is an excellent artificial neural network, which has huge advantages in intelligent classification of complex data. However, the de-interleaving process based on SOFM is faced with the problems that the initialization of the map size relies on prior information and the network topology cannot be adaptively adjusted. In this paper, an SOFM with self-adaptive network topology (SANT-SOFM) algorithm is proposed to solve the above problems. The SANT-SOFM algorithm first proposes an adaptive proliferation algorithm to adjust the map size, so that the initialization of the map size is no longer dependent on prior information but is gradually adjusted with the input data. Then, structural optimization algorithms are proposed to gradually optimize the topology of the SOFM network in the iterative process, constructing an optimal SANT. Finally, the optimized SOFM network is used for de-interleaving radar signals. Simulation results show that SANT-SOFM could get excellent performance in complex EW environments and the probability of getting the optimal map size is over 95% in the absence of priori information.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180138","de-interleaving;self-organizing feature map (SOFM);self-adaptive network topology (SANT)","Network topology;Neurons;Radar;Topology;Clustering algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Electronic warfare","","9","","","","28 Aug 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The proposed architecture is tested using both raw GNSS observables (Pseudorange and Doppler frequency) and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems-grade (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements fused using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to aid the navigation solution.

With two satellites visible during the GNSS outage, the position error improved by one order of magnitude as opposed to a tightly coupled INS/GNSS scheme.

However, the performance of MIMO-VLC highly depends on channel correlation, which means that the system performs worse when the channels are more highly correlated. Some studies have developed techniques to alleviate channel correlation and improve the performance of spatial multiplexing MIMO-VLC systems. However, these works have not considered situations where all LEDs and PDs are integrated into a compact structure. In this paper, a single-user spatial multiplexing MIMO-VLC system with densely distributed LEDs (light emitting diodes) and PDs (photodiodes) is proposed. Designs of optimal signal vectors and system structures are introduced, to fulfill multiplexing gains when LEDs and PDs are set close to each other respectively. Numerical simulations are carried out and the results illustrate that the proposed system can realize multiplexing gains over the system where LEDs and PDs are distributed densely, and also outperforms the traditional repetition coding (RC) technique.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2020.3029185","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2015A030312006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216539","Multiple-input multiple-output visible light communications (MIMO-VLC);spatial multiplexing (SMP);optimal signal vectors;densely distributed LEDs and PDs","Light emitting diodes;Multiplexing;Receivers;Optical transmitters;MIMO communication;Correlation;Switched mode power supplies","","9","","8","CCBY","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from the conventional aircraft control allocation problem, the particular characteristic of actuators makes the actuator control command totally subject to integer constraints. In order to tackle this problem, first, the control allocation problem is described as an integer programming problem with two desired objectives. Then considering the requirement of real-time, a metaheuristic algorithm based on the Levy flight is introduced to tackling this problem. In order to improve the searching efficiency, several targeted and heuristic strategies including variable step length and inherited population initialization according to feedback and so on are designed. Moreover, to prevent the incertitude of the metaheuristic algorithm and ensure the flight stability, a guaranteed control strategy is designed. Finally, a time-varying simulation model is introduced to verifying the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The contrastive simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves superior tracking performance with appropriate actuator dynamics and computational time, and the improvements for efficiency are active and the parameter settings are reasonable.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180148","flight control;control allocation;optimization;Lévy flight;tracking control","Actuators;Aircraft;Aerospace control;Resource management;Ice;Atmospheric modeling","","9","","","","28 Aug 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Further, in CP-PLLs, the reset pulse of phase detector (PD) must be wide for proper PLL functioning, but this sets a lower limit on reference spurs. We propose a hybrid-PLL in a 7-nm FinFET CMOS that combines the best advantages of ADPLL and CP-PLL.

Therefore, target tracking in the Doppler radar is a nonlinear filtering problem. In order to handle this problem, the Kalman filter form of best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) with position measurements is proposed, which is combined with the sequential filtering algorithm to handle the Doppler measurement further, where the statistic characteristic of the converted measurement error is calculated based on the predicted information in the sequential filter. Moreover, the algorithm is extended to the maneuvering target tracking case, where the interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm is used as the basic framework and the model probabilities are updated according to the BLUE position filter and the sequential filter, and the final estimation is a weighted sum of the outputs from the sequential filters and the model probabilities. Simulation results show that compared with existing approaches, the proposed algorithm can realize target tracking with preferable tracking precision and the extended method can achieve effective maneuvering target tracking.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316399","Kalman filter;best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE);measurement conversion;sequential filter","Target tracking;Radar tracking;Filtering algorithms;Estimation;Kalman filters;Position measurement;Measurement uncertainty","","9","","","","6 Jan 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Thus, secure authentication and key agreement (AKA) schemes are indispensable to provide useful services in multi-server environments. In 2020, Ali et al. presented a three-factor symmetric key based secure AKA scheme for privacy and security in multi-server environments. Ali et al. claimed that their scheme can prevent various security attacks, and also ensure secure authentication. However, this comment shows that Ali et al.’s scheme suffers from many drawbacks, including session key exposure, man-in-the-middle (MITM), and masquerade attacks.

The resistive sheet layer is composed of a multiple bended strip resonator (MBSR) in the center and two metallic strips loaded with resistors beside MBSR. Two metallic strips loaded with resistors can be equivalent to serial RLC, and the MBSR can be equivalent to parallel LC circuit.

This paper proposes a new algorithm named improved tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) for moving target detection. Firstly, this paper establishes a moving target model and sparsely compensates the Doppler migration of the moving target in the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domain. Then, TQWT is adopted to decompose the signal based on the discrimination between the sea clutter and the target's oscillation characteristics, using the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) algorithm to get the wavelet coefficients. Furthermore, an energy selection method based on the optimal distribution of sub-bands energy is proposed to sparse the coefficients and reconstruct the target. Finally, experiments on the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) dataset indicate the performance of the proposed method and provide the basis for subsequent target detection.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127911","marine moving target detection;improved tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT);fractional Fourier transform (FRFT);basis pursuit denoising (BPDN)","Clutter;Acceleration;Object detection;Radar;Oscillators;Wavelet transforms;Q-factor","","8","","","","29 Jun 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The P-type doping can significantly reduce the intensity of the electric field at the gate oxide corner, and modulate the bulk electric field for the device. The breakdown voltage (BV) is therefore improved. As a result, the proposed SiC MOSFET has a better trade-off of BV and Ron,sp.

Junction temperature of the device shows a sensitivity of 1.28°C for every unit of TBR for GaN-on-Diamond compared to 0.43°C for every 10 units of TBR for GaN/SiC-on-Diamond. Finite Volume Thermal Analysis has shown a limit of around 22 m2K/GW beyond which the merit of proximity to the heat-source for GaN-on-Diamond can no more outperform GaN/SiC-on-Diamond. Besides, due to the temperature dependency of the thermal conductivity K, an increase in the temperature causes an increase in the thermal resistivity of the device which is more significant in high power operations. Simplified assumption of constant K overestimates the device performance by resulting in 17.4°C lower junction temperature for the areal power density of 10W/mm.

The antenna is composed of a feeding circuit, radiating slots on radiating waveguides, and dipoles for polarization conversion. By integrating the feeding circuit and the radiating waveguides into a single dielectric layer, the total number of dielectric layers is reduced to two which greatly increases ease of mass production. The feeding circuit divides power into two and feeds the two radiating waveguides from their center. 8 × 2 radiating elements are composed of a slot and a dipole placed on the radiating waveguides. The elements are designed by standing-wave excitation. The antenna is fabricated by printed circuit board technology and its dimensions are 44.5 × 20.0 × 2.16 mm3. The measured results show a 2.1-dB axial ratio, 15.6-dBi gain, and 57.2% efficiency at 61.5 GHz.

However, the tunability and reconfigurability of the chiral metasurfaces remain challenges. Then, we proposed an S-shaped metamirror consisting of a MIM (Au-LiNbO3-Au) structure with a dual-band chiral absorption in the near-infrared range. The proposed structure has two resonant wavelengths with a giant chiro-optical effect. The giant chiro-optical effect originates from the different plasmonic resonances induced by the incident circularly polarized light (CPL) with opposite spin states. By tuning the voltage and thus tuning the refractive index of the lithium niobate (LiNbO3), chiral resonant wavelengths can be dynamically adjusted in a large range as desired. Furthermore, by tuning the refractive index of LiNbO3, we can move the short-wavelength resonance peak to the position of another long-wavelength resonance peak. Therefore, the chiral metamirror can be dynamically reconfigured at the position of the long-wavelength resonance peak. The work offers a further step in developing tunable and reconfigurable chirality for possible applications including reconfigurable chiral hologram, chiral-selective absorber and other chiral components in near-infrared region.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2020.3020090","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1701661,61427819,11774240,11604218); Leading Talents of Guangdong Province Program(grant numbers:00201505); Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen(grant numbers:KQTD2015071016560101,KQTD20170330110444030,KQJSCX20170727100838364); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2016A030312010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180039","Metasurface;chirality;tunable;reconfigurable","Lithium niobate;Magnetic resonance;Optical polarization;Electric fields;Dielectrics;Magnetic moments;Magnetic fields","","7","","39","CCBY","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the largely enhanced interaction between the photons and the suspended structure, the opto-mechanical effect can be dramatically improved. With injecting low optical powers, the optical gradient force can be effectively aroused in the opto-mechanical MRRs, which would arise nano-meter scale waveguide deformations and the significant spectrum red-shifts of the rings. The opto-mechanical effect would cause different red-shifts of the two MRR resonances in the forward and backward transmissions, which contributes to realizing the nonreciprocal transmissions.

The load power is presented as the instantaneous power. In order to balance the instantaneous power difference between the pulse load and the DC bus, a bi-directional DC/DC converter is usually connected in parallel to compensate for the current fluctuation caused by the characteristics of the pulse load. However, there is a large current spike in the bus current in the pre-stage when the pulse load is changed between light and heavy load. In this paper, a three-state dual-inductance bi-directional converter is proposed. In addition, the load current waveform is directly used to control the inductive branch switches, and an adaptive current feedback control strategy based on the valley voltage loop is proposed to control the power switches. The control method is applicable to the arbitrary change of the frequency and power of the pulse load.

With few exceptions, the reflectors consisted of a set of panels, typically a few square meters in size, that were supported on a backup structure. To be an effective reflector, the shape needs to obey the prescribed contour with a precision of about one-twentieth of the shortest operational wavelength. This was achieved with the aid of a continuously improving array of metrology methods, from the original geodetic theodolite-tape to current laser-trackers, digital photogrammetry, and radio holography. We review the historical development by summarizing the different methods and illustrating their applications with examples, mainly from the field of radio astronomy. It is here where the largest and most precise reflectors have been installed, and metrology has been pushed to a level where a reflector of 100 m diameter can be realized with a surface error of about 250 μm, and a 12 m diameter submillimeter telescope with an error of about 10 μm.

While this is a reasonable assumption in the absence of data, it ignores the radial and unbalanced nature of LV networks; potentially under or overestimating the effects of DER. To understand the drawbacks of such simplified approaches, this study investigates the role of integrated MV–LV network modelling in adequately capturing solar PV effects. A methodology is proposed to realistically model three-phase, radial, unbalanced pseudo-LV networks based on network design principles.

With the development of wireless communication, the signal transmission environment has become increasingly bad, causing more difficulties in parameter estimation. It is well known that the signal cycle spectrum is robust to noises and signal parameters are closely related. In practice, it is impossible to calculate the cyclic spectrum of infinite length data signals. When using finite length data to obtain a cycle spectrum, the truncation noise is induced, resulting in interference. It is necessary to overcome the influence of noises in order to improve the detection ability of discrete spectral lines. An improved method of the discrete spectral line extraction algorithm is proposed by reflecting the amplitude advantage of discrete spectral lines through salient features of continuous noises in discrete spectral line neighborhood.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2020.01.05","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014587","digital modulation signal;carrier frequency;symbol rate;cyclic spectrum;noise control","Frequency estimation;Estimation;Frequency modulation;Frequency-domain analysis;Correlation","","7","","","","27 Feb 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

These eigenstates correspond to orbital angular momentum modes except for the two polarized-vortex modes. The design of appropriate core parameters can lead to the difference in the effective refractive indexes between all adjacent modes being greater than 10−4 over a bandwidth of 1.5 to 1.6 μm, which is expected to be an ideal method for the generation of multiple vortex modes in few-mode fiber for optical communication. The results showed that the separation of these modes changes with twist rate. Compared to the twisted air-hole ring-core fiber, the optimal twist rate of this fiber was found to be an order of magnitude smaller, which provides a more feasible scheme for the combination of mode division multiplexing and wavelength division multiplexing.

In the off-state, with the increasing potential of the N-cs (N-doped carrier store layer), the self-biased pMOS turns on and the potential of the P-layer will be clamped by the hole channel. Then, the reverse voltage is sustained by the P-layer/N-drift junction and the potential of the N-cs is shielded by the clamped P-layer region. Therefore, the N-cs can be heavily doped to reduce the on-state voltage (Von) without decreasing the breakdown voltage.

In this paper, we propose a novel outlier detection method that works on the Riemannian manifold of sample covariance matrices (SCMs). Existing outlier detection methods run the risk of erroneously rejecting some samples as outliers, even if there is no outlier, due to the detection being based on a reference matrix and a threshold. To address this limitation, our method, Riemannian Spectral Clustering (RiSC), detects outliers by clustering SCMs into non-outliers and outliers, based on a proposed similarity measure. This considers the Riemannian geometry of the space and magnifies the similarity within the non-outlier cluster and weakens it between non-outlier and outlier clusters, instead of setting a threshold. To assess RiSC performance, we generated artificial EEG datasets contaminated by different outlier strengths and numbers. Comparing Hit-False (HF) difference between RiSC and existing outlier detection methods confirmed that RiSC could detect outliers significantly better (p <; 0.001). In particular, RiSC improved HF difference the most for datasets with the most severe outlier contamination.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175456","","Electroencephalography;Reduced instruction set computing;Anomaly detection;Hafnium;Manifolds;Geometry;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Cluster Analysis;Electroencephalography","7","","12","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a new method named elementary belief assignment function for conflict data fusion. The proposed method aims at getting a more rational data fusion result by preprocessing the mass function before implementing data fusion with Dempster’s combination rule. The elementary belief assignment function takes into consideration not only the number of focal elements in the current body of evidence but also the proposition in the power set space. By assigning the mass value of potential conflict focal element to other related propositions in the power set space, we can reduce the conflict level among different bodies of evidences effectively.

Also, arc slots in the parasitic patch are added to improve the bandwidth and shorting-pins located along the edges of square patch are introduced to adjust the operating frequency, gain and pitch angle. The multi-source multi-beam antenna has a similar construction with the single-source case except it has four ports.

The filling morphology of TSV electrodeposited with different stirring rate and different current density were observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The phenomenon that forced convection reduces the TSV filling ratio at low current density but promotes the TSV filling ratio at high current density was discovered. Additionally, the influence of stirring rate on the TSV filling results was researched. In order to study the mechanism of forced convection at different current densities, electrochemical analysis and particle size measurement were carried out. The volt-ampere characteristic curves of the plating solution stirred at different speeds were analyzed.

Four zero-dispersion wavelength decreasing photonic crystal fibers with different fiber cross structures and taper profiles are fabricated to extend the short wavelength edge of supercontinuum. Both nanosecond and picosecond pump pulses at 1 μm are used to generate supercontinuum. With a 3 ns pump pulse, the short wavelength edge of supercontinuum is extended to below 400 nm in a fiber with high air-hole ratio (named T3). The underlying mechanism of supercontinuum generation is explored. The short and long wavelength edges of supercontinuum are highly related with the phase-matching condition which decided by the group velocity curve of fiber small core end. With a 10 ps pump pulse, the spectral intensity around ∼800 nm increases in all four fibers. However, the intensity in shorter wavelength band decreased in fibers with a high air-hole ratio (named T3, T4).

As a consequence, square-wave mixer implementations, as, e.g., the 25% duty-cycle current-driven passive mixer, may lead to the down-conversion of these blocker signals by their harmonic response. This contribution describes a harmonic rejection (HR) strategy, which modifies the local oscillator (LO) waveform of a 25% duty-cycle current-driven passive mixer, to suppress specific harmonics. Two HR control signal waveforms are proposed and their performance is evaluated by circuit simulations using a 28nm CMOS technology. By applying the proposed concept, the down-conversion of a blocker by the mixer's 3rd order harmonic response can be suppressed by more than 30 dB, and the receiver noise figure (NF) is improved by 21.1 dB for a blocker power of -5 dBm at the low-noise amplifier (LNA) input.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2019.2937654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8815876","Mixer;receiver;harmonics;digital-to-time converter;wireless communications","Harmonic analysis;Mixers;Radio frequency;Receivers;Transceivers;Control systems;Circuits and systems","","6","","12","CCBY","27 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, a radial-flux permanent magnet (PM) micromotor with 3D iron-core MEMS in-chip coils of high aspect ratio was designed and fabricated. The three-phase PM brushless direct current (BLDC) micromotor has four Nd-Fe-B magnet poles on a steel rotor and six solenoid Cu coils of high aspect ratio (coil height/line width = 14) in the silicon stator fabricated using MEMS processes. Iron cores were inserted into the coils, and a low-resistivity magnetic circuit was established. At 100 Hz, the inductance of a 15-turn coil was 13.2μH. The coils were embedded tightly in the silicon substrate, resulting in a good heat dissipation performance and thus a high current-carrying capacity. The hexagonal sheet-type micromotor weighed 2.25 g with a volume of 586.5 mm3 before bearing packaging. The modeling results showed that at 10000 rpm, the torque was 676μN·m and the power density was 314 W/kg.

However, synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs) often operate around saturation point to achieve higher torque density. Therefore, a new AM is proposed, in which the saturation of stator iron has been considered. The key of the proposed method includes a saturation factor, and an iterative method is adopted to compute the saturation factor in the SynRM by increasing the air-gap length. Especially, the proposed AM can be applied to a SynRM even with shifted-asymmetrical-salient-poles. In the process of AM, the expression of stator magnetomotive force (MMF) is built firstly. Additionally, the air-gap density including slotting effect and salient-poles is calculated. Then, the rotor MMF under saturation of the stator iron is obtained. Therefore, the precision of the instantaneous torque can be improved significantly. Eventually, by the verification of finite elements method (FEM) and experiments, the torque performance of SynRMs with shifted asymmetrical rotor can be predicted accurately by the proposed AM.","2096-3564","","10.30941/CESTEMS.2020.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9130116","Synchronous reluctance motors;torque;shifted asymmetrical salient pole;analytical method;saturation","Rotors;Stator windings;Torque;Air gaps;Atmospheric modeling;Torque measurement","","6","","","","30 Jun 2020","","","CES","CES Journals"

Tactile sensors have previously been incorporated into MIS robotic end effectors, which require lengthy scanning procedures due to localised sensitivity. Distributed tactile sensors, or “artificial skin” offer a map of tissue properties in a single instance but are often not suitable for MIS applications due to limited biocompatibility or large collapsed volumes. We propose a deployable, soft, tactile sensor with a deformable saline chamber and integrated Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) electrodes. During contact with tissue, the saline is displaced from the chamber and the lesion size and stiffness can be inferred from the resultant impedance changes. Through optimisation of the EIT measurement protocol and hardware the sensor was capable of localising the centre of mass of palpation targets within 1.5 mm in simulation and 2.3–4.6mm in phantom experiments.

In this paper, we present a derivation of a general and direct relationship between these two coherence measures. We refer to the result as the Central Relation.

In addition, with the emergence of real-time, delay sensitive and mission-critical applications, stringent network availability requirement is put forward for internet service providers (ISPs). However, commonly deployed intradomain link-state routing protocols react to link failures by globally exchanging link state advertisements and recalculating routing table, inevitably causing significant forwarding discontinuity after a failure. Therefore, the loop-free criterion (LFC) approach has been widely deployed by many ISPs for coping with the single network component failure scenario in large internet backbones. The success of LFC lies in its inherent simplicity, but this comes at the expense of letting certain failure scenarios go unprotected. To achieve full failure coverage with LFC without incurring significant extra overhead, we propose a novel link protection scheme, hybrid link protection (HLP), to achieve failure resilient routing. Compared to previous schemes, HLP ensures high network availability in a more efficient way. HLP is implemented in two stages. Stage one provides an efficient LFC based method (MNP-e). The complexity of the algorithm is less than that of Dijkstra's algorithm and can provide the similar network availability with LFC. Stage two provides backup path protection (BPP) based on MNP-e, where only a minimum number of links need to be protected, using special paths and packet headers, to meet the network availability requirement. We evaluate these algorithms in a wide spread of relevant topologies, both real and synthetic, and the results reveal that HLP can achieve high network availability without introducing conspicuous overhead. HLP not only needs around 10% time of that of full protection, but also provides full protection capabilities that full protection provide.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2019.000056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9042897","Incremental shortest path first;loop-free;multipath routing;network availability;network link failure","Routing;Network topology;Topology;Routing protocols;Complexity theory;IP networks;Maintenance engineering","","6","","","","19 Mar 2020","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Firstly, a correction method is introduced to prevent the network from prematurely saturating; then, the fuzzy vigilance models (FVM) are constructed to replace the conventional vigilance parameter, reducing the error probability in the overlapping region; finally, a dual vigilance mechanism is introduced to solve the performance improving dilemma.

Long cable system installed in the factory need to develop precise fault detection method considering propagation dispersion. Using the derived time delay between the incident and reflected wave which is generated from the fault, fault can be localized. The time-frequency cross correlation (TFCC) is a signal scanning process based on the similarity of the energy spectrum for detecting the reflected signal mixed with the noise. The threshold value in TFCC is a reference constant value for judging whether or not a fault is present. Due to the attenuation and dispersion of signal along the propagation, a new threshold value function considering attenuation and dispersion is needed. We propose the adaptive threshold curve for compensating the signal attenuation. We design the equivalent circuit of target cable (7m length) and optimal reference signal based on the comparative analysis between the results of computer simulation and actual experiments of 7m length cable. Based on the designed equivalent circuit of target cable(7 m length), a long cable system is modeled by simulation and the performance of the proposed method is proved through the simulation under the various noise level environments.","2644-1284","","10.1109/OJIES.2020.2973881","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2018R1C1B5086489); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8998223","Advanced signal processing;signal sensing;signal detection;fault detection;adaptive curve;time-frequency domain reflectometry;health monitoring","Power cables;Circuit faults;Attenuation;Integrated circuit modeling;Superconducting cables;Equivalent circuits;High-temperature superconductors","","6","","18","CCBY","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This development has led to increasing concerns about problems associated with electrical equipment connected with the RE technologies, especially in wind and solar. These RE technologies have intermittent generation profiles and are connected to non-linear loads. The fundamental electrical equipment including the step-up transformer, with respect to which, high harmonic losses, abnormal temperature rise and gassing problems have been extensively reported within the last 10 years and remains a precedence for many Independent Power Producers (IPPs). A requirement of the step-up transformer is that IPPs are required to provide a technical schedule clarifying the harmonic and distortion content at the plant's point of common coupling (PCC). A lack of this knowledge to the transformer manufactures thereof leads to under-designing or over-designing cases if the harmonic content has been underestimated or overestimated respectively. In hindsight, it may be beneficial for the Independent Power Producers and transformer manufactures to collaborate to assure the transformer design philosophy for the intended RE application is aligned with the technical requirements. In this paper, a method of de-rating the transformer when supplying non-sinusoidal loads is presented. In this method, the continuous power rating of the transformer is reduced to treat the additional losses as a result of harmonic penetration. Initially, a harmonic spectrum supplied by the IPP is used to calculate the transformer load and service losses. Secondly, the harmonic load spectrum is employed to compute derating factors ascribed to as “K-Factor” and “Factor-K”, indicating the amount of de-rating necessary for the transformer under study when serving the considered harmonic spectrum. Lastly, the thermal considerations under the harmonic spectrum are presented.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2020.9099492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099492","Step-up transformer;Harmonic and distortion;Harmonic losses;Abnormal Temperature rise;Gassing;De-rating;Thermal requirements","Harmonic analysis;Oil insulation;Windings;Phase transformers;Power transformer insulation;Conductors;Power system harmonics","","6","","20","","25 May 2020","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

In order to cope with these challenges, several approaches to reduce peak feed-in and demand are possible. For example, the curtailment of renewable generation or peak loads or the activation of demand-side flexibility through, e.g., time of use tariffs. Local energy markets (LEMs) are a promising alternative concept to combine various of these measures and activate untapped flexibility potential of the demand- and generation-side as well as storages. In this study, the authors propose a linear optimisation-based market mechanism that can explicitly consider demand, generation and storage flexibility in the form of flexibility orders. Through the simulation of a LEM in a rural region of Germany with a high share of renewable feed-in, they demonstrate the effects of the proposed LEM for the current situation and a future scenario with additional load through electric vehicles and heat pumps.

The presented architecture is simple, without cascode transistor while it has more than 80 dB open-loop gain without extra power consumption. As a result, the proposed structure has a better power efficiency factor (PEF) and output swing in comparison with previous reported architectures is increased to the 2Vov below the maximum supply voltage. In order to reduce flicker noise and achieve better trade-off between the power and noise, PMOS transistors with an optimum size have been utilized which operate in sub-threshold region. The amplifier is designed and simulated in a commercially available 0.18 μm CMOS technology. Monte Carlo simulations for process and mismatch have been carried out. The gain of the proposed amplifier is 39.22 dB in its bandwidth (3 Hz - 5 kHz). Total input-referred noise is 3.03 μVrms over 1 Hz - 10 kHz. The power consumption of the amplifier is 2.98 μW at supply voltage of 1.4 V. The noise efficiency factor (NEF) and PEF are 2.4 and 8.06, respectively. The output swing is about 1.16 V.

The main radiating patch is responsible for the original TM10 mode while the electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) arrays is for another resonant mode characterized as quasi-TM20 mode. Thus, wideband performance is obtained due to the combination of the two generated resonant modes. And on this basis, by adding symmetrical mushroom structures at the other two edges of the main radiating patch, the impedance bandwidth and sidelobe suppression are improved. The current distributions on the all metal patches are almost uniform, therefore high gains can be obtained during the whole operating bandwidth. The antenna array is formed by 4 × 4 unit cells and the prototype is fabricated to validate the design. The measured results show that the impedance bandwidth is broadened from 11.1 to 15.6 GHz with the peak-gain reaching as high as 18.8dBi.

Such technology enables various levels of modulation and coding. AMC technologies use channel state information to select the optimal modulation or coding scheme as well as transmission parameters to improve the transmission speed, transmission quality, and spectrum efficiency of links. Because of equipment limitations at the receiving end, channel estimation algorithms cannot be used to acquire ideal solutions, and thus estimation errors are inevitable. Consequently, parameter information returned from the receiving end may be inaccurate and the radio link is affected by interference, which may impede the reliability of data transmission and reduce spectrum efficiency. This study proposed an AMC with a backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) scheme (AMC-BP-ANN). This study addressed problems regarding reduced efficiency in conventional AMC technology caused by channel, interference and noise estimation errors. In particular, this study used channel estimation, interference and noise estimation errors as features for machine learning, which allowed eMBB systems to accurately estimate the signal-to-interference plus noise ration and ensure that the estimated value approximated the value was determined through ideal channel estimation. The simulation results indicated that the AMC-BP-ANN scheme could achieve ideal performance and a superior bit error rate compared with the AMC technologies using lookup table and genetic algorithm, and furthermore, a lower bit error rate could improve the transmission reliability and spectral efficiency in 5G eMBB.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3024726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200321","5G;enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB);adaptive modulation and coding (AMC);machine learning;back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN)","Modulation;5G mobile communication;Encoding;Interference;OFDM;Downlink;Gaussian processes","","5","","","CCBY","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In these years, for the sparse elevation distribution, compressive sensing (CS) is a developed favorable technique for the high-resolution elevation reconstruction in TomoSAR by solving an Li regularization problem. However, because the elevation distribution in the forested area is nonsparse, if we want to use CS in the recovery, some basis, such as wavelet, should be exploited in the sparse representation of the elevation reflectivity function. This paper presents a novel wavelet-based L1/2 regularization CS-TomoSAR imaging method of the forested area. In the proposed method, we first construct a wavelet basis, which can sparsely represent the elevation reflectivity function of the forested area, and then reconstruct the elevation distribution by using the L1/2 regularization technique.

Irreversible demagnetization of permanent magnets by rotor loss always is a critical problem of high-speed permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). The stabilization and efficiency can be increased by reduction of rotor loss. By Finite Element Method simulations with experiment date, the rotor temperature rising of the prototype PMSM mainly comes from rotor loss induced by time harmonic. The distribution and components of prototype rotor loss are given. Rotor loss is analyzed by equivalent magnetic circuit with considering time harmonic magnetomotive force in this paper. According to analysis of rotor loss, this paper presents a method to reduce rotor loss without changing stator structure and winding current. This rotor structure optimization will not affect output performance of PMSM. The method has been proved to be available by the no-load experiment finally.

The intelligence measurement is typically built as a model based on multiple factors. The different agent is generally difficult to measure because of the uncertainty between multiple factors. The purpose of this paper is to solve the problem of uncertainty between multiple factors and propose an effective method for universal intelligence measurement for the different agents. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, the authors propose a universal intelligence measurement method based on meta-analysis for crowd network. First, the authors get study data through keywords in the database and delete the low-quality data. Second, they compute the effect value by odds ratio, relative risk and risk difference. Then, they test the homogeneity by Q-test and analyze the bias by funnel plots. Third, they select the fixed effect and random effect as a statistical model. Finally, through the meta-analysis of time, complexity and reward, the weight of each factor in the intelligence measurement is obtained and then the meta measurement model is constructed.

High blood pressure greatly increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Therefore, it is important to control blood pressure (BP) through regular BP monitoring; as such, it is necessary to develop a method to accurately and conveniently predict BP in a variety of settings. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting BP without feature extraction using fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We measured single multi-wave photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using a smartphone. To find an effective wavelength of PPG signals for the generation of accurate BP measurements, we investigated the BP prediction performance by changing the combinations of the input PPG signals. Our CNN-based BP predictor yielded the best performance metrics when a green PPG time signal was used in combination with an instantaneous frequency signal. This combination had an overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.28 and 4.92 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. Thus, our CNN-based approach achieved comparable results to other approaches that use a single PPG signal.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175902","","Time-frequency analysis;Feature extraction;Biomedical monitoring;Wavelength measurement;Hypertension;Blood pressure;Convolution","Blood Pressure;Blood Pressure Determination;Photoplethysmography;Pulse Wave Analysis;Smartphone","5","","14","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In existing circulating current suppression control (CCSC) methods, multiple resonant regulators or dq-frame integrators are usually employed to reduce the harmonic components. Besides the complexity, it requires additional designs of controller parameters, which relies on accurate frequency and sequence information of the circulating currents. In this paper, a common-mode (CM) insertion indices compensation method is introduced to realize CCSC, which is based on feeding forward the capacitor voltages. This approach not only facilitates the analysis of circulating current mechanism with a deep insight, but also provides a simple approach to achieve a wide bandwidth circulating current suppression without considering the specific harmonic frequencies and sequences. The latter one makes it easy to be used even in the unbalanced, multi-frequency or variable fundamental frequency ac systems. In addition to these advantages, the proposed compensation method can maintain inter-arm capacitor voltages balanced without additional differential energy control loop, which is required in the existing capacitor voltage feedforward scheme. Analytical and extensive simulation results are given for validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2020.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9135025","Capacitor voltages feedforward;circulating current suppression control;common-mode insertion indices;compensation method;modular multilevel converter (MMC)","Capacitors;Harmonic analysis;Voltage control;Feedforward systems;Resonant frequency;Frequency modulation","","5","","","","7 Jul 2020","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

However, the existing weapon system-of-systems (SoS) is tightly coupled. Because of the diversity and connectivity of mission requirements, it is difficult to describe the direct mapping relationship from the mission to the weapon system. In the latest service-oriented research, the introduction of service modules to build a service-oriented, flexible, and combinable structure is an important trend. This paper proposes a service-oriented weapon system portfolio selection method, by introducing service to serve as an intermediary to connect missions and system selection, and transferring the weapon system selection into the service portfolio selection. Specifically, the relation between the service and the task is described through the service-task mapping matrix; and the relation between the service and the weapon system is constructed through the servicesystem mapping matrix. The service collaboration network to calculate the flexibility and connectivity of each service portfolio is then established. Through multi-objective programming, the optimal service portfolios are generated, which are further decoded into weapon system portfolios.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2020.000034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127916","weapon system portfolio selection;service-oriented;multi-objective programming","Weapons;Portfolios;Task analysis;Modeling;Collaboration;Feature extraction","","5","","","","29 Jun 2020","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

By analyzing the interaction of Mie resonance in the lateral direction and Fabry-Pérot resonance in the longitudinal direction using numerical simulations, we reveal the detrimental role the tapering angle plays due to the low transmission near the resonance. We observe the weakening of the electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole response, and the increase of the electric dipole response for tapered nanopillars. Moreover, the Fabry-Pérot resonance is disturbed due to the broken symmetry. These factors contribute to lower Q factor resonance and hence the low transmission.

Effective equations and simulations for the relevant antennas are used to obtain the propagation constants of the proposed antenna and design it.

Truncating and interlacing the unit cells are developed to make them become impedance matched structures with the elimination of the OSB and the improvement of the radiation patterns.

The wind power deviation in the RT market is settled with the two-price mechanism based on the deviation direction and the relation between the locational marginal prices (LMPs) of DA and RT. Instead of using the point forecasting for the DA and RT LMPs, the uncertainties of LMP forecasting are modeled. In addition, the correlation between the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP are directly modeled instead of generating the correlated scenarios. Finally, the optimal offered quantity of wind power in the DA market is derived using the probability theory based on the probabilistic wind power forecasting. The case study using the price data of actual DA and RT from Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) validates the effectiveness of the proposed model. It shows that the correlation of the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP has a significant impact on the wind power quantity offered by DA and revenue results.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2019.000598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9169982","Electricity market;wind power;uncertainty;correlation;strategic wind power offering","Wind power generation;Forecasting;Correlation;Correlation coefficient;Wind forecasting;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty","","5","","16","","17 Aug 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Numerical simulations revealed that the radius of curvature of 6 μm or larger nearly enabled the equalization, and thus we developed a bending technology using ion implantation to realize simultaneously a VCW radius of curvature of 6 μm and a straight SSC of length 7 μm by varying the implantation angles. The bent silicon core was subsequently coated with SiO2 by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition to function as a collimation lens.

This metric has proved useful in the past, where fixed voltage reductions were applied. However, this letter shows from a theoretical perspective and with a realistic case study that when used for active CVR schemes (voltages actively controlled throughout the day), the CVRf can be smaller than that for fixed voltage reductions despite the larger energy savings. This could be misleading for decision makers considering active CVR schemes as an energy efficiency measure. Consequently, it is recommended that comparisons among CVR schemes are carried out in terms of actual energy reductions.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2944750","Electricity North West, U.K.; EPSRC project MY-STORE(grant numbers:EP/N001974/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8853291","Conservation voltage reduction (CVR);CVR factor (CVRf);load models;voltage control","Voltage control;Load modeling;Substations;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Business;Loading","","5","","9","CCBY","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to minimize the noise and increase the bandwidth, a single stage current reuse amplifier with pseudo-resistor common-mode feedback is chosen, while a simple fully differential amplifier is implemented at the second stage to provide high swing. A DC servo loop with an active RC integrator is designed to block the DC offset of electrodes and a positive feedback loop is used to increase the input impedance. Finally, an area and power-efficient ripple reduction technique and chopping spike filter are used in order to have a clear signal. The designed circuit is simulated in a commercially available 0.18 μm CMOS technology. 3.7 μA current is drawn from a ±0.6V supply. The total bandwidth is from 50 mHz to 10 kHz while the total inputreferred noise in this bandwidth is 2.9 μVrms and the mid-band gain is about 40 dB. The designed amplifier can tolerate up to 60 mV DC electrode offset and the amplifier's input impedance with positive feedback loop is 17 MΩ while the chopping frequency is 20 kHz.

These optimal ratios to the fundamental component are analytically derived to maximize the output torque. It is found that except for the 3rd harmonic current contributing to the output torque, the 5th harmonic current can also produce the additional positive torque. However, the 5th harmonic is zero sequence component for the five-phase machines, which does not exist in the phase windings. Hence, the neutral point is required to connect the middle point of the DC link capacitors for constructing flowing path. The conventional vector space decomposition (VSD) control is extended to zero sequence sub-plane, which can quantitatively control 5th harmonic current. For a prototype five-phase PM machine, the average torque can be increased by 21.4% with 3rd harmonic current injection. Meanwhile, 10.7% additional positive torque is achieved together with 3rd and 5th harmonic injection. The torque ripple remains similar to that without harmonics injection.

This method collects the optical interference information on a two-dimensional plane at different frequencies. The collected data can be used to characterize the principal modes, including their patterns and differential mode group delays. Due to the frequency invariance of PMs even in mode coupling state, which is studied carefully, this proposed method is shown to be robust. Analyses based on a four-mode fiber show that the distributed fluctuation of the coupling coefficients break the frequency invariance of PMs. We experimentally measure the mode characteristics of a four-mode fiber with S2 method. The results show that the mode group delays of degenerate modes can be separated in mode coupling state, which is exactly appropriate for the modified measurement method.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2020.2979861","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61335005,61775165); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9031415","Few-mode fibers;optical fiber characterization;principal modes","Couplings;Optical fiber dispersion;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber theory;Optical fiber devices;Optical fiber polarization","","5","","11","CCBY","10 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Feasible process flows of the cascode device were adopted from those of nanosheet FETs (NSFETs) and complementary FETs. Key process flows were depositing two different separate spacers and etching one spacer selectively, depositing oxide layer in between source/drain epitaxial growths for electrical isolation, and fill-CMP-etch back sequence for dual-WF. The folded cascode device consists of two or three FETs in series, designated as 2-CAS or 3-CAS respectively, under the same active area. Conventional three-stacked NSFETs have larger transconductance (Gm) than 2-CAS and 3-CAS, but the cascode devices have much larger output resistance (Ro) by dual-WF scheme and thus achieve larger intrinsic gain (AV = GmRo). Smaller Gm and larger gate capacitance for the cascode devices decrease the cutoff frequency. But smaller gate-to-drain capacitance by shrunk drain epi along with large Ro increases the maximum frequency (Fmax). Especially, 2-CAS has larger AV and Fmax than conventional NSFETs for all the NS widths of 20, 30, and 40 nm and at all the operation voltages of 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 V, promising for low power mobile applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034572","Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy(grant numbers:10080617); Korea Semiconductor Research Consortium Support Program for the Development of the Future Semiconductor Device; National Research Foundation of Korea grant; Ministry of Science and ICT(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1A4A4079777); Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)-Samsung Electronics Industry-Academia Cooperative Research Center; IC Design Education Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9243944","Cascode;dual workfunction;nanosheet;low power;analog/RF;intrinsic gain;maximum frequency;sub-5-nm node","Logic gates;FinFETs;Mathematical model;Metals;Nanoscale devices;Etching","","5","","18","CCBY","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

And the 16-CAP signal is encrypted by (CCDM) and XOR operator to realize dynamic probability and flexible rate. The ONU checks out and compares the hash value sent by OLT, so as to achieve slot synchronization. A 4 Gb/s multi-slot chaos encrypted 16-CAP signal with dynamic probability is transmitted through a 25-km standard single mode fiber (SSMF). The proposed scheme has a high anti-hacking capability and good performance under key leakage.

The Doppler shift estimation accuracy should be less than 500 Hz to ensure satellite signals to enter a locked state in the tracking loop. Since the frequency step is usually 500 Hz or larger, the Doppler shift estimation accuracy cannot guarantee that satellite signals are brought into a stable tracking state. The straightforward solutions consist in increasing the sampling time and using zero-padding to improve the frequency resolution of the FFT. However, these solutions intensify the complexity and amount of computation. The contradiction between the acquisition accuracy and the computational load leads us to research for a more simple and effective algorithm, which achieves fine acquisition by a look-up table. After coarse acquisition using the parallel frequency acquisition (PFA) algorithm, the proposed algorithm optimizes the Doppler shift estimation through the look-up table method based on the FFT results to improve the acquisition accuracy of the Doppler shift with a minimal additional computing load.

In this paper, we propose a single-photon level real-time phase tracking scheme using only the estimated quantum bit error rate (QBER) and mismatched-basis data to acquire the phase drift parameter instead of a phase scanning process or reference light pulses, without extra hardware or interrupting the transmission of quantum signals. This scheme is applied into a phase-coding QKD system with active phase disturbance and obtains an average QBER of $1.01\%$ with a standard derivation of $0.37\%$ over 50 h of continuous operation. Experimental results show that this scheme enables QKD systems to operate continuously with long-term stability and keep a low level of QBER even with rapid phase drift, suggesting its suitability for practical applications.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2020.2986343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064897","Quantum key distribution;phase tracking","Real-time systems;Optical interferometry;Laser beams;Stability criteria;Protocols;Licenses;Complexity theory","","4","","23","CCBY","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A recent breakthrough finding in AF ablation consists in identifying ablation sites based on their spatiotemporal dispersion (STD). STD stands for a delay of the cardiac activation observed in intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) across contiguous leads. In practice, interventional cardiologists localize STD sites visually using the PentaRay multipolar mapping catheter. This work aims at automatically characterizing STD by classifying EGM data into STD vs. non STD groups using machine learning (ML) techniques. A dataset of 23082 multichannel EGM recordings acquired by the PentaRay coming from 16 persistent AF patients is included in this study. A major problem hampering the classification performance lies in the highly imbalanced dataset ratio. We suggest to tackle data imbalance using adapted data augmentation techniques including 1) undersampling 2) oversampling 3) lead shift 4) time reversing and 5) time shift. These tools are designed to preserve the integrity of the cardiac data and are validated by a partner cardiologist. They provide enhancement in classification performance in terms of sensitivity, which increases from 50% to 80% while maintaining accuracy and AUC around 90% with oversampling. Bootstrapping is applied to check the variability of the trained classifiers.Clinical relevance-The machine learning techniques developed in this contribution are expected to aid cardiologists in performing patient-tailored catheter ablation procedures for treating persistent AF.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176400","","Catheters;Dispersion;Sensitivity;Training;Machine learning;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Radio frequency","Atrial Fibrillation;Cardiac Conduction System Disease;Catheter Ablation;Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac;Humans;Machine Learning","4","","11","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These microgrids should be optimally sized so as to meet the electrical needs of the communities cost effectively. This work presents an efficient and robust sizing approach for off-grid PV microgrid systems that has been named as the ComμGrid Sizing Approach in this research. This approach utilizes “Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)” to optimally size the PV microgrid. The ComμGrid optimization algorithm uses hourly load variation, hourly solar irradiance values and hourly ambient temperature to optimally size the system. This approach also uses the “Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)” algorithm to aggregate load and meteorological data.

Precisely, the performance of a VLC system, with relay nodes equipped with a MIMO technique called space time block coding (STBC), is investigated. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the Alamouti coding (AC) scheme, which is a type of STBC, is specifically considered. In order to enhance the overall system reliability, we propose to use an imaging receiver (ImR), in conjunction with the relay-MIMO setup. In comparison to when a nonimaging receiver (NImR) is employed, an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 7 dB is observed when an ImR with a specific number of pixels, is used, hence, improving the BER. We also investigate and show that the selected number of pixels and receiver location have an effect on the system BER. SNR values of 9 dB, 11 dB and 15 dB were required to maintain a BER of 10−4 for imaging receivers with 70, 50 and 20 pixels, respectively.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2020.9099493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099493","Alamouti Coding;Imaging receivers;MIMO;Power line communication;Relays;Space time block coding;Visible light communication","MIMO communication;Optical transmitters;Relays;Imaging;Bit error rate;Optical receivers","","4","","35","","25 May 2020","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Both lateral bandgap and index engineering could be attained along the MQW plane, which could be used for a buried-heterostructure optical waveguide. Two SiO2 strips with 3, 5 and 7 μm windows were fabricated for waveguide on a 1540 nm InGaAsP MQW sample. A 120 nm blueshift under the SiO2 area was observed, leading to the index contrast of 0.07. Far-field optical diffraction measurements were also performed to yield angles of 13.9°, 12.8° and 10.6°. A narrower window resulted in a narrower optical waveguide width and exhibited a larger diffraction angle, suggesting that QWI defined the buried optical waveguide.

Therefore, we developed a detector prototype with an active area of 13 cm × 13 cm using silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs).

In this article, an algorithm based on the evidence theory and fuzzy entropy is proposed to resist SSDF attacks. In this algorithm, secondary users (SUs) obtain the corresponding degree of membership function and basic probability assignment function based on the local energy detection result. The new conflicting coefficient is calculated based on the evidence distance and classical conflicting coefficient, and the conflicting weight of the evidence is obtained. The fuzzy weight is calculated by the fuzzy entropy. The credibility weight is obtained by updating the credibility. On this basis, the probability assignment function of the evidence is corrected, and the final result is obtained by using the fusion formula.

A method of on-line copper coating on the inner hole of hollow-core anti-resonant fiber cladding during drawing is proposed in this paper, and the related polarization characteristic of the ARF is studied. The theoretical and experimental results show that the ARF has good polarization characteristics after coating due to the coupling of copper film and core mode. Polarized light at 860 nm shows the best polarization characteristics. When the ARF is 1 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2 mm in length, its crosstalk is more than 20 dB which works well in communications applications.

This paper introduces the concept of an accessible route navigation application to reduce EPW battery consumption. The application, called eNav, uses five layers of information including OpenStreetMaps (OSM), airborne laser scanner (ALS), Point-of-Interests (POIs), public transportation, and crowdsourcing. eNav collects these layers of information to provide the shortest, most accessible, and most comfortable routes that consume the least amount of EPW battery. Additionally, the paper presents the Mobility Enhancement roBot (MEBot), a legged-wheeled power wheelchair, to drive over architectural barriers and less accessible environments.

In crowd science and technology, evolutionary phenomenon exists also among many agents in crowd network systems. This kind of phenomenon is named as crowd co-evolutionary, which cannot be easily studied by most existing methods for its nonlinearity. This paper aims to proposes a novel simulation framework for co-evolution to discover improvements and behaviors of intelligent agents in crowd network systems. Design/methodology/approach – This paper introduces a novel simulation framework for crowd co-evolutions. There are three roles and one scene in the crowd. The scene represented by a band-right to a ringless diagram. The three roles are unit, advisor and monitor. Units find path in the scene. Advisors give advice to units. Monitors supervise units' behavior in the scene. Building a network among these three kinds member, influencing individual relationships through information exchange, and finally enable the individual to find the optimal path in the scene. Findings – Through this simulation framework, one can record the behavior of an individual in a group, the reasons for the individual's behavior and the changes in the relationships of others in the group that cause the individual to do so. The speed at which an individual finds the optimal path can reflect the advantages and disadvantages of the relationship change function. Originality/value – The framework provides a new way to study the evolution of inter-individual relationships in crowd networks. This framework takes the first-person perspective of members of the crowd-sourced network as the starting point. Through this framework, the user can design relationship evolution methods and mathematical models for the members of different roles, so as to verify that the level of public intelligence of the crowd network is actually the essence of the rationality of the membership relationship.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-02-2020-0004","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1400105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826683","Relationship;Crowd co-evolution;Crowd network system;Framework for crowd co-evolution","Technological innovation;Design methodology;Decision making;Buildings;Mathematical models;Behavioral sciences;Intelligent agents","","4","","16","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

This is done for a base case and a case with DSG. The results show with DSG, there is a general improvement in magnitudes of remaining voltage. Comparison of the populations of voltages for the two cases, using The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Sum Test, showed that these improvement are statistically significant. Further analysis showed that DSG either reduces severity of or eliminates some voltage sags. In addition, the number of expected trips due voltage sags is reduced with DSG, for any voltage sensitivity level assumed.

Eight high-efficiency silicon nanobricks with the phase shifts over 2π are designed as the basic unit cell, which have the same transmitted amplitude and phase for the CP and XLP light, and the phase difference for XLP and YLP light. We have also designed the beam deflector, metalens and vortex beam generator, which possess identical function for cross-polarized CP and co-polarized XLP and YLP light, respectively.

Shear Wave Absolute Vibro-Elastography (SWAVE) is a new elastography technique proposed to detect placenta disorders. Elastography involves applying a force on the tissue and measuring the resulting tissue deformation. All types of compression cause the tissue to expand in three directions given the biological tissues are nearly incompressible. Hence, 3D displacement estimation should lead to the most accurate elasticity reconstruction compared to the traditional 1D methods. Previous studies estimated 3D displacements over ultrasound volumes mostly for quasi-static compression to generate strain images. However, accurate displacement tracking of dynamic motion continues to be a challenge. In this work, a novel volumetric regularized algorithm, 3D GLobal Ultrasound Elastography (GLUE3D), is presented to estimate the 3D displacement over a volume of ultrasound data, following by a 3D Young's modulus reconstruction. The proposed method outperforms the previous 2D method over a volume and is compared with a 3D technique using phantom data for which the elasticity are provided by the values from magnetic resonance elastography on the same phantom and also the manufacturer reference numbers. We then present Young's modulus reconstruction results obtained from clinical data of placenta which shows more uniform elasticity maps compared to the traditional 1D displacement measurements over a volume of ultrasound data. Furthermore, the dependency of the elasticity values to the frequency is investigated in this study.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175657","","Three-dimensional displays;Elasticity;Ultrasonic imaging;Radio frequency;Phantoms;Elastography;Image reconstruction","Elastic Modulus;Elasticity;Elasticity Imaging Techniques;Female;Humans;Phantoms, Imaging;Placenta;Pregnancy","3","","18","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this algorithm, switching between the quaternion and the three-component vector is done by a couple of the mathematical transformations. Quaternion is chosen as the state variable of attitude in the kinematics equation to time update, while the mean value and covariance of the quaternion are computed by the three-component vector to avoid the normalization constraint of quaternion. The square-root forms enjoy a continuous and improved numerical stability because all the resulting covariance matrices are guaranteed to stay positively semidefinite. The entire square-root cubature attitude estimation algorithm with quaternion-vector switching for the nonlinear equality constraint of quaternion is given.

Finally, a hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the trajectory optimization problem of space robots by combining genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization method. The simulation results show that, compared with several classic optimization algorithms, the proposed hybrid optimization algorithm can obtain a better maintenance trajectory of the space robots under the constraints, which solves the low efficiency and poor stability of the space robots on-orbit maintenance problem.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3008754","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144494","space robot;trajectory optimization;cubic spline;hybrid optimization algorithm","Trajectory;Planning;Splines (mathematics);Robots;Maintenance engineering","","3","","","CCBY","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The objective of this study was to examine the generalizability of this approach to individuals who have experienced a stroke. An egocentric camera was used to capture the hand use (hand-object interactions) of 6 stroke survivors performing daily tasks in a home simulation laboratory. The interaction detection classifier previously trained on 9 individuals with cSCI was applied to detect hand use in the stroke survivors. The processing pipeline consisted of hand detection, hand segmentation, feature extraction, and interaction detection. The resulting average F1 scores for affected and unaffected hands were 0.66 ± 0.25 and 0.80 ± 0.15, respectively, indicating that the approach is feasible and has the potential to generalize to stroke survivors.

In modern GAN frameworks, both generator and discriminator are formulated to model the conditional distribution of images given with labels. In this article, we provide an alternative formulation of GAN which models the joint distribution of images and labels. There are two advantages in this joint formulation over conditional approaches. The first advantage is that the joint formulation is more robust to label noises if it's properly modeled. This alleviates the burden of making noise-free labels and allows the use of weakly-supervised labels in image generation. The second is that we can use any kinds of weak labels or image features that have correlations with the original image data to enhance unconditional image generation.

A tunneling LED is fabricated through use of InGaN QWs, combined with a thin Al2O3 dielectric with NiO as the source of the holes. This hybrid InGaN LED utilizes Fowler-Nordheim tunneling and band bending in order to inject holes into the active region. Due to the symmetric nature of the tunneling, hole or electron injection through the top oxide layer leads to AC performance. Room temperature and cryogenic I-V measurements are performed to evaluate the tunneling mechanism.

The reason why it is not easy to identify this piecewise affine system is that each separated region and each unknown parameter vector are all needed to be determined simultaneously. Then, firstly, in order to achieve the identification goal, a multi-class classification process is proposed to determine each separated region. As the proposed multi-class classification process is the same with the classical data clustering strategy, the multi-class classification process can combine the first order algorithm of convex optimization, while achieving the goal of the classification process. Secondly, a zonotope parameter identification algorithm is used to construct a set, which contains the unknown parameter vector. In this zonotope parameter identification algorithm, the strict probabilistic description about the external noise is relaxed, and each unknown parameter vector is also identified. Furthermore, this constructed set is consistent with the measured output and the given bound corresponding to the noise. Thirdly, a sufficient condition about guaranteeing our derived zonotope not growing unbounded with iterations is formulated as an explicit linear matrix inequality.

However, due to different driving behaviour in terms of distances and downtimes, the charging profile of electric trucks can differ significantly from that of electric cars. As the availability of measurement data is still scarce in the field of truck charging, synthetic charging profiles offer an opportunity to consider them in grid planning. This study proposes a methodology to produce synthetic charging profiles of electric trucks using trip chain generation based on real historic mobility data of conventional vehicles. The obtained synthetic profiles can be used in grid planning, not only in the development of new industrial areas, but also for further development of motorway service areas.

This article proposes a folding spring triboelectric nanogenerator that can be used for trajectory training and time training in rock climbing training. The folding spring triboelectric nanogenerator, made of PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), Kapton, PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), Cu (copper) and PLA (polylactic acid), realizes the detection functions based on the voltage pulse generated by the vertical friction between each two adjacent friction layers, and then the width of the output voltage pulse is the training time and the envelope of the space area formed by all the contacted folding spring triboelectric nanogenerator is the climbing trajectory. Test results show that the output voltage amplitude are between 7.5 V and 10.8 V, the output current will drop sharply from 24.5 × 10-7 A when the load resistance exceeds 47k ohms, the time interval between two consecutive uses should be greater than 0.2 s, and the maximum output power is 163.6 × 10-8 W when a 4.7 × 106 ohm load resistance is connected in series, which shows a strong signal-to-noise ratio and anti-interference ability.

However, previous studies were conducted in a controlled environment and may not be indicative of the actual hand use of people with cSCI living in the community. Thus, we propose a deep learning algorithm for automatically detecting hand-object interactions in egocentric videos recorded by participants with cSCI during their daily activities at home. The proposed approach is able to detect hand-object interactions with good accuracy (F1-score up to 0.82), demonstrating the feasibility of this system in uncontrolled situations (e.g., unscripted activities and variable illumination).

This drift has been previously corrected with the application of a wavelet- based filter using visual inspection of the signal to select the optimal filter level (Uva et al. Front. Physiol. 6:411, 2016), thus introducing potential operator bias. To exclude the latter we compared this approach with a newly developed automatic method based on (1) correction for actual changes in temperature and humidity inside the plethysmograph (algorithm TH) and (2) automatic selection of the wavelet filter level based on comparison between deltaVb and intra-thoracic and abdominal pressure variations measured simultaneously (algorithm WAV). The Pearson's correlation coefficient between deltaVb and the changes in volume of the chest wall (deltaVcw) simultaneously obtained by optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) was calculated after correction of deltaVb with TH and WAV applied separately, TH and WAV applied consecutively (TH+WAV), manual selection of a wavelet filter based on visual inspection (MAN) or no correction (CTRL). The correlation between deltaVb and deltaVcw increased marginally with WAV, TH+WAV and MAN compared to CTRL (P <; 0.01). Conversely, TH alone yielded a lower correlation (P <; 0.01). It follows that while the automated wavelet filter level selection method (WAV) represents an effective, operator-independent method for the correction of deltaVb, whether or not it is combined with specific correction for changes in thermodynamic conditions inside the plethysmograph, the manual method (MAN) yields satisfactory results without the constraints of intra-thoracic and abdominal pressure measurement.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176170","","Temperature measurement;Correlation;Thermodynamics;Humidity;Plethysmography;Visualization","Algorithms;Plethysmography;Plethysmography, Whole Body;Temperature;Thermodynamics","3","","7","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because the temporal width is magnified, the temporal resolution of the photomultiplier tube is better than that of the output collector alone. The result shows that the temporal resolution of the detector is improved to be 25 ps by using pulse-dilation technology, which is much better than 300 ps temporal resolution while without pulse-dilation.

A particular characteristic of these prosumers which makes them a suitable candidate for enhancing the grid flexibility is their high ramp rate. A new ancillary service product some USA independent system operators have launched, named flexible ramping product, enhances the flexibility of the grid by assuring sufficient ramp rates. This study proposes a novel framework for the participation of the DPs through a mediator (aggregator) in the day-ahead energy and flexibility markets. The proposed interaction framework is a bi-level optimisation, which by using the single-level mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions of the lower level optimisation is converted to a single-level MILP optimisation. To encourage the DPs to participate in this framework, the aggregator must assure each agent that their profitability will be higher than the profit they could make by trading energy based on distribution level energy tariffs. The simulation results verify the participating DPs and grid market operators both benefiting.","","","10.1049/oap-cired.2021.0104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582849","","","","3","","12","","21 Oct 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In our model, we combine near-field wave optic and far-field ray tracing simulations, showing that the designed photonic structures spectrally split blue, green and red photons into different locations in the tissue. Furthermore, by introducing dual grating components, photons at different wavelengths can be spatially separated at different depths.

The studied network had been subject to voltage excursions due to photovoltaic productions before implanting the solutions. The hosting capacity, being difficult to compute without precise knowledge of the network characteristics, has been computed using an innovative planning tool developed by Odit-e, that only requires smart meters data. Both of the studied mitigation solutions have solved the voltage excursions, and the network hosting capacity has increased by 67%. However, with random photovoltaic insertion generating huge voltage imbalances, the balancing method proved to be more appropriate while being much easier to implement, and should therefore be chosen first.

While it is easy to switch the amplitude of an RF signal at GHz speed, unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to perform phase or frequency switching of an RF signal with a fast switching time in the picosecond range. In this paper, a real-time RF signal switching technique is proposed and demonstrated based on polarization dependent four-wave mixing in a highly-nonlinear optical fiber. Due to the amplitude, phase, and frequency transparent property of four-wave mixing, the proposed scheme is capable of manipulating multidimensional RF signal of over tens of GHz frequency, and achieve frequency hopping and phase switching of a GHz RF signal. The switching time is not limited by the proposed temporal switching technique; instead, it is solely depending on the rise/fall time of the control signal itself. Furthermore, the generation of frequency hopping signal with a switching time of 50 ps, as well as simultaneously frequency and phase switching of a GHz RF signal have been experimentally demonstrated based on the proposed RF signal switching scheme.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2020.2977847","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1653525); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9020098","Microwave photonics;RF signal switching;frequency hopping;four-wave mixing.","Optical switches;RF signals;Optical polarization;Frequency modulation;Optical mixing","","3","","28","CCBY","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the convergence of the proposed identification algorithm is analyzed by using the martingale convergence theorem.

Irrespective of treatment options, approximately 1/3 will suffer secondary ACL injuries following their return to activity (RTA). Despite this, there are no evidence-informed RTA guidelines to aid clinicians in deciding when this should occur. The first step towards these guidelines is to identify relevant and feasible measures to assess the functional status of these patients. The purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate tests frequently used to assess functional capacity following surgery using a Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPT). Thirty-six healthy and forty-two ACLinjured adolescent females performed a series of functional tasks. Motion analysis along with spatiotemporal measures were used to extract thirty clinically relevant variables. The REPT reduced these variables down to two limb symmetry measures (maximum anterior hop and maximum lateral hop), capable of classifying injury status between the healthy and ACL injured participants with a 69% sensitivity, 78% specificity and kappa statistic of 0.464. We, therefore, conclude that the REPT model was able to evaluate functional capacity as it relates to injury status in adolescent females. We also recommend considering these variables when developing RTA assessments and guidelines.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176010","","Injuries;Task analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Biomedical measurement;Large scale integration;Surgery;Decision trees","Adolescent;Algorithms;Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction;Decision Trees;Female;Humans;Knee;Knee Injuries","3","","28","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These tests help developers during their debugging practices. One of the most promising techniques in this research field leverages search-based software testing techniques for generating crash reproducing test cases. In this paper, we introduce Botsing, an open-source search-based crash reproduction framework for Java. Botsing implements state-of-the-art and novel approaches for crash reproduction. The well-documented architecture of Botsing makes it an easy-to-extend framework, and can hence be used for implementing new approaches to improve crash reproduction. We have applied Botsing to a wide range of crashes collected from open source systems. Furthermore, we conducted a qualitative assessment of the crash-reproducing test cases with our industrial partners. In both cases, Botsing could reproduce a notable amount of the given stack traces.Demo. video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6XaQjHqe48 Botsing website: https://stamp-project.github.io/botsing/","2643-1572","978-1-4503-6768-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9286108","Search-based software testing;crash reproduction;Botsing","Software testing;Java;Debugging;Computer crashes;Open source software;Software engineering;Genetic algorithms","","3","","19","","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we studied how the electrostatic distribution was affected by the structure of a back-side bombarded CMOS (BSB-CMOS) and the anode position in electron-bombarded sensors. The simulation results reveal that the electrostatic field may cause a fault in the signal readout of the BSB-CMOS when the anode is positioned under the BSB-CMOS. In contrast, we found that the structure of an EBCMOS will aid electron focusing when the anode is positioned above the BSB-CMOS and the doping concentration of the electron multiplier layer is high. However, the high doping concentration of the electron multiplier layer will reduce the electron collection efficiency due to its rapid electron-hole recombination. We then designed a structure in which the multiplier layer has an overlying ultra-thin highly-doped layer, with an electrostatic distribution that functions to focus electrons. At the same time, this configuration can effectively prevent most of the multiplier electrons from recombining because ultra-thin highly-doped layer is much thinner than incident depth for the high-energy electron. This simulation study will provide a theoretical foundation for the fabrication of high-performance EBCMOS devices. Graphic abstract: a) EBCMOS physical model in Ansoft Maxwell 3D; b) The distribution of electrostatic distribution for BSB-CMOS with an ultra-thin heavily-doped layer. Electrostatic distribution of EBCMOS with different configurations were simulated. The results reveal that the electrostatic field may cause an erroneous readout of the BSB-CMOS if the anode is positioned under the BSB-CMOS. If the high voltage anode is positioned above the CMOS sensor, this is improved, especially when an ultrathin highly-doped multiplier layer is added to improve electron collection efficiency.

TDDE with an accuracy in the low picosecond range and a low computational cost is essential to extend the application of compact ultrasonic clamp-on flow meters to flow velocities below 50 mm/s. A digitized sinusoidal measurement signal of an ultrasonic flow meter is transformed into an analytic signal by using a time-discrete Hilbert transform. The phase shift between two analytic signals is proportional to the time delay difference of the two ultrasonic waves. In our approach, the response of the measurement system is compared with that of a model system. The standard error for the TDDE is 5 ps for a sampling time of 100 ns without interpolation under typical operating conditions. The time delay difference is calculated with tight tolerances, paving the way to the measurement of the smallest volume flows with high accuracy.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2019.2945697","European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8861086","Hilbert transform;model system;ultrasonic;subsample time delay difference estimation;TDE;analytic signals;clamp-on flow meters","Delay effects;Acoustics;Mathematical model;Estimation;Meters;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Electron tubes","","3","","10","CCBY","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their target detection performance depends on the correlation between the received and reference signals, and the improved detection performance of QTMS radars over noise radars is due to the fact that it has an increased correlation. In this paper, we present a novel way of understanding how detection performance depends on the correlation by relating the correlation to the integration time. Concretely, we prove that increasing the correlation by a given factor is equivalent to increasing the integration time by the square of that factor. We apply this result to a recent QTMS radar experiment where the increase in correlation was approximately a factor of 3. This was found to be equivalent to increasing the integration time by a factor of 9, thus confirming the validity of our result and approximation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216087","Quantum radar;quantum two-mode squeezing radar;noise radar;correlation;integration time","Correlation;Radar detection;Radar cross-sections;Covariance matrices;Object detection","","3","","15","CCBYNCND","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Input text is first analyzed, matched against handcrafted patterns developed using regular expressions to detect any NSWs. Upon detection, NSWs are tokenized and classified into one of the semiotic classes and then if necessary, into one of the Luganda noun classes. These are subsequently verbalized, each according to its semiotic as well as noun class, and a new text file is produced.

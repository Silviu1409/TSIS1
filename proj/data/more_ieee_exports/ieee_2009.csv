But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500–1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206848","","Large-scale systems;Image databases;Explosions;Internet;Robustness;Information retrieval;Image retrieval;Multimedia databases;Ontologies;Spine","","35240","202","28","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We cast the recognition problem as one of classifying among multiple linear regression models and argue that new theory from sparse signal representation offers the key to addressing this problem. Based on a sparse representation computed by \ell^{1}-minimization, we propose a general classification algorithm for (image-based) object recognition. This new framework provides new insights into two crucial issues in face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to occlusion. For feature extraction, we show that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed, the choice of features is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is whether the number of features is sufficiently large and whether the sparse representation is correctly computed. Unconventional features such as downsampled images and random projections perform just as well as conventional features such as Eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension of the feature space surpasses certain threshold, predicted by the theory of sparse representation. This framework can handle errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting the fact that these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard (pixel) basis. The theory of sparse representation helps predict how much occlusion the recognition algorithm can handle and how to choose the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available databases to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the above claims.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483511","Face recognition;feature extraction;occlusion and corruption;sparse representation;compressed sensing;\ell^{1}--minimization;validation and outlier rejection.;Classifier design and evaluation;Face and gesture recognition;Feature evaluation and selection;Occlusion;Spare representation;Outlier rejection","Robustness;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Humans;Lighting;Linear regression;Signal representations;Classification algorithms;Object recognition;Image recognition","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Cluster Analysis;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","7738","47","62","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5128907","Imbalanced learning;classification;sampling methods;cost-sensitive learning;kernel-based learning;active learning;assessment metrics.","Availability;Large-scale systems;Surveillance;Data security;IP networks;Finance;Data analysis;Decision making;Data engineering;Knowledge representation","","5754","8","145","IEEE","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"From PID to Active Disturbance Rejection Control","J. Han","Institute of Systems Science, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,"27 Feb 2009","2009","56","3","900","906","Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) can be summarized as follows: it inherits from proportional-integral-derivative (PID) the quality that makes it such a success: the error driven, rather than model-based, control law; it takes from modern control theory its best offering: the state observer; it embraces the power of nonlinear feedback and puts it to full use; it is a useful digital control technology developed out of an experimental platform rooted in computer simulations. ADRC is made possible only when control is taken as an experimental science, instead of a mathematical one. It is motivated by the ever increasing demands from industry that requires the control technology to move beyond PID, which has dominated the practice for over 80 years. Specifically, there are four areas of weakness in PID that we strive to address: 1) the error computation; 2) noise degradation in the derivative control; 3) oversimplification and the loss of performance in the control law in the form of a linear weighted sum; and 4) complications brought by the integral control. Correspondingly, we propose four distinct measures: 1) a simple differential equation as a transient trajectory generator; 2) a noise-tolerant tracking differentiator; 3) the nonlinear control laws; and 4) the concept and method of total disturbance estimation and rejection. Together, they form a new set of tools and a new way of control design. Times and again in experiments and on factory floors, ADRC proves to be a capable replacement of PID with unmistakable advantage in performance and practicality, providing solutions to pressing engineering problems of today. With the new outlook and possibilities that ADRC represents, we further believe that control engineering may very well break the hold of classical PID and enter a new era, an era that brings back the spirit of innovations.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.2011621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796887","Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC);extended state observer (ESO);nonlinear proportional–integral–derivative (PID);tracking differentiator","Three-term control;Pi control;Proportional control;Error correction;Computer errors;Control theory;State feedback;Digital control;Computer simulation;Industrial control","","4977","4","15","IEEE","27 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Channel Polarization: A Method for Constructing Capacity-Achieving Codes for Symmetric Binary-Input Memoryless Channels","E. Arikan","Department of Electrical-Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey",IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,"16 Jun 2009","2009","55","7","3051","3073"," A method is proposed, called channel polarization, to construct code sequences that achieve the symmetric capacity $I(W)$ of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC) $W$. The symmetric capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of $N$ independent copies of a given B-DMC  $W$, a second set of $N$  binary-input channels $\{W_N^{(i)}:1\le i\le N\}$  such that, as $N$ becomes large, the fraction of indices  $i$ for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near $1$  approaches $I(W)$ and the fraction for which  $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near $0$  approaches $1-I(W)$. The polarized channels  $\{W_N^{(i)}\}$ are well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate $1$ through those with capacity near  $1$ and at rate $0$ through the remaining. Codes constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves that, given any B-DMC $W$ with $I(W)> 0$ and any target rate $R ≪ I(W)$, there exists a sequence of polar codes $\{{\Fraktur {C}}_n;n\ge 1\}$  such that  ${\Fraktur {C}}_n$ has block-length $N=2^n$ , rate  $\ge R$, and probability of block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as $P_{e}(N,R) \le O(N^{-{1\over 4}})$  independently of the code rate. This performance is achievable by encoders and decoders with complexity $O(N\log N)$ for each.

However, the success of DE in solving a specific problem crucially depends on appropriately choosing trial vector generation strategies and their associated control parameter values. Employing a trial-and-error scheme to search for the most suitable strategy and its associated parameter settings requires high computational costs. Moreover, at different stages of evolution, different strategies coupled with different parameter settings may be required in order to achieve the best performance. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive DE (SaDE) algorithm, in which both trial vector generation strategies and their associated control parameter values are gradually self-adapted by learning from their previous experiences in generating promising solutions. Consequently, a more suitable generation strategy along with its parameter settings can be determined adaptively to match different phases of the search process/evolution. The performance of the SaDE algorithm is extensively evaluated (using codes available from P. N. Suganthan) on a suite of 26 bound-constrained numerical optimization problems and compares favorably with the conventional DE and several state-of-the-art parameter adaptive DE variants.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2008.927706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632146","Differential evolution (DE);global numerical optimization;parameter adaptation;self-adaptation;strategy adaptation","Feedback;Stochastic processes;Computational efficiency;Power engineering and energy;Encoding;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Mechanical engineering;Pattern recognition;Size control","","2931","","42","IEEE","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It seamlessly augments users' cognitive abilities via compute-intensive capabilities such as speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. By thus empowering mobile users, we could transform many areas of human activity. This article discusses the technical obstacles to these transformations and proposes a new architecture for overcoming them. In this architecture, a mobile user exploits virtual machine (VM) technology to rapidly instantiate customized service software on a nearby cloudlet and then uses that service over a wireless LAN; the mobile device typically functions as a thin client with respect to the service. A cloudlet is a trusted, resource-rich computer or cluster of computers that's well-connected to the Internet and available for use by nearby mobile devices. Our strategy of leveraging transiently customized proximate infrastructure as a mobile device moves with its user through the physical world is called cloudlet-based, resource-rich, mobile computing. Crisp interactive response, which is essential for seamless augmentation of human cognition, is easily achieved in this architecture because of the cloudlet's physical proximity and one-hop network latency. Using a cloudlet also simplifies the challenge of meeting the peak bandwidth demand of multiple users interactively generating and receiving media such as high-definition video and high-resolution images. Rapid customization of infrastructure for diverse applications emerges as a critical requirement, and our results from a proof-of-concept prototype suggest that VM technology can indeed help meet this requirement.","1558-2590","","10.1109/MPRV.2009.82","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280678","dynamic VM synthesis;cyber foraging;augmented reality;cognitive augmentation;virtual machines;resource constraints","Mobile computing;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Humans;Virtual manufacturing;Speech recognition;Natural language processing;Virtual machining;Wireless LAN;Internet","","2795","36","20","IEEE","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Specifically, we derive a third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule that provides a set of cubature points scaling linearly with the state-vector dimension. The CKF may therefore provide a systematic solution for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems. The paper also includes the derivation of a square-root version of the CKF for improved numerical stability. The CKF is tested experimentally in two nonlinear state estimation problems. In the first problem, the proposed cubature rule is used to compute the second-order statistics of a nonlinearly transformed Gaussian random variable. The second problem addresses the use of the CKF for tracking a maneuvering aircraft.

More concretely, we present several optimizations that reduce their computation times drastically by either caching previously computed values or by revising their theoretical formulations. The latter results in a new type of local features, called Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH), which retain most of the discriminative power of the PFH. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for the online computation of FPFH features for realtime applications.

We focus on the stability analysis for switched linear systems under arbitrary switching, and we highlight necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability. After a brief review of the stability analysis under restricted switching and the multiple Lyapunov function theory, the switching stabilization problem is studied, and a variety of switching stabilization methods found in the literature are outlined. Then the switching stabilizability problem is investigated, that is under what condition it is possible to stabilize a switched system by properly designing switching control laws. Note that the switching stabilizability problem has been one of the most elusive problems in the switched systems literature.

Rather, we hope to make the point that there are powerful, easy-to-use, and easy-to-understand alternatives that might be deployed depending on the application environment and needs. While we expect (and indeed, hope) that the MSE will continue to be widely used as a signal fidelity measure, it is our greater desire to see more advanced signal fidelity measures being used, especially in applications where perceptual criteria might be relevant. Ideally, the performance of a new signal processing algorithm might be compared to other algorithms using several fidelity criteria.

To address this problem, efforts to develop algorithms that can process naturally occurring human affective behaviour have recently emerged. Moreover, an increasing number of efforts are reported toward multimodal fusion for human affect analysis including audiovisual fusion, linguistic and paralinguistic fusion, and multi-cue visual fusion based on facial expressions, head movements, and body gestures. This paper introduces and surveys these recent advances. We first discuss human emotion perception from a psychological perspective. Next we examine available approaches to solving the problem of machine understanding of human affective behavior, and discuss important issues like the collection and availability of training and test data.

This paper surveys the fundamental capacity limits and associated transmission techniques for different wireless network design paradigms based on this promising technology. These paradigms are unified by the definition of a cognitive radio as an intelligent wireless communication device that exploits side information about its environment to improve spectrum utilization. This side information typically comprises knowledge about the activity, channels, codebooks, and/or messages of other nodes with which the cognitive node shares the spectrum. Based on the nature of the available side information as well as a priori rules about spectrum usage, cognitive radio systems seek to underlay, overlay, or interweave the cognitive radios' signals with the transmissions of noncognitive nodes. We provide a comprehensive summary of the known capacity characterizations in terms of upper and lower bounds for each of these three approaches. The increase in system degrees of freedom obtained through cognitive radios is also illuminated. This information-theoretic survey provides guidelines for the spectral efficiency gains possible through cognitive radios, as well as practical design ideas to mitigate the coexistence challenges in today's crowded spectrum.

Optics has potential benefits in interconnect density, energy, and timing. The necessity of low interconnect energy imposes low limits especially on the energy of the optical output devices, with a ~ 10 fJ/bit device energy target emerging. Some optical modulators and radical laser approaches may meet this requirement. Low (e.g., a few femtofarads or less) photodetector capacitance is important. Very compact wavelength splitters are essential for connecting the information to fibers. Dense waveguides are necessary on-chip or on boards for guided wave optical approaches, especially if very high clock rates or dense wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is to be avoided. Free-space optics potentially can handle the necessary bandwidths even without fast clocks or WDM.

More importantly, it can perform a global search over the entire search space with faster convergence speed. The APSO consists of two main steps. First, by evaluating the population distribution and particle fitness, a real-time evolutionary state estimation procedure is performed to identify one of the following four defined evolutionary states, including exploration, exploitation, convergence, and jumping out in each generation. It enables the automatic control of inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and other algorithmic parameters at run time to improve the search efficiency and convergence speed. Then, an elitist learning strategy is performed when the evolutionary state is classified as convergence state. The strategy will act on the globally best particle to jump out of the likely local optima. The APSO has comprehensively been evaluated on 12 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. The effects of parameter adaptation and elitist learning will be studied. Results show that APSO substantially enhances the performance of the PSO paradigm in terms of convergence speed, global optimality, solution accuracy, and algorithm reliability. As APSO introduces two new parameters to the PSO paradigm only, it does not introduce an additional design or implementation complexity.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2015956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4812104","Adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO);evolutionary computation;global optimization;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Particle swarm optimization;Convergence;Iterative algorithms;State estimation;Acceleration;Evolutionary computation;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Performance evaluation;Automatic control","","1526","","58","IEEE","7 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SLICE architecture enables sub-wavelength, superwavelength, and multiple-rate data traffic accommodation in a highly spectrum-efficient manner, thereby providing a fractional bandwidth service. Dynamic bandwidth variation of elastic optical paths provides network operators with new business opportunities offering cost-effective and highly available connectivity services through time-dependent bandwidth sharing, energy-efficient network operation, and highly survivable restoration with bandwidth squeezing. We also discuss an optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based flexible-rate transponder and a bandwidth-variable wavelength cross-connect as the enabling technologies of SLICE concept.

The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531750","Handwriting recognition;online handwriting;offline handwriting;connectionist temporal classification;bidirectional long short-term memory;recurrent neural networks;hidden Markov model.;Unconstrained handwriting recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Online handwriting recognition;Offline handwriting recognition;Long Short-Term Memory;Connectionist temporal classification","Handwriting recognition;Hidden Markov models;Character recognition;Text recognition;Speech;Recurrent neural networks;Labeling;Databases;Robustness;Size measurement","Algorithms;Automatic Data Processing;Handwriting;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reading;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","1408","24","56","IEEE","30 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data acquisition rates reaching more than thousands of images per second enable the real-time visualization of shear mechanical waves propagating in biological tissues, which convey information about local viscoelastic properties of tissues. The first proposed approach for reaching such ultrafast frame rates consists of transmitting plane waves into the medium. However, because the beamforming process is then restricted to the receive mode, the echographic images obtained in the ultrafast mode suffer from a low quality in terms of resolution and contrast and affect the robustness of the transient elastography mode. It is here proposed to improve the beamforming process by using a coherent recombination of compounded plane-wave transmissions to recover high-quality echographic images without degrading the high frame rate capabilities. A theoretical model is derived for the comparison between the proposed method and the conventional B-mode imaging in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution. Our model predicts that a significantly smaller number of insonifications, 10 times lower, is sufficient to reach an image quality comparable to conventional B-mode. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by in vitro experiments performed in tissue-mimicking phantoms. Such results raise the appeal of coherent compounds for use with standard imaging modes such as B-mode or color flow. Moreover, in the context of transient elastography, ultrafast frame rates can be preserved while increasing the image quality compared with flat insonifications. Improvements on the transient elastography mode are presented and discussed.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4816058","","Ultrasonography;Ultrasonic imaging;Biological tissues;Array signal processing;Image resolution;Image quality;Data acquisition;Data visualization;Viscosity;Elasticity","Algorithms;Elasticity;Elasticity Imaging Techniques;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Models, Statistical;Models, Theoretical;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography, Mammary;Viscosity","1402","27","31","IEEE","21 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The background noise, although often characterized as Gaussian, is not white, but has a decaying power spectral density. The channel capacity depends on the distance, and may be extremely limited. Because acoustic propagation is best supported at low frequencies, although the total available bandwidth may be low, an acoustic communication system is inherently wideband in the sense that the bandwidth is not negligible with respect to its center frequency. The channel can have a sparse impulse response, where each physical path acts as a time-varying low-pass filter, and motion introduces additional Doppler spreading and shifting. Surface waves, internal turbulence, fluctuations in the sound speed, and other small-scale phenomena contribute to random signal variations. At this time, there are no standardized models for the acoustic channel fading, and experimental measurements are often made to assess the statistical properties of the channel in particular deployment sites.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2009.4752682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752682","","Underwater acoustics;Communication channels;Acoustic propagation;Frequency;Bandwidth;Attenuation;Background noise;Channel capacity;Wideband;Low pass filters","","1391","5","15","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this case, different techniques based on stochastic geometry and the theory of random geometric graphs -including point process theory, percolation theory, and probabilistic combinatorics-have led to results on the connectivity, the capacity, the outage probability, and other fundamental limits of wireless networks.

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, “Animals with Attributes”, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206594","","Object detection;Humans;Marine animals;Testing;Learning systems;Face detection;Detectors;Training data;Cybernetics;Computer vision","","1303","14","40","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose a unified framework for combining these two families of methods. We further show how this combined approach can be applied to obtain super resolution from as little as a single image (with no database or prior examples). Our approach is based on the observation that patches in a natural image tend to redundantly recur many times inside the image, both within the same scale, as well as across different scales. Recurrence of patches within the same image scale (at subpixel misalignments) gives rise to the classical super-resolution, whereas recurrence of patches across different scales of the same image gives rise to example-based super-resolution. Our approach attempts to recover at each pixel its best possible resolution increase based on its patch redundancy within and across scales.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459271","","Image resolution;Strontium;Image databases;Computer science;Mathematics;Layout;Equations;Image reconstruction;Computer vision;Frequency","","1299","42","19","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Basis pursuit, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), wavelet-based deconvolution and reconstruction, and compressed sensing (CS) are a few well-known areas in which problems of this type appear. One standard approach is to minimize an objective function that includes a quadratic (lscr 2) error term added to a sparsity-inducing (usually lscr1) regularizater. We present an algorithmic framework for the more general problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex function and a nonsmooth, possibly nonconvex regularizer. We propose iterative methods in which each step is obtained by solving an optimization subproblem involving a quadratic term with diagonal Hessian (i.e., separable in the unknowns) plus the original sparsity-inducing regularizer; our approach is suitable for cases in which this subproblem can be solved much more rapidly than the original problem. Under mild conditions (namely convexity of the regularizer), we prove convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm to a minimum of the objective function. In addition to solving the standard lscr2-lscr1 case, our framework yields efficient solution techniques for other regularizers, such as an lscrinfin norm and group-separable regularizers. It also generalizes immediately to the case in which the data is complex rather than real. Experiments with CS problems show that our approach is competitive with the fastest known methods for the standard lscr2-lscr1 problem, as well as being efficient on problems with other separable regularization terms.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2016892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4799134","Compressed sensing;optimization;reconstruction;sparse approximation","Image reconstruction;Iterative algorithms;Linear systems;Equations;Signal processing;Image processing;Statistics;Deconvolution;Compressed sensing;Iterative methods","","1256","4","81","IEEE","10 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given the increasing age of many industrial systems and the dynamic industrial manufacturing market, intelligent and low-cost industrial automation systems are required to improve the productivity and efficiency of such systems. The collaborative nature of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) brings several advantages over traditional wired industrial monitoring and control systems, including self-organization, rapid deployment, flexibility, and inherent intelligent-processing capability. In this regard, IWSN plays a vital role in creating a highly reliable and self-healing industrial system that rapidly responds to real-time events with appropriate actions. In this paper, first, technical challenges and design principles are introduced in terms of hardware development, system architectures and protocols, and software development. Specifically, radio technologies, energy-harvesting techniques, and cross-layer design for IWSNs have been discussed. In addition, IWSN standards are presented for the system owners, who plan to utilize new IWSN technologies for industrial automation applications.

While modern GPUs offer orders of magnitude more raw computing power than contemporary CPUs, many important applications, even those with abundant data level parallelism, do not achieve peak performance. This paper characterizes several non-graphics applications written in NVIDIA's CUDA programming model by running them on a novel detailed microarchitecture performance simulator that runs NVIDIA's parallel thread execution (PTX) virtual instruction set. For this study, we selected twelve non-trivial CUDA applications demonstrating varying levels of performance improvement on GPU hardware (versus a CPU-only sequential version of the application). We study the performance of these applications on our GPU performance simulator with configurations comparable to contemporary high-end graphics cards. We characterize the performance impact of several microarchitecture design choices including choice of interconnect topology, use of caches, design of memory controller, parallel workload distribution mechanisms, and memory request coalescing hardware. Two observations we make are (1) that for the applications we study, performance is more sensitive to interconnect bisection bandwidth rather than latency, and (2) that, for some applications, running fewer threads concurrently than on-chip resources might otherwise allow can improve performance by reducing contention in the memory system.","","978-1-4244-4184-6","10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4919648","","Analytical models;Yarn;Graphics;Parallel processing;Microarchitecture;Hardware;Process design;Concurrent computing;Parallel programming;Computational modeling","","1239","4","46","IEEE","12 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one?

The MRF, trained via supervised learning, models both image depth cues as well as the relationships between different parts of the image. Other than assuming that the environment is made up of a number of small planes, our model makes no explicit assumptions about the structure of the scene; this enables the algorithm to capture much more detailed 3D structure than does prior art and also give a much richer experience in the 3D flythroughs created using image-based rendering, even for scenes with significant nonvertical structure.

Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (“spotty”) or discriminative (“dogs have it but sheep do not”). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206772","","Object recognition;Dogs;Computer vision;Shape;Motorcycles;Leg;Cats;Object detection;Detectors;Testing","","1176","11","24","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two kinds of detectors, i.e., global detector for whole scanning windows and part detectors for local regions, are learned from the training data using linear SVM. For each ambiguous scanning window, we construct an occlusion likelihood map by using the response of each block of the HOG feature to the global detector. The occlusion likelihood map is then segmented by Mean-shift approach. The segmented portion of the window with a majority of negative response is inferred as an occluded region. If partial occlusion is indicated with high likelihood in a certain scanning window, part detectors are applied on the unoccluded regions to achieve the final classification on the current scanning window. With the help of the augmented HOG-LBP feature and the global-part occlusion handling method, we achieve a detection rate of 91.3% with FPPW= 10−6, 94.7% with FPPW= 10−5, and 97.9% with FPPW= 10−4 on the INRIA dataset, which, to our best knowledge, is the best human detection performance on the INRIA dataset. The global-part occlusion handling method is further validated using synthesized occlusion data constructed from the INRIA and Pascal dataset.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459207","","Humans;Detectors;Support vector machines;Image segmentation;Histograms;Support vector machine classification;Training data;Object detection;Pixel;Testing","","1161","49","34","IEEE","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interaction force is then mapped into the image plane to obtain Force Flow for every pixel in every frame. Randomly selected spatio-temporal volumes of Force Flow are used to model the normal behavior of the crowd. We classify frames as normal and abnormal by using a bag of words approach. The regions of anomalies in the abnormal frames are localized using interaction forces. The experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset from University of Minnesota for escape panic scenarios and a challenging dataset of crowd videos taken from the web. The experiments show that the proposed method captures the dynamics of the crowd behavior successfully.

In particular, a class of tracking techniques called “tracking by detection” have been shown to give promising results at real-time speeds. These methods train a discriminative classifier in an online manner to separate the object from the background. This classifier bootstraps itself by using the current tracker state to extract positive and negative examples from the current frame. Slight inaccuracies in the tracker can therefore lead to incorrectly labeled training examples, which degrades the classifier and can cause further drift. In this paper we show that using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) instead of traditional supervised learning avoids these problems, and can therefore lead to a more robust tracker with fewer parameter tweaks.

In crowded scenarios a strong dynamic model is particularly important, because more accurate predictions allow for smaller search regions, which greatly simplifies data association. Traditional dynamic models predict the location for each target solely based on its own history, without taking into account the remaining scene objects. Collisions are resolved only when they happen. Such an approach ignores important aspects of human behavior: people are driven by their future destination, take into account their environment, anticipate collisions, and adjust their trajectories at an early stage in order to avoid them. In this work, we introduce a model of dynamic social behavior, inspired by models developed for crowd simulation. The model is trained with videos recorded from birds-eye view at busy locations, and applied as a motion model for multi-people tracking from a vehicle-mounted camera. Experiments on real sequences show that accounting for social interactions and scene knowledge improves tracking performance, especially during occlusions.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459260","","Predictive models;Vehicle dynamics;Layout;Humans;Computer vision;Trajectory;Cameras;Legged locomotion;Path planning;Computer science","","990","8","24","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes a family of improved variants of the DE/target-to-best/1/bin scheme, which utilizes the concept of the neighborhood of each population member. The idea of small neighborhoods, defined over the index-graph of parameter vectors, draws inspiration from the community of the PSO algorithms. The proposed schemes balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of DE without imposing serious additional burdens in terms of function evaluations. They are shown to be statistically significantly better than or at least comparable to several existing DE variants as well as a few other significant evolutionary computing techniques over a test suite of 24 benchmark functions.

Most scene recognition models that work well for outdoor scenes perform poorly in the indoor domain. The main difficulty is that while some indoor scenes (e.g. corridors) can be well characterized by global spatial properties, others (e.g, bookstores) are better characterized by the objects they contain. More generally, to address the indoor scenes recognition problem we need a model that can exploit local and global discriminative information.

Alternatives based on manned airborne platforms are lacking due to their high operational costs. A fundamental requirement for providing useful remote sensing products in agriculture is the capacity to combine high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times. Remote sensing sensors placed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could fill this gap, providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based UAV equipped with inexpensive thermal and narrowband multispectral imaging sensors. During summer of 2007, the platform was flown over agricultural fields, obtaining thermal imagery in the 7.5-13-mum region (40-cm resolution) and narrowband multispectral imagery in the 400-800-nm spectral region (20-cm resolution). Surface reflectance and temperature imagery were obtained, after atmospheric corrections with MODTRAN. Biophysical parameters were estimated using vegetation indices, namely, normalized difference vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index, and photochemical reflectance index (PRI), coupled with SAILH and FLIGHT models. As a result, the image products of leaf area index, chlorophyll content (C ab), and water stress detection from PRI index and canopy temperature were produced and successfully validated. This paper demonstrates that results obtained with a low-cost UAV system for agricultural applications yielded comparable estimations, if not better, than those obtained by traditional manned airborne sensors.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2010457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781575","Multispectral;narrowband;radiative transfer modeling;remote sensing;stress detection;thermal;unmanned aerial system (UAS);unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Remote monitoring;Narrowband;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Vegetation mapping;Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Remote sensing;Reflectivity;Image sensors;Crops","","941","1","75","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we give an overview of cooperative localization approaches and apply them to ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) wireless networks. UWB transmission technology is particularly attractive for short- to medium-range localization, especially in GPS-denied environments: wide transmission bandwidths enable robust communication in dense multipath scenarios, and the ability to resolve subnanosecond delays results in centimeter-level distance resolution. We will describe several cooperative localization algorithms and quantify their performance, based on realistic UWB ranging models developed through an extensive measurement campaign using FCC-compliant UWB radios. We will also present a powerful localization algorithm by mapping a graphical model for statistical inference onto the network topology, which results in a net-factor graph, and by developing a suitable net-message passing schedule. The resulting algorithm (SPAWN) is fully distributed, can cope with a wide variety of scenarios, and requires little communication overhead to achieve accurate and robust localization.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2008.2008853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4802193","Cooperative processing;factor graphs;localization;sum-product algorithm;ultrawide bandwidth transmission","Wireless networks;Bandwidth;Inference algorithms;Laboratories;Wireless communication;Robustness;Pollution measurement;Temperature sensors;Phase measurement;State estimation","","941","11","131","IEEE","16 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed power control strategy contains a virtual inductor at the interfacing inverter output and an accurate power control and sharing algorithm with consideration of both impedance voltage drop effect and DG local load effect. Specifically, the virtual inductance can effectively prevent the coupling between the real and reactive powers by introducing a predominantly inductive impedance even in a low-voltage network with resistive line impedances. On the other hand, based on the predominantly inductive impedance, the proposed accurate reactive power sharing algorithm functions by estimating the impedance voltage drops and significantly improves the reactive power control and sharing accuracy. Finally, considering the different locations of loads in a multibus microgrid, the reactive power control accuracy is further improved by employing an online estimated reactive power offset to compensate the effects of DG local load power demands.

This speed allows visibility restoration to be applied for the first time within real-time processing applications such as sign, lane-marking and obstacle detection from an in-vehicle camera. Another advantage is the possibility to handle both color images or gray level images since the ambiguity between the presence of fog and the objects with low color saturation is solved by assuming only small objects can have colors with low saturation. The algorithm is controlled only by a few parameters and consists in: atmospheric veil inference, image restoration and smoothing, tone mapping. A comparative study and quantitative evaluation is proposed with a few other state of the art algorithms which demonstrates that similar or better quality results are obtained.

Cooperative communications and networking is another new communication technology paradigm that allows distributed terminals in a wireless network to collaborate through some distributed transmission or signal processing so as to realize a new form of space diversity to combat the detrimental effects of fading channels. In this paper, we consider the application of these technologies to spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing. One of the most important challenges for cognitive radio systems is to identify the presence of primary (licensed) users over a wide range of spectrum at a particular time and specific geographic location.

They provide pose and illumination invariance by modeling the space of 3D faces and the imaging process. The power of these models comes at the cost of an expensive and tedious construction process, which has led the community to focus on more easily constructed but less powerful models. With this paper we publish a generative 3D shape and texture model, the Basel face model (BFM), and demonstrate its application to several face recognition task. We improve on previous models by offering higher shape and texture accuracy due to a better scanning device and less correspondence artifacts due to an improved registration algorithm. The same 3D face model can be fit to 2D or 3D images acquired under different situations and with different sensors using an analysis by synthesis method. The resulting model parameters separate pose, lighting, imaging and identity parameters, which facilitates invariant face recognition across sensors and data sets by comparing only the identity parameters. We hope that the availability of this registered face model will spur research in generative models. Together with the model we publish a set of detailed recognition and reconstruction results on standard databases to allow complete algorithm comparisons.","","978-1-4244-4755-8","10.1109/AVSS.2009.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5279762","Basel Face Model (BFM);Morphable Model;generative 3D face models;statistical models;database;2D/3D fitting;recognition;identification","Lighting;Face recognition;Face detection;Shape;Image sensors;Power generation;Computer vision;Costs;Image analysis;Image reconstruction","","849","7","23","IEEE","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The segmentation of the data is obtained by applying spectral clustering to a similarity matrix built from this SR. Our method can handle noise, outliers as well as missing data.

Numerous localization algorithms with different accuracies, computational complexities, a-priori knowledge requirements, and different levels of robustness against non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias effects also have been reported. However, to our best knowledge, a detailed unified survey of different localization and NLOS mitigation algorithms is not available in the literature. This paper aims to give a comprehensive review of these different TOA-based localization algorithms and their technical challenges, and to point out possible future research directions. Firstly, fundamental lower bounds and some practical estimators that achieve close to these bounds are summarized for line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios. Then, after giving the fundamental lower bounds for NLOS systems, different NLOS mitigation techniques are classified and summarized. Simulation results are also provided in order to compare the performance of various techniques. Finally, a table that summarizes the key characteristics of the investigated techniques is provided to conclude the paper.","1553-877X","","10.1109/SURV.2009.090308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5208736","Cramer-Rao Lower Bound, Location Estimation, NLOS Mitigation, Positioning, Time-of-Arrival","Social network services;Mobile radio mobility management;Wireless sensor networks;Emergency services;Base stations;Computational complexity;Robustness;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Wireless LAN;Marketing and sales","","837","39","60","IEEE","21 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fading is exploited for multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) channels to provide better performance over conventional amplitude/phase modulation (APM) techniques. In SSK, it is the antenna index used during transmission that relays information, rather than the transmitted symbols themselves. This absence of symbol information eliminates the transceiver elements necessary for APM transmission and detection (such as coherent detectors). As well, the simplicity involved in modulation reduces the detection complexity compared to that of SM, while achieving almost identical performance gains. Throughout the paper, we illustrate SSK's strength by studying its interaction with the fading channel. We obtain tight upper bounds on bit error probability, and discuss SSK's performance under some non-ideal channel conditions (estimation error and spatial correlation). Analytical and simulation results show performance gains over APM systems (3 dB at a bit error rate of 10-5), making SSK an interesting candidate for future wireless applications. We then extend SSK concepts to incorporate channel coding, where in particular, we consider a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) system using iterative decoding for both convolutional and turbo codes. Capacity results are derived, and improvements over APM are illustrated (up to 1 bits/s/Hz), with performance gains of up to 5 dB.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.080910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5165332","Multiple antenna array, spatial modulation.","MIMO;Performance gain;Samarium;Fading;Phase modulation;Transmitting antennas;Relays;Transceivers;Detectors;Upper bound","","827","6","50","IEEE","21 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All measures were combined according to a specific scoring system relating the obtained values to human expert variability. In general, interactive methods reached higher average scores than automatic approaches and featured a better consistency of segmentation quality.

In this context, this tutorial introduces the concepts of cooperative game theory, namely coalitional games, and their potential applications in communication and wireless networks. For this purpose, we classify coalitional games into three categories: canonical coalitional games, coalition formation games, and coalitional graph games. This new classification represents an application-oriented approach for understanding and analyzing coalitional games. For each class of coalitional games, we present the fundamental components, introduce the key properties, mathematical techniques, solution concepts, and describe the methodologies for applying these games in several applications drawn from the state-of-theart research in communications. In a nutshell, this article constitutes a unified treatment of coalitional game theory tailored to the demands of communications and network engineers.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2009.000000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5230848","","Game theory;Communication networks;Collaboration;Performance loss;Costs;Nash equilibrium;Resource management;Radio control;Communication system control;Power control","","813","2","43","IEEE","4 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"The “Physics” of Notations: Toward a Scientific Basis for Constructing Visual Notations in Software Engineering","D. Moody","Department of Information Systems & Change Management, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands",IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,"15 Dec 2009","2009","35","6","756","779","Visual notations form an integral part of the language of software engineering (SE). Yet historically, SE researchers and notation designers have ignored or undervalued issues of visual representation. In evaluating and comparing notations, details of visual syntax are rarely discussed. In designing notations, the majority of effort is spent on semantics, with graphical conventions largely an afterthought. Typically, no design rationale, scientific or otherwise, is provided for visual representation choices. While SE has developed mature methods for evaluating and designing semantics, it lacks equivalent methods for visual syntax. This paper defines a set of principles for designing cognitively effective visual notations: ones that are optimized for human communication and problem solving. Together these form a design theory, called the Physics of Notations as it focuses on the physical (perceptual) properties of notations rather than their logical (semantic) properties. The principles were synthesized from theory and empirical evidence from a wide range of fields and rest on an explicit theory of how visual notations communicate. They can be used to evaluate, compare, and improve existing visual notations as well as to construct new ones. The paper identifies serious design flaws in some of the leading SE notations, together with practical suggestions for improving them. It also showcases some examples of visual notation design excellence from SE and other fields.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353439","Modeling;analysis;diagrams;communication;visualization;visual syntax;concrete syntax.","Software engineering;Humans;Visualization;Design optimization;Problem-solving;Physics;Concrete;Flowcharts;Unified modeling language;Computer industry","","811","1","152","IEEE","15 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Under these assumptions, Olfati-Saber in a recent IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control paper proposed a flocking algorithm which by incorporating a navigational feedback enables a group of agents to track a virtual leader. This paper revisits the problem of multi-agent flocking in the absence of the above two assumptions. We first show that, even when only a fraction of agents are informed, the Olfati-Saber flocking algorithm still enables all the informed agents to move with the desired constant velocity, and an uninformed agent to also move with the same desired velocity if it can be influenced by the informed agents from time to time during the evolution. Numerical simulation demonstrates that a very small group of the informed agents can cause most of the agents to move with the desired velocity and the larger the informed group is the bigger portion of agents will move with the desired velocity. In the situation where the virtual leader travels with a varying velocity, we propose modification to the Olfati-Saber algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm enables the asymptotic tracking of the virtual leader. That is, the position and velocity of the center of mass of all agents will converge exponentially to those of the virtual leader. The convergent rate is also given.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2008.2010897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4782025","Distributed control;flocking;informed agents;nonlinear systems;virtual leader","Algorithm design and analysis;Multiagent systems;Navigation;Feedback;Evolution (biology);Numerical simulation;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Birds","","798","","33","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent algorithms have afforded dramatic progress, yet many aspects of the problem remain challenging and hard to understand. The goal of this paper is to analyze and evaluate recent blind deconvolution algorithms both theoretically and experimentally. We explain the previously reported failure of the naive MAP approach by demonstrating that it mostly favors no-blur explanations. On the other hand we show that since the kernel size is often smaller than the image size a MAP estimation of the kernel alone can be well constrained and accurately recover the true blur. The plethora of recent deconvolution techniques makes an experimental evaluation on ground-truth data important. We have collected blur data with ground truth and compared recent algorithms under equal settings. Additionally, our data demonstrates that the shift-invariant blur assumption made by most algorithms is often violated.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206815","","Deconvolution;Kernel;Algorithm design and analysis;Failure analysis;Convolution;Cameras;Signal processing;Image processing;Statistics","","793","11","23","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The underlying system models and time series data generating processes are generally complex for these applications and the models for these systems are usually not known a priori. Accurate and unbiased estimation of the time series data produced by these systems cannot always be achieved using well known linear techniques, and thus the estimation process requires more advanced time series prediction algorithms. This paper provides a survey of time series prediction applications using a novel machine learning approach: support vector machines (SVM). The underlying motivation for using SVMs is the ability of this methodology to accurately forecast time series data when the underlying system processes are typically nonlinear, non-stationary and not defined a-priori. SVMs have also been proven to outperform other non-linear techniques including neural-network based non-linear prediction techniques such as multi-layer perceptrons.The ultimate goal is to provide the reader with insight into the applications using SVM for time series prediction, to give a brief tutorial on SVMs for time series prediction, to outline some of the advantages and challenges in using SVMs for time series prediction, and to provide a source for the reader to locate books, technical journals, and other online SVM research resources.","1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2009.932254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840324","","Support vector machines;Power industry;Weather forecasting;Books;Load forecasting;Economic forecasting;Medical control systems;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;USA Councils","","774","9","105","IEEE","24 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The need for smaller, less expensive, higher performance sensors helped drive early micromachining technology, a precursor to microsystems or microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The effect of stress on doped silicon and germanium has been known since the work of Smith at Bell Laboratories in 1954. Since then, researchers have extensively reported on microscale, piezoresistive strain gauges, pressure sensors, accelerometers, and cantilever force/displacement sensors, including many commercially successful devices. In this paper, we review the history of piezoresistance, its physics and related fabrication techniques. We also discuss electrical noise in piezoresistors, device examples and design considerations, and alternative materials. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of integrated piezoresistor technology with an introduction to the physics of piezoresistivity, process and material selection and design guidance useful to researchers and device engineers.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2013612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4811093","MEMS;microfabrication;micromachining;microsensors;piezoresistance;piezoresistor;sensors","Piezoresistive devices;Silicon devices;Sensor systems;Micromachining;Microelectromechanical systems;Micromechanical devices","","768","26","380","IEEE","3 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) technology is a viable candidate for enabling accurate localization capabilities through time-of-arrival (TOA)-based ranging techniques. These techniques exploit the fine delay resolution property of UWB signals by estimating the TOA of the first signal path. Exploiting the full capabilities of UWB TOA estimation can be challenging, especially when operating in harsh propagation environments, since the direct path may not exist or it may not be the strongest. In this paper, we first give an overview of ranging techniques together with the primary sources of TOA error (including propagation effects, clock drift, and interference). We then describe fundamental TOA bounds (such as the CramÉr–Rao bound and the tighter Ziv–Zakai bound) in both ideal and multipath environments. These bounds serve as useful benchmarks in assessing the performance of TOA estimation techniques. We also explore practical low-complexity TOA estimation techniques and analyze their performance in the presence of multipath and interference using IEEE 802.15.4a channel models as well as experimental data measured in indoor residential environments.

The main advantages of the ridge gap waveguides compared to hollow waveguides are that they are planar and much cheaper to manufacture, in particular at high frequencies such as for millimeter and sub- millimeter waves. The latter is due to the fact that there are no mechanical joints across which electric currents must float. The gap waveguides have lower losses than microstrip lines, and they are completely shielded by metal so no additional packaging is needed, in contrast to the severe packaging problems associated with microstrip circuits. The gap waveguides are realized in a narrow gap between two parallel metal plates by using a texture or multilayer structure on one of the surfaces. The waves follow metal ridges in the textured surface. All wave propagation in other directions is prohibited (in cutoff) by realizing a high surface impedance (ideally a perfect magnetic conductor) in the textured surface at both sides of all ridges. Thereby, cavity resonances do not appear either within the band of operation. The present letter introduces the gap waveguide and presents some initial simulated results.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2008.2011147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4729600","Gap waveguides;metamaterials;millimeter waves;submillimeter waves;waveguides","Waveguide discontinuities;Surface waves;Surface texture;Millimeter wave technology;Hollow waveguides;Planar waveguides;Waveguide components;Microstrip;Packaging;Magnetic resonance","","743","35","13","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With parameter values chosen to obtain good fits, the circuit models yield transfer frequency responses that are in good agreement with experimental measurements over a range of frequencies that span the resonance. Resonant frequency splitting is observed experimentally and described theoretically for the multiple receiver system. In the single receiver system at resonance, more than 50% of the power that is supplied by the actual source is delivered to the load.

Recognizing action from such videos has not been addressed extensively, primarily due to the tremendous variations that result from camera motion, background clutter, changes in object appearance, and scale, etc. The main challenge is how to extract reliable and informative features from the unconstrained videos. We extract both motion and static features from the videos. Since the raw features of both types are dense yet noisy, we propose strategies to prune these features. We use motion statistics to acquire stable motion features and clean static features. Furthermore, PageRank is used to mine the most informative static features. In order to further construct compact yet discriminative visual vocabularies, a divisive information-theoretic algorithm is employed to group semantically related features. Finally, AdaBoost is chosen to integrate all the heterogeneous yet complementary features for recognition. We have tested the framework on the KTH dataset and our own dataset consisting of 11 categories of actions collected from YouTube and personal videos, and have obtained impressive results for action recognition and action localization.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206744","","Videos;Cameras;YouTube;Humans;Feature extraction;Motion pictures;Shape;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Computer vision;Vocabulary","","733","3","29","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A prevalent assumption which often guarantees recovery from the given measurements is that x lies in a known subspace. Recently, there has been growing interest in nonlinear but structured signal models, in which x lies in a union of subspaces. In this paper, we develop a general framework for robust and efficient recovery of such signals from a given set of samples. More specifically, we treat the case in which x lies in a sum of k subspaces, chosen from a larger set of m possibilities. The samples are modeled as inner products with an arbitrary set of sampling functions. To derive an efficient and robust recovery algorithm, we show that our problem can be formulated as that of recovering a block-sparse vector whose nonzero elements appear in fixed blocks. We then propose a mixed lscr2/lscr1 program for block sparse recovery. Our main result is an equivalence condition under which the proposed convex algorithm is guaranteed to recover the original signal. This result relies on the notion of block restricted isometry property (RIP), which is a generalization of the standard RIP used extensively in the context of compressed sensing. Based on RIP, we also prove stability of our approach in the presence of noise and modeling errors. A special case of our framework is that of recovering multiple measurement vectors (MMV) that share a joint sparsity pattern. Adapting our results to this context leads to new MMV recovery methods as well as equivalence conditions under which the entire set can be determined efficiently.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2009.2030471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290295","Block restricted isometry property;block sparsity;compressed sensing;mixed-norm recovery;multiple measurement vectors (MMV);union of linear subspaces","Robustness;Signal processing algorithms;Compressed sensing;Signal processing;Sampling methods;Vectors;Signal sampling;Stability;History;Frequency","","719","9","48","IEEE","20 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite its popularity, these nonlinear SVMs have a complexity O(n2 ∼ n3) in training and O(n) in testing, where n is the training size, implying that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handlemore than thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension of the SPM method, by generalizing vector quantization to sparse coding followed by multi-scale spatial max pooling, and propose a linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse codes. This new approach remarkably reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training and a constant in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments, we find that, in terms of classification accuracy, the suggested linear SPM based on sparse coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms the linear SPM kernel on histograms, and is even better than the nonlinear SPM kernels, leading to state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks by using a single type of descriptors.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206757","","Image coding;Image classification;Scanning probe microscopy;Kernel;Histograms;Testing;Image representation;Vector quantization;Image segmentation;Computational complexity","","698","7","28","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this framework, contrast enhancement is posed as an optimization problem that minimizes a cost function. Histogram equalization is an effective technique for contrast enhancement. However, a conventional histogram equalization (HE) usually results in excessive contrast enhancement, which in turn gives the processed image an unnatural look and creates visual artifacts. By introducing specifically designed penalty terms, the level of contrast enhancement can be adjusted; noise robustness, white/black stretching and mean-brightness preservation may easily be incorporated into the optimization. Analytic solutions for some of the important criteria are presented. Finally, a low-complexity algorithm for contrast enhancement is presented, and its performance is demonstrated against a recently proposed method.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2009.2021548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4895264","Histogram equalization;histogram modification;image/video quality enhancement","Histograms;Dynamic range;Pixel;Cost function;White noise;Noise level;Noise robustness;Design optimization;Digital photography","","687","10","30","IEEE","28 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The allocation of spectrum resources and the avoidance of electromagnetic interference are some of the more urgent challenges that operators face before femtocells become widely deployed. In this article a coverage and interference analysis based on a realistic OFDMA macro/femtocell scenario is provided, as well as some guidelines on how the spectrum allocation and interference mitigation problems can be approached in these networks.

We incorporate different ldquorebalancerdquo heuristics in SVM modeling, including cost-sensitive learning, and over- and undersampling. These SVM-based strategies are compared with various state-of-the-art approaches on a variety of data sets by using various metrics, including G-mean, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, F-measure, and area under the precision/recall curve. We show that we are able to surpass or match the previously known best algorithms on each data set. In particular, of the four SVM variations considered in this paper, the novel granular SVMs-repetitive undersampling algorithm (GSVM-RU) is the best in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. GSVM-RU is effective, as it can minimize the negative effect of information loss while maximizing the positive effect of data cleaning in the undersampling process. GSVM-RU is efficient by extracting much less support vectors and, hence, greatly speeding up SVM prediction.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2002909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4695979","Computational intelligence;cost-sensitive learning;granular computing;highly imbalanced classification;oversampling;support vector machines (SVMs);undersampling;Computational intelligence;cost-sensitive learning;granular computing;highly imbalanced classification;oversampling;support vector machines (SVMs);undersampling","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Sampling methods;Data mining;Machine learning;Computer science;Classification algorithms;Cleaning;Learning systems;Bioinformatics","Algorithms;Area Under Curve;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;ROC Curve","680","","31","IEEE","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our system has three components: 1) given a face photo, synthesizing a sketch drawing; 2) given a face sketch drawing, synthesizing a photo; and 3) searching for face photos in the database based on a query sketch drawn by an artist. It has useful applications for both digital entertainment and law enforcement. We assume that faces to be studied are in a frontal pose, with normal lighting and neutral expression, and have no occlusions. To synthesize sketch/photo images, the face region is divided into overlapping patches for learning. The size of the patches decides the scale of local face structures to be learned. From a training set which contains photo-sketch pairs, the joint photo-sketch model is learned at multiple scales using a multiscale MRF model. By transforming a face photo to a sketch (or transforming a sketch to a photo), the difference between photos and sketches is significantly reduced, thus allowing effective matching between the two in face sketch recognition. After the photo-sketch transformation, in principle, most of the proposed face photo recognition approaches can be applied to face sketch recognition in a straightforward way.

We analyze the behavior of l1-constrained quadratic programming (QP), also referred to as the Lasso, for recovering the sparsity pattern. Our main result is to establish precise conditions on the problem dimension p, the number k of nonzero elements in beta*, and the number of observations n that are necessary and sufficient for sparsity pattern recovery using the Lasso. We first analyze the case of observations made using deterministic design matrices and sub-Gaussian additive noise, and provide sufficient conditions for support recovery and linfin-error bounds, as well as results showing the necessity of incoherence and bounds on the minimum value. We then turn to the case of random designs, in which each row of the design is drawn from a N (0, Sigma) ensemble. For a broad class of Gaussian ensembles satisfying mutual incoherence conditions, we compute explicit values of thresholds 0 < thetasl(Sigma) les thetasu(Sigma) < +infin with the following properties: for any delta > 0, if n > 2 (thetasu + delta) klog (p- k), then the Lasso succeeds in recovering the sparsity pattern with probability converging to one for large problems, whereas for n < 2 (thetasl - delta)klog (p - k), then the probability of successful recovery converges to zero. For the special case of the uniform Gaussian ensemble (Sigma = Iptimesp), we show that thetasl = thetas<u = 1, so that the precise threshold n = 2 klog(p- k) is exactly determined.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2009.2016018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4839045","Compressed sensing;convex relaxation;high-dimensional inference;$\ell _{1}$-constraints;model selection;phase transitions;sparse approximation;signal denoising;subset selection","Quadratic programming;Signal denoising;Compressed sensing;Statistics;Graphical models;Polynomials;Context modeling;Pattern analysis;Additive noise;Sufficient conditions","","659","2","37","IEEE","21 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A novel model predictive control scheme is proposed that keeps the motor torque, the stator flux, and (if present) the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while minimizing the switching frequency of the inverter. Based on an internal model of the drive, the controller predicts several future switch transitions, extrapolates the output trajectories, and chooses the sequence of inverter switch positions (voltage vectors) that minimizes the switching frequency. The advantages of the proposed controller are twofold. First, as underlined by the experimental results in the second part of this paper, it yields a superior performance with respect to the industrial state of the art. Specifically, the switching frequency is reduced by up to 50% while the torque and flux are kept more accurately within their bounds. Moreover, the fast dynamic torque response is inherited from standard DTC.

We postulate two criteria (1) It should be easy to find a poselet given an input image (2) it should be easy to localize the 3D configuration of the person conditioned on the detection of a poselet. To permit this we have built a new dataset, H3D, of annotations of humans in 2D photographs with 3D joint information, inferred using anthropometric constraints. This enables us to implement a data-driven search procedure for finding poselets that are tightly clustered in both 3D joint configuration space as well as 2D image appearance. The algorithm discovers poselets that correspond to frontal and profile faces, pedestrians, head and shoulder views, among others. Each poselet provides examples for training a linear SVM classifier which can then be run over the image in a multiscale scanning mode. The outputs of these poselet detectors can be thought of as an intermediate layer of nodes, on top of which one can run a second layer of classification or regression. We show how this permits detection and localization of torsos or keypoints such as left shoulder, nose, etc. Experimental results show that we obtain state of the art performance on people detection in the PASCAL VOC 2007 challenge, among other datasets.

This paper presents a new approach for image denoising in the case of a known uncorrelated noise model. The proposed filter is an extension of the nonlocal means (NL means) algorithm introduced by Buades, which performs a weighted average of the values of similar pixels. Pixel similarity is defined in NL means as the Euclidean distance between patches (rectangular windows centered on each two pixels). In this paper, a more general and statistically grounded similarity criterion is proposed which depends on the noise distribution model. The denoising process is expressed as a weighted maximum likelihood estimation problem where the weights are derived in a data-driven way. These weights can be iteratively refined based on both the similarity between noisy patches and the similarity of patches extracted from the previous estimate. We show that this iterative process noticeably improves the denoising performance, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratio images such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Numerical experiments illustrate that the technique can be successfully applied to the classical case of additive Gaussian noise but also to cases such as multiplicative speckle noise. The proposed denoising technique seems to improve on the state of the art performance in that latter case.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2009.2029593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196737","Image denoising;nonlocal means (NL means);patch-based methods;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);weighted maximum likelihood estimation (WMLE)","Noise reduction;Maximum likelihood estimation;Image denoising;Additive noise;Gaussian noise;Image processing;Filters;Euclidean distance;Signal to noise ratio;Synthetic aperture radar","","650","2","54","IEEE","7 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most direct strategy to regulate such currents is to use a simple closed loop proportional-integral (PI) regulator, which has no theoretical stability limits as the proportional and integral gains are increased, since it is only a second order system. However, pulsewidth modulation (PWM) transport and controller sampling delays limit the gain values that can be achieved in practical systems. Taking these limitations into account, this paper presents an analytical method to determine the best possible gains that can be achieved for any class of practical linear AC current controller. The analysis shows that the maximum possible proportional gain is determined by the plant series inductance, the DC bus voltage and the transport and sampling delays, while the maximum possible integral gain is determined primarily by the transport and sampling delays. The work is applicable to stationary frame PI regulators, stationary frame controllers with back electromotive force compensation, stationary frame P+ resonant (PR) controllers, and synchronous d- q frame controllers, since they all have identical proportional and integral gains that must be optimized for any particular application.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2009.2029548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5338054","Back electromotive force (EMF) compensation;current regulation;feed forward;P$+$resonant (PR);proportional integral (PI);stationary frame;synchronous $d$–$q$ frame","Design optimization;Regulators;Pulse width modulation;Sampling methods;Delay;Force control;Pi control;Proportional control;Current control;Power electronics","","645","","16","IEEE","17 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed approach is based on the universal model of an auto-oscillator with negative damping and nonlinear frequency shift. It is demonstrated that this universal model, when applied to the case of a spin-torque oscillator (STO) based on a current-driven magnetic nano-pillar or nano-contact, gives adequate description of most of the experimentally observed properties of STO. In particular, the model describes the power and frequency of the generated microwave signal as functions of the bias current and magnetic field, predicts the magnitude and properties of the generation linewidth, and explains the STO behavior under the influence of periodic and stochastic external signals: frequency modulation, phase-locking to external signals, mutual phase-locking in an array of STO, broadening of the generation linewidth near the generation threshold, etc. The proposed nonlinear auto-oscillator theory is rather general and can be used not only for the development of practical nano-sized STO, but, also, for the description of nonlinear auto-oscillating systems of any physical nature.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2008.2009935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4802339","Auto-oscillator;phase locking;spin-transfer torque;spin wave;thermal noise","Microwave generation;Power generation;Signal generators;Magnetic analysis;Frequency;Magnetic properties;Phased arrays;Damping;Microwave oscillators;Predictive models","","645","7","150","IEEE","16 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

LCL filters require resonance damping. Active resonance damping is state of the art to face the problem, but it is still under investigation because of the manifold solutions. It is often realized using many sensors and/or complex control algorithms. In contrast, pure PI control requires only one set of current sensors, and its implementation and design are rather simple and well known from the L filter control. PI control has already been shown to be a suitable solution also for LCL filters, but there are limitations. These are investigated in this paper. System stability is analyzed with respect to different ratios of LCL filter resonance and control frequencies. The latter are important parameters for system design and control. Both line and converter current control are analyzed. For a certain range of frequency ratios, the voltage-oriented PI control gives stable performance without additional feedback, but for ratios outside this range, stable operation is impossible. Experimental tests validate the theoretical results. In addition, an experimentally determined LCL filter transfer function is shown in this paper, which shows a lower resonance peak as expected from commonly used filter models.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.2008774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4667634","Active damping (AD);grid-connected pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) rectifier;$LCL$ filter;PI current control","Pulse width modulation;Current control;Rectifiers;Filters;Pi control;Resonance;Damping;Control systems;Space vector pulse width modulation;Stability analysis","","635","9","31","IEEE","7 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dominant local binary pattern method makes use of the most frequently occurred patterns to capture descriptive textural information, while the Gabor-based features aim at supplying additional global textural information to the DLBP features. Through experiments, the proposed approach has been intensively evaluated by applying a large number of classification tests to histogram-equalized, randomly rotated and noise corrupted images in Outex, Brodatz, Meastex, and CUReT texture image databases.

Our approach assumes an existing multi-coset sampling. To date, recovery methods for this sampling strategy ensure perfect reconstruction either when the band locations are known, or under strict restrictions on the possible spectral supports. In this paper, only the number of bands and their widths are assumed without any other limitations on the support. We describe how to choose the parameters of the multi-coset sampling so that a unique multiband signal matches the given samples. To recover the signal, the continuous reconstruction is replaced by a single finite-dimensional problem without the need for discretization. The resulting problem is studied within the framework of compressed sensing, and thus can be solved efficiently using known tractable algorithms from this emerging area. We also develop a theoretical lower bound on the average sampling rate required for blind signal reconstruction, which is twice the minimal rate of known-spectrum recovery. Our method ensures perfect reconstruction for a wide class of signals sampled at the minimal rate, and provides a first systematic study of compressed sensing in a truly analog setting. Numerical experiments are presented demonstrating blind sampling and reconstruction with minimal sampling rate.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2012791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4749297","Landau–Nyquist rate;multiband;multiple measurement vectors (MMV);nonuniform periodic sampling;sparsity","Signal reconstruction;Compressed sensing;Sampling methods;Signal sampling;Signal processing;Frequency;Signal processing algorithms;Digital signal processing;Terrorism","","629","13","33","IEEE","13 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique both optimizes higher-order dynamics and is able to converge over a wider range of input paths relative to previous path optimization strategies. In particular, we relax the collision-free feasibility prerequisite on input paths required by those strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries.

We propose a system of fingerprint extraction and random numbers in SRAM (FERNS) that harvests static identity and randomness from existing volatile CMOS memory without requiring any dedicated circuitry. The identity results from manufacture-time physically random device threshold voltage mismatch, and the random numbers result from runtime physically random noise. We use experimental data from high-performance SRAM chips and the embedded SRAM of the WISP UHF RFID tag to validate the principles behind FERNS. For the SRAM chip, we demonstrate that 8-byte fingerprints can uniquely identify circuits among a population of 5,120 instances and extrapolate that 24-byte fingerprints would uniquely identify all instances ever produced. Using a smaller population, we demonstrate similar identifying ability from the embedded SRAM. In addition to identification, we show that SRAM fingerprints capture noise, enabling true random number generation. We demonstrate that a 512-byte SRAM fingerprint contains sufficient entropy to generate 128-bit true random numbers and that the generated numbers pass the NIST tests for runs, approximate entropy, and block frequency.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2008.212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674345","SRAM;chip ID;TRNG;RFID.;Hardware;SRAM;Memory design;Memory used as logic;Memory technologies;VLSI;Support for security;Ubiquitous computing","Fingerprint recognition;Random access memory;Noise;Object recognition;Random number generation;SRAM chips;Hamming distance","","602","46","48","IEEE","17 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To quantify near-far effects with universal frequency reuse, this paper derives a fundamental relation providing the largest feasible cellular Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), given any set of feasible femtocell SINRs. We provide a link budget analysis which enables simple and accurate performance insights in a two-tier network. A distributed utility- based SINR adaptation at femtocells is proposed in order to alleviate cross-tier interference at the macrocell from cochannel femtocells. The Foschini-Miljanic (FM) algorithm is a special case of the adaptation. Each femtocell maximizes their individual utility consisting of a SINR based reward less an incurred cost (interference to the macrocell). Numerical results show greater than 30% improvement in mean femtocell SINRs relative to FM. In the event that cross-tier interference prevents a cellular user from obtaining its SINR target, an algorithm is proposed that reduces transmission powers of the strongest femtocell interferers. The algorithm ensures that a cellular user achieves its SINR target even with 100 femtocells/cell-site (with typical cellular parameters) and requires a worst case SINR reduction of only 16% at femtocells.

In this paper, we demonstrate the suitability of the time-frequency ( t-f) analysis to classify EEG segments for epileptic seizures, and we compare several methods for t- f analysis of EEGs. Short-time Fourier transform and several t-f distributions are used to calculate the power spectrum density (PSD) of each segment. The analysis is performed in three stages: 1) t-f analysis and calculation of the PSD of each EEG segment; 2) feature extraction, measuring the signal segment fractional energy on specific t-f windows; and 3) classification of the EEG segment (existence of epileptic seizure or not), using artificial neural networks.

The proposed BF protocol targets to minimize the BF set-up time and to mitigate the high path loss of 60 GHz WPAN systems. It consists of 3 stages, namely the device (DEV) to DEV linking, sector-level searching and beam-level searching. The division of the stages facilitates significant reduction in setup time as compared to BF protocols with exhaustive searching mechanisms. The proposed BF protocol employs discrete phase-shifters, which significantly simplifies the structure of DEVs as compared to the conventional BF with phase-and-amplitude adjustment, at the expense of a gain degradation of less than 1 dB. The proposed BF protocol is a complete design and PHY-independent, it is applicable to different antenna configurations. Simulation results show that the setup time of the proposed BF protocol is as small as 2% when compared to the exhaustive searching protocol. Furthermore, based on the codebooks with four phases per element, around 15.1 dB gain is achieved by using eight antenna elements at both transmitter and receiver, thereby enabling 1.6 Gbps-data-streaming over a range of three meters. Due to the flexibility in supporting multiple PHY layer designs, the proposed protocol has been adopted by the IEEE 802.15.3c as an optional functionality to realize Gbps communication systems.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2009.091009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5262295","beam codebook, beamforming, MAC, protocol, 60 GHz, millimeter-wave, multi-Gbps, WPAN ","Array signal processing;Media Access Protocol;Physical layer;Access protocols;Millimeter wave communication;Wireless personal area networks;Wireless application protocol;Joining processes;Degradation;Gain","","594","19","22","IEEE","29 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We assume an attacker wishes to disrupt the operation of a control system in steady state. In order to inject an exogenous control input without being detected the attacker will hijack the sensors, observe and record their readings for a certain amount of time and repeat them afterwards while carrying out his attack. This is a very common and natural attack (we have seen numerous times intruders recording and replaying security videos while performing their attack undisturbed) for an attacker who does not know the dynamics of the system but is aware of the fact that the system itself is expected to be in steady state for the duration of the attack. We assume the control system to be a discrete time linear time invariant gaussian system applying an infinite horizon Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller. We also assume that the system is equipped with a ¿2 failure detector. The main contributions of the paper, beyond the novelty of the problem formulation, consist in 1. providing conditions on the feasibility of the replay attack on the aforementioned system and 2. proposing a countermeasure that guarantees a desired probability of detection (with a fixed false alarm rate) by trading off either detection delay or LQG performance, either by decreasing control accuracy or increasing control effort.","","978-1-4244-5871-4","10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394956","","Control systems;Computer crime;Communication system control;Robust control;Steady-state;Detectors;National security;Detection algorithms;Video recording;Aerodynamics","","594","","11","IEEE","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, different fault-detection and grounding methods are discussed. The influence of the selected protection devices and grounding method on an LV DC microgrid is studied through simulations.

The framework is mainly based on the producer-scrounger model, which assumes that group members search either for “finding” (producer) or for “joining” (scrounger) opportunities. Based on this framework, concepts from animal searching behavior, e.g., animal scanning mechanisms, are employed metaphorically to design optimum searching strategies for solving continuous optimization problems. When tested against benchmark functions, in low and high dimensions, the GSO algorithm has competitive performance to other EAs in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, especially on high-dimensional multimodal problems.

Among the several wind generation technologies, variable speed wind turbines utilizing doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are gaining momentum in the power industry. With the increase in penetration of these wind turbines, the power system dominated by synchronous machines will experience a change in dynamics and operational characteristics. Given this assertion, the present paper develops an approach to analyze the impact of increased penetration of DFIG-based wind turbines on transient and small signal stability of a large power system. The primary basis of the method is to convert the DFIG machines into equivalent conventional round rotor synchronous machines and then evaluate the sensitivity of the eigenvalues with respect to inertia. In this regard, modes that are both detrimentally and beneficially affected by the change in inertia are identified. These modes are then excited by appropriate disturbances and the impact of reduced inertia on transient stability performance is also examined. The proposed technique is tested on a large test system representing the Midwestern portion of the U.S. interconnection. The results obtained indicate that the proposed method effectively identifies both detrimental and beneficial impacts of increased DFIG penetration both for transient stability and small signal stability related performance.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2021234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4912364","Doubly fed induction generator;inertia;sensitivity;small signal stability;transient stability;wind turbine generators","Power system transients;Power system stability;Wind turbines;Power generation;Signal generators;Wind energy generation;Power system dynamics;Induction generators;Wind energy;Wind power generation","","578","2","17","IEEE","8 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, previous research focused on designing heuristic-based algorithms which had clear separation between the node mapping and the link mapping phases. This paper proposes VN embedding algorithms with better coordination between the two phases. We formulate the VN embedding problem as a mixed integer program through substrate network augmentation. We then relax the integer constraints to obtain a linear program, and devise two VN embedding algorithms D-ViNE and R-ViNE using deterministic and randomized rounding techniques, respectively.

In this paper, the effects of stochastic wind and load on the unit commitment and dispatch of power systems with high levels of wind power are examined. By comparing the costs, planned operation and performance of the schedules produced, it is shown that stochastic optimization results in less costly, of the order of 0.25%, and better performing schedules than deterministic optimization. The impact of planning the system more frequently to account for updated wind and load forecasts is then examined. More frequent planning means more up to date forecasts are used, which reduces the need for reserve and increases performance of the schedules. It is shown that mid-merit and peaking units and the interconnection are the most affected parts of the system where uncertainty of wind is concerned.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2016470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4806110","Power generation dispatch;power system economics;stochastic systems;wind power generation","Stochastic processes;Wind energy;Wind forecasting;Power system planning;Stochastic systems;Uncertainty;Robustness;Load forecasting;Power generation;Wind energy generation","","575","5","25","IEEE","27 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a novel wideband spectrum sensing technique referred to as multiband joint detection is introduced, which jointly detects the primary signals over multiple frequency bands rather than over one band at a time. Specifically, the spectrum sensing problem is formulated as a class of optimization problems, which maximize the aggregated opportunistic throughput of a cognitive radio system under some constraints on the interference to the primary users. By exploiting the hidden convexity in the seemingly nonconvex problems, optimal solutions can be obtained for multiband joint detection under practical conditions. The situation in which individual cognitive radios might not be able to reliably detect weak primary signals due to channel fading/shadowing is also considered. To address this issue by exploiting the spatial diversity, a cooperative wideband spectrum sensing scheme refereed to as spatial-spectral joint detection is proposed, which is based on a linear combination of the local statistics from multiple spatially distributed cognitive radios. The cooperative sensing problem is also mapped into an optimization problem, for which suboptimal solutions can be obtained through mathematical transformation under conditions of practical interest. Simulation results show that the proposed spectrum sensing schemes can considerably improve system performance. This paper establishes useful principles for the design of distributed wideband spectrum sensing algorithms in cognitive radio networks.

To reduce the complexity, several SNR-suboptimal multiple relay selection schemes are proposed, whose complexity is linear in the number of relays. They are proved to achieve full diversity.

The ESO can estimate both the states and the disturbances simultaneously so that the composite speed controller can have a corresponding part to compensate for the disturbances. Then, considering the case of variations of load inertia, an adaptive control scheme is developed by analyzing the control performance relationship between the feedforward compensation gain and the system inertia. By using inertia identification techniques, a fuzzy-inferencer-based supervisor is designed to automatically tune the feedforward compensation gain according to the identified inertia.

We use a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF reconstructed from q-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT provides new insight into the relationship between the HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical spherical deconvolution and improves the angular resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of this paper is the development of new deterministic and new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the full multidirectional information obtained through use of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is performed on human brain datasets comparing our new deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an application of our new probabilistic tracking, we quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects.

Consensus with noise in the network links leads to the bias-variance dilemma-running consensus for long reduces the bias of the final average estimate but increases its variance. We present two different compromises to this tradeoff: the A-ND algorithm modifies conventional consensus by forcing the weights to satisfy a persistence condition (slowly decaying to zero;) and the A-NC algorithm where the weights are constant but consensus is run for a fixed number of iterations [^(iota)], then it is restarted and rerun for a total of [^(p)] runs, and at the end averages the final states of the [^(p)] runs (Monte Carlo averaging). We use controlled Markov processes and stochastic approximation arguments to prove almost sure convergence of A-ND to a finite consensus limit and compute explicitly the mean square error (mse) (variance) of the consensus limit. We show that A-ND represents the best of both worlds-zero bias and low variance-at the cost of a slow convergence rate; rescaling the weights balances the variance versus the rate of bias reduction (convergence rate). In contrast, A-NC, because of its constant weights, converges fast but presents a different bias-variance tradeoff. For the same number of iterations [^(iota)][^(p)] , shorter runs (smaller [^(iota)] ) lead to high bias but smaller variance (larger number [^(p)] of runs to average over.) For a static nonrandom network with Gaussian noise, we compute the optimal gain for A-NC to reach in the shortest number of iterations [^(iota)][^(p)] , with high probability (1-delta), (epsiv, delta)-consensus (epsiv residual bias).

In addition, our framework explicitly captures sensor specifications that depend on the environment with which the robot is interacting, which results in a novel paradigm for sensor-based temporal-logic-motion planning. As one robot is part of the environment of another robot, our sensor-based framework very naturally captures multirobot specifications in a decentralized manner.

Similar to dc distributed power systems, an ac DPS relies on power electronics and control to realize its functions and achieve the required performance. System stability and power quality are important issues in both types of systems due to the complex system behavior resulted from active control at both the source and the load side. Traditional small-signal analysis methods cannot be directly applied to an ac DPS because of the periodically time-varying system operation trajectory. Possible solutions to this problem include transformation into a rotating (dq) reference frame, modeling using dynamic phasors, reduced-order modeling, and harmonic linearization. This paper reviews these small-signal methods and discusses their utilities as well as limitations. Compatibility of each type of models with state-space and impedance-based system analysis approaches will also be discussed.

This approach referred to as error minimized extreme learning machine (EM-ELM) can add random hidden nodes to SLFNs one by one or group by group (with varying group size). During the growth of the networks, the output weights are updated incrementally. The convergence of this approach is proved in this brief as well. Simulation results demonstrate and verify that our new approach is much faster than other sequential/incremental/growing algorithms with good generalization performance.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2009.2024147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5161346","Echo state network (ESN);extreme learning machine (ELM);feedforward neural networks (FNNs);growing algorithm;incremental learning;minimizing error;sequential learning","Machine learning;Recurrent neural networks;Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Iterative methods;Convergence;Iterative algorithms;Backpropagation algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Neurons","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Classification;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Learning;Neural Networks (Computer);Neurons;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Regression Analysis;Synaptic Transmission;Time Factors","550","1","25","IEEE","10 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On-chip communication was frequently ignored. This was because of fast, single-cycle on-chip communication. The interconnect power was also insignificant compared to the transistor power. With uniprocessor designs providing diminishing returns and the advent of chip multiprocessors (CMPs) in mainstream systems, the on-chip network that connects different processing cores has become a critical part of the design. Transistor miniaturization has led to high global wire delay, and interconnect power comparable to transistor power. CMP design proposals can no longer ignore the interaction between the memory hierarchy and the interconnection network that connects various elements. This necessitates a detailed and accurate interconnection network model within a full-system evaluation framework. Ignoring the interconnect details might lead to inaccurate results when simulating a CMP architecture. It also becomes important to analyze the impact of interconnection network optimization techniques on full system behavior. In this light, we developed a detailed cycle-accurate interconnection network model (GARNET), inside the GEMS full-system simulation framework. GARNET models a classic five-stage pipelined router with virtual channel (VC) flow control. Microarchitectural details, such as flit-level input buffers, routing logic, allocators and the crossbar switch, are modeled. GARNET, along with GEMS, provides a detailed and accurate memory system timing model. To demonstrate the importance and potential impact of GARNET, we evaluate a shared and private L2 CMP with a realistic state-of-the-art interconnection network against the original GEMS simple network. The objective of the evaluation was to figure out which configuration is better for a particular workload. We show that not modeling the interconnect in detail might lead to an incorrect outcome. We also evaluate Express Virtual Channels (EVCs), an on-chip network flow control proposal, in a full-system fashion. We show that in improving on-chip network latency-throughput, EVCs do lead to better overall system runtime, however, the impact varies widely across applications.","","978-1-4244-4184-6","10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4919636","","Garnets;Network-on-a-chip;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Power system interconnection;System-on-a-chip;Proposals;Switches;Computational modeling;Microprocessors;Wire","","549","1","31","IEEE","12 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate how color names learned from color chips compare to color names learned from real-world images. To avoid hand labeling real-world images with color names, we use Google image to collect a data set. Due to the limitations of Google image, this data set contains a substantial quantity of wrongly labeled data. We propose several variants of the PLSA model to learn color names from this noisy data.

We also consider filters like LoG, mean, and bilateral background subtraction (BilSub) and nonparametric measures like Rank, SoftRank, Census, and Ordinal. Finally, hierarchical mutual information (HMI) is considered as pixelwise cost. Using stereo data sets with ground-truth disparities taken under controlled changes of exposure and lighting, we evaluate the costs with a local, a semiglobal, and a global stereo method. We measure the performance of all costs in the presence of simulated and real radiometric differences, including exposure differences, vignetting, varying lighting, and noise. Overall, the ranking of methods across all data sets and experiments appears to be consistent. Among the best costs are BilSub, which performs consistently very well for low radiometric differences; HMI, which is slightly better as pixelwise matching cost in some cases and for strong image noise; and Census, which showed the best and most robust overall performance.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620119","Stereo;matching cost;performance evaluation;radiometric differences.;Stereo;Performance evaluation of algorithms and systems;Radiometry;Intensity;color;photometry;and thresholding","Costs;Radiometry;Mutual information;Lighting control;Pixel;Noise robustness;Light sources;Layout;Band pass filters;Laplace equations","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photogrammetry;Radiometry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","540","15","54","IEEE","5 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the proportion of power produced by wind farms increases, it becomes more difficult to predict accurately the total amount of power injected by all generators into the power system. This added uncertainty must be taken into account when setting the requirement for SR. This paper proposes a technique to calculate the optimal amount of SR that the system operator should provide to be able to respond not only to generation outages but also to errors in the forecasts for load and wind power production. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed technique for setting the SR requirements is then compared with the traditional deterministic criterion (i.e., the capacity of the largest online infeed), an approach to cope with wind imbalances and an approach that combines the traditional criterion with the approach to cope with wind imbalances. The results show that, contrary to what is commonly believed, an increased wind power penetration does not necessarily require larger amounts of SR.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2004745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4682642","Expected energy not served;mixed integer programming;Monte Carlo methods;power generation dispatch;power generation scheduling;spinning reserve;value of lost load;wind power generation","Spinning;Wind power generation;Strontium;Wind energy generation;Load forecasting;Production systems;Power generation;Wind energy;Wind farms;Power systems","","538","4","31","IEEE","18 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, six properties are discussed: (Robin Hood, Scaling, Rising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates, and Babies), each of which a sparsity measure should have. The main contributions of this paper are the proofs and the associated summary table which classify commonly-used sparsity measures based on whether or not they satisfy these six propositions.

This paper presents an approach to predict regional PV power output based on forecasts up to three days ahead provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Focus of the paper is the description and evaluation of the approach of irradiance forecasting, which is the basis for PV power prediction. One day-ahead irradiance forecasts for single stations in Germany show a rRMSE of 36%. For regional forecasts, forecast accuracy is increasing in dependency on the size of the region. For the complete area of Germany, the rRMSE amounts to 13%. Besides the forecast accuracy, also the specification of the forecast uncertainty is an important issue for an effective application. We present and evaluate an approach to derive weather specific prediction intervals for irradiance forecasts. The accuracy of PV power prediction is investigated in a case study.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2020300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4897348","Forecasting;photovoltaic power systems;power generation meteorological factors;solar radiation","Weather forecasting;Predictive models;Forecasting;Clouds;Atmospheric modeling;Interpolation","","535","11","27","IEEE","28 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To learn normal patterns of activity at each local node, we capture the distribution of its typical optical flow with a Mixture of Probabilistic Principal Component Analyzers. For any new optical flow patterns detected in incoming video clips, we use the learned model and MRF graph to compute a maximum a posteriori estimate of the degree of normality at each local node. Further, we show how to incrementally update the current model parameters as new video observations stream in, so that the model can efficiently adapt to visual context changes over a long period of time. Experimental results on surveillance videos show that our space-time MRF model robustly detects abnormal activities both in a local and global sense: not only does it accurately localize the atomic abnormal activities in a crowded video, but at the same time it captures the global-level abnormalities caused by irregular interactions between local activities.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206569","","Optical sensors;Image motion analysis;Context modeling;Markov random fields;Optical devices;Pattern analysis;Optical detectors;Optical computing;Maximum a posteriori estimation;Streaming media","","531","3","19","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is demonstrated that materials can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods (starting from as small as 3times3 pixels square) and that this can outperform classification using filter banks with large support. It is also shown that the performance of filter banks is inferior to that of image patches with equivalent neighborhoods. We develop novel texton-based representations which are suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution for Markov random fields. The representations are learned from training images and then used to classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. Three such representations are proposed and their performance is assessed and compared to that of filter banks. The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying 2,806 images of all 61 materials present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank-based classifiers such as Leung and Malik (IJCV 01), Cula and Dana (IJCV 04), and Varma and Zisserman (IJCV 05). We also benchmark performance by classifying all of the textures present in the UIUC, Microsoft Textile, and San Francisco outdoor data sets.

We show that the right selection of components for both appearance and spatial modeling is crucial for general applicability and overall performance of the model. The appearance of body parts is modeled using densely sampled shape context descriptors and discriminatively trained AdaBoost classifiers. Furthermore, we interpret the normalized margin of each classifier as likelihood in a generative model. Non-Gaussian relationships between parts are represented as Gaussians in the coordinate system of the joint between parts. The marginal posterior of each part is inferred using belief propagation.

This is difficult due to variations in scale, pose, lighting, background, expression, hairstyle, and glasses. In this paper we present two methods for learning robust distance measures: (a) a logistic discriminant approach which learns the metric from a set of labelled image pairs (LDML) and (b) a nearest neighbour approach which computes the probability for two images to belong to the same class (MkNN). We evaluate our approaches on the Labeled Faces in the Wild data set, a large and very challenging data set of faces from Yahoo! News. The evaluation protocol for this data set defines a restricted setting, where a fixed set of positive and negative image pairs is given, as well as an unrestricted one, where faces are labelled by their identity. We are the first to present results for the unrestricted setting, and show that our methods benefit from this richer training data, much more so than the current state-of-the-art method.

To address the challenges and deficiencies in the current state of the art, we propose a modular, extensible cloud architecture with intrinsic support for business service management and the federation of clouds. The goal is to facilitate an open, service-based online economy in which resources and services are transparently provisioned and managed across clouds on an on-demand basis at competitive costs with high-quality service. The Reservoir project is motivated by the vision of implementing an architecture that would enable providers of cloud infrastructure to dynamically partner with each other to create a seemingly infinite pool of IT resources while fully preserving their individual autonomy in making technological and business management decisions. To this end, Reservoir could leverage and extend the advantages of virtualization and embed autonomous management in the infrastructure. At the same time, the Reservoir approach aims to achieve a very ambitious goal: creating a foundation for next-generation enterprise-grade cloud computing.","0018-8646","","10.1147/JRD.2009.5429058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5429058","","","","517","27","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

We then investigate four applications of the proposed model: 1) interference in cognitive radio networks; 2) interference in wireless packet networks; 3) spectrum of the aggregate radio-frequency emission of wireless networks; and 4) coexistence between ultrawideband and narrowband systems.

In this paper, we consider the latter case, known as spectrum sharing, and study the optimal power allocation strategies to achieve the ergodic capacity and the outage capacity of the SU fading channel under different types of power constraints and fading channel models. In particular, besides the interference power constraint at PU, the transmit power constraint of SU is also considered. Since the transmit power and the interference power can be limited either by a peak or an average constraint, various combinations of power constraints are studied. It is shown that there is a capacity gain for SU under the average over the peak transmit/interference power constraint. It is also shown that fading for the channel between SU transmitter and PU receiver is usually a beneficial factor for enhancing the SU channel capacities.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.071448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4786456","Cognitive radio;power control;ergodic capacity;outage capacity;delay-limited capacity;spectrum sharing;interference power constraint;fading channel","Fading;Cognitive radio;Interference constraints;Communication networks;Channel capacity;AWGN;Personal communication networks;FCC;Quality of service;Radio spectrum management","","515","","21","IEEE","20 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While this is a necessity in order to generalize beyond a given set of training images, it is also a very difficult problem due to the high variability of visual appearance within each class. In the last years substantial performance gains on challenging benchmark datasets have been reported in the literature. This progress can be attributed to two developments: the design of highly discriminative and robust image features and the combination of multiple complementary features based on different aspects such as shape, color or texture. In this paper we study several models that aim at learning the correct weighting of different features from training data. These include multiple kernel learning as well as simple baseline methods. Furthermore we derive ensemble methods inspired by Boosting which are easily extendable to several multiclass setting. All methods are thoroughly evaluated on object classification datasets using a multitude of feature descriptors. The key results are that even very simple baseline methods, that are orders of magnitude faster than learning techniques are highly competitive with multiple kernel learning. Furthermore the Boosting type methods are found to produce consistently better results in all experiments. We provide insight of when combination methods can be expected to work and how the benefit of complementary features can be exploited most efficiently.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459169","","Kernel;Computer vision;Robustness;Shape;Training data;Boosting;Cybernetics;Performance gain;Object recognition;Image classification","","514","4","22","IEEE","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We describe how IS-NMF is underlaid by a well-defined statistical model of superimposed gaussian components and is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of variance parameters. This setting can accommodate regularization constraints on the factors through Bayesian priors. In particular, inverse-gamma and gamma Markov chain priors are considered in this work. Estimation can be carried out using a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm; this leads to a novel type of NMF algorithm, whose convergence to a stationary point of the IS cost function is guaranteed. We also discuss the links between the IS divergence and other cost functions used in NMF, in particular, the Euclidean distance and the generalized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As such, we describe how IS-NMF can also be performed using a gradient multiplicative algorithm (a standard algorithm structure in NMF) whose convergence is observed in practice, though not proven. Finally, we report a furnished experimental comparative study of Euclidean-NMF, KL-NMF, and IS-NMF algorithms applied to the power spectrogram of a short piano sequence recorded in real conditions, with various initializations and model orders. Then we show how IS-NMF can successfully be employed for denoising and upmix (mono to stereo conversion) of an original piece of early jazz music. These experiments indicate that IS-NMF correctly captures the semantics of audio and is better suited to the representation of music signals than NMF with the usual Euclidean and KL costs.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco.2008.04-08-771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797100","","","","512","13","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Our features include the distribution of edges, dense and sparse visual words, and feature descriptors at different levels of spatial organization. Such a powerful classifier cannot be tested on all image sub-windows in a reasonable amount of time. Thus we propose a novel three-stage classifier, which combines linear, quasi-linear, and non-linear kernel SVMs. We show that increasing the non-linearity of the kernels increases their discriminative power, at the cost of an increased computational complexity. Our contributions include (i) showing that a linear classifier can be evaluated with a complexity proportional to the number of sub-windows (independent of the sub-window area and descriptor dimension); (ii) a comparison of three efficient methods of proposing candidate regions (including the jumping window classifier of Chum and Zisserman (CVPR 2007) based on proposing windows from scale invariant features); and (Hi) introducing overlap-recall curves as a mean to compare and optimize the performance of the intermediate pipeline stages.

A classification of tracking and data association approaches has been presented, as a pure MMSE approach, which amounts to a soft decision, and single best-hypothesis approach, which amounts to a hard decision. It has been shown that the optimal state estimator in the presence of data association uncertainty consists of the computation of the conditional pdf of the state x(k) given all information available at time k, namely, the prior information about the initial state, the intervening known inputs, and the sets of measurements through time k. It has also been pointed out that if the exact conditional pdf, which is a mixture, is available, then its recursion requires only the probabilities of the most recent association events. The conditions under which this result holds, namely whiteness of the noise, detection, and clutter processes, were presented. The PDAF and JPDAF algorithms, which carry out data association and state estimation in clutter, have been described. A simple example was given to illustrate how the clutter and occasional missed detections can lead to track loss for a standard tracking filter, and how PDAF can keep the target in track under such circumstances. By using the Monte Carlo in a simulated based surveillance as an exampled shown. The numerous applications of the PDAF/JPDAF illustrated in ""Real-World Applications of PDAF and JPDAF"" show the potential pitfalls of using sophisticated algorithms for tracking in difficult environments as well as how to overcome them. The effect of finite sensor resolution can be a more severe problem than the data association and deserves special attention.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2009.934469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5338565","","Radar tracking;Target tracking;Probability;Clutter;State estimation;Statistics;Particle filters;Particle tracking;Radar detection;Sonar","","507","1","32","IEEE","20 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The effects of the approximation error and external disturbances are counteracted by employing the robustness signal. The proposed algorithm is decentralized because the controller for each agent only utilizes the information of its neighbor agents. By the theoretical analysis, it is proved that the consensus error can be reduced as small as desired.

Then, highly integrated 60-GHz radios are overviewed as a basis for the link budget analysis to derive the antenna gain requirement. Next, in order to have deep physical insight into the AoC solution, the silicon substrate's high permittivity and low resistivity effects on the AoC efficiency are examined. It is shown that the AoC solution has low efficiency, less than 12% due to large ohmic losses and surface waves, which requires the development of techniques to improve the AoC efficiency. After that, the AiP solution and associated challenges such as how to realize low-loss interconnection between the chip and antenna are addressed. It is shown that wire-bonding interconnects, although inferior to the flip-chip, are still feasible in the 60-GHz band if proper compensation schemes are utilized. An example of the AiP solution in a low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) process is presented in the 60-GHz band showing an efficiency better than 90%. A major concern with both AoC and AiP solutions is electromagnetic interference (EMI), which is also discussed.

This paper provides an optimization algorithm to manage a VPP composed of a large number of customers with thermostatically controlled appliances. The algorithm, based on a direct load control (DLC), determines the optimal control schedules that an aggregator should apply to the controllable devices of the VPP in order to optimize load reduction over a specified control period.

In this paper we describe a human detection method that augments widely used edge-based features with texture and color information, providing us with a much richer descriptor set. This augmentation results in an extremely high-dimensional feature space (more than 170,000 dimensions). In such high-dimensional spaces, classical machine learning algorithms such as SVMs are nearly intractable with respect to training. Furthermore, the number of training samples is much smaller than the dimensionality of the feature space, by at least an order of magnitude. Finally, the extraction of features from a densely sampled grid structure leads to a high degree of multicollinearity. To circumvent these data characteristics, we employ Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis, an efficient dimensionality reduction technique, one which preserves significant discriminative information, to project the data onto a much lower dimensional subspace (20 dimensions, reduced from the original 170,000). Our human detection system, employing PLS analysis over the enriched descriptor set, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques on three varied datasets including the popular INRIA pedestrian dataset, the low-resolution gray-scale DaimlerChrysler pedestrian dataset, and the ETHZ pedestrian dataset consisting of full-length videos of crowded scenes.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459205","","Humans;Least squares methods;Videos;Image edge detection;Machine learning algorithms;Data mining;Feature extraction;Information analysis;Gray-scale;Layout","","494","4","28","IEEE","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the challenges posed by the study of VANETs is the definition of a vehicular mobility model providing an accurate and realistic vehicular mobility description at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Another challenge is to be able to dynamically alter this vehicular mobility as a consequence of the vehicular communication protocols. Many mobility models have been developed by the community in order to solve these two issues. However, due to the large number of available models claiming to be adapted to vehicular traffic, and also due to their different and somehow incomparable features, understanding their true characteristics, their degree of realism with respect to vehicular mobility, and real capabilities is a hard task. In this survey, we first introduce a framework that proposes a guideline for the generation of vehicular mobility models. Then, we illustrate the different approaches chosen by the community for the development of vehicular mobility models and their interactions with network simulators. Finally, we propose an overview and taxonomy of a large range of mobility models available for vehicular ad hoc networks. The objective is to provide readers with a guideline to easily understand and objectively compare the different models, and eventually identify the one required for their needs.","1553-877X","","10.1109/SURV.2009.090403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5343061","Vehicular Mobility Models, Survey, Taxonomy, Classification, Architecture, Traffic Simulator, Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks, Inter-Vehicle Communications (IVC), Car-2-X Communication, Traffic Telematics","Ad hoc networks;Taxonomy;Telecommunication traffic;Protocols;Traffic control;Telematics;Guidelines;Intelligent transportation systems;Road vehicles;Vehicle safety","","492","","96","IEEE","1 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By applying the principle of analogue network coding (ANC), each of S1 and S2 cancels the so-called ""self-interference"" in the received signal from R and then decodes the desired message. Assuming that S1 and S2 are each equipped with a single antenna and R with multi-antennas, this paper analyzes the capacity region of the ANC-based TWRC with linear processing (beamforming) at R. The capacity region contains all the achievable bidirectional rate-pairs of S1 and S2 under the given transmit power constraints at S1, S2, and R.

Environmental sounds, such as chirpings of insects and sounds of rain which are typically noise-like with a broad flat spectrum, may include strong temporal domain signatures. However, only few temporal-domain features have been developed to characterize such diverse audio signals previously. Here, we perform an empirical feature analysis for audio environment characterization and propose to use the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm to obtain effective time-frequency features. The MP-based method utilizes a dictionary of atoms for feature selection, resulting in a flexible, intuitive and physically interpretable set of features. The MP-based feature is adopted to supplement the MFCC features to yield higher recognition accuracy for environmental sounds. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of these joint features for unstructured environmental sound classification, including listening tests to study human recognition capabilities.

Therefore, it is desirable to extend and hybridize the underlying concepts to deal with additional aspects of data imperfection. Such developments offer a high degree of flexibility and provide robust solutions and advanced tools for data analysis. Fuzzy-rough set-based feature (FS) selection has been shown to be highly useful at reducing data dimensionality but possesses several problems that render it ineffective for large datasets.

Since the statistical covariances of the received signal and noise are usually different, they can be used to differentiate the case where the primary user's signal is present from the case where there is only noise. In this paper, spectrum-sensing algorithms are proposed based on the sample covariance matrix calculated from a limited number of received signal samples. Two test statistics are then extracted from the sample covariance matrix. A decision on the signal presence is made by comparing the two test statistics. Theoretical analysis for the proposed algorithms is given. Detection probability and the associated threshold are found based on the statistical theory. The methods do not need any information about the signal, channel, and noise power a priori. In addition, no synchronization is needed.

One of the most important subspace approaches is the linear dimensionality reduction step in the Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), which has been successfully employed in many fields such as biometrics, bioinformatics, and multimedia information management. However, the linear dimensionality reduction step in FLDA has a critical drawback: for a classification task with c classes, if the dimension of the projected subspace is strictly lower than c - 1, the projection to a subspace tends to merge those classes, which are close together in the original feature space. If separate classes are sampled from Gaussian distributions, all with identical covariance matrices, then the linear dimensionality reduction step in FLDA maximizes the mean value of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between different classes. Based on this viewpoint, the geometric mean for subspace selection is studied in this paper. Three criteria are analyzed: 1) maximization of the geometric mean of the KL divergences, 2) maximization of the geometric mean of the normalized KL divergences, and 3) the combination of 1 and 2. Preliminary experimental results based on synthetic data, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and handwriting digits show that the third criterion is a potential discriminative subspace selection method, which significantly reduces the class separation problem in comparing with the linear dimensionality reduction step in FLDA and its several representative extensions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479477","Arithmetic mean;Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA);geometric mean;Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence;machine learning;subspace selection (or dimensionality reduction);visualization.;Numerical Analysis;Probability and Statistics","Pattern classification;Data visualization;Linear discriminant analysis;Information analysis;Biometrics;Bioinformatics;Information management;Gaussian distribution;Covariance matrix;Machine learning","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Discriminant Analysis;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","467","","44","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, many prototype displays have been demonstrated in these four years since the first report of AOS TFT. The most prominent feature of AOS TFTs is that they operate with good performances even if they are fabricated at low temperatures without a defect passivation treatment. The TFT mobilities exceed 10 cm2/(V ldr s), which are more than ten times larger than those of conventional amorphous semiconductor devices.

These features indicate that electron transport in oxide semiconductors are insensitive to random structures and these oxides do not form high-density defects that affect electron transport and TFT operation.

By conducting four case studies, we have demonstrated the superiority of the CW-SSIM index against other indices (e.g., Dice, Hausdorff distance) commonly used for assessing the similarity of a given pair of images. In addition, we show that the CW-SSIM index has a number of advantages. It is robust to small rotations and translations.

The SC algorithm relies on the concept of atmospheric functions (AFs) which are dependent on atmospheric transmissivity and upwelling and downwelling atmospheric radiances. These AFs are fitted versus the atmospheric water vapor content for operational purposes. In this paper, we present updated fits using MODTRAN 4 radiative transfer code, and we also extend the application of the SC algorithm to the TIR channel of the TM sensor onboard the Landsat-4 platform and the enhanced TM plus sensor onboard the Landsat-7 platform. Five different atmospheric sounding databases have been considered to create simulated data used for retrieving AFs and to test the algorithm. The test from independent simulated data provided root mean square error (rmse) values below 1 K in most cases when atmospheric water vapor content is lower than 2 $\hbox{g} \cdot \hbox{cm}^{-2}$. For values higher than 3 $\hbox{g} \cdot \hbox{cm}^{-2}$, errors are not acceptable, as what occurs with other SC algorithms. Results were also tested using a land surface temperature map obtained from one Landsat-5 image acquired over an agricultural area using inversion of the radiative transfer equation and the atmospheric profile measured in situ at the sensor overpass time.

It has been demonstrated that with appropriate design of the compressive measurements used to define v, the decompressive mapping vrarru may be performed with error ||u-u||2 2 having asymptotic properties analogous to those of the best adaptive transform-coding algorithm applied in the basis Psi. The mapping vrarru constitutes an inverse problem, often solved using l1 regularization or related techniques.

In many applications the L ldquotasksrdquo defined by the mappings virarrui are not statistically independent, and it may be possible to improve the performance of the inversion if statistical interrelationships are exploited. In this paper, we address this problem within a multitask learning setting, wherein the mapping vrarru for each task corresponds to inferring the parameters (here, wavelet coefficients) associated with the desired signal vi, and a shared prior is placed across all of the L tasks. Under this hierarchical Bayesian modeling, data from all L tasks contribute toward inferring a posterior on the hyperparameters, and once the shared prior is thereby inferred, the data from each of the L individual tasks is then employed to estimate the task-dependent wavelet coefficients. An empirical Bayesian procedure for the estimation of hyperparameters is considered; two fast inference algorithms extending the relevance vector machine (RVM) are developed.

However, conventional SAR systems are not capable of fulfilling the increasing demands for improved spatial resolution and wider swath coverage. To overcome these inherent limitations, several innovative techniques have been suggested which employ multiple receive-apertures to gather additional information along the synthetic aperture. These digital beamforming (DBF) on receive techniques are reviewed with particular emphasis on the multi-aperture signal processing in azimuth and a multi-aperture reconstruction algorithm is presented that allows for the unambiguous recovery of the Doppler spectrum. The impact of Doppler aliasing is investigated and an analytic expression for the residual azimuth ambiguities is derived. Further, the influence of the processing on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed, resulting in a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) dependent factor describing the SNR scaling of the multi-aperture beamforming network. The focus is then turned to a complete high-resolution wide-swath SAR system design example which demonstrates the intricate connection between multi-aperture azimuth processing and the system architecture. In this regard, alternative processing approaches are compared with the multi-aperture reconstruction algorithm. In a next step, optimization strategies are discussed as pattern tapering, prebeamshaping-on-receive, and modified processing algorithms. In this context, the analytic expressions for both the residual ambiguities and the SNR scaling factor are generalized to cascaded beamforming networks. The suggested techniques can moreover be extended in many ways. Examples discussed are a combination with ScanSAR burst mode operation and the transfer to multistatic sparse array configurations.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2009.5089542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089542","","Array signal processing;Radar polarimetry;Azimuth;Synthetic aperture radar;Signal processing algorithms;Reconstruction algorithms;High-resolution imaging;Remote sensing;Earth;Spatial resolution","","450","4","47","IEEE","19 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To evaluate the system error performance in turbulence regimes from weak to strong, the probability density function (pdf) of the received irradiance after traversing the atmosphere is modelled using the gamma-gamma distribution while the negative exponential distribution is used to model turbulence in the saturation region and beyond. The effect of turbulence induced irradiance fluctuation is mitigated using spatial diversity at the receiver.

The capacity-limiting factor in such networks is interference. The cross-tier interference between macrocells and femtocells can suffocate the capacity due to the near-far problem, so in practice hotspots should use a different frequency channel than the potentially nearby high-power macrocell users. Centralized or coordinated frequency planning, which is difficult and inefficient even in conventional cellular networks, is all but impossible in a two-tier network. This paper proposes and analyzes an optimum decentralized spectrum allocation policy for two-tier networks that employ frequency division multiple access (including OFDMA). The proposed allocation is optimal in terms of area spectral efficiency (ASE), and is subjected to a sensible quality of service (QoS) requirement, which guarantees that both macrocell and femtocell users attain at least a prescribed data rate. Results show the dependence of this allocation on the QoS requirement, hotspot density and the co-channel interference from the macrocell and femtocells.

In this paper, we assume that two types of messages are used for traffic safety-related communication: 1) Periodic messages (ldquobeaconsrdquo) that are sent by all vehicles to inform their neighbors about their current status (i.e., position) and 2) event-driven messages that are sent whenever a hazard has been detected. In IEEE 802.11 distributed-coordination-function-based vehicular networks, interferences and packet collisions can lead to the failure of the reception of safety-critical information, in particular when the beaconing load leads to an almost-saturated channel, as it could easily happen in many critical vehicular traffic conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of transmit power control to avoid saturated channel conditions and ensure the best use of the channel for safety-related purposes. We propose a distributed transmit power control method based on a strict fairness criterion, i.e., distributed fair power adjustment for vehicular environments (D-FPAV), to control the load of periodic messages on the channel. The benefits are twofold: 1) The bandwidth is made available for higher priority data like dissemination of warnings, and 2) beacons from different vehicles are treated with ldquoequal rights,rdquo and therefore, the best possible reception under the available bandwidth constraints is ensured. We formally prove the fairness of the proposed approach. Then, we make use of the ns-2 simulator that was significantly enhanced by realistic highway mobility patterns, improved radio propagation, receiver models, and the IEEE 802.11p specifications to show the beneficial impact of D-FPAV for safety-related communications. We finally put forward a method, i.e., emergency message dissemination for vehicular environments (EMDV), for fast and effective multihop information dissemination of event-driven messages and show that EMDV benefits of the beaconing load control provided by D-FPAV with respect to both probability of reception and latency.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2017545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4801661","Active safety;contention;fairness;information dissemination;power control;vehicle-to-vehicle communication","Power control;Hazards;Communication system traffic control;Bandwidth;Vehicle safety;Vehicle detection;Interference;Road accidents;Vehicles;Road transportation","","445","8","61","IEEE","16 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although cellular networks account for a rather small share of energy use, lowering their energy consumption appears beneficial from an economical perspective. In this regard, the deployment of small, low power base stations, alongside conventional sites is often believed to greatly lower the energy consumption of cellular radio networks. This paper investigates on the impact of deployment strategies on the power consumption of mobile radio networks. We consider layouts featuring varying numbers of micro base stations per cell in addition to conventional macro sites. We introduce the concept of area power consumption as a system performance metric and employ simulations to evaluate potential improvements of this metric through the use of micro base stations. The results suggest, that for scenarios with full traffic load, the use of micro base stations has a rather moderate effect on the area power consumption of a cellular network.","1090-3038","978-1-4244-2514-3","10.1109/VETECF.2009.5379031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379031","","Energy efficiency;Base stations;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Energy consumption;Communication industry;Communication networks;Power generation economics;Environmental economics;Land mobile radio;System performance","","441","2","11","IEEE","12 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On one hand, learning overcomplete dictionaries that facilitate a sparse representation of the data as a liner combination of a few atoms from such dictionary leads to state-of-the-art results in image and video restoration and classification. On the other hand, the framework of compressed sensing (CS) has shown that sparse signals can be recovered from far less samples than those required by the classical Shannon-Nyquist Theorem. The samples used in CS correspond to linear projections obtained by a sensing projection matrix. It has been shown that, for example, a nonadaptive random sampling matrix satisfies the fundamental theoretical requirements of CS, enjoying the additional benefit of universality. On the other hand, a projection sensing matrix that is optimally designed for a certain class of signals can further improve the reconstruction accuracy or further reduce the necessary number of samples. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the joint design and optimization, from a set of training images, of the nonparametric dictionary and the sensing matrix. We show that this joint optimization outperforms both the use of random sensing matrices and those matrices that are optimized independently of the learning of the dictionary. Particular cases of the proposed framework include the optimization of the sensing matrix for a given dictionary as well as the optimization of the dictionary for a predefined sensing environment. The presentation of the framework and its efficient numerical optimization is complemented with numerous examples on classical image datasets.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2009.2022459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061489","Compressed sensing;image patches;learning;overcomplete dictionary;sensing projection matrix;sparse representation","Sparse matrices;Dictionaries;Signal representations;Signal analysis;Video signal processing;Video compression;Image restoration;Signal restoration;Compressed sensing;Sampling methods","","441","4","57","IEEE","2 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Similarities and specifics of behavioral modeling and digital predistortion were presented. Thereby, digital predistortion can be seen as a behavioral modeling problem for which performance assessment is much more straightforward. For DUT behavioral modeling, there is no comprehensive metric that allows the model performance evaluation while taking into account the model accuracy in predicting all the three components of the DUT behavior (in-band distortion, static nonlinearity and memory effects).

The second relay is used in order to create intentional interference at the eavesdropper nodes. The proposed selection technique jointly protects the primary destination against interference and eavesdropping and jams the reception of the eavesdropper. The new approach is analyzed for different complexity requirements based on instantaneous and average knowledge of the eavesdropper channels.

Multi-cell block diagonalization is used to coordinate the transmissions across multiple BTSs in the same cluster. To satisfy per-BTS power constraints, three combined precoder and power allocation algorithms are proposed with different performance and complexity tradeoffs. For inter-cluster coordination, the coordination area is chosen to balance fairness for edge users and the achievable sum rate. It is shown that a small cluster size (about 7 cells) is sufficient to obtain most of the sum rate benefits from clustered coordination while greatly relieving channel feedback requirement. Simulations show that the proposed coordination strategy efficiently reduces interference and provides a considerable sum rate gain for cellular MIMO networks.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.080180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4907459","MIMO systems;cellular technology;resource allocation and interference management;base station coordination","MIMO;Receiving antennas;Cellular networks;Mobile antennas;Downlink;Interference suppression;Resource management;Decoding;Transceivers;Interference constraints","","429","40","50","IEEE","2 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In previous studies, various classification schemes and feature extraction methods have been used to identify different activities from a range of different datasets. In this paper, we present a comparison of 14 methods to extract classification features from accelerometer signals. These are based on the wavelet transform and other well-known time- and frequency-domain signal characteristics. To allow an objective comparison between the different features, we used two datasets of activities collected from 20 subjects. The first set comprised three commonly used activities, namely, level walking, stair ascent, and stair descent, and the second a total of eight activities. Furthermore, we compared the classification accuracy for each feature set across different combinations of three different accelerometer placements. The classification analysis has been performed with robust subject-based cross-validation methods using a nearest-neighbor classifier. The findings show that, although the wavelet transform approach can be used to characterize nonstationary signals, it does not perform as accurately as frequency-based features when classifying dynamic activities performed by healthy subjects. Overall, the best feature sets achieved over 95% intersubject classification accuracy.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2008.2006190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663615","Activity classification;ambulatory monitoring;machine learning;wavelet transform","Feature extraction;Accelerometers;Wavelet transforms;Medical services;Monitoring;Humans;Legged locomotion;Performance analysis;Robustness;Frequency","Adult;Algorithms;Ankle;Female;Humans;Locomotion;Male;Models, Theoretical;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Movement;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Thigh","427","5","44","IEEE","31 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents four link budgets that account for the major propagation mechanisms of the backscatter channel, along with a detailed discussion of each.

In other words, we model the motion variation of local space-time volumes and their spatial-temporal statistical behaviors to characterize the overall behavior of the scene. We demonstrate that by capturing the steady-state motion behavior with these spatio-temporal motion pattern models, we can naturally detect unusual activity as statistical deviations.

Resilience engineering is concerned with building systems that are able to circumvent accidents through anticipation, survive disruptions through recovery, and grow through adaptation.

In a similar vein, we connect the conditional max-entropy H max(A |B) to the maximum fidelity of rhoAB with a product state that is completely mixed on A. In the case where A is classical, this corresponds to the security of A when used as a secret key in the presence of an adversary holding B. Because min- and max-entropies are known to characterize information-processing tasks such as randomness extraction and state merging, our results establish a direct connection between these tasks and basic operational problems.

The effects of system parameters, such as the number of users, the number of subcarriers per chunk, and the coherence bandwidth, are evaluated. The numerical results show that, when the chunk bandwidth is smaller than the coherence bandwidth, the average downlink throughput of the chunk-based subcarrier allocation is very close to that of the single-subcarrier-based allocation. When the number of users is small, the average throughput increases dramatically with increasing the number of users due to multiuser diversity, whereas when the number of users is large, the multiuser diversity gain is saturated.

A novel multistage approach is developed for disturbance cancellation and target detection based on projections of the received signal in a subspace orthogonal to both the disturbance and previously detected targets. The resulting algorithm is shown to be effective against typical simulated scenarios with a limited number of stages, and a version with computational savings is also introduced. Finally its effectiveness is demonstrated with the application to real data acquired with an experimental VHF PBR system.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2009.5089551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089551","","Object detection;Bistatic radar;Bioreactors;Clutter;Doppler radar;Surveillance;Radio transmitters;Radio broadcasting;Displacement control;Computational modeling","","412","1","17","IEEE","19 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Approaches utilizing spatio-temporal local features have proved that they are able to cope with such difficulties, but they mainly focused on classifying short videos of simple periodic actions. In this paper, we present a new activity recognition methodology that overcomes the limitations of the previous approaches using local features. We introduce a novel matching, spatio-temporal relationship match, which is designed to measure structural similarity between sets of features extracted from two videos. Our match hierarchically considers spatio-temporal relationships among feature points, thereby enabling detection and localization of complex non-periodic activities. In contrast to previous approaches to `classify' videos, our approach is designed to `detect and localize' all occurring activities from continuous videos where multiple actors and pedestrians are present. We implement and test our methodology on a newly-introduced dataset containing videos of multiple interacting persons and individual pedestrians. The results confirm that our system is able to recognize complex non-periodic activities (e.g. `push' and `hug') from sets of spatio-temporal features even when multiple activities are present in the scene.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459361","","Humans;Layout;Feature extraction;System testing;Computer vision;Lighting;Intelligent robots;Surveillance;Cameras;Robot vision systems","","412","1","16","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed SOS-based framework provides a number of innovations and improvements over the existing linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based approaches to Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling and control. First, we propose a polynomial fuzzy modeling and control framework that is more general and effective than the well-known T--S fuzzy modeling and control. Secondly, we obtain stability and stabilizability conditions of the polynomial fuzzy systems based on polynomial Lyapunov functions that contain quadratic Lyapunov functions as a special case. Hence, the stability and stabilizability conditions presented in this paper are more general and relaxed than those of the existing LMI-based approaches to T-S fuzzy modeling and control. Moreover, the derived stability and stabilizability conditions are represented in terms of SOS and can be numerically (partially symbolically) solved via the recently developed SOSTOOLS. To illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, a number of analysis and design examples are provided. The first example shows that the SOS approach renders more relaxed stability results than those of both the LMI-based approaches and a polynomial system approach. The second example presents an extensive application of the SOS approach in comparison with a piecewise Lyapunov function approach. The last example is a design exercise that demonstrates the viability of the SOS-based approach to synthesizing a stabilizing controller.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.924341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4505350","Polynomial fuzzy controller;polynomial fuzzy system;polynomial Lyapunov function;stability;stabilizability;sum of squares (SOS);polynomial fuzzy system;sum of squares;polynomial Lyapunov function;polynomial fuzzy controller;stability;stabilizability","Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Polynomials;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy control;Stability;Lyapunov method;Technological innovation;Linear matrix inequalities;Takagi-Sugeno model","","409","","38","IEEE","30 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Starting with a small and nonoptimal training set, the model itself builds the optimal set of samples which minimizes the classification error. We have applied the proposed algorithms to a variety of remote sensing data, including very high resolution and hyperspectral images, using support vector machines.

A visual stimulation process elicits the neurological phenomenon, and the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing detects the target location. This location is transferred to the autonomous navigation system that drives the wheelchair to the desired location while avoiding collisions with obstacles in the environment detected by the laser scanner. This concept gives the user the flexibility to use the device in unknown and evolving scenarios. The prototype was validated with five healthy participants in three consecutive steps: screening (an analysis of three different groups of visual interface designs), virtual-environment driving, and driving sessions with the wheelchair. On the basis of the results, this paper reports the following evaluation studies: 1) a technical evaluation of the device and all functionalities; 2) a users' behavior study; and 3) a variability study.

In this new world of computing, users are universally required to accept the underlying premise of trust. Within the cloud computing world, the virtual environment lets users access computing power that exceeds that contained within their own physical worlds. Typically, users will know neither the exact location of their data nor the other sources of the data collectively stored with theirs. The data you can find in a cloud ranges from public source, which has minimal security concerns, to private data containing highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, medical records, or shipping manifests for hazardous material). Does using a cloud environment alleviate the business entities of their responsibility to ensure that proper security measures are in place for both their data and applications, or do they share joint responsibility with service providers? The answers to this and other questions lie within the realm of yet-to-be-written law. As with most technological advances, regulators are typically in a ""catch-up"" mode to identify policy, governance, and law. Cloud computing presents an extension of problems heretofore experienced with the Internet. To ensure that such decisions are informed and appropriate for the cloud computing environment, the industry itself should establish coherent and effective policy and governance to identify and implement proper security methods.","1558-4046","","10.1109/MSP.2009.87","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5189563","cloud computing;security;governance;it all depends","Data security;Cloud computing;Information security;Internet;Distributed computing;Virtual environment;Physics computing;Hazardous materials;Regulators;Computer industry","","408","4","5","IEEE","4 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Each atlas image is registered to the target image independently and the calculated transformation is applied to the segmentation of the atlas image to obtain a segmented version of the target image. Several independent candidate segmentations result from the process, which must be somehow combined into a single final segmentation. Majority voting is the generally used rule to fuse the segmentations, but more sophisticated methods have also been proposed. In this paper, we show that the use of global weights to ponderate candidate segmentations has a major limitation. As a means to improve segmentation accuracy, we propose the generalized local weighting voting method. Namely, the fusion weights adapt voxel-by-voxel according to a local estimation of segmentation performance. Using digital phantoms and MR images of the human brain, we demonstrate that the performance of each combination technique depends on the gray level contrast characteristics of the segmented region, and that no fusion method yields better results than the others for all the regions. In particular, we show that local combination strategies outperform global methods in segmenting high-contrast structures, while global techniques are less sensitive to noise when contrast between neighboring structures is low. We conclude that, in order to achieve the highest overall segmentation accuracy, the best combination method for each particular structure must be selected.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2009.2014372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4785214","Atlas-based segmentation;classifier combination;combination of segmentations;majority voting;weighted voting","Image segmentation;Voting;Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Fuses;Imaging phantoms;Humans;Level set;Scholarships","Algorithms;Brain;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging","408","5","35","IEEE","18 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With universal frequency reuse and DS-CDMA transmission however, the ensuing cross-tier interference causes unacceptable outage probability. This paper develops an uplink capacity analysis and interference avoidance strategy in such a two-tier CDMA network. We evaluate a network-wide area spectral efficiency metric called the operating contour (OC) defined as the feasible combinations of the average number of active macrocell users and femtocell base stations (BS) per cell-site that satisfy a target outage constraint. The capacity analysis provides an accurate characterization of the uplink outage probability, accounting for power control, path loss and shadowing effects. Considering worst case interference at a corner femtocell, results reveal that interference avoidance through a time-hopped CDMA physical layer and sectorized antennas allows about a 7x higher femtocell density, relative to a split spectrum two-tier network with omnidirectional femtocell antennas. A femtocell exclusion region and a tier selection based handoff policy offers modest improvements in the OCs. These results provide guidelines for the design of robust shared spectrum two-tier networks.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.070475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5165314","Operating contours, code division multiaccess, macrocell, femtocell, cellular, uplink capacity, outage probability.","Femtocell networks;Multiaccess communication;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Power generation economics;Cellular networks;Frequency;Macrocell networks;Base stations;Interference constraints;Capacity planning","","408","1","25","IEEE","21 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Quantitative measurement is more suitable than qualitative measurement (i.e., mapping with a relative scale) of tissue viscoelasticity for diagnosis of diffuse diseases where abnormality is not confined to a local region and there is no normal background tissue to provide contrast. Shearwave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (SDUV) uses shear wave propagation speed measured in tissue at multiple frequencies (typically in the range of hundreds of Hertz) to solve quantitatively for both tissue elasticity and viscosity. A shear wave is stimulated within the tissue by an ultrasound push beam and monitored by a separate ultrasound detect beam. The phase difference of the shear wave between 2 locations along its propagation path is used to calculate shear wave speed within the tissue. In vitro SDUV measurements along and across bovine striated muscle fibers show results of tissue elasticity and viscosity close to literature values. An intermittent pulse sequence is developed to allow one array transducer for both push and detect function. Feasibility of this pulse sequence is demonstrated by in vivo SDUV measurements in swine liver using a dual transducer prototype simulating the operation of a single array transducer.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4775264","","Dispersion;Ultrasonic imaging;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Elasticity;Viscosity;Transducers;Pulse measurements;Medical services;Biomedical equipment;Pathology","Algorithms;Animals;Cattle;Elasticity;Elasticity Imaging Techniques;Equipment Design;Feasibility Studies;Liver;Liver;Muscle, Striated;Muscle, Striated;Swine;Transducers;Vibration;Viscosity","407","6","26","IEEE","6 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Distributed beamforming may also provide benefits in terms of security and interference reduction since less transmit power is scattered in unintended directions. Key challenges in realizing these benefits, however, include coordinating the sources for information sharing and timing synchronization and, most crucially, distributed carrier synchronization so that the transmissions combine constructively at the destination.

However, the adoption of home automation systems has been slow. This paper identifies the reasons for this slow adoption and evaluates the potential of ZigBee for addressing these problems through the design and implementation of a flexible home automation architecture. A ZigBee based home automation system and Wi-Fi network are integrated through a common home gateway. The home gateway provides network interoperability, a simple and flexible user interface, and remote access to the system. A dedicated virtual home is implemented to cater for the system's security and safety needs.

We introduce a design principle of modulation and network coding, considering the superposed constellations during the MA stage. For the case of QPSK modulations at the MA stage, we show that QPSK constellations with an exclusive-or (XOR) network coding do not always offer the best transmission for the BC stage, and that there are several channel conditions in which unconventional 5-ary constellations lead to a better throughput performance. Through the use of sphere packing, we optimize the constellation for such an irregular network coding. We further discuss the design issue of the modulation in the case when the relay exploits diversity receptions such as multiple-antenna diversity and path diversity in frequency-selective fading. In addition, we apply our design strategy to a relaying system using higher-level modulations of 16QAM in the MA stage.

A well-known challenge to local stereo methods is to decide an appropriate support window for the pixel under consideration, adapting the window shape or the pixelwise support weight to the underlying scene structures. Our stereo method tackles this problem with two key contributions. First, for each anchor pixel an upright cross local support skeleton is adaptively constructed, with four varying arm lengths decided on color similarity and connectivity constraints. Second, given the local cross-decision results, we dynamically construct a shape-adaptive full support region on the fly, merging horizontal segments of the crosses in the vertical neighborhood. Approximating image structures accurately, the proposed method is among the best performing local stereo methods according to the benchmark Middlebury stereo evaluation. Additionally, it reduces memory consumption significantly thanks to our compact local cross representation. To accelerate matching cost aggregation performed in an arbitrarily shaped 2-D region, we also propose an orthogonal integral image technique, yielding a speedup factor of 5-15 over the straightforward integration.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2020478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4811952","Cross-based region construction;orthogonal integral images;shape adaptive approximation;stereo matching","Shape;Costs;Layout;Image segmentation;Microelectronics;Electronic mail;Skeleton;Merging;Performance evaluation;Acceleration","","400","3","18","IEEE","7 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such approaches are only applicable to time series data living in a Euclidean space, e.g. joint trajectories extracted from motion capture data or feature point trajectories extracted from video. Much of the success of recent object recognition techniques relies on the use of more complex feature descriptors, such as SIFT descriptors or HOG descriptors, which are essentially histograms. Since histograms live in a non-Euclidean space, we can no longer model their temporal evolution with LDSs, nor can we classify them using a metric for LDSs. In this paper, we propose to represent each frame of a video using a histogram of oriented optical flow (HOOF) and to recognize human actions by classifying HOOF time-series. For this purpose, we propose a generalization of the Binet-Cauchy kernels to nonlinear dynamical systems (NLDS) whose output lives in a non-Euclidean space, e.g. the space of histograms. This can be achieved by using kernels defined on the original non-Euclidean space, leading to a well-defined metric for NLDSs. We use these kernels for the classification of actions in video sequences using (HOOF) as the output of the NLDS.

An active cannula is composed of telescoping, concentric, precurved superelastic tubes that can be axially translated and rotated at the base relative to one another. Active cannulas derive bending not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms but from elastic tube interaction in the backbone itself, permitting high dexterity and small size, and dexterity improves with miniaturization. They are designed to traverse narrow and winding environments without relying on ldquoguidingrdquo environmental reaction forces. These features seem ideal for a variety of applications where a very thin robot with tentacle-like dexterity is needed. In this paper, we apply beam mechanics to obtain a kinematic model of active cannula shape and describe design tools that result from the modeling process. After deriving general equations, we apply them to a simple three-link active cannula. Experimental results illustrate the importance of including torsional effects and the ability of our model to predict energy bifurcation and active cannula shape.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2008.2006868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4671090","Continuum robot;flexible manipulator;medical robot;snake-like robot;Continuum robot;flexible manipulator;medical robot;snake-like robot","Robots;Medical robotics;Active shape model;Medical services;Biomedical equipment;Tendons;Wires;Spine;Kinematics;Equations","","392","16","36","IEEE","11 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data assimilation and parameter-estimation problems are explained, and the concept of joint parameter and state estimation, which can be solved using ensemble methods, is presented. KF and EKF are briefly discussed before introducing and deriving EnKF. Similarities and differences between KF and EnKF are pointed out. The benefits of using EnKF with high-dimensional and highly nonlinear dynamical models are illustrated by examples. EnKF and EnKS are also derived from Bayes theorem, using a probabilistic approach. The derivation is based on the assumption that measurement errors are independent in time and the model represents a Markov process, which allows for Bayes theorem to be written in a recursive form, where measurements are processed sequentially in time. The practical implementation of the analysis scheme isdiscussed, and it is shown that it can be computed efficiently in the space spanned by the ensemble realizations. The square root scheme is discussed as an alternative method that avoids the perturbation of measurements. However, the square root scheme has other pitfalls, and it is recommended to use the symmetric square root with or without a random rotation. The random rotation introduces a stochastic component to the update, and the quality of the scheme may then not improve compared to the original stochastic EnKF scheme with perturbed measurements.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2009.932223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4939313","","Parameter estimation;Particle filters;Atmospheric modeling;Covariance matrix;Nonlinear equations;Error analysis;Kalman filters;Computational modeling;Computational efficiency;Bayesian methods","","391","1","63","IEEE","19 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The performance of free-space optical (FSO) communication, however, severely suffers from turbulence-induced fading caused by atmospheric conditions. Multiple laser transmitters and/or receivers can be placed at both ends to mitigate the turbulence fading and exploit the advantages of spatial diversity. Spatial diversity is particularly crucial for strong turbulence channels in which single-input single-output (SISO) link performs extremely poor. Atmospheric-induced strong turbulence fading in outdoor FSO systems can be modeled as a multiplicative random process which follows the K distribution. In this paper, we investigate the error rate performance of FSO systems for K-distributed atmospheric turbulence channels and discuss potential advantages of spatial diversity deployments at the transmitter and/or receiver. We further present efficient approximated closed-form expressions for the average bit-error rate (BER) of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) FSO systems. These analytical tools are reliable alternatives to time-consuming Monte Carlo simulation of FSO systems where BER targets as low as 10-9 are typically aimed to achieve.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.071318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4786457","Atmospheric turbulence;bit-error rate (BER);free-space optical communication;K distribution;optical wireless;spatial diversity","Optical transmitters;Bit error rate;Optical receivers;Fading;Atmospheric modeling;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical refraction;Optical variables control;Radio transmitters;Bandwidth","","390","","26","IEEE","20 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While each of these perceptual tasks can be conducted independently, recognition rate improves when interactions between them are considered. Motivated by psychological studies of human perception, we present a Bayesian approach which integrates various perceptual tasks involved in understanding human-object interactions. Previous approaches to object and action recognition rely on static shape/appearance feature matching and motion analysis, respectively. Our approach goes beyond these traditional approaches and applies spatial and functional constraints on each of the perceptual elements for coherent semantic interpretation. Such constraints allow us to recognize objects and actions when the appearances are not discriminative enough. We also demonstrate the use of such constraints in recognition of actions from static images without using any motion information.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815270","Action recognition;object recognition;functional recognition.","Humans;Image recognition;Object recognition;Pattern recognition;Videos;Bayesian methods;Shape;Motion analysis;Information analysis;Layout","Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Human Activities;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Biological;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Recognition (Psychology);Video Recording","390","6","62","IEEE","17 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their attractiveness resides in their elegant treatment of nonlinear problems. They have been successfully applied to pattern recognition, regression and density estimation. A common characteristic of kernel-based methods is that they deal with kernel expansions whose number of terms equals the number of input data, making them unsuitable for online applications. Recently, several solutions have been proposed to circumvent this computational burden in time series prediction problems. Nevertheless, most of them require excessively elaborate and costly operations. In this paper, we investigate a new model reduction criterion that makes computationally demanding sparsification procedures unnecessary. The increase in the number of variables is controlled by the coherence parameter, a fundamental quantity that characterizes the behavior of dictionaries in sparse approximation problems. We incorporate the coherence criterion into a new kernel-based affine projection algorithm for time series prediction. We also derive the kernel-based normalized LMS algorithm as a particular case. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare our approach to existing methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.2009895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685707","Adaptive filters;machine learning;nonlinear systems;pattern recognition","Kernel;Filters;Nonlinear systems;Signal processing algorithms;Neural networks;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Coherence;Least squares approximation","","389","","43","IEEE","21 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After summarizing the basic physics of these materials, the state of the art of their interconnect-related fabrication and modeling efforts is reviewed. Both electrical and thermal modeling and performance analysis for various CNT- and GNR-based interconnects are presented and compared with conventional interconnect materials to provide guidelines for their prospective applications. It is shown that single-walled, double-walled, and multiwalled CNTs can provide better performance than that of Cu. However, in order to make GNR interconnects comparable with Cu or CNT interconnects, both intercalation doping and high edge-specularity must be achieved. Thermal analysis of CNTs shows significant advantages in tall vias, indicating their promising application as through-silicon vias in 3-D ICs. In addition to on-chip interconnects, various applications exploiting the low-dimensional properties of these nanomaterials are discussed. These include chip-to-packaging interconnects as well as passive devices for future generations of IC technology.

In this paper, we use low-performance microelectromechanical (MEMS) inertial sensors attached to the foot of a person. This sensor has triaxial orthogonal accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers. We describe, implement and compare several of the most relevant algorithms for step detection, stride length, heading and position estimation. The challenge using MEMS is to provide location estimations with enough accuracy and a limited drift. Several tests were conducted outdoors and indoors, and we found that the stride length estimation errors were about 1%. The positioning errors were almost always below 5% of the total travelled distance. The main source of positioning errors are the absolute orientation estimation.","","978-1-4244-5057-2","10.1109/WISP.2009.5286542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5286542","","Micromechanical devices;Motion estimation;Magnetic sensors;Humans;Length measurement;Measurement units;Motion measurement;Motion detection;Foot;Accelerometers","","386","27","9","IEEE","13 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Open, market-based spectrum trading motivates existing spectrum owners (as sellers) to lease their selected idle spectrum to new spectrum users, and provides new users (as buyers) the spectrum they desperately need. The most significant challenge is how to make the auction economic-robust (truthful in particular) while enabling spectrum reuse to improve spectrum utilization. Unfortunately, existing designs either do not consider spectrum reuse or become untruthful when applied to double spectrum auctions. We address this challenge by proposing TRUST, a general framework for truthful double spectrum auctions. TRUST takes as input any reusability-driven spectrum allocation algorithm, and applies a novel winner determination and pricing mechanism to achieve truthfulness and other economic properties while significantly improving spectrum utilization. To our best knowledge, TRUST is the first solution for truthful double spectrum auctions that enable spectrum reuse. Our results show that economic factors introduce a tradeoff between spectrum efficiency and economic robustness.

The primary and secondary systems comprise of a transmitter-receiver pair, PT-PR and ST-SR, respectively. In the first transmission phase, PT transmits the primary signal to PR, which is also received by ST and SR, where it is decoded. At ST, the primary signal is regenerated and linearly combined with the secondary signal by assigning fractions alpha and (1 - alpha) of the available power to the primary and secondary signals respectively. This combined signal is then broadcasted by ST in the second transmission phase. We show that as long as ST is located within a critical radius from PT, there exists a threshold value for alpha above which the outage probability of the primary system will be equal to or lower than the case without spectrum sharing. We also determine the outage probability achieved by the secondary system.

The advancement of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology with high-resolution data of large dimensions demands better and efficient speckle filtering algorithms. In this paper, we extend and improve the Lee sigma filter by eliminating these deficiencies. The bias problem is solved by redefining the sigma range based on the speckle probability density functions. To mitigate the problems of blurring and depressing strong reflective scatterers, a target signature preservation technique is developed. In addition, we incorporate the minimum-mean-square-error estimator for adaptive speckle reduction. Simulated SAR data are used to quantitatively evaluate the characteristics of this improved sigma filter and to validate its effectiveness. The proposed algorithm is applied to spaceborne and airborne SAR data to demonstrate its overall speckle filtering characteristics as compared with other algorithms.

The term weighting methods assign appropriate weights to the terms to improve the performance of text categorization. In this study, we investigate several widely-used unsupervised (traditional) and supervised term weighting methods on benchmark data collections in combination with SVM and kNN algorithms. In consideration of the distribution of relevant documents in the collection, we propose a new simple supervised term weighting method, i.e. tf.rf, to improve the terms' discriminating power for text categorization task. From the controlled experimental results, these supervised term weighting methods have mixed performance. Specifically, our proposed supervised term weighting method, tf.rf, has a consistently better performance than other term weighting methods while other supervised term weighting methods based on information theory or statistical metric perform the worst in all experiments. On the other hand, the popularly used tf.idf method has not shown a uniformly good performance in terms of different data sets.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509437","Knowledge and data engineering tools and techniques;Clustering;classification;and association rules;Text mining;Database Applications;Database Management;Information Technology and Systems;Indexing methods;Content Analysis and Indexing;Information Storage and Retrieval;Information Technolog;Text analysis;Natural Language Processing;Artificial Intelligence;Computing Methodologies;Knowledge and data engineering tools and techniques;Clustering;classification;and association rules;Text mining;Database Applications;Database Management;Information Technology and Systems;Indexing methods;Content Analysis and Indexing;Information Storage and Retrieval;Information Technolog;Text analysis;Natural Language Processing;Artificial Intelligence;Computing Methodologies","Text categorization;Text recognition;Indexing;Support vector machines;Information theory;Support vector machine classification;Natural languages;Information retrieval;Supervised learning;Frequency","","382","15","28","IEEE","2 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This framework includes the source video data, ground-truth annotations (along with guidelines for annotation), performance metrics, evaluation protocols, and tools including scoring software and baseline algorithms. For each detection and tracking task and supported domain, we developed a 50-clip training set and a 50-clip test set.

Each task/domain, therefore, has an associated annotated corpus of approximately 450,000 frames. The scope of such annotation is unprecedented and was designed to begin to support the necessary quantities of data for robust machine learning approaches, as well as a statistically significant comparison of the performance of algorithms. The goal of this work was to systematically address the challenges of object detection and tracking through a common evaluation framework that permits a meaningful objective comparison of techniques, provides the research community with sufficient data for the exploration of automatic modeling techniques, encourages the incorporation of objective evaluation into the development process, and contributes useful lasting resources of a scale and magnitude that will prove to be extremely useful to the computer vision research community for years to come.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479472","Performance evaluation;object detection and tracking;baseline algorithms;face;text;vehicle.;Tracking;Miscellaneous;Video analysis;performance evaluation;object detection and tracking","Face detection;Vehicle detection;Protocols;Measurement;Object detection;Research and development;Vehicles;Guidelines;Software performance;Software tools","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Motor Vehicles;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;Video Recording","381","7","57","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This will give rise to a heterogeneous wireless access environment where network selection becomes crucial for load balancing to avoid network congestion and performance degradation. We study the dynamics of network selection in a heterogeneous wireless network using the theory of evolutionary games. The competition among groups of users in different service areas to share the limited amount of bandwidth in the available wireless access networks is formulated as a dynamic evolutionary game, and the evolutionary equilibrium is considered to be the solution to this game. We present two algorithms, namely, population evolution and reinforcement-learning algorithms for network selection. Although the network-selection algorithm based on population evolution can reach the evolutionary equilibrium faster, it requires a centralized controller to gather, process, and broadcast information about the users in the corresponding service area. In contrast, with reinforcement learning, a user can gradually learn (by interacting with the service provider) and adapt the decision on network selection to reach evolutionary equilibrium without any interaction with other users. Performance of the dynamic evolutionary game-based network-selection algorithms is empirically investigated. The accuracy of the numerical results obtained from the game model is evaluated by using simulations.

For the pattern recognition unit, feedforward and fully connected artificial neural networks, which are optimally designed for each patient by the proposed multidimensional particle swarm optimization technique, are employed. By using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, the proposed classification system can adapt to significant interpatient variations in ECG patterns by training the optimal network structure, and thus, achieves higher accuracy over larger datasets. The classification experiments over a benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed system achieves such average accuracies and sensitivities better than most of the current state-of-the-art algorithms for detection of ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) and supra-VEBs (SVEBs). Over the entire database, the average accuracy-sensitivity performances of the proposed system for VEB and SVEB detections are 98.3%-84.6% and 97.4%-63.5%, respectively.

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unstructured uncertainties, and a state observer is developed to estimate the unmeasured states. By combining the backstepping technique with the small-gain approach, a stable adaptive fuzzy output feedback control method is proposed.

On the contrary, conventional ankle-foot prostheses exhibit a passive-elastic response during stance, and consequently, cannot provide net work. Clinical studies indicate that transtibial amputees using conventional prostheses have higher gait metabolic rates than normal. Researchers believe that the main cause for these higher rates is due to the inability of conventional prostheses to provide sufficient positive power at terminal stance in the trailing leg to limit heel strike losses of the adjacent leading leg. In this investigation, we evaluate the hypothesis that a powered ankle-foot prosthesis, capable of providing human-like ankle work and power during stance, can decrease the metabolic cost of transport (COT) compared to a conventional passive-elastic prosthesis. To test the hypothesis, a powered prosthesis is built that comprises a unidirectional spring, configured in parallel with a force-controllable actuator with series elasticity. The prosthesis is shown to deliver the high mechanical power and net positive work observed in normal human walking. The rate of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production is measured as a determinant of metabolic rate on three unilateral transtibial amputees walking at self-selected speeds. We find that the powered prosthesis decreases the amputee's metabolic COT on average by 14% compared to the conventional passive-elastic prostheses evaluated (Flex-Foot Ceterusreg and Freedom Innovations Sierra), even though the powered system is over twofold heavier than the conventional devices. These results highlight the clinical importance of prosthetic interventions that closely mimic the mass distribution, kinetics, and kinematics of the missing limb.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2008.2008747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4738392","Amputee gait;impedance control;parallel elasticity;powered prosthesis;series elasticity;walking metabolism","Prosthetics;Legged locomotion;Humans;Leg;Propulsion;Costs;Testing;Springs;Actuators;Elasticity","","374","44","54","IEEE","6 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following recent developments in compressive sensing (CS) theory, several authors have demonstrated that certain classes of MR images which possess sparse representations in some transform domain can be accurately reconstructed from very highly undersampled K-space data by solving a convex lscr1-minimization problem. Although lscr1-based techniques are extremely powerful, they inherently require a degree of over-sampling above the theoretical minimum sampling rate to guarantee that exact reconstruction can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the CS paradigm based on homotopic approximation of the lscr0 quasi-norm and show how MR image reconstruction can be pushed even further below the Nyquist limit and significantly closer to the theoretical bound. Following a brief review of standard CS methods and the developed theoretical extensions, several example MRI reconstructions from highly undersampled K-space data are presented.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2008.927346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4556634","Compressed sensing;compressive sensing (CS);image reconstruction;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);nonconvex optimization;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);Image Reconstruction;Compressive Sensing;Compressed Sensing;Nonconvex Optimization","Magnetic resonance;Image reconstruction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Image sampling;Image coding;Biomedical imaging;Signal sampling;Standards development;Biological tissues;Ionizing radiation","Animals;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Data Compression;Fourier Analysis;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sample Size;Spine;Subtraction Technique;Wrist","372","12","45","IEEE","2 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"A Competitive-Cooperative Coevolutionary Paradigm for Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization","C. -K. Goh; K. C.

This paper proposes a new coevolutionary paradigm that hybridizes competitive and cooperative mechanisms observed in nature to solve multiobjective optimization problems and to track the Pareto front in a dynamic environment. The main idea of competitive-cooperative coevolution is to allow the decomposition process of the optimization problem to adapt and emerge rather than being hand designed and fixed at the start of the evolutionary optimization process. In particular, each species subpopulation will compete to represent a particular subcomponent of the multiobjective problem, while the eventual winners will cooperate to evolve for better solutions. Through such an iterative process of competition and cooperation, the various subcomponents are optimized by different species subpopulations based on the optimization requirements of that particular time instant, enabling the coevolutionary algorithm to handle both the static and dynamic multiobjective problems. The effectiveness of the competitive-cooperation coevolutionary algorithm (COEA) in static environments is validated against various multiobjective evolutionary algorithms upon different benchmark problems characterized by various difficulties in local optimality, discontinuity, nonconvexity, and high-dimensionality. In addition, extensive studies are also conducted to examine the capability of dynamic COEA (dCOEA) in tracking the Pareto front as it changes with time in dynamic environments.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2008.920671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4553723","Coevolution;dynamic multiobjective optimization;evolutionary algorithms","Pareto optimization;Design optimization;Evolutionary computation;Iterative algorithms;Space exploration;Stochastic processes;Biological system modeling;Evolution (biology);Algorithm design and analysis;Memory","","370","","70","IEEE","27 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Especially for images and video, providing training data is very expensive in terms of human time and effort. In this paper we propose an active learning approach to tackle the problem. Instead of passively accepting random training examples, the active learning algorithm iteratively selects unlabeled examples for the user to label, so that human effort is focused on labeling the most “useful” examples. Our method relies on the idea of uncertainty sampling, in which the algorithm selects unlabeled examples that it finds hardest to classify. Specifically, we propose an uncertainty measure that generalizes margin-based uncertainty to the multi-class case and is easy to compute, so that active learning can handle a large number of classes and large data sizes efficiently. We demonstrate results for letter and digit recognition on datasets from the UCI repository, object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset, and scene categorization results on a dataset of 13 natural scene categories. The proposed method gives large reductions in the number of training examples required over random selection to achieve similar classification accuracy, with little computational overhead.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206627","","Image classification;Training data;Humans;Iterative algorithms;Layout;Labeling;Sampling methods;Measurement uncertainty;Size measurement;Object recognition","","369","5","20","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The result holds in a “low-interference” regime in which the cognitive radio is closer to its receiver than to the primary receiver. In this regime, our results are subsumed by the results derived in a concurrent and independent work (Wu , 2007).

The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject those that are unstable. Efficient retrieval is achieved by employing methods from statistical text retrieval, including inverted file systems, and text and document frequency weightings. This requires a visual analogy of a word which is provided here by vector quantizing the region descriptors. The final ranking also depends on the spatial layout of the regions. The result is that retrieval is immediate, returning a ranked list of shots in the manner of Google.

"Neural Network for Graphs: A Contextual Constructive Approach","A. Micheli","Dipartimento di Informatica, Università di Pisa, Pisa, Italy",IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,"24 Feb 2009","2009","20","3","498","511","This paper presents a new approach for learning in structured domains (SDs) using a constructive neural network for graphs (NN4G). The new model allows the extension of the input domain for supervised neural networks to a general class of graphs including both acyclic/cyclic, directed/undirected labeled graphs. In particular, the model can realize adaptive contextual transductions, learning the mapping from graphs for both classification and regression tasks. In contrast to previous neural networks for structures that had a recursive dynamics, NN4G is based on a constructive feedforward architecture with state variables that uses neurons with no feedback connections. The neurons are applied to the input graphs by a general traversal process that relaxes the constraints of previous approaches derived by the causality assumption over hierarchical input data. Moreover, the incremental approach eliminates the need to introduce cyclic dependencies in the definition of the system state variables. In the traversal process, the NN4G units exploit (local) contextual information of the graphs vertices. In spite of the simplicity of the approach, we show that, through the compositionality of the contextual information developed by the learning, the model can deal with contextual information that is incrementally extended according to the graphs topology.

Coordinated control of the grid- and rotor-side converters (GSC and RSC, respectively) during voltage unbalance is proposed. Under an unbalanced supply voltage, the RSC is controlled to eliminate the torque pulsation at double supply frequency. The oscillation of the stator output active power is then compensated by the active power output from the GSC, to ensure constant active power output from the overall DFIG generation system. In order to provide precise control of the positive- and negative-sequence currents of the GSC and RSC, a current control scheme consisting of a proportional integral (PI) controller and a resonant (R) compensator is presented. The PI plus R current regulator is implemented in the positive synchronous reference frame without the need to decompose the positive- and negative-sequence components. Simulations on a 1.5-MW DFIG system and experimental tests on a 1.5-kW prototype validate the proposed strategy. Precise control of both positive- and negative-sequence currents and simultaneous elimination of torque and total active power oscillations have been achieved.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.2006952","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663711","Converter;doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs);proportional integral (PI) plus resonant (R; PI–R);voltage unbalance;wind energy","Control systems;Regulators;Voltage control;Torque control;Pi control;Proportional control;Induction generators;Rotors;Frequency;Stators","","366","","28","IEEE","31 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first part is the payload while the second part is the auxiliary information package for blind detection. To increase embedding capacity, we have to make the size of the second part as small as possible. Tian's classical DE method has a large auxiliary information package. Thodi mitigated the problem by using a payload-independent overflow location map. However, the compressibility of the overflow location map is still undesirable in some image types. In this paper, we focus on improving the overflow location map. We design a new embedding scheme that helps us construct an efficient payload-dependent overflow location map. Such an overflow location map has good compressibility. Our accurate capacity control capability also reduces unnecessary alteration to the image. Under the same image quality, the proposed algorithm often has larger embedding capacity. It performs well in different types of images, including those where other algorithms often have difficulty in acquiring good embedding capacity and high image quality.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2009252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4703233","Difference expansion embedding;location map;predicted error expansion;reversible data hiding;watermarking","Data encapsulation;Image coding;Image quality;Watermarking;Histograms;Prototypes;Payloads;Packaging;Computer science;Automation","","365","1","21","IEEE","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Flexible pad foam is commonly available in protective clothing and overcomes these constraints by providing a uniform, stable, and sufficient thickness. Moreover, its cellular structure and properties, such as flame retardance and water repellence, make it an excellent substrate material for the integration of antennas into protective garments. In this paper, we describe the design, manufacture, and performance of the first textile planar antenna to be implemented on flexible protective foam, suitable for firefighter garments. We employed shock absorbing foam with a thickness of 3.94 mm and achieved a nearly circularly polarized antenna with a bandwidth of more than 180 MHz even when the antenna was compressed or bent. These outstanding substrate and antenna characteristics result in an antenna that is highly appropriate for garment integration.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2009.2014574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4812194","Textile antenna;wearable textile system;wireless off-body communication","Protective clothing;Protection;Bandwidth;Intelligent systems;Fabrics;Textile industry;Fires;Water;Biological materials;Flexible manufacturing systems","","364","1","10","IEEE","7 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With technology scaling, only depending on the material innovation will extend the lifetime of conventional interconnect systems a few technology generations. According to International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) for the longer term, new interconnect paradigms are in need. The conventional two dimensional (2D) integrated circuit (IC) has limited floor-planning choices, and consequently it limits the performance enhancements arising out of NoC architectures. Three dimensional (3D) ICs are capable of achieving better performance, functionality, and packaging density compared to more traditional planar ICs. On the other hand, NoC is an enabling solution for integrating large numbers of embedded cores in a single die. 3D NoC architectures combine the benefits of these two new domains to offer an unprecedented performance gain.

Execution anomalies include both work flow errors and low performance problems. People often use system logs produced by distributed systems for troubleshooting and problem diagnosis. However, manually inspecting system logs to detect anomalies is unfeasible due to the increasing scale and complexity of distributed systems. Therefore, there is a great demand for automatic anomalies detection techniques based on log analysis. In this paper, we propose an unstructured log analysis technique for anomalies detection. In the technique, we propose a novel algorithm to convert free form text messages in log files to log keys without heavily relying on application specific knowledge. The log keys correspond to the log-print statements in the source code which can provide cues of system execution behavior. After converting log messages to log keys, we learn a Finite State Automaton (FSA) from training log sequences to present the normal work flow for each system component. At the same time, a performance measurement model is learned to characterize the normal execution performance based on the log messages' timing information. With these learned models, we can automatically detect anomalies in newly input log files. Experiments on Hadoop and SILK show that the technique can effectively detect running anomalies.","2374-8486","978-1-4244-5242-2","10.1109/ICDM.2009.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360240","log analysis;distributed system;problem diagnosis;finite state automaton","Large-scale systems;Learning automata;Measurement;Timing","","361","13","18","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, PCM cells can endure only a maximum of 107-108 writes, making a PCM based system have a lifetime of only a few years under ideal conditions. Furthermore, we show that non-uniformity in writes to different cells reduces the achievable lifetime of PCM system by 20×. Writes to PCM cells can be made uniform with Wear-Leveling. Unfortunately, existing wear-leveling techniques require large storage tables and indirection, resulting in significant area and latency overheads. We propose Start-Gap, a simple, novel, and effective wear-leveling technique that uses only two registers. By combining Start-Gap with simple address-space randomization techniques we show that the achievable lifetime of the baseline 16 GB PCM-based system is boosted from 5% (with no wear-leveling) to 97% of the theoretical maximum, while incurring a total storage overhead of less than 13 bytes and obviating the latency overhead of accessing large tables. We also analyze the security vulnerabilities for memory systems that have limited write endurance, showing that under adversarial settings, a PCM-based system can fail in less than one minute. We provide a simple extension to Start-Gap that makes PCM-based systems robust to such malicious attacks.","2379-3155","978-1-60558-798-1","10.1145/1669112.1669117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5375309","Phase Change Memory;Wear Leveling;Endurance","Security;Phase change materials;Random access memory;Phase change memory;Delay;Costs;Failure analysis;Robustness;Semiconductor memory;Semiconductor device reliability","","360","67","21","","8 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A sensing-throughput tradeoff problem under a cooperative sensing scenario is formulated to find a pair of sensing time and k value that maximize the secondary users' throughput subject to sufficient protection that is provided to the primary user.

However, due to parameter variations in scaled technologies, stable operation of SRAMs is critical for the success of low-voltage SRAMs. It has been shown that conventional 6T SRAMs fail to achieve reliable subthreshold operation. Hence, researchers have considered different configuration SRAMs for subthreshold operations having single-ended 8T or 10T bit-cells for improved stability. While these bit-cells improve SRAM stability in subthreshold region significantly, the single-ended sensing methods suffer from reduced bit-line swing due to bit-line leakage noise. In addition, efficient bit-interleaving in column may not be possible and hence, the multiple-bit soft errors can be a real issue. In this paper, we propose a differential 10T bit-cell that effectively separates read and write operations, thereby achieving high cell stability. The proposed bit-cell also provides efficient bit-interleaving structure to achieve soft-error tolerance with conventional Error Correcting Codes (ECC). For read access, we employ dynamic DCVSL scheme to compensate bitline leakage noise, thereby improving bitline swing. To verify the proposed techniques, a 32 kb array of the proposed 10T bit-cell is fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology. The hardware measurement results demonstrate that this bit-cell array successfully operates down to 160 mV. For leakage power comparison, we also fabricated 49 kb arrays of the 6T and the proposed 10T bit-cells. Measurement results show that the leakage power of the proposed bit-cell is close to that of the 6T (between 0.96x and 1.22x of 6T).","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2008.2011972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4768883","Low voltage SRAM design;robust subthreshold operation of SRAM;voltage scaling in SRAM","Random access memory;Stability;CMOS technology;Low voltage;Error correction codes;Hardware;Power supplies;Noise reduction;Semiconductor device noise;Power measurement","","359","10","14","IEEE","27 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that under the assumptions of continuity and monotonicity properties, the set of representable uninorm operators is characterized as the solution to this functional equation. Cardinal consistency with the conjunctive representable cross ratio uninorm is equivalent to Tanino's multiplicative transitivity property. Because any two representable uninorms are order isomorphic, we conclude that multiplicative transitivity is the most appropriate property for modeling cardinal consistency of reciprocal preference relations. Results toward the characterization of this uninorm consistency property based on a restricted set of (n-1) preference values, which can be used in practical cases to construct perfect consistent preference relations, are also presented.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.2008028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663688","Consistency;fuzzy preference relation;rationality;reciprocity;transitivity;uninorm","Equations;Mathematical model;Councils;Computational intelligence;Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Software engineering;Fuzzy set theory","","358","","57","IEEE","31 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Geographical forwarding is used to transfer packets between intersections on the path, reducing the path's sensitivity to individual node movements. For dense networks with high contention, we optimize the forwarding using a distributed receiver-based election of next hops based on a multicriterion prioritization function that takes nonuniform radio propagation into account. We designed and implemented a reactive protocol RBVT-R and a proactive protocol RBVT-P and compared them with protocols representative of mobile ad hoc networks and VANETs. Simulation results in urban settings show that RBVT-R performs best in terms of average delivery rate, with up to a 40% increase compared with some existing protocols.

In order to investigate, measure and model stochastic dependence, one should transform all different random variables to a common domain, the rank/uniform domain, by applying the cumulative distribution function transformation. In this domain, special functions, copulae, can be used for modeling dependence.

Most prior methods for scene recovery use active illumination scanners (structured and gated), which can be slow and cumbersome, while natural illumination is inapplicable to dark environments. The current paper addresses the need for a non-scanning recovery method, that uses active scene irradiance. We study the formation of images under widefield artificial illumination. Based on the formation model, the paper presents an approach for recovering the object signal. It also yields rough information about the 3D scene structure. The approach can work with compact, simple hardware, having active widefield, polychromatic polarized illumination. The camera is fitted with a polarization analyzer. Two frames of the scene are taken, with different states of the analyzer or polarizer. A recovery algorithm follows the acquisition. It allows both the backscatter and the object reflection to be partially polarized. It thus unifies and generalizes prior polarization-based methods, which had assumed exclusive polarization of either of these components. The approach is limited to an effective range, due to image noise and illumination falloff. Thus, the limits and noise sensitivity are analyzed.

Here a VB method for nonlinear forward models with Gaussian additive noise is presented. In the case of noninformative priors the parameter estimates obtained from this VB approach are identical to those found via nonlinear least squares. However, the advantage of the VB method lies in its Bayesian formulation, which permits prior information to be included in a hierarchical structure and measures of uncertainty for all parameter estimates to be obtained via the posterior distribution. Unlike other Bayesian methods VB is only approximate in comparison with the sampling method of MCMC. However, the VB method is found to be comparable and the assumptions made about the form of the posterior distribution reasonable. Practically, the VB approach is substantially faster than MCMC as fewer calculations are required. Some of the advantages of the fully Bayesian nature of the method are demonstrated through the extension of the noise model and the inclusion of automatic relevance determination (ARD) within the VB algorithm.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.2005752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625948","Biomedical signal processing;magnetic resonance imaging;nonlinear estimation;signal processing","Bayesian methods;Least squares approximation;Signal processing algorithms;Parameter estimation;Sampling methods;Inference algorithms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Councils;Context modeling;Additive noise","","350","3","34","IEEE","16 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main challenge for secondary radio systems is to be able to robustly sense when they are within such a spectrum hole. To allow a unified discussion of the core issues in spectrum sensing, the ldquoweighted probability of area recoveredrdquo (WPAR) metric is introduced to measure the performance of a sensing strategy; and the ldquofear of harmful interferencerdquo F HI metric is introduced to measure its safety. These metrics explicitly consider the impact of asymmetric uncertainties (and misaligned incentives) in the system model. Furthermore, they allow a meaningful comparison of diverse approaches to spectrum sensing unlike the traditional triad of sensitivity, probability of false-alarm P FA, and probability of missed-detection P MD. These new metrics are used to show that fading uncertainty forces the WPAR performance of single-radio sensing algorithms to be very low for small values of F HI, even for ideal detectors. Cooperative sensing algorithms enable a much higher WPAR, but only if users are guaranteed to experience independent fading. Lastly, in-the-field calibration for wide-band (but uncertain) environment variables (e.g., interference and shadowing) can robustly guarantee safety (low F HI) even in the face of potentially correlated users without sacrificing WPAR.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2015710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4895279","Assisted detection;cognitive radio;cooperation;dynamic spectrum;robust sensing metrics;spectrum holes;spectrum sensing","Robustness;Area measurement;Interference;Safety;Fading;Multidimensional systems;Frequency;Uncertainty;Detectors;Calibration","","349","8","90","IEEE","28 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this issue is well known as a nonlinear, multimodal and mixed-variable problem. In the last decades, computation intelligence-based techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), differential evolution (DE) algorithms and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, etc., have often been used for this aim. In this work, a seeker optimization algorithm (SOA)-based reactive power dispatch method is proposed. The SOA is based on the concept of simulating the act of human searching, where the search direction is based on the empirical gradient by evaluating the response to the position changes and the step length is based on uncertainty reasoning by using a simple Fuzzy rule. In this study, the algorithm's performance is evaluated on benchmark function optimization. Then, the SOA is applied to optimal reactive power dispatch on standard IEEE 57- and 118-bus power systems, and compared with conventional nonlinear programming method, two versions of GAs, three versions of DE algorithms and four versions of PSO algorithms.

Comparison of convergence characteristics of BF, GA, and classical approach reveals that the BF algorithm is quite faster in optimization, leading to reduction in computational burden and giving rise to minimal computer resource utilization. Simultaneous optimization of KIi, Ri, and Bi parameters which surprisingly has never been attempted in the past, provides not only best dynamic response for the system but also allows use of much higher values of Ri (than used in practice), that will appeal to the power industries for easier and cheaper realization of governor.

Motivated by this observation, we propose a hierarchical random field model, that allows integration of features computed at different levels of the quantisation hierarchy. MAP inference in this model can be performed efficiently using powerful graph cut based move making algorithms. Our framework generalises much of the previous work based on pixels or segments.

This method is based on maximizing compatibility of the MS to access points (AP) distance estimates. Once the propagation models are estimated in real time, it is possible to accurately determine the distance between the MS and each AP. By means of these distance estimates, the location of the MS can be obtained by trilateration.

The proposed methodology examines the interdependency of electricity and natural gas in a highly complex transmission system. The natural gas transmission system is modeled as a set of nonlinear equations. The proposed solution applies a decomposition method to separate the natural gas transmission feasibility check subproblem and the power transmission feasibility check subproblem from the hourly unit commitment (UC) in the master problem. Gas contracts are modeled and incorporated in the master UC problem. The natural gas transmission subproblem checks the feasibility of natural gas transmission as well as natural gas transmission security constraints for the commitment and dispatch of gas-fired generating units. If any natural gas transmission violations arise, corresponding energy constraints will be formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC. The iterative process will continue until a converged feasible gas transmission solution is found. A six-bus power system with seven-node gas transmission system and the IEEE 118-bus power system with 14-node gas transmission system are analyzed to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Lately various measurement studies of human walk traces have discovered several significant statistical patterns of human mobility. Namely these include truncated power-law distributions of flights, pause-times and inter-contact times, fractal way-points, and heterogeneously defined areas of individual mobility. Unfortunately, none of existing mobility models effectively captures all of these features. This paper presents a new mobility model called SLAW (self-similar least action walk) that can produce synthetic walk traces containing all these features. This is by far the first such model. Our performance study using using SLAW generated traces indicates that SLAW is effective in representing social contexts present among people sharing common interests or those in a single community such as university campus, companies and theme parks. The social contexts are typically common gathering places where most people visit during their daily lives such as student unions, dormitory, street malls and restaurants. SLAW expresses the mobility patterns involving these contexts by fractal way points and heavy-tail flights on top of the way points. We verify through simulation that SLAW brings out the unique performance features of various mobile network routing protocols.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061995","","Humans;Fractals;Size control;Global Positioning System;Disruption tolerant networking;Delay;Communications Society;Anthropometry;Routing protocols;Probability distribution","","345","","37","IEEE","2 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With power now the first-order design constraint, early-stage estimation of NoC power has become crucially important. ORION was amongst the first NoC power models released, and has since been fairly widely used for early-stage power estimation of NoCs. However, when validated against recent NoC prototypes - the Intel 80-core Teraflops chip and the Intel scalable communications core (SCC) chip - we saw significant deviation that can lead to erroneous NoC design choices. This prompted our development of ORION 2.0, an extensive enhancement of the original ORION models which includes completely new subcomponent power models, area models, as well as improved and updated technology models. Validation against the two Intel chips confirms a substantial improvement in accuracy over the original ORION. A case study with these power models plugged within the COSI-OCC NoC design space exploration tool confirms the need for, and value of, accurate early-stage NoC power estimation.

For such applications, a rotary series elastic actuator (RSEA) has been introduced recently. This paper presents the design of RSEA and the associated control algorithms. To generate joint torque as desired, a torsional spring is installed between a motor and a human joint, and the motor is controlled to produce a proper spring deflection for torque generation. When the desired torque is zero, the motor must follow the human joint motion, which requires that the friction and the inertia of the motor be compensated. The human joint and the body part impose the load on the RSEA. They interact with uncertain environments and their physical properties vary with time. In this paper, the disturbance observer (DOB) method is applied to make the RSEA precisely generate the desired torque under such time-varying conditions. Based on the nominal model preserved by the DOB, feedback and feedforward controllers are optimally designed for the desired performance, i.e., the RSEA: (1) exhibits very low impedance and (2) generates the desired torque precisely while interacting with a human. The effectiveness of the proposed design is verified by experiments.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2008.2004561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4783213","Disturbance observer (DOB);force-mode control;human–robot interaction;motor impedance;rotary series elastic actuator (RSEA)","Force control;Pneumatic actuators;Joints;Impedance;Springs;Torque control;Human robot interaction;Algorithm design and analysis;Friction;Biological system modeling","","344","6","29","IEEE","13 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Location of data and processes makes the difference in the realm of computation. On one hand, an individual has full control on data and processes in his/her computer. On the other hand, we have the cloud computing wherein, the service and data maintenance is provided by some vendor which leaves the client/customer unaware of where the processes are running or where the data is stored. So, logically speaking, the client has no control over it. The cloud computing uses the internet as the communication media. When we look at the security of data in the cloud computing, the vendor has to provide some assurance in service level agreements (SLA) to convince the customer on security issues. Organizations use cloud computing as a service infrastructure, critically like to examine the security and confidentiality issues for their business critical insensitive applications. Yet, guaranteeing the security of corporate data in the ""cloud"" is difficult, if not impossible, as they provide different services like Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Each service has their own security issues. So the SLA has to describe different levels of security and their complexity based on the services to make the customer understand the security policies that are being implemented. There has to be a standardized way to prepare the SLA irrespective to the providers. This can help some of the enterprises to look forward in using the cloud services. In this paper, we put forward some security issues that have to be included in SLA.","","978-1-4244-5183-8","10.1109/SCC.2009.84","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283911","Cloud Computing;Service Level Agreement (SLA);Software as a Service (SaaS);Cloud computing Security","Marketing and sales;Application software;Costs;Automation;Computer architecture;Usability;Subscriptions;Data security;Cloud computing;Conference management","","342","16","8","IEEE","13 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PHEVs have a battery pack of high energy density and can run solely on electric power for a given range. The battery pack can be recharged by a neighborhood outlet. In this paper, a novel integrated bidirectional AC/DC charger and DC/DC converter (henceforth, the integrated converter) for PHEVs and hybrid/plug-in-hybrid conversions is proposed. The integrated converter is able to function as an AC/DC battery charger and to transfer electrical energy between the battery pack and the high-voltage bus of the electric traction system.

Employing CF electrical and thermal parameters, which were previously characterized on our NiO-based samples, our calculations are shown to match experimental reset and retention characteristics. Simulations show that reset transition is self-accelerated as a consequence of a positive feedback between the thermal dissolution of the CF and local Joule heating in the CF bottleneck, which can account for the abrupt resistance transition in experimental data. Finally, the model is used to investigate the reduction of the reset current, which is needed for device application.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2008.2010584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4757224","Electrothermal modeling;nonvolatile memories;resistive-switching memory (RRAM)","Resistance;Thermal resistance;Electrodes;Temperature dependence;Conductivity;Programming;Joule","","340","57","26","IEEE","23 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the switching state which minimizes a given cost function is selected and applied during the next sampling time. The second control scheme uses a modulator to apply two configurations of the inverter legs during a computation period. Among these configurations, one leads to null voltages. The duration of the other configuration is calculated in order to minimize the distance between the obtained state vector and the desired one. The third control scheme uses a model of the PMSM in order to predict the stator voltages which allows us to reach the desired currents after one modulation period. An algebraic method is presented to compute the duty cycle of each leg of the inverter in a direct manner. These control schemes are detailed and tested using the same switching frequency on the same test bench (1.6-kW PMSM drive).

In this paper, the ability of the supersonic shear imaging (SSI) technique to generate planar shear waves propagating in tissues is fully exploited. First, by strongly limiting shear wave diffraction in the imaging plane, this imaging technique enables to discriminate between the usually concomitant influences of both medium rheological properties and diffraction affecting the shear wave dispersion. Second, transient propagation of these plane shear waves in soft tissues can be measured using echographic images acquired at very high frame. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that dispersion curves, which characterize the rheological behavior of tissues by measuring the frequency dependence of shear wave speed and attenuation, can be recovered in the 75-600 Hz frequency range. Based on a phase difference algorithm, the dispersion curves are computed in 1 cm2 regions of interest from the acquired propagation movie. In vivo measurements in biceps brachii muscle and liver of three healthy volunteers show important differences in the rheological behavior of these different tissues. Liver tissue appears to be much more dispersive with a phase velocity ranging from ~ 1.5 m/s at 75 Hz to ~ 3 m/s at 500 Hz whereas muscle tissue shows an important anisotropy, shear waves propagating longitudinally to the muscular fibers are almost nondispersive while those propagating transversally are very dispersive with a shear wave speed ranging from 0.5 to 2 m/s between 75 and 500 Hz. The estimation of dispersion curves is local and can be performed separately in different regions of the organ. This signal processing approach based on the SSI modality introduces the new concept of In vivo shear wave spectroscopy (SWS) that could become an additional tool for tissue characterization. This paper demonstrates the in vivo ability of this SWS to quantify both local shear elasticity and dispersion in real time.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2008.925077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4520150","Dispersion;elastography;liver;muscle;rheology;shear wave spectroscopy (SWS);supersonic shear imaging (SSI);Dispersion;Elastography;Liver;Muscle;Rheology;Shear Wave Spectroscopy;Supersonic Shear Imaging","Spectroscopy;In vivo;Rheology;Dispersion;Biological tissues;Diffraction;Attenuation measurement;Frequency measurement;Velocity measurement;Muscles","Algorithms;Elasticity;Elasticity Imaging Techniques;Humans;Liver;Models, Biological;Muscle, Skeletal;Phantoms, Imaging;Rheology;Spectrum Analysis","339","12","38","IEEE","16 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, Gradientfaces is derived from the image gradient domain such that it can discover underlying inherent structure of face images since the gradient domain explicitly considers the relationships between neighboring pixel points. Therefore, Gradientfaces has more discriminating power than the illumination insensitive measure extracted from the pixel domain. Recognition rates of 99.83% achieved on PIE database of 68 subjects, 98.96% achieved on Yale B of ten subjects, and 95.61% achieved on Outdoor database of 132 subjects under uncontrolled natural lighting conditions show that Gradientfaces is an effective method for face recognition under varying illumination.

Several examples are given, with some emphasis on a 24-level format and an 8-level format, including descriptions of how they can be realized and expressions for their symbol and bit error probabilities. These formats are, respectively, an extension and a subset of the commonly used 16-level dual-polarization QPSK format.

Therefore, many fall detection systems have been developed. However, prevalent methods only use accelerometers to isolate falls from activities of daily living (ADL). This makes it difficult to distinguish real falls from certain fall-like activities such as sitting down quickly and jumping, resulting in many false positives. Body orientation is also used as a means of detecting falls, but it is not very useful when the ending position is not horizontal, e.g. falls happen on stairs. In this paper we present a novel fall detection system using both accelerometers and gyroscopes. We divide human activities into two categories: static postures and dynamic transitions. By using two tri-axial accelerometers at separate body locations, our system can recognize four kinds of static postures: standing, bending, sitting, and lying. Motions between these static postures are considered as dynamic transitions. Linear acceleration and angular velocity are measured to determine whether motion transitions are intentional. If the transition before a lying posture is not intentional, a fall event is detected. Our algorithm, coupled with accelerometers and gyroscopes, reduces both false positives and false negatives, while improving fall detection accuracy. In addition, our solution features low computational cost and real-time response.","2376-8894","978-0-7695-3644-6","10.1109/BSN.2009.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226903","","Gyroscopes;Accelerometers;Aging;Humans;Acceleration;Angular velocity;Motion measurement;Velocity measurement;Event detection;Computational efficiency","","338","14","14","IEEE","28 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm is easily distributed through measurement and limited message passing with the use of a spectrum management center. We outline how overhead can be managed, and show that in the limit of zero message-passing, performance reduces to IWF.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2009.2023751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5165179","Digital subscriber line;dynamic spectrum management;interference channel;iterative water-filling;successive convex optimization","Protocols;DSL;Crosstalk;Iterative algorithms;Radio spectrum management;Copper;Bandwidth;Optical fiber networks;Optical fiber cables;Aging","","337","2","21","IEEE","14 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A two-level Stackelberg game is employed to jointly consider the benefits of the source node and the relay nodes in which the source node is modeled as a buyer and the relay nodes are modeled as sellers, respectively. The proposed approach not only helps the source find the relays at relatively better locations and ""buy” an optimal amount of power from the relays, but also helps the competing relays maximize their own utilities by asking the optimal prices. The game is proved to converge to a unique optimal equilibrium. Moreover, the proposed resource allocation scheme with the distributed game can achieve comparable performance to that employing centralized schemes.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2008.153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4657359","Cooperative communication networks;relay selection;distributed power allocation;game theory.;Mobile Computing;Algorithm/protocol design and analysis;Mobile communication systems;Performance of Systems","Relays;Power control;Communication networks;Power system relaying;Resource management;Wireless networks;Channel state information;Game theory;Broadcasting;Error analysis","","335","1","28","IEEE","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A comprehensive conductance and delay analysis of GNR interconnects is presented in this paper. Using a simple tight-binding model and the linear response Landauer formula, the conductance model of GNR is derived. Several GNR structures are examined, and the conductance among them and other interconnect materials [e.g., copper (Cu), tungsten (W), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)] is compared. The impact of different model parameters (i.e., bandgap, mean free path, Fermi level, and edge specularity) on the conductance is discussed. Both global and local GNR interconnect delays are analyzed using an RLC equivalent circuit model. Intercalation doping for multilayer GNRs is proposed, and it is shown that in order to match (or better) the performance of Cu or CNT bundles at either the global or local level, multiple zigzag-edged GNR layers along with proper intercalation doping must be used and near-specular nanoribbon edge should be achieved. However, intercalation-doped multilayer zigzag GNRs can have better performance than that of W, implying possible application as local interconnects in some cases. Thus, this paper identifies the on-chip interconnect domains where GNRs can be employed and provides valuable insights into the process technology development for GNR interconnects.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2009.2024254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5165081","Armchair graphene nanoribbon (ac-GNR);carbon nanotube (CNT);conductance;delay modeling;graphene nanoribbon (GNR);intercalation doping;specularity;very large scale integration (VLSI) interconnects;zigzag GNR (zz-GNR)","Copper;Nonhomogeneous media;Integrated circuit interconnections;Scattering;Substrates;Doping;Fabrication","","333","5","54","IEEE","14 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cognitive radio was proposed to promote the spectrum utilization by opportunistically exploiting the existence of spectrum ""holes."" Meanwhile, cooperative relay technology is regarded widely as a key technology for increasing transmission diversity gain in various types of wireless networks, including cognitive radio networks. In this article, we first give a brief overview of the envisioned applications of: cooperative relay technology to CRNs, cooperative transmission of primary traffic by secondary users, cooperative transmission between secondary nodes to improve spatial diversity, and cooperative relay between secondary nodes to improve spectrum diversity. As the latter is a new direction, in this article we focus on this scenario and investigate a simple wireless network, where a spectrum-rich node is selected as the relay node to improve the performance between the source and the destination. With the introduction of cooperative relay, many unique problems should be considered, especially the issue for relay selection and spectrum allocation. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of cooperative relay for cognitive radio, a new MAC protocol was proposed and implemented in a universal software radio peripheral-based testbed. Experimental results show that the throughput of the whole system is greatly increased by exploiting the benefit of cooperative relay.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2009.4785388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4785388","","Relays;Cognitive radio;Telecommunication traffic;Radio transmitters;Throughput;Frequency diversity;Wireless networks;Availability;System performance;OFDM","","333","","10","IEEE","18 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

But it frequently encounters several difficulties, such as insufficiency of training data and the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a method named optimized multigraph-based semi-supervised learning (OMG-SSL), which aims to simultaneously tackle these difficulties in a unified scheme. We show that various crucial factors in video annotation, including multiple modalities, multiple distance functions, and temporal consistency, all correspond to different relationships among video units, and hence they can be represented by different graphs. Therefore, these factors can be simultaneously dealt with by learning with multiple graphs, namely, the proposed OMG-SSL approach. Different from the existing graph-based semi-supervised learning methods that only utilize one graph, OMG-SSL integrates multiple graphs into a regularization framework in order to sufficiently explore their complementation. We show that this scheme is equivalent to first fusing multiple graphs and then conducting semi-supervised learning on the fused graph. Through an optimization approach, it is able to assign suitable weights to the graphs. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be implemented through a computationally efficient iterative process. Extensive experiments on the TREC video retrieval evaluation (TRECVID) benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2017400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4801611","Multimodal fusion;semi-supervised learning;video annotation","Semisupervised learning;Video compression;Feature extraction;NIST;Costs;Training data;Optimization methods;Iterative methods;Large-scale systems;Asia","","332","","53","IEEE","16 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We gain robustness to clutter by modeling the global room space with a parameteric 3D “box” and by iteratively localizing clutter and refitting the box. To fit the box, we introduce a structured learning algorithm that chooses the set of parameters to minimize error, based on global perspective cues.

A key challenge is to find a route that can provide good delivery performance and low end-to-end delay in a disconnected network graph where nodes may move freely. We cast this challenge as an information flow problem in a social network. This paper presents social network analysis metrics that may be used to support a novel and practical forwarding solution to provide efficient message delivery in disconnected delay-tolerant MANETs. These metrics are based on social analysis of a node's past interactions and consists of three locally evaluated components: a node's ""betweenness"" centrality (calculated using ego networks) and a node's social 'similarity' to the destination node and a node's tie strength relationship with the destination node. We present simulations using three real trace data sets to demonstrate that by combining these metrics delivery performance may be achieved close to epidemic routing but with significantly reduced overhead. Additionally, we show improved performance when compared to PRoPHET routing.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2008.161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674358","Store and forward networks;Wireless communication;Store and forward networks;Wireless communication","Social network services;Information analysis;Mobile ad hoc networks;Delay estimation;Ad hoc networks;Disruption tolerant networking;Routing protocols;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","","331","","54","IEEE","17 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The measured channel characteristics, in particular the nonstationarity of the channel statistics, motivate the use of a geometry-based stochastic channel model (GSCM) instead of the classical tapped-delay line model. We introduce generalizations of the generic GSCM approach and techniques for parameterizing it from measurements and find it suitable to distinguish between diffuse and discrete scattering contributions. The time-variant contribution from discrete scatterers is tracked over time and delay using a high resolution algorithm, and our observations motivate their power being modeled as a combination of a (deterministic) distance decay and a slowly varying stochastic process. The paper gives a full parameterization of the channel model and supplies an implementation recipe for simulations.

Since the existing surveys on wind turbine condition monitoring cover the literatures up to 2006, this review aims to report the most recent advances in the past three years, with primary focus on gearbox and bearing, rotor and blades, generator and power electronics, as well as system-wise turbine diagnosis. There are several major trends observed through the survey. Due to the variable-speed nature of wind turbine operation and the unsteady load involved, time-frequency analysis tools such as wavelets have been accepted as a key signal processing tool for such application. Acoustic emission has lately gained much more attention in order to detect incipient failures because of the low-speed operation for wind turbines. There has been an increasing trend of developing model based reasoning algorithms for fault detection and isolation as cost-effective approach for wind turbines as relatively complicated system. The impact of unsteady aerodynamic load on the robustness of diagnostic signatures has been notified. Decoupling the wind load from condition monitoring decision making will reduce the associated down-time cost.","","978-1-4244-4936-1","10.1109/PEMWA.2009.5208325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5208325","Wind turbine;condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;gearbox;bearing;generator;power electronics;rotor;blade;pitch control","Wind turbines;Condition monitoring;Fault diagnosis;Signal processing algorithms;Rotors;Blades;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Power electronics;Time frequency analysis","","328","7","49","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wireless signal transmission is also crucial to remotely control instruments in ocean observatories and to enable coordination of swarms of autonomous underwater vehicles and robots, which will play the role of mobile nodes in future ocean observation networks by virtue of their flexibility and reconfigurability. To make underwater applications viable, efficient communication protocols among underwater devices, which are based on acoustic wireless technology for distances over one hundred meters, must be enabled because of the high attenuation and scattering that affect radio and optical waves, respectively. The unique characteristics of an underwater acoustic channel - such as very limited and distance-dependent bandwidth, high propagation delays, and time-varying multipath and fading - require new, efficient and reliable communication protocols to network multiple devices, either static or mobile, potentially over multiple hops. In this article, we provide an overview of recent medium access control, routing, transport, and cross-layer networking protocols.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2009.4752684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752684","","Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Oceans;Mobile communication;Underwater communication;Underwater acoustics;Optical attenuators;Optical scattering;Access protocols;Safety","","328","2","14","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is assumed that every node in the network has its own power constraint. A two-step amplify-and-forward protocol is used, in which the transmitter and relays not only use match filters to form a beam at the receiver but also adaptively adjust their transmit powers according to the channel strength information. For networks with no direct link, an algorithm is proposed to analytically find the exact solution with linear (in network size) complexity. It is shown that the transmitter should always use its maximal power while the optimal power of a relay ca.n take any value between zero and its maxima. Also, this value depends on the quality of all other channels in addition to the relay's own. Despite this coupling fact, distributive strategies are proposed in which, with the aid of a low-rate receiver broadcast, a relay needs only its own channel information to implement the optimal power control. Then, beamforming in networks with a direct link is considered. When the direct link exists during the first step only, the optimal power control is the same as that of networks with no direct link. For networks with a direct link during the second step only and both steps, recursive numerical algorithms are proposed. Simulation shows that network beamforming achieves the maximal diversity order and outperforms other existing schemes.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2009.2018175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4957661","Relay networks;beamforming;power control;capacity;outage probability;error rate","Array signal processing;Relays;Transmitters;Power control;Protocols;Adaptive filters;Information filtering;Information filters;Matched filters;Algorithm design and analysis","","327","","62","IEEE","19 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By changing the orientations of the CSRRs, which are incorporated in the waveguide surface and can be interpreted in terms of electric dipoles, varied passband characteristics are observed. A detailed explanation for the generation and variations of the passbands has been illuminated. The application of this waveguide and CSRR combination technique to the design of miniaturized waveguide bandpass filters characterized by transmission zeros is then illustrated. Filter design methodology is examined. These proposed filters exhibit high selectivity and compact size due to the employment of the subwavelength resonators and an evanescent-wave transmission. By slightly altering the configuration of the CSRRs, we find that the propagation of the TE10 mode can be suppressed and filters with improved selectivity and stopband rejection can be obtained. To verify the presented concept, three different types of filters are fabricated based on the standard printed circuit board process.

A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to adjust the network's weights in the training phase of the ANNs. The advantage of using a PSO algorithm over other conventional training algorithms such as the back-propagation (BP) is that potential solutions will be flown through the problem hyperspace with accelerated movement towards the best solution. Thus the training phase should result in obtaining the weights configuration associated with the minimum output error. Data are wavelet transformed during the preprocessing stage and then inserted into the neural network to extract redundant information from the load curve. This results in better load characterization which creates a more reliable forecasting model. The transformed data of historical load and weather information were trained and tested over various periods of time.

This limits their usability for many practical problems, for instance, when training data arrives sequentially or the underlying distribution is continuously changing. In this paper, we propose a novel on-line random forest algorithm. We combine ideas from on-line bagging, extremely randomized forests and propose an on-line decision tree growing procedure. Additionally, we add a temporal weighting scheme for adaptively discarding some trees based on their out-of-bag-error in given time intervals and consequently growing of new trees. The experiments on common machine learning data sets show that our algorithm converges to the performance of the off-line RF. Additionally, we conduct experiments for visual tracking, where we demonstrate real-time state-of-the-art performance on well-known scenarios and show good performance in case of occlusions and appearance changes where we outperform trackers based on on-line boosting.

All of these algorithms have been designed intuitively and pragmatically, i.e., on the basis of the experience and knowledge of experts for their own purposes. Therefore, it will be more informative to provide a systematic framework for understanding the common properties and intrinsic difference in different algorithms. In this paper, we propose such a framework, named ""patch alignment,” which consists of two stages: part optimization and whole alignment. The framework reveals that 1) algorithms are intrinsically different in the patch optimization stage and 2) all algorithms share an almost identical whole alignment stage. As an application of this framework, we develop a new dimensionality reduction algorithm, termed Discriminative Locality Alignment (DLA), by imposing discriminative information in the part optimization stage. DLA can 1) attack the distribution nonlinearity of measurements; 2) preserve the discriminative ability; and 3) avoid the small-sample-size problem. Thorough empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of DLA compared with representative dimensionality reduction algorithms.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4653494","Dimensionality reduction;spectral analysis;patch alignment;discriminative locality alignment.;Dimensionality reduction;Patch alignment","Principal component analysis;Linear discriminant analysis;Spectral analysis;Clustering algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Level measurement;Data mining;Computer vision;Application software;Laplace equations","","321","","40","IEEE","17 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main goal of the design is to combine the ability to scan over a relatively large range (25times25 mum) with high scanning speed. Consequently, the stage is designed to have its first dominant mode at 2.7 kHz. Cross-coupling between the two axes is kept to -35 dB, low enough to utilize single-input--single-output control strategies for tracking. Finite-element analysis (FEA) is used during the design process to analyze the mechanical resonance frequencies, travel range, and cross-coupling between the X- and Y-axes of the stage. Nonlinearities such as hysteresis are present in such stages. These effects, which exist due to the use of piezoelectric stacks for actuation, are minimized using charge actuation. The integral resonant control method is applied in conjunction with feedforward inversion technique to achieve high-speed and accurate scanning performances, up to 400 Hz.","1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2008.2005829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4630755","Feedforward inversion;integral resonant control (IRC);mechanical design;nanopositioning stage","Resonance;Nanopositioning;Resonant frequency;Bandwidth;Control systems;Scanning probe microscopy;Australia Council;Nanobioscience;Piezoelectric actuators;Finite element methods","","321","2","41","IEEE","23 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By employing (double) compound parallelogram flexures and a compact displacement amplifier, a class of novel XY TDPS with simple and symmetric structures are enumerated, and one example is chosen for further analysis. The kinematic and dynamic modeling of the manipulator are conducted by resorting to compliance and stiffness analysis based on the matrix method, which are validated by finite-element analysis (FEA). In view of predefined performance constraints, the dimension optimization is carried out by means of particle swarm optimization, and a prototype of the optimized stage is fabricated for performance tests.

Using 3D heterogeneous integrations, it becomes feasible and cost-efficient to stack MRAM atop conventional chip multiprocessors (CMPs). However, one disadvantage of MRAM is its long write latency and its high write energy. In this paper, we first stack MRAM-based L2 caches directly atop CMPs and compare it against SRAM counterparts in terms of performance and energy. We observe that the direct MRAM stacking might harm the chip performance due to the aforementioned long write latency and high write energy. To solve this problem, we then propose two architectural techniques: read-preemptive write buffer and SRAM-MRAM hybrid L2 cache. The simulation result shows that our optimized MRAM L2 cache improves performance by 4.91% and reduces power by 73.5%compared to the conventional SRAM L2 cache with the similar area.","2378-203X","978-1-4244-2932-5","10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4798259","","Random access memory;Stacking;Delay;Magnetic cores;Magnetic tunneling;Sun;Computational modeling;Fabrication;Degradation;Clocks","","321","7","27","IEEE","6 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Very few minority class instances cannot provide sufficient information and result in performance degrading greatly. As a good way to improve the classification performance of weak learner, some ensemble-based algorithms have been proposed to solve class imbalance problem. However, it is still not clear that how diversity affects classification performance especially on minority classes, since diversity is one influential factor of ensemble. This paper explores the impact of diversity on each class and overall performance. As the other influential factor, accuracy is also discussed because of the trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Firstly, three popular re-sampling methods are combined into our ensemble model and evaluated for diversity analysis, which includes under-sampling, over-sampling, and SMOTE - a data generation algorithm. Secondly, we experiment not only on two-class tasks, but also those with multiple classes.

Second, we examine the statistical properties of traffic flow volume time series. We show that the fluctuations of traffic flow are Gaussian type and that principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to retrieve the features of traffic flow. Third, we discuss how to use a robust PCA to filter out the abnormal traffic flow data that disturb the imputation process. Finally, we recall the theories of PPCA/Bayesian PCA-based imputation algorithms and compare their performance with some conventional methods, including the nearest/mean historical imputation methods and the local interpolation/regression methods.

Targeting a working bandwidth of 1.5-2.5 GHz an initial power amplifier (PA) design was based on basic class-J theory and computer-aided design simulation. This realized a 50% bandwidth with measured drain efficiency of 60%-70%. A second PA design iteration has realized near-rated output power of 39 dBm and improved efficiency beyond the original 2.5 GHz target, hence extending efficient PA operation across a bandwidth of 1.4-2.6 GHz, centered at 2 GHz. This second iteration made extensive use of active harmonic load-pull and waveform measurements, and incorporated a novel design methodology for achieving predistortable linearity.

Fringing fields associated with voltage control required to implement the 2pi resets have limited the efficiency and steering angle of this beam steering approach. Because of steering angle limitations, this conventional liquid crystal steering approach is usually combined with a large angle step-steering approach. Volume holograms, birefringent prisms or sawtooth-profile birefringent phase gratings, and circular-type polarization gratings are the large angle step steering approaches that will be reviewed in this paper. Alternate steering approaches to the combined liquid crystal and step-steering approach exist. Microelectromechanical system mirrors, lenslet arrays, electrowetting, and a variable birefringent grating approach will be reviewed and compared against the conventional liquid crystal and step-steering approaches.

Specifically, the parameters of the DNNs are subject to the switching from one to another at different times according to a Markov chain, and the mixed time delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays that are dependent on the Markovian jumping mode. We first deal with the stability analysis problem of the addressed neural networks. A special inequality is developed to account for the mixed time delays in the discrete-time setting, and a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is put forward to reflect the mode-dependent time delays. Sufficient conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that guarantee the stochastic stability. We then turn to the synchronization problem among an array of identical coupled Markovian jumping neural networks with mixed mode-dependent time delays. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed synchronization problem is solvable if several LMIs are feasible. Hence, different from the commonly used matrix norm theories (such as the  $M$-matrix method), a unified LMI approach is developed to solve the stability analysis and synchronization problems of the class of neural networks under investigation, where the LMIs can be easily solved by using the available Matlab LMI toolbox. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the main results obtained.

In the usual series-connected wiring scheme, the residual energy generated by partially shaded cells either cannot be collected (if diode bypassed) or, worse, impedes collection of power from the remaining fully illuminated cells (if not bypassed). Rapid fluctuation of the shading pattern makes maximum power point (MPP) tracking difficult; generally, there will exist multiple local MPPs, and their values will change as rapidly as does the illumination. In this paper, a portable solar PV system that effectively eliminates both of the aforementioned problems is described and proven. This system is capable of simultaneously maximizing the power generated by every PV cell in the PV panel. The proposed configuration consists of an array of parallel-connected PV cells, a low-input-voltage step-up power converter, and a simple wide bandwidth MPP tracker. Parallel-configured PV systems are compared to traditional series-configured PV systems through both hardware experiments and computer simulations in this paper. Study results demonstrate that, under complex irradiance conditions, the power generated by the new configuration is approximately twice that of the traditional configuration. The solar PV system can be widely used in many consumer applications, such as PV vests for cell phones and music players.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.2011296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4738341","Complex illumination;maximum power point tracking (MPPT);partial shading;photovoltaic (PV) solar cell;power converter;solar array","Solar power generation;Power generation;Fluctuations;Photovoltaic systems;Wiring;Diodes;Impedance;Lighting;Bandwidth;Hardware","","315","99","33","IEEE","6 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges which have not been well understood. In this article, we focus on cloud data storage security, which has always been an important aspect of quality of service. To ensure the correctness of users' data in the cloud, we propose an effective and flexible distributed scheme with two salient features, opposing to its predecessors. By utilizing the homomorphic token with distributed verification of erasure-coded data, our scheme achieves the integration of storage correctness insurance and data error localization, i.e., the identification of misbehaving server (s). Unlike most prior works, the new scheme further supports secure and efficient dynamic operations on data blocks, including: data update, delete and append. Extensive security and performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is highly efficient and resilient against Byzantine failure, malicious data modification attack, and even server colluding attacks.","1548-615X","978-1-4244-3876-1","10.1109/IWQoS.2009.5201385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5201385","","Memory;Data security;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Personnel;Application software;Databases;Quality of service;Insurance;Error correction","","314","9","17","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method, called BoneXpert, reconstructs, from radiographs of the hand, the borders of 15 bones automatically and then computes ldquointrinsicrdquo bone ages for each of 13 bones (radius, ulna, and 11 short bones). Finally, it transforms the intrinsic bone ages into Greulich Pyle (GP) or Tanner Whitehouse (TW) bone age. The bone reconstruction method automatically rejects images with abnormal bone morphology or very poor image quality. From the methodological point of view, BoneXpert contains the following innovations: 1) a generative model (active appearance model) for the bone reconstruction; 2) the prediction of bone age from shape, intensity, and texture scores derived from principal component analysis; 3) the consensus bone age concept that defines bone age of each bone as the best estimate of the bone age of the other bones in the hand; 4) a common bone age model for males and females; and 5) the unified modelling of TW and GP bone age. BoneXpert is developed on 1559 images. It is validated on the Greulich Pyle atlas in the age range 2-17 years yielding an SD of 0.42 years [0.37; 0.47] 95% conf, and on 84 clinical TW-rated images yielding an SD of 0.80 years [0.68; 0.93] 95% conf. The precision of the GP bone age determination (its ability to yield the same result on a repeated radiograph) is inferred under suitable assumptions from six longitudinal series of radiographs.

This unified framework classifies most commonly used design objectives such as the minimal mean-square error and the maximal mutual information into two categories: Schur-concave and Schur-convex functions. We prove that for Schur-concave objective functions, the optimal source precoding matrix and relay amplifying matrix jointly diagonalize the source–relay–destination channel matrix and convert the multicarrier MIMO relay channel into parallel single-input single-output (SISO) relay channels. While for Schur-convex objectives, such joint diagonalization occurs after a specific rotation of the source precoding matrix. After the optimal structure of the source and relay matrices is determined, the linear nonregenerative relay design problem boils down to the issue of power loading among the resulting SISO relay channels. We show that this power loading problem can be efficiently solved by an alternating technique. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

We consider the probability of successful transmission in an interference-limited channel when fading is modeled as Rayleigh. We provide a numerically integrable expression for the outage probability and closed-form upper and lower bounds. We show that when the transmitter-receiver distance is large, the success probability is greater than that of a Poisson arrangement. These results characterize the performance of the system under geographical or MAC-induced clustering. We obtain the maximum intensity of transmitting nodes for a given outage constraint, i.e., the transmission capacity (of this spatial arrangement) and show that it is equal to that of a Poisson arrangement of nodes.

For such antennas, the effectiveness of passive matching is severely limited by gain-bandwidth theory, which predicts narrow bandwidths and/or poor gain. With receivers, the inability to resolve this impedance mismatch results in poor signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, as compared to using a full-size antenna. With transmitters, the consequence is poor power efficiency. However, in many applications full-size antennas are impractical, and a means is required to effectively match their electrically-small counterparts. This paper presents the technique of non-Foster impedance matching, which employs active networks of negative inductors and capacitors to bypass the restrictions of gain-bandwidth theory. We first review the origins and development of non-Foster impedance matching, and then present experimental results for the non-Foster impedance matching of electrically-small dipoles and monopoles. For receivers, our best measurements on the antenna range demonstrate up to 20 dB improvement in S/N over 20-120 MHz; for transmitters, we show a power efficiency improvement which exceeds a factor of two over an 5% bandwidth about 20 MHz with an average signal power of 1 W to the radiation resistance.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2009.2024494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5067360","Active antennas;electrically small antennas;impedance matching;negative resistance circuits","Impedance matching;Bandwidth;Receiving antennas;Transmitters;Antenna theory;Signal resolution;Active inductors;Capacitors;Antenna measurements;Electrical resistance measurement","","312","20","38","IEEE","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Research has shown that homogeneous ad hoc networks have poor performance and scalability. The many-to-one traffic pattern dominates in sensor networks, and hence a sensor may only communicate with a small portion of its neighbors. Key management is a fundamental security operation. Most existing key management schemes try to establish shared keys for all pairs of neighbor sensors, no matter whether these nodes communicate with each other or not, and this causes large overhead. In this paper, we adopt a Heterogeneous Sensor Network (HSN) model for better performance and security. We propose a novel routing-driven key management scheme, which only establishes shared keys for neighbor sensors that communicate with each other. We utilize Elliptic Curve Cryptography in the design of an efficient key management scheme for sensor nodes.

"Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Hyperspectral Unmixing","S. Jia; Y.

During the last few years, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), as a suitable candidate for the linear spectral mixture model, has been applied to unmix hyperspectral data. Unfortunately, the local minima caused by the nonconvexity of the objective function makes the solution nonunique, thus only the nonnegativity constraint is not sufficient enough to lead to a well-defined problem. Therefore, in this paper, two inherent characteristics of hyperspectral data, piecewise smoothness (both temporal and spatial) of spectral data and sparseness of abundance fraction of every material, are introduced to NMF. The adaptive potential function from discontinuity adaptive Markov random field model is used to describe the smoothness constraint while preserving discontinuities in spectral data. At the same time, two NMF algorithms, nonsmooth NMF and NMF with sparseness constraint, are used to quantify the degree of sparseness of material abundances. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is presented, and the monotonic convergence of the algorithm is proved. Three important facts are exploited in our method: First, both the spectra and abundances are nonnegative; second, the variation of the material spectra and abundance images is piecewise smooth in wavelength and spatial spaces, respectively; third, the abundance distribution of each material is almost sparse in the scene. Experiments using synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides an effective unsupervised technique for hyperspectral unmixing.

Following Craig's seminal ideas, hyperspectral linear unmixing amounts to finding the minimum volume simplex containing the hyperspectral vectors. This is a nonconvex optimization problem with convex constraints. In the proposed approach, the positivity constraints, forcing the spectral vectors to belong to the convex hull of the end member signatures, are replaced by soft constraints. The obtained problem is solved by a sequence of augmented Lagrangian optimizations. The resulting algorithm is very fast and able so solve problems far beyond the reach of the current state-of-the art algorithms. The effectiveness of SISAL is illustrated with simulated data.","2158-6276","978-1-4244-4686-5","10.1109/WHISPERS.2009.5289072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5289072","Hyperspectral unmixing;Minimum volume simplex;Variable Splitting augmented Lagrangian;nonsmooth optimization","Lagrangian functions;Hyperspectral imaging;Vectors;Source separation;Constraint optimization;Noise robustness;Telecommunications;Art;Additive noise;Solid modeling","","309","","23","IEEE","16 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three different current controllers based on symmetrical components and linear quadratic regulator have been considered.

Moreover, no frequency divider is needed in the locked state and hence divider noise and power can be eliminated. An added frequency locked loop guarantees correct frequency locking without degenerating jitter performance when in lock. The PLL is implemented in a standard 0.18- ¿m CMOS process.

Its voltage linearity and DC bus and AC output PWM current ripple characteristics are studied. Its output line-to-line voltage pattern is carefully studied with regard to switching transients that may cause overvoltages at the motor terminals, particularly for long-cable applications. The NSPWM method is thoroughly investigated, and its performance is compared to conventional PWM methods. Theory, simulations, and experiments show that NSPWM exhibits superior common-mode performance and satisfactory input/output PWM ripple performance characteristics. It is also illustrated that even though the method has bipolar line-to-line output voltage pulses, due to the sufficient zero-voltage time intervals for the switching transients to settle, these pulses do not cause additional overvoltages at the motor terminals compared to the conventional methods.

This paper investigates how the static eccentricity (SE), dynamic eccentricity (DE), and ME in three-phase PMSMs can be detected. A novel index for noninvasive diagnosis of these eccentricities is introduced for a faulty PMSM. The nominated index is the amplitude of sideband components with a particular frequency pattern which is extracted from the spectrum of stator current. Using this index makes it possible to determine the occurrence, as well as the type and percentage, of eccentricity precisely. Meanwhile, the current spectrum of the faulty PMSM during a large span is inspected, and the ability of the proposed index is exhibited to detect eccentricity in faulty PMSMs with different loads. A novel theoretical scrutiny based on a magnetic field analysis is presented to prove the introduced index and generalize the illustrated fault recognition method. To show the merit of this index in the eccentricity detection and estimation of its severity, first, the correlation between the index and the SE and DE degrees is determined. Then, the type of the eccentricity is determined by a k-nearest neighbor classifier. At the next step, a three-layer artificial neural network is employed to estimate the eccentricity degree and its type. After all, a white Gaussian noise is added to the simulated current, and the robustness of the proposed index is analyzed with respect to the noise variance. In this paper, the PMSM under magnetic fault (demagnetization) and electrical faults (short and open circuits) is modeled, and the current spectrum of the faulty PMSM under demagnetization, short circuit, and open circuit faults is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the proposed index, due to eccentricity fault, is not generated in the current spectrum due to magnetic and electrical faults. Indeed, it is exposed that the introduced index is only created due to eccentricity fault and it is not sensitive to other faults. To model the PMSM eccentricities, a time-stepping finite-element method, which takes into account all geometrical and physical characteristics of the machine components, nonuniform permeance of the air gap, and nonuniform characteristics of the PM material, is employed. This model facilitates the access to the demanded signals in order to have accurate processing. A comparison of simulation and experimental results validate the proposed index.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2009.2029577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226595","Amplitude of sideband components (ASBC);artificial neural network (ANN);dynamic eccentricity (DE) and mixed eccentricity (ME);fault diagnosis;Gaussian noise;pattern recognition;permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous motor (PMSM);static;time-stepping finite-element (FE) method (FEM) (TSFEM)","Synchronous motors;Circuit faults;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic circuits;Gaussian noise;Demagnetization;Fault diagnosis;Noninvasive treatment;Frequency;Stators","","307","5","23","IEEE","28 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second strong point of the suggested approach is to capitalize on the trust relationships that are part of social networks in real life in order to cope with the problem of building trusted and privacy- preserving mechanisms as part of the online application. The combination of these design principles is Safebook, a decentralized and privacy- preserving online social network application.

Many existing hyperspectral unmixing algorithms were developed under a commonly used assumption that pure pixels exist. However, the pure-pixel assumption may be seriously violated for highly mixed data. Based on intuitive grounds, Craig reported an unmixing criterion without requiring the pure-pixel assumption, which estimates the endmembers by vertices of a minimum-volume simplex enclosing all the observed pixels. In this paper, we incorporate convex analysis and Craig's criterion to develop a minimum-volume enclosing simplex (MVES) formulation for hyperspectral unmixing. A cyclic minimization algorithm for approximating the MVES problem is developed using linear programs (LPs), which can be practically implemented by readily available LP solvers. We also provide a non-heuristic guarantee of our MVES problem formulation, where the existence of pure pixels is proved to be a sufficient condition for MVES to perfectly identify the true endmembers. Some Monte Carlo simulations and real data experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MVES algorithm over several existing hyperspectral unmixing methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2025802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089462","Convex analysis;convex optimization;hyperspectral unmixing;linear programming;minimum-volume enclosing simplex","Algorithm design and analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Layout;Data mining;Signal processing algorithms;Councils;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Minimization methods","","304","","46","IEEE","19 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm has the ability to reorganize the model and adapt itself to a changing environment where both the structure and learning parameters are performed simultaneously. The network generates a new rule if the smallest distance between the new data and all the existing rules (the winner rule) is more than a prespecified radius. The major contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) A new network is proposed, in which unidimensional membership functions are used, and only two parameters for each rule are employed, thus reducing the number of parameters. The network avoids the singularity produced by the widths in the antecedent part for online learning; 2) a new pruning algorithm based on the density is proposed, where the density is the number of times each rule is used in the algorithm.

In this paper, we have used the minimum-variance beamformer to show how the low sidelobe levels and narrow beamwidth of adaptive methods can be used, not only to increase resolution, but also to enhance imaging in several ways. By using a minimum-variance beamformer instead of delay-and-sum on reception, reduced aperture, higher frame rates, or increased depth of penetration can be achieved without sacrificing image quality. We demonstrate comparable resolution on images of wire targets and a cyst phantom obtained with a 96-element, 18.5-mm transducer using delay-and-sum, and a 48-element, 9.25-mm transducer using minimum variance. To increase frame rate, fewer and wider transmit beams in combination with several parallel receive beams may be used. We show comparable resolution to delay-and-sum using minimum variance, 1/4th of the number of transmit beams and 4 parallel receive beams, potentially increasing the frame rate by 4. Finally, we show that by lowering the frequency of the transmitted beam and beamforming the received data with the minimum variance beamformer, increased depth of penetration is achieved without sacrificing lateral resolution.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5278437","","Ultrasonic imaging;Array signal processing;Biomedical imaging;Image resolution;Delay;Transducers;High-resolution imaging;Apertures;Image quality;Wire","Algorithms;Phantoms, Imaging;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Transducers;Ultrasonography","304","7","20","IEEE","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, Gamma-Gamma fading has become the dominant fading model for FSO links because of its excellent agreement with measurement data for a wide range of turbulence conditions. However, in contrast to RF communications, the analysis techniques for FSO are not well developed and prior work has mostly resorted to simulations and numerical integration for performance evaluation in Gamma-Gamma fading. In this paper, we express the pairwise error probabilities of single-input single- output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) FSO systems with intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) as generalized infinite power series with respect to the signal- to-noise ratio. For numerical evaluation these power series are truncated to a finite number of terms and an upper bound for the associated approximation error is provided. The resulting finite power series enables fast and accurate numerical evaluation of the bit error rate of IM/DD FSO with on-off keying and pulse position modulation in SISO and MIMO Gamma-Gamma fading channels. Furthermore, we extend the well-known RF concepts of diversity and combining gain to FSO and Gamma-Gamma fading. In particular, we provide simple closed-form expressions for the diversity gain and the combining gain of MIMO FSO with repetition coding across lasers at the transmitter and equal gain combining or maximal ratio combining at the receiver.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.080168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336863","Free-space optics, gamma-gamma fading, pairwise error probability, generalized infinite power series, combining gain, diversity gain","Performance analysis;MIMO;Fading;Diversity reception;Optical transmitters;Optical receivers;Radio frequency;Pulse modulation;Atmospheric modeling;Atmospheric measurements","","303","","36","IEEE","20 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we define the concept of numerical scale and extend the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation models under the numerical scale. We find that the key of computational techniques based on linguistic 2-tuples is to set suitable numerical scale with the purpose of making transformations between linguistic 2-tuples and numerical values. By defining the concept of the transitive calibration matrix and its consistent index, this paper develops an optimization model to compute the numerical scale of the linguistic term set. The desired properties of the optimization model are also presented. Furthermore, we discuss how to construct the transitive calibration matrix for decision problems using linguistic preference relations and analyze the linkage between the consistent index of the transitive calibration matrix and one of the linguistic preference relations.

To this end, a fully distributed least mean-square (D-LMS) algorithm is developed in this paper, offering simplicity and flexibility while solely requiring single-hop communications among sensors. The resultant estimator minimizes a pertinent squared-error cost by resorting to i) the alternating-direction method of multipliers so as to gain the desired degree of parallelization and ii) a stochastic approximation iteration to cope with the time-varying statistics of the process under consideration. Information is efficiently percolated across the WSN using a subset of ldquobridgerdquo sensors, which further tradeoff communication cost for robustness to sensor failures. For a linear data model and under mild assumptions aligned with those considered in the centralized LMS, stability of the novel D-LMS algorithm is established to guarantee that local sensor estimation error norms remain bounded most of the time. Interestingly, this weak stochastic stability result extends to the pragmatic setup where intersensor communications are corrupted by additive noise. In the absence of observation and communication noise, consensus is achieved almost surely as local estimates are shown exponentially convergent to the parameter of interest with probability one. Mean-square error performance of D-LMS is also assessed. Numerical simulations: i) illustrate that D-LMS outperforms existing alternatives that rely either on information diffusion among neighboring sensors, or, local sensor filtering; ii) highlight its tracking capabilities; and iii) corroborate the stability and performance analysis results.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2016226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787093","Distributed estimation;LMS algorithm;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Least squares approximation;Wireless sensor networks;Costs;Stability;Adaptive algorithm;Parameter estimation;Signal processing;Stochastic processes;Statistics;Robustness","","301","","27","IEEE","24 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One EDS circuit is a dynamic transition detector with a time-borrowing datapath latch (TDTB). The other EDS circuit is a double-sampling static design with a time-borrowing datapath latch (DSTB). In comparison to previous EDS designs, TDTB and DSTB redirect the highly complex metastability problem from both the datapath and error path to only the error path, enabling a drastic simplification in managing metastability.

Similarly to some previous works, this is accomplished via generalized Hough transform, where the detections of individual object parts cast probabilistic votes for possible locations of the centroid of the whole object; the detection hypotheses then correspond to the maxima of the Hough image that accumulates the votes from all parts. However, whereas the previous methods detect object parts using generative codebooks of part appearances, we take a more discriminative approach to object part detection. Towards this end, we train a class-specific Hough forest, which is a random forest that directly maps the image patch appearance to the probabilistic vote about the possible location of the object centroid. We demonstrate that Hough forests improve the results of the Hough-transform object detection significantly and achieve state-of-the-art performance for several classes and datasets.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206740","","Object detection;Voting;Shape;Runtime;Computer vision;Lighting;Training data;Robustness;Large-scale systems;Testing","","300","17","27","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This does not prevent deep discharges of the battery, which are critical to the lifetime of the battery. In this paper, the ratings of the battery and ultracapacitors are investigated. Comparisons of the system volume, the system mass, and the lifetime of the battery due to the rating of the energy storage devices are presented. It is concluded that not only should the energy storage devices of a FCHEV be sized by their power and energy requirements, but the battery lifetime should also be considered. Two energy-management strategies, which sufficiently divide the load power between the fuel cell stack, the battery, and the ultracapacitors, are proposed. A charging strategy, which charges the energy-storage devices due to the conditions of the FCHEV, is also proposed.

Furthermore, an atlas selection procedure is proposed that is equivalent to sequential forward selection from statistical pattern recognition theory. The proposed method is compared to three existing atlas-based segmentation approaches, namely 1) single atlas-based segmentation, 2) average-shape atlas-based segmentation, and 3) multi-atlas-based segmentation with averaging as decision fusion.

The performance of a degradation model depends strongly on the appropriateness of the model describing a product's degradation path. In this paper, motivated by laser data, we propose a general linear degradation path in which the unit-to-unit variation of all test units can be considered simultaneously with the time-dependent structure in degradation paths. Based on the proposed degradation model, we first derive an implicit expression of a product's lifetime distribution, and its corresponding mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). By using the profile likelihood approach, maximum likelihood estimation of parameters, a product's MTTF, and their confidence intervals can be obtained easily. In addition, laser degradation data are used to illustrate the proposed procedure. Furthermore, we also address the effects of model mis-specification on the prediction of the product's MTTF. It shows that the effect of the model mis-specification on the predictions of a product's MTTF is not critical under the case of large samples. However, when the sample size and the termination time are not large enough, a simulation study shows that these effects are not negligible.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2009.2026784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196698","Degradation;first passage time;identifiability;model mis-specification","Degradation;Maximum likelihood estimation;Life estimation;Life testing;Laser modes;Predictive models;Measurement standards;Light emitting diodes;Councils;Statistical distributions","","299","","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The modified objective functions are used in the nondominance sorting to facilitate the search of optimal solutions not only in the feasible space but also in the infeasible regions. The search in the infeasible space is designed to exploit those individuals with better objective values and lower constraint violations. The number of feasible individuals in the population is used to guide the search process either toward finding more feasible solutions or favor in search for optimal solutions.

In this study, we apply a machine learning technique [support vector machines (SVMs)] for automated recognition of OSAS types from their nocturnal ECG recordings. A total of 125 sets of nocturnal ECG recordings acquired from normal subjects (OSAS${-}$ ) and subjects with OSAS (OSAS${+}$), each of approximately 8 h in duration, were analyzed. Features extracted from successive wavelet coefficient levels after wavelet decomposition of signals due to heart rate variability (HRV) from RR intervals and ECG-derived respiration (EDR) from R waves of QRS amplitudes were used as inputs to the SVMs to recognize OSAS ${+/-}$ subjects. Using leave-one-out technique, the maximum accuracy of classification for 83 training sets was found to be 100% for SVMs using a subset of selected combination of HRV and EDR features. Independent test results on 42 subjects showed that it correctly recognized 24 out of 26 OSAS ${+}$ subjects and 15 out of 16 OSAS ${-}$ subjects (accuracy ${=}$ 92.85%; Cohen's $\kappa$ value of 0.85). For estimating the relative severity of OSAS, the posterior probabilities of SVM outputs were calculated and compared with respective apnea/hypopnea index. These results suggest superior performance of SVMs in OSAS recognition supported by wavelet-based features of ECG. The results demonstrate considerable potential in applying SVMs in an ECG-based screening device that can aid a sleep specialist in the initial assessment of patients with suspected OSAS.

The client only needs to be able to prepare single qubits randomly chosen from a finite set and send them to the server, who has the balance of the required quantum computational resources. Our protocol is interactive: after the initial preparation of quantum states, the client and server use two-way classical communication which enables the client to drive the computation, giving single-qubit measurement instructions to the server, depending on previous measurement outcomes. Our protocol works for inputs and outputs that are either classical or quantum. We give an authentication protocol that allows the client to detect an interfering server; our scheme can also be made fault-tolerant. We also generalize our result to the setting of a purely classical client who communicates classically with two non-communicating entangled servers, in order to perform a blind quantum computation. By incorporating the authentication protocol, we show that any problem in BQP has an entangled two-prover interactive proof with a purely classical verifier. Our protocol is the first universal scheme which detects a cheating server, as well as the first protocol which does not require any quantum computation whatsoever on the client's side. The novelty of our approach is in using the unique features of measurement-based quantum computing which allows us to clearly distinguish between the quantum and classical aspects of a quantum computation.","0272-5428","978-1-4244-5116-6","10.1109/FOCS.2009.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438603","quantum prover interactive proofs;quantum cryptography;measurement-based quantum computing","Quantum computing;Protocols;Authentication;Computer aided instruction;Fault tolerance;Privacy;Computer science;Informatics;Fault detection;Quantum entanglement","","295","2","33","IEEE","25 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In theory, the effective electromagnetic properties of metamaterials at any frequency can be engineered to take on arbitrary values, including those not appearing in nature. As a result, this new class of materials can dramatically add a degree of freedom to the control of electromagnetic waves. The emergence of metamaterials fortunately coincides with the intense emerging interest in terahertz radiation (T-rays), for which efficient forms of electromagnetic manipulation are sought. Considering the scarcity of naturally existing materials that can control terahertz, metamaterials become ideal substitutes that promise advances in terahertz research. Ultimately, terahertz metamaterials will lead to scientific and technological advantages in a number of areas. This article covers the principles of metamaterials and reviews the latest trends in terahertz metamaterial research from the fabrication and characterization to the implementation.

For this range, it is proved that using Gaussian codebooks and treating interference as noise are optimal. It is shown that when Gaussian codebooks are used, the full Han–Kobayashi achievable rate region can be obtained by using the naive Han–Kobayashi achievable scheme over three frequency bands (equivalently, three subspaces).

These machines are very sensitive to grid disturbances. To prevent the damages that voltage dips can cause on the converter, most machines are equipped nowadays with a crowbar that short circuits the rotor. However, during the crowbar activation, the rotor converter must be disconnected, hence the power generated with the turbine is no longer controlled. In doing so, the crowbar impedes the wind turbine from carrying out the voltage stabilization required by most new grid codes. This paper proposes a novel control strategy that notably reduces the crowbar activation time. As a result, the control of the turbine might shortly be resumed and the turbine can furthermore supply a reactive power fulfilling the newest grid regulations. Experimental results of a complete system are included, demonstrating the viability of the proposed control.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2009.2028447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5191080","Asynchronous rotating machines;power system faults;wind power generation","Wind turbines;Induction generators;Voltage fluctuations;Rotors;Circuit faults;Power system stability;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Impedance;Power supplies","","291","4","16","IEEE","4 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we explore the impact of lowering the precision of the ADC on the performance of the communication link. Specifically, we evaluate the communication limits imposed by low-precision ADC (e.g., 1-3 bits) for transmission over the real discrete-time additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, under an average power constraint on the input. For an ADC with K quantization bins (i.e., a precision of log2 K bits), we show that the input distribution need not have any more than K+1 mass points to achieve the channel capacity. For 2-bin (1-bit) symmetric quantization, this result is tightened to show that binary antipodal signaling is optimum for any signal-to- noise ratio (SNR). For multi-bit quantization, a dual formulation of the channel capacity problem is used to obtain tight upper bounds on the capacity. The cutting-plane algorithm is employed to compute the capacity numerically, and the results obtained are used to make the following encouraging observations : (a) up to a moderately high SNR of 20 dB, 2-3 bit quantization results in only 10-20% reduction of spectral efficiency compared to unquantized observations, (b) standard equiprobable pulse amplitude modulated input with quantizer thresholds set to implement maximum likelihood hard decisions is asymptotically optimum at high SNR, and works well at low to moderate SNRs as well.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2009.12.080559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5351659","Channel capacity;optimum input distribution;AWGN channel;analog to digital converter;quantization","Analog-digital conversion;Quantization;AWGN;Additive white noise;Channel capacity;Signal to noise ratio;Pulse modulation;Bandwidth;Costs;Energy consumption","","291","3","32","IEEE","11 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inertial sensors based on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology have recently become commercially available at lower costs. These relatively lower cost inertial sensors have the potential to allow the development of an affordable GPS-aided INS (INS/GPS) vehicular navigation system. While MEMS-based INS is inherently immune to signal jamming, spoofing, and blockage vulnerabilities (as opposed to GPS), the performance of MEMS-based gyroscopes and accelerometers is significantly affected by complex error characteristics that are stochastic in nature. To improve the overall performance of MEMS-based INS/GPS, this paper proposes the following two-tier approach at different levels: (1) improving the stochastic modeling of MEMS-based inertial sensor errors using autoregressive processes at the raw measurement level and (2) enhancing the positioning accuracy during GPS outages by nonlinear modeling of INS position errors at the information fusion level using neuro-fuzzy (NF) modules, which are augmented in the Kalman filtering INS/GPS integration.

In practice, the system may be operated in different topologies due to outage of the transmission lines, transformers, and generating units. There are some situations for which the changes in the network topology of a system could cause the protective system to operate without selectivity. The aim of this paper is to study DOCRs coordination considering the effects of the different network topologies in the optimization problem. Corresponding to each network topology, a large number of coordination constraints should be taken into account in the problem formulation. In this situation, in addition to nonlinearity and nonconvexity, the optimization problem experiences many coordination constraints. The genetic algorithm (GA) is selected as a powerful tool in solving this complex and nonconvex optimization problem. In this paper, in order to improve the convergence of the GA, a new hybrid method is introduced. The results show a robust and optimal solution can be efficiently obtained by implementing the proposed hybrid GA method.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2029057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5235753","Different network topologies;genetic algorithm (GA);overcurrent relay coordination;power system protection","Network topology;Relays;Power system relaying;Power system interconnection;Hybrid power systems;Power system protection;Power transmission lines;Transformers;Constraint optimization;Genetic algorithms","","289","","17","IEEE","22 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aim of this paper is to improve the consensus reaching process in GDM problems defined in multigranular linguistic contexts, i.e., by using linguistic term sets with different cardinality to represent experts' preferences. To do that, we propose an adaptive consensus support system model for this type of decision-making problem, i.e., a process that adapts its behavior to the agreement achieved in each round. This adaptive model increases the convergence toward the consensus and, therefore, reduces the number of rounds to reach it.

The consequent assumption is that each microlens image is completely defocused with respect to to the image created by the main camera lens and the outside object. As a result, only a single pixel in the final image can be rendered from it, resulting in disappointingly low resolution. In this paper, we present a new approach to lightfield capture and image rendering that interprets the microlens array as an imaging system focused on the focal plane of the main camera lens. This approach captures a lightfield with significantly higher spatial resolution than the traditional approach, allowing us to render high resolution images that meet the expectations of modern photographers. Although the new approach samples the lightfield with reduced angular density, analysis and experimental results demonstrate that there is sufficient parallax to completely support lightfield manipulation algorithms such as refocusing and novel views.","","978-1-4244-4534-9","10.1109/ICCPHOT.2009.5559008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559008","","Lenses;Microoptics;Cameras;Rendering (computer graphics);Spatial resolution;Pixel","","286","50","21","IEEE","30 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In compressed sensing we are interested in finding the sparsest solution to the system of equations A x = y for a given y. In general, whenever the sparsity of x is smaller than half the dimension of y then with overwhelming probability over A the sparsest solution is unique and can be found by an exhaustive search over x with an exponential time complexity for any y. The recent work of Candes, Donoho, and Tao shows that minimization of the lscr 1 norm of x subject to Ax = y results in the sparsest solution provided the sparsity of x, say K, is smaller than a certain threshold for a given number of measurements. Specifically, if the dimension of y approaches the dimension of x , the sparsity of x should be K < 0.239 N. Here, we consider the case where x is block sparse, i.e., x consists of n = N /d blocks where each block is of length d and is either a zero vector or a nonzero vector (under nonzero vector we consider a vector that can have both, zero and nonzero components). Instead of lscr1 -norm relaxation, we consider the following relaxation: times min ||X 1||2 + ||X 2||2 + ldrldrldr + ||X n ||2, subject to A x = y (*) where X i = (x ( i-1)d+1, x ( i-1)d+2, ldrldrldr , x i d)T for i = 1, 2, ldrldrldr , N. Our main result is that as n rarr infin, (*) finds the sparsest solution to A=x = y, with overwhelming probability in A, for any x whose sparsity is k/n < (1/2) - O (isin), provided m /n > 1 - 1/d, and d = Omega(log(1/isin)/isin3) .

While new fire monitoring systems are based on fundamental Earth Systems Science (ESS) research, adaptation to the forecasting problem requires special procedures and simplifications. In a reciprocal manner, results from the air quality research community have contributed scientifically to basic ESS. To help exploit research and data products in climate, ESS, meteorology and air quality biomass burning communities, the joint Navy, NASA, NOAA, and University Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) program was formed in 1999. Based upon the operational NOAA/NESDIS Wild-Fire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF_ABBA) and the near real time University of Maryland/NASA MODIS fire products coupled to the operational Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) transport model, FLAMBE is a combined ESS and operational system to study the nature of smoke particle emissions and transport at the synoptic to continental scales. In this paper, we give an overview of the FLAMBE system and present fundamental metrics on emission and transport patterns of smoke. We also provide examples on regional smoke transport mechanisms and demonstrate that MODIS optical depth data assimilation provides significant variance reduction against observations. Using FLAMBE as a context, throughout the paper we discuss observability issues surrounding the biomass burning system and the subsequent propagation of error. Current indications are that regional particle emissions estimates still have integer factors of uncertainty.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2027443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5208306","Aerosol forecasting;biomass burning;modeling;satellite applications","MODIS;Meteorology;Uncertainty;Satellites;Biomass;NASA;Aerosols","","282","","86","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One way to handle large datasets is to disperse them across an array of networked computers, each of which implements simple sorting and accumulating, or MapReduce, operations. This cloud computing approach offers many attractive features. If decomposing useful graph operations in terms of MapReduce cycles is possible, it provides incentive for seriously considering cloud computing. Moreover, it offers a way to handle a large graph on a single machine that can't hold the entire graph as well as enables streaming graph processing.

Our goal is to be able to understand how patterns of behavior shape individuals and organizations. By using on-body sensors in large groups of people for extended periods of time in naturalistic settings, we have been able to identify, measure, and quantify social interactions, group behavior, and organizational dynamics. We deployed this wearable computing platform in a group of 22 employees working in a real organization over a period of one month. Using these automatic measurements, we were able to predict employees' self-assessments of job satisfaction and their own perceptions of group interaction quality by combining data collected with our platform and e-mail communication data. In particular, the total amount of communication was predictive of both of these assessments, and betweenness in the social network exhibited a high negative correlation with group interaction satisfaction. We also found that physical proximity and e-mail exchange had a negative correlation of $r = -0.55\ (p 0.01)$, which has far-reaching implications for past and future research on social networks.

In particular, UGC sites are creating new viewing patterns and social interactions, empowering users to be more creative, and generating new business opportunities. Compared to traditional video-on-demand (VoD) systems, UGC services allow users to request videos from a potentially unlimited selection in an asynchronous fashion. To better understand the impact of UGC services, we have analyzed the world's largest UGC VoD system, YouTube, and a popular similar system in Korea, Daum Videos. In this paper, we first empirically show how UGC services are fundamentally different from traditional VoD services. We then analyze the intrinsic statistical properties of UGC popularity distributions and discuss opportunities to leverage the latent demand for niche videos (or the so-called ""the Long Tail"" potential), which is not reached today due to information filtering or other system scarcity distortions. Based on traces collected across multiple days, we study the popularity lifetime of UGC videos and the relationship between requests and video age. Finally, we measure the level of content aliasing and illegal content in the system and show the problems aliasing creates in ranking the video popularity accurately. The results presented in this paper are crucial to understanding UGC VoD systems and may have major commercial and technical implications for site administrators and content owners.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2008.2011358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4801529","Interactive TV;human factors;exponential distributions;log normal distributions;pareto distributions;probability;copyright protection","Large-scale systems;User-generated content;Watches;TV;Business;YouTube;Information analysis;Probability distribution;Information filtering;Distortion measurement","","280","5","37","IEEE","16 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these frameworks tend to exploit the provided bounding box merely to exclude its exterior from consideration and sometimes to initialize the energy minimization. In this paper, we discuss how the bounding box can be further used to impose a powerful topological prior, which prevents the solution from excessive shrinking and ensures that the user-provided box bounds the segmentation in a sufficiently tight way. The prior is expressed using hard constraints incorporated into the global energy minimization framework leading to an NP-hard integer program. We then investigate the possible optimization strategies including linear relaxation as well as a new graph cut algorithm called pinpointing. The latter can be used either as a rounding method for the fractional LP solution, which is provably better than thresholding-based rounding, or as a fast standalone heuristic. We evaluate the proposed algorithms on a publicly available dataset, and demonstrate the practical benefits of the new prior both qualitatively and quantitatively.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459262","","Image segmentation;Iterative algorithms;Power generation economics;Mice;Active contours;Computer vision;Linear programming;Image reconstruction","","280","12","15","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is presented as a system-level solution for ultra-low-cost mass production of UHF radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and wireless sensor nodes (WSN), in an approach that could be easily extended to other microwave and wireless applications. First, we discuss the benefits of using paper as a substrate for high-frequency applications, reporting its very good electrical/dielectric performance up to at least 1 GHz. The RF characteristics of the paper-based substrate are studied by using a microstrip-ring resonator, in order to characterize the dielectric properties (dielectric constant and loss tangent). We then give details about the inkjet-printing technology, including the characterization of the conductive ink, which consists of nano-silver particles. We highlight the importance of this technology as a fast and simple fabrication technique, especially on flexible organic (e.g., LCP) or paper-based substrates. A compact inkjet-printed UHF ldquopassive RFIDrdquo antenna, using the classic T-match approach and designed to match the IC's complex impedance, is presented as a demonstration prototype for this technology. In addition, we briefly touch upon the state-of-the-art area of fully-integrated wireless sensor modules on paper.

Existing gesture recognition methods typically assume either known spatial segmentation or known temporal segmentation, or both. This paper introduces a unified framework for simultaneously performing spatial segmentation, temporal segmentation, and recognition. In the proposed framework, information flows both bottom-up and top-down. A gesture can be recognized even when the hand location is highly ambiguous and when information about when the gesture begins and ends is unavailable. Thus, the method can be applied to continuous image streams where gestures are performed in front of moving, cluttered backgrounds. The proposed method consists of three novel contributions: a spatiotemporal matching algorithm that can accommodate multiple candidate hand detections in every frame, a classifier-based pruning framework that enables accurate and early rejection of poor matches to gesture models, and a subgesture reasoning algorithm that learns which gesture models can falsely match parts of other longer gestures. The performance of the approach is evaluated on two challenging applications: recognition of hand-signed digits gestured by users wearing short-sleeved shirts, in front of a cluttered background, and retrieval of occurrences of signs of interest in a video database containing continuous, unsegmented signing in American sign language (ASL).","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4589214","Gesture recognition;gesture spotting;human motion analysis;dynamic time warping;continuous dynamic programming.;Computer vision;Human-centered computing","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Dynamic programming;Computer vision;Image segmentation;Streaming media;Handicapped aids;Video sequences;Information retrieval;Databases;Humans","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Gestures;Hand;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sign Language","280","13","56","IEEE","8 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, many prototype displays have been demonstrated in these four years since the first report of AOS TFT. The most prominent feature of AOS TFTs is that they operate with good performances even if they are fabricated at low temperatures without a defect passivation treatment. The TFT mobilities exceed 10 cm2/(Vmiddots), which are more than ten times larger than those of conventional amorphous semiconductor devices. In addition, they operate at low voltages, e.g., < 5 V owing to their small subthreshold voltage swings. These features indicate that electron transport in oxide semiconductors are insensitive to random structures and these oxides do not form high-density defects that affect electron transport and TFT operation. In this paper, we discuss the origins of the prominent features of AOS devices from the viewpoint of materials science of AOS.","1558-9323","","10.1109/JDT.2009.2034559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5332033","Amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS);defect;doping mechanism;electronic structure;thin-film transistor (TFT)","Low voltage;Amorphous materials;Electron mobility;Thin film transistors;Displays;Semiconductor device doping;Semiconductor materials;Prototypes;Temperature;Passivation","","280","3","67","IEEE","24 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The complete current controller is the superposition of all individual harmonic controllers and may be implemented in various reference frames. The analysis is focused on the comparison of harmonic and total closed-loop transfer functions for each controller. Analytical similarities and differences between schemes in terms of frequency response characteristics are emphasized. It is concluded that three of them have identical harmonic behavior despite the fact that their implementation is significantly different. It emerges that the fourth one has superior behavior and robustness and can stably work at higher frequencies than the others. Theoretical findings and analysis are supported by comparative experimental results on a 7-kVA laboratory setup. The highest harmonic frequency that can be stably compensated with each control method has been determined, indicating significant differences in the control performance.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.2006953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663712","Active power filters (APFs);current control;harmonic compensation;selective harmonic controller","Frequency response;Harmonic analysis;Power system harmonics;Power harmonic filters;Active filters;Phased arrays;Transfer functions;Current control;Resonance;Performance gain","","280","","19","IEEE","31 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, the interdependencies of different characteristics of the multipath channel are also investigated. A linear relationship between the number of paths and the delay spread is found, negative cross correlation between the shadow fading and the delay spread can be established, and an upper bound exponential model of the delay spread and the path loss is developed to estimate the worst case of the RMS delay spread at given path loss. Based on the DOA measurements that are carried out in a room [line of sight (LOS)] and in a corridor with both LOS and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, radio-wave propagation mechanisms are studied. It is found that considering the direct wave and the first-order reflected waves from smooth surfaces is sufficient in the LOS cases.

We then present several research hypotheses which we tested in a controlled experiment (N = 30). Using a 2 (robotics experience vs. none: between-participants) × 2 (robot head oriented toward a participant's face vs. legs: within-participants) mixed design experiment, we explored the factors that influence proxemic behavior around robots in several situations: (1) people approaching a robot, (2) people being approached by an autonomously moving robot, and (3) people being approached by a teleoperated robot. We found that personal experience with pets and robots decreases a person's personal space around robots. In addition, when the robot's head is oriented toward the person's face, it increases the minimum comfortable distance for women, but decreases the minimum comfortable distance for men. We also found that the personality trait of agreeableness decreases personal spaces when people approach robots, while the personality trait of neuroticism and having negative attitudes toward robots increase personal spaces when robots approach people. These results have implications for both human-robot interaction theory and design.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-3803-7","10.1109/IROS.2009.5354145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5354145","","Orbital robotics;Human robot interaction;Legged locomotion;Testing;Robot sensing systems;Intelligent robots;Magnetic heads;Leg;Positron emission tomography;USA Councils","","279","2","25","IEEE","15 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our aim is to develop a robust fault detection approach to the T--S fuzzy systems with Brownian motion. By using a general observer-based fault detection filter as a residual generator, the robust fault detection is formulated as a filtering problem. Attention is focused on the design of both the fuzzy-rule-independent and the fuzzy-rule-dependent fault detection filters guaranteeing a prescribed noise attenuation level in an ${{\H}}_\infty$ sense. Sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the mean-square asymptotic stability with an ${{\H}}_\infty$  performance for the fault detection system. The corresponding solvability conditions for the desired fuzzy-rule-independent and fuzzy-rule-dependent fault detection filters are also established. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.

While existing control paradigms are typically used to drive a single-DOF hook-based configurations, dexterous tasks such as individual finger movements would require more elaborate control schemes. We show that it is possible to decode individual flexion and extension movements of each finger (ten movements) with greater than 90% accuracy in a transradial amputee using only noninvasive surface myoelectric signals. Further, comparison of decoding accuracy from a transradial amputee and able-bodied subjects shows no statistically significant difference ( p < 0.05) between these subjects.

Markov processes. A user, with limited channel sensing capability, chooses one channel to sense and decides whether to use the channel (based on the sensing result) in each time slot. A reward is obtained whenever the user senses and accesses a ldquogoodrdquo channel. The objective is to design a channel selection policy that maximizes the expected total (discounted or average) reward accrued over a finite or infinite horizon. This problem can be cast as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) or a restless multiarmed bandit process, to which optimal solutions are often intractable. This paper shows that a myopic policy that maximizes the immediate one-step reward is optimal when the state transitions are positively correlated over time. When the state transitions are negatively correlated, we show that the same policy is optimal when the number of channels is limited to two or three, while presenting a counterexample for the case of four channels.

It is shown that both VSI and CSI systems are subject to LC resonance, even with multiloop control, while the CSI system is also subject to LC resonant frequency variations. On the other hand, the LC resonant frequencies in both current-source rectifier (CSR) and voltage-source rectifier (VSR) systems with input LC filter circuits are relatively fixed due to the small variation range of source impedance. To further dampen the LC resonance in these converter systems, active damping techniques such as virtual harmonic damper and control-signal-shaping methods are investigated, and their implementation into the converter systems is discussed in detail.

Our main focus, in this technical note, is to address the following two problems: 1) Design a velocity-free attitude tracking and synchronization control scheme, that allows the team members to align their attitudes and track a time-varying reference trajectory (simultaneously). 2) Design a velocity-free synchronization control scheme, in the case where no reference attitude is specified, and all spacecraft are required to reach a consensus by aligning their attitudes with the same final time-varying attitude. In this work, one important and novel feature (besides the non-requirement of the angular velocity measurements), consists in the fact that the control torques are naturally bounded and the designer can arbitrarily assign the desired bounds on the control torques, a priori, through the control gains, regardless of the angular velocities. Throughout this technical note, the communication flow between spacecraft is assumed to be undirected.

Based on the idea of delay fractioning, a new method is proposed for the delay-dependent stability analysis of fuzzy time-delay systems. Due to the instrumental idea of delay partitioning, the proposed stability condition is much less conservative than most of the existing results. The conservatism reduction becomes more obvious with the partitioning getting thinner. Based on this, the problem of stabilization via the so-called parallel distributed compensation scheme is also solved. Both the stability and stabilization results are further extended to time-delay fuzzy systems with time-varying parameter uncertainties. All the results are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be readily solved via standard numerical software. The advantage of the results proposed in this paper lies in their reduced conservatism, as shown via detailed illustrative examples. The idea of delay partitioning is well demonstrated to be efficient for conservatism reduction and could be extended to solving other problems related to fuzzy delay systems.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.928598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4565673","Delay partitioning;stability;Takagi–Sugeno (T--S) fuzzy systems;time-delay systems;uncertainties;Delay partitioning;Stability;T-S fuzzy systems;Time-delay systems;Uncertainties","Delay systems;Fuzzy systems;Communication system control;Stability analysis;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Space technology;Delay effects;Nonlinear control systems;Fuzzy sets","","275","","47","IEEE","16 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main focus in this research has been on the development of a single universal genetic operator for population evolution that is always efficient for a diverse set of optimization problems. In this paper, we argue that significant advances to the field of evolutionary computation can be made if we embrace a concept of self-adaptive multimethod optimization in which multiple different search algorithms are run concurrently, and learn from each other through information exchange using a common population of points. We present an evolutionary algorithm, entitled A Multialgorithm Genetically Adaptive Method for Single Objective Optimization (AMALGAM-SO), that implements this concept of self adaptive multimethod search. This method simultaneously merges the strengths of the covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) evolution strategy, genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimizer (PSO) for population evolution and implements a self-adaptive learning strategy to automatically tune the number of offspring these three individual algorithms are allowed to contribute during each generation. Benchmark results in 10, 30, and 50 dimensions using synthetic functions from the special session on real-parameter optimization of CEC 2005 show that AMALGAM-SO obtains similar efficiencies as existing algorithms on relatively simple unimodal problems, but is superior for more complex higher dimensional multimodal optimization problems. The new search method scales well with increasing number of dimensions, converges in the close proximity of the global minimum for functions with noise induced multimodality, and is designed to take full advantage of the power of distributed computer networks.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2008.924428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4594621","Adaptive estimation;elitism;genetic algorithms;nonlinear estimation;optimization","Evolutionary computation;Genetic algorithms;Evolution (biology);Optimization methods;Particle swarm optimization;Covariance matrix;Search methods;Computer networks;State estimation;Cost function","","274","1","44","IEEE","8 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Corresponding numerical simulations and initial experiments on a standard clinical MRI system underline the principal feasibility of EPT to determine the electric conductivity and the local SAR.

To date, the cost of transmission and switching equipment has been considered to be the major barrier to growth of the Internet. But energy consumption rather than cost of the component equipment may eventually become a barrier to continued growth. Research efforts on ldquogreening the Internetrdquo have been initiated in recent years, aiming to develop energy-efficient network architectures and operational strategies so as to reduce the energy consumption of the Internet. The direct benefits of such efforts are to reduce the operational costs in the network and cut the greenhouse footprint of the network. Second, from an engineering point of view, energy efficiency will assist in reducing the thermal issues associated with heat dissipation in large data centers and switching nodes. In the present research, we concentrate on minimizing the energy consumption of an IP over WDM network. We develop efficient approaches ranging from mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models to heuristics. These approaches are based on traditional virtual-topology and traffic grooming designs. The novelty of the framework involves the definition of an energy-oriented model for the IP over WDM network, the incorporation of the physical layer issues such as energy consumption of each component and the layout of optical amplifiers in the design, etc. Extensive optimization and simulation studies indicate that the proposed energy-minimized design can significantly reduce energy consumption of the IP over WDM network, ranging from 25% to 45%. Moreover, the proposed designs can also help equalize the power consumption at each network node. This is useful for real network deployment, in which each node location may be constrained by a limited electricity power supply. Finally, it is also interesting and useful to find that an energy-efficient network design is also a cost-efficient design because of the fact that IP router ports play a dominating role in both energy consumption and network cost in the IP over WDM network.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.1.000176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069813","Green Internet;IP over WDM network;Energy-minimized network design;Lightpath bypass;MILP model","WDM networks;Energy consumption;Costs;IP networks;Energy efficiency;Internet;Data engineering;Power engineering and energy;Thermal engineering;Heat engines","","273","6","16","","5 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moving state and behavior between classes can help reduce coupling and increase cohesion, but it is nontrivial to identify where such refactorings should be applied. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the identification of Move Method refactoring opportunities that constitute a way for solving many common feature envy bad smells. An algorithm that employs the notion of distance between system entities (attributes/methods) and classes extracts a list of behavior-preserving refactorings based on the examination of a set of preconditions. In practice, a software system may exhibit such problems in many different places. Therefore, our approach measures the effect of all refactoring suggestions based on a novel entity placement metric that quantifies how well entities have been placed in system classes. The proposed methodology can be regarded as a semi-automatic approach since the designer will eventually decide whether a suggested refactoring should be applied or not based on conceptual or other design quality criteria. The evaluation of the proposed approach has been performed considering qualitative, metric, conceptual, and efficiency aspects of the suggested refactorings in a number of open-source projects.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752842","Move Method refactoring;Feature Envy;object-oriented design;Jaccard distance;design quality.","Software systems;Performance evaluation;Open source software;Runtime;Productivity;Data mining","","271","","33","IEEE","19 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

DILOC uses the barycentric coordinates of a node with respect to its neighbors; these coordinates are computed using the Cayley-Menger determinants, i.e., the determinants of matrices of internode distances. We show convergence of DILOC by associating with it an absorbing Markov chain whose absorbing states are the states of the anchors. We introduce a stochastic approximation version extending DILOC to random environments, i.e., when the communications among nodes is noisy, the communication links among neighbors may fail at random times, and the internodes distances are subject to errors. We show a.s. convergence of the modified DILOC and characterize the error between the true values of the sensors' locations and their final estimates given by DILOC.

Moreover, a technique for numerical approximation of the asymptotic distribution of the censored FC test statistic is proposed. The proposed tests are nonparametric in the sense that no assumptions on data or noise distributions are required.

The sensor nodes have to operate under severe constraints on energy consumption and form factor, and provide the ability for precise self-location of the nodes. These requirements can be fulfilled very well by various forms of ultra-wide-band (UWB) transmission technology. We discuss various techniques and tradeoffs in UWB systems and indicate that time-hopping and frequency-hopping impulse radio physical layers combined with simple multiple-access techniques like ALOHA are suitable designs. We also describe the IEEE 802.15.4a standard, an important system that adopts UWB impulse radio to ensure robust data communications and precision ranging.

The objective of our study was to develop a new fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian (FLAB) segmentation for automatic lesion volume delineation. FLAB was compared with a threshold approach as well as the previously proposed fuzzy hidden Markov chains (FHMC) and the fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithms. The performance of the algorithms was assessed on acquired datasets of the IEC phantom, covering a range of spherical lesion sizes (10–37 mm), contrast ratios (4:1 and 8:1), noise levels (1, 2, and 5 min acquisitions), and voxel sizes (8 and 64 mm $^3$). In addition, the performance of the FLAB model was assessed on realistic nonuniform and nonspherical volumes simulated from patient lesions. Results show that FLAB performs better than the other methodologies, particularly for smaller objects. The volume error was 5%–15% for the different sphere sizes (down to 13 mm), contrast and image qualities considered, with a high reproducibility (variation $≪$4%). By comparison, the thresholding results were greatly dependent on image contrast and noise, whereas FCM results were less dependent on noise but consistently failed to segment lesions $≪$ 2 cm. In addition, FLAB performed consistently better for lesions $≪$ 2 cm in comparison to the FHMC algorithm. Finally the FLAB model provided errors less than 10% for nonspherical lesions with inhomogeneous activity distributions. Future developments will concentrate on an extension of FLAB in order to allow the segmentation of separate activity distribution regions within the same functional volume as well as a robustness study with respect to different scanners and reconstruction algorithms.

Among these, urban-area boundaries and building locations play crucial roles. For a human expert, manually extracting this valuable information is tedious. One possible solution to extract this information is using automated techniques. Unfortunately, the solution is not straightforward if standard image processing and pattern recognition techniques are used. Therefore, to detect the urban area and buildings in satellite images, we propose the use of scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and graph theoretical tools. SIFT keypoints are powerful in detecting objects under various imaging conditions. However, SIFT is not sufficient for detecting urban areas and buildings alone. Therefore, we formalize the problem in terms of graph theory. In forming the graph, we represent each keypoint as a vertex of the graph. The unary and binary relationships between these vertices (such as spatial distance and intensity values) lead to the edges of the graph. Based on this formalism, we extract the urban area using a novel multiple subgraph matching method. Then, we extract separate buildings in the urban area using a novel graph cut method. We form a diverse and representative test set using panchromatic 1-m-resolution Ikonos imagery. By extensive testings, we report very promising results on automatically detecting urban areas and buildings.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2008440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4799121","Building detection;graph cut;multiple subgraph matching;scale invariant feature transform (SIFT);urban-area detection","Graph theory;Urban areas;Satellites;Data mining;Image resolution;Humans;Image processing;Pattern recognition;Object detection;Image edge detection","","268","4","35","IEEE","10 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose an RRIQA algorithm based on a divisive normalization image representation. Divisive normalization has been recognized as a successful approach to model the perceptual sensitivity of biological vision. It also provides a useful image representation that significantly improves statistical independence for natural images. By using a Gaussian scale mixture statistical model of image wavelet coefficients, we compute a divisive normalization transformation (DNT) for images and evaluate the quality of a distorted image by comparing a set of reduced-reference statistical features extracted from DNT-domain representations of the reference and distorted images, respectively. This leads to a generic or general-purpose RRIQA method, in which no assumption is made about the types of distortions occurring in the image being evaluated. The proposed algorithm is cross-validated using two publicly-accessible subject-rated image databases (the UT-Austin LIVE database and the Cornell-VCL A57 database) and demonstrates good performance across a wide range of image distortions.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2014497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4799311","Divisive normalization;image quality assessment;reduced-reference image quality assessment (RRIQA);perceptual image representation;statistical image modeling","Image quality;Image representation;Degradation;Feature extraction;Signal processing algorithms;Image databases;Biological system modeling;Image coding;Data mining;Wavelet coefficients","","267","3","39","IEEE","10 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The concave relaxation has the same global minimum as the initial graph matching problem, but the search for its global minimum is also a hard combinatorial problem. We, therefore, construct an approximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a convex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and concave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows to easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the optimization problem, and therefore, perform labeled weighted graph matching. The algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching methods on four data sets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images, and handwritten Chinese characters.

Existing conventional measurements can also be accommodated in the proposed PMU placement method. Complete observability of the system is ensured under normal operating conditions as well as under the outage of a single transmission line or a single PMU.

In graph matching, patterns are modeled as graphs and pattern recognition amounts to finding a correspondence between the nodes of different graphs. Many formulations of this problem can be cast in general as a quadratic assignment problem, where a linear term in the objective function encodes node compatibility and a quadratic term encodes edge compatibility. The main research focus in this theme is about designing efficient algorithms for approximately solving the quadratic assignment problem, since it is NP-hard. In this paper we turn our attention to a different question: how to estimate compatibility functions such that the solution of the resulting graph matching problem best matches the expected solution that a human would manually provide. We present a method for learning graph matching: the training examples are pairs of graphs and the 'labels' are matches between them. Our experimental results reveal that learning can substantially improve the performance of standard graph matching algorithms. In particular, we find that simple linear assignment with such a learning scheme outperforms Graduated Assignment with bistochastic normalisation, a state-of-the-art quadratic assignment relaxation algorithm.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770108","Graph matching;Learning;Support Vector Machines;Structured Estimation;Optimization","Optimal matching;Pattern recognition;Pattern matching;Computer vision;Machine learning;Surveillance;Cameras;Image databases;Data mining;Application software","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","266","1","50","IEEE","2 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These processes exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics and coupling between the dimensions, which make their component-wise processing by multiple univariate LMS, bivariate complex LMS (CLMS), or multichannel LMS (MLMS) algorithms inadequate. The QLMS accounts for these problems naturally, as it is derived directly in the quaternion domain. The analysis shows that QLMS operates inherently based on the so called ldquoaugmentedrdquo statistics, that is, both the covariance E{ xx H} and pseudocovariance E{ xx T} of the tap input vector x are taken into account. In addition, the operation in the quaternion domain facilitates fusion of heterogeneous data sources, for instance, the three vector dimensions of the wind field and air temperature.

This is in contrast to the traditional multiple-access problem, in which the goal is to obtain both S1 and S2 explicitly at the relay node. Trying to obtain S1 and S2 explicitly is an overkill if we are only interested in S1oplusS2. In this paper, we refer to the transformation Y3 rarr S1 oplus S2 as the channel-decoding- network-coding process (CNC) in that it involves both channel decoding and network coding operations. This paper shows that if we adopt the repeat accumulate (RA) channel code at the two end nodes, then there is a compatible decoder at the relay that can perform the transformation Y3 rarr S1oplusS2 efficiently. Specifically, we redesign the belief propagation decoding algorithm of the RA code for traditional point-to-point channel to suit the need of the PNC multiple-access channel.

To remedy this shortcoming, this paper presents the results of a large-scale case study that was undertaken to find out if inconsistent changes to cloned code can indicate faults. For the analyzed commercial and open source systems we not only found that inconsistent changes to clones are very frequent but also identified a significant number of faults induced by such changes.

The control is based on an inner current-control loop and an outer DC-link voltage regulator. The current-control mechanism decouples the PV system dynamics from those of the network and the loads. The DC-link voltage-control scheme enables control and maximization of the real power output. Proper feedforward actions are proposed for the current-control loop to make its dynamics independent of those of the rest of the system. Further, a feedforward compensation mechanism is proposed for the DC-link voltage-control loop, to make the PV system dynamics immune to the PV array nonlinear characteristic. This, in turn, permits the design and optimization of the PV system controllers for a wide range of operating conditions. A modal/sensitivity analysis is also conducted on a linearized model of the overall system, to characterize dynamic properties of the system, to evaluate robustness of the controllers, and to identify the nature of interactions between the PV system and the network/loads. The results of the modal analysis confirm that under the proposed control strategy, dynamics of the PV system are decoupled from those of the distribution network and, therefore, the PV system does not destabilize the distribution network. It is also shown that the PV system dynamics are not influenced by those of the network (i.e., the PV system maintains its stability and dynamic properties despite major variations in the line length, line X/R ratio, load type, and load distance from the PV system).","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2016632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4915798","Control;eigenvalue analysis;feedforward;modal analysis;participation factor;photovoltaic (PV);power electronics;voltage-source converter (VSC)","Control systems;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Voltage control;Regulators;Design optimization;Sensitivity analysis;Robust control;Modal analysis","","264","1","38","IEEE","12 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the amount of ambiguity, we propose the use of a rich set of feature descriptors based on color, textures and edges. Another issue regarding appearance modeling is the limited number of training samples available for each appearance. The discriminative models are created using a powerful statistical tool called partial least squares (PLS), responsible for weighting the features according to their discriminative power for each different appearance.

Current algorithms, in a trade-off for computational performance, employ heuristics in order to quickly compute an answer. Of course, these heuristics are imperfect: existing methods can produce poor results, particularly when the prior is weak. The computational power available to modern robots warrants a re-examination of these quality vs. complexity trade-offs. In this paper, we advocate a probabilistically-motivated scan-matching algorithm that produces higher quality and more robust results at the cost of additional computation time. We describe several novel implementations of this approach that achieve real-time performance on modern hardware, including a multi-resolution approach for conventional CPUs, and a parallel approach for graphics processing units (GPUs). We also provide an empirical evaluation of our methods and several contemporary methods, illustrating the benefits of our approach. The robustness of the methods make them especially useful for global loop-closing.","1050-4729","978-1-4244-2788-8","10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5152375","","Robustness;Laser radar;Iterative closest point algorithm;Mobile robots;Cost function;Graphics;Navigation;Wheels;Motion estimation;Central Processing Unit","","263","16","20","IEEE","6 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Equalization techniques to compensate for linear transmission impairments are presented using the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), the recursive least-squares (RLS)-CMA, and the radius directed equalization (RDE). With 7 T/2-spaced taps, the RDE and the RLS-CMA can compensate up to 1000 ps/nm of CD in the 16-QAM coherent system with performances comparable to the decision-directed (DD) equalizer. We show that the RDE is a promising technique for blind equalization in a 16-QAM coherent system with lower complexity than the RLS-CMA. Blind carrier phase recovery is investigated in a decision-directed-mode. We show that the blind carrier phase recovery algorithm can recover the Square-16-QAM constellation for laser beat linewidths of DeltanuTs ~ 10-4 in a polarization-multiplexed (POLMUX) 16-QAM coherent system with the RDE algorithm giving better overall performance than the CMA when compensating for CD and differential group delay (DGD).

With the adaptation parameters optimized, the equalizers can track angular rate of rotation ~ 105 rad/s.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2009.2021961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4909145","Blind equalization;carrier phase recovery;coherent communications;QAM","Blind equalizers;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Intersymbol interference;Optical noise;Optical sensors;Optical polarization;Optical modulation;Optical distortion;Educational institutions;Delay","","263","13","20","IEEE","5 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The synergy of remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), Internet, and mobile phone technologies is revolutionizing the way in which satellite-derived information is archived and distributed to users.

Specifically, we describe how satellite remote sensing and GIS technologies have been integrated to deliver MODIS active fire data to natural resource managers using Internet mapping services and customized e-mail alerts to users in more than 90 countries.

Most previous studies have focused on designing special algorithms to effectively exploit the unlabeled data in conjunction with labeled data. Our goal is to improve the classification accuracy of any given supervised learning algorithm by using the available unlabeled examples. We call this as the Semi-supervised improvement problem, to distinguish the proposed approach from the existing approaches. We design a metasemi-supervised learning algorithm that wraps around the underlying supervised algorithm and improves its performance using unlabeled data. This problem is particularly important when we need to train a supervised learning algorithm with a limited number of labeled examples and a multitude of unlabeled examples. We present a boosting framework for semi-supervised learning, termed as SemiBoost. The key advantages of the proposed semi-supervised learning approach are: 1) performance improvement of any supervised learning algorithm with a multitude of unlabeled data, 2) efficient computation by the iterative boosting algorithm, and 3) exploiting both manifold and cluster assumption in training classification models. An empirical study on 16 different data sets and text categorization demonstrates that the proposed framework improves the performance of several commonly used supervised learning algorithms, given a large number of unlabeled examples.

The proposed receiver works on a block-by-block basis, where null subcarriers are used for Doppler compensation, pilot subcarriers are used for channel estimation, and a MIMO detector consisting of a hybrid use of successive interference cancellation and soft minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization is coupled with low-density parity-check (LDPC) channel decoding for iterative detection on each subcarrier.

Soil-moisture estimation by means of SAR is a topic that is intensively investigated but yet not solved satisfactorily. The key problem is the presence of vegetation cover which biases soil-moisture estimates. In this paper, we discuss the problem of soil-moisture estimation in the presence of agricultural vegetation by means of L-band PolSAR images. SAR polarimetry allows the decomposition of the scattering signature into canonical scattering components and their quantification. We discuss simple canonical models for surface, dihedral, and vegetation scattering and use them to model and interpret scattering processes. The performance and modifications of the individual scattering components are discussed. The obtained surface and dihedral components are then used to retrieve surface soil moisture. The investigations cover, for the first time, the whole vegetation-growing period for three crop types using SAR data and ground measurements acquired in the frame of the AgriSAR campaign.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2009642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4773468","Model-based decomposition;polarimetric SAR (PolSAR);scattering mechanisms;surface-soil-moisture estimation","Soil moisture;Vegetation mapping;Radar scattering;Electromagnetic scattering;Crops;Spaceborne radar;L-band;Surface waves;Remote monitoring","","259","","31","IEEE","3 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To estimate the object's location, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost because the classifier or similarity function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch and bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of quality functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in linear or even sublinear time, in contrast to the quadratic scaling of exhaustive or sliding window search. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and image retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest-neighbor classifiers based on the lambda2 distance.

With this modularization, low voltage stress on the electronic devices can be achieved, which means that there is less chance of a failure on the charge equalizer. The power rating selection is one of the most important design issues for a charge equalizer because it is very closely related to equalization time. To solve this problem optimally, this paper presents a power rating design guide.

First, an adaptive global threshold is selected to obtain an index matrix which labels whether each pixel of the image is a potential target pixel or not. Second, by using the index matrix, the clutter environment can be determined adaptively to prescreen the clutter pixels in the sliding window used for detecting. The $G^{0}$  distribution, which can model multilook SAR images within an extensive range of degree of homogeneity, is adopted as the statistical model of clutter in this paper. With the introduction of AC, the proposed algorithm gains good CFAR detection performance for homogeneous regions, clutter edge, and multitarget situations. Meanwhile, the corresponding fast algorithm greatly reduces the computational load. Finally, target clustering is implemented to obtain more accurate target regions. According to the theoretical performance analysis and the experiment results of typical real SAR images, the proposed algorithm is shown to be of good performance and strong practicability.

In this paper, we tackle this problem by jointly optimizing partial frequency reuse and load-balancing schemes in a multicell network. We formulate this problem as a network-wide utility maximization problem and propose optimal offline and practical online algorithms to solve this. Our online algorithm turns out to be a simple mixture of inter- and intra-cell handover mechanisms for existing users and user association control and cell-site selection mechanisms for newly arriving users. A remarkable feature of the proposed algorithm is that it uses a notion of expected throughput as the decision making metric, as opposed to signal strength in conventional systems. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our online algorithm can not only closely approximate network-wide proportional fairness but also provide two types of gain, interference avoidance gain and load balancing gain, which yield 20∼100% throughput improvement of boundary users (depending on traffic load distribution), while not penalizing total system throughput.We also demonstrate that this improvement cannot be achieved by conventional systems using universal frequency reuse and signal strength as the decision making metric.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.071140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5165320","Inter-cell interference (ICI), ICI avoidance, load balancing, association, network-wide proportional fairness, multi-cell network, network utility maximization.","Load management;Interference;Throughput;Frequency;Decision making;Next generation networking;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Physical layer;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic","","257","3","23","IEEE","21 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for adaptive enhancement and spatiotemporal upscaling of videos containing complex activities without explicit need for accurate motion estimation. Our approach is based on multidimensional kernel regression, where each pixel in the video sequence is approximated with a 3-D local (Taylor) series, capturing the essential local behavior of its spatiotemporal neighborhood. The coefficients of this series are estimated by solving a local weighted least-squares problem, where the weights are a function of the 3-D space-time orientation in the neighborhood. As this framework is fundamentally based upon the comparison of neighboring pixels in both space and time, it implicitly contains information about the local motion of the pixels across time, therefore rendering unnecessary an explicit computation of motions of modest size. The proposed approach not only significantly widens the applicability of super-resolution methods to a broad variety of video sequences containing complex motions, but also yields improved overall performance. Using several examples, we illustrate that the developed algorithm has super-resolution capabilities that provide improved optical resolution in the output, while being able to work on general input video with essentially arbitrary motion.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2009.2023703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967983","Denoising;frame rate upconversion;interpolation;kernel;local polynomial;nonlinear filter;nonparametric;regression;spatially adaptive;super-resolution","Motion estimation;Spatial resolution;Kernel;Video sequences;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Displays;Multidimensional systems;Nonlinear optics;Optical filters;Interpolation","","257","159","42","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Without energy, a sensor is essentially useless and cannot contribute to the utility of the network as a whole. Consequently, substantial research efforts have been spent on designing energy-efficient networking protocols to maximize the lifetime of WSNs. However, there are emerging WSN applications where sensors are required to operate for much longer durations (like years or even decades) after they are deployed. Examples include in-situ environmental/habitat monitoring and structural health monitoring of critical infrastructures and buildings, where batteries are hard (or impossible) to replace/recharge. Lately, an alternative to powering WSNs is being actively studied, which is to convert the ambient energy from the environment into electricity to power the sensor nodes. While renewable energy technology is not new (e.g., solar and wind) the systems in use are far too large for WSNs. Those small enough for use in wireless sensors are most likely able to provide only enough energy to power sensors sporadically and not continuously. Sensor nodes need to exploit the sporadic availability of energy to quickly sense and transmit the data. This paper surveys related research and discusses the challenges of designing networking protocols for such WSNs powered by ambient energy harvesting.","","978-1-4244-4066-5","10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5172411","","Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;Protocols;Renewable energy resources;Power generation;Solar power generation;Wind energy generation;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Power engineering and energy","","257","3","32","IEEE","24 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The degree of time/frequency localization, the existence of a mapping between scale and frequency, and the bias involved in estimating properties of modulated oscillatory signals, are proposed as important considerations. Wavelet behavior is found to be strongly impacted by the degree of asymmetry of the wavelet in both the frequency and the time domain, as quantified by the third central moments.

The three relevant time series are a weekly similarity time series, a daily similarity time series, and an hourly time series, which can be directly generated from the source time series. The MA, ES, and ARIMA models are selected to give predictions of the three relevant time series. The predictions that result from the different models are used as the basis of the NN in the aggregation stage. The output of the trained NN serves as the final prediction.

As a result, numerous approaches have been proposed with varying degrees of success. A class of approaches that has shown substantial promise is one that makes independent predictions regarding locations of the model's landmarks, which are combined by enforcing a prior over their joint motion. A common theme in innovations to this approach is the replacement of the distribution of probable landmark locations, obtained from each local detector, with simpler parametric forms. This simplification substitutes the true objective with a smoothed version of itself, reducing sensitivity to local minima and outlying detections. In this work, a principled optimization strategy is proposed where a nonparametric representation of the landmark distributions is maximized within a hierarchy of smoothed estimates. The resulting update equations are reminiscent of mean-shift but with a subspace constraint placed on the shape's variability.

The algorithm utilizes a combination of model-based estimation and kinematics-based estimation. Compared with previously published results on slip angle estimation, this present paper compensates for the presence of road bank angle and variations in tire-road characteristics.

The concept of opportunistic spectrum access is motivated by the frontier technology of cognitive radio which offers a tremendous potential to improve the utilization of the radio spectrum by implementing efficient sharing of the licensed spectrum. In this spectrum-sharing technology, a secondary user may utilize the primary user's licensed band as long as its interference to the primary receiver remains below a tolerable level. Herein, we consider that the secondary user's transmission has to adhere to limitations on the ensuing received power at the primary's receiver, and investigate the capacity gains offered by this spectrum-sharing approach in a Rayleigh fading environment. Specifically, we derive the fading channel capacity of a secondary user subject to both average and peak received-power constraints at the primary's receiver. In particular, considering flat Rayleigh fading, we derive the capacity and optimum power allocation scheme for three different capacity notions, namely, ergodic, outage, and minimum-rate, and provide closed-form expressions for these capacity metrics. Numerical simulations are conducted to corroborate our theoretical results.","1558-2248","","10.1109/T-WC.2009.070265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4786495","Cognitive radio;spectrum sharing;peak and average received-power constraints;ergodic capacity;outage capacity;minimum-rate capacity;fading channels","Fading;Cognitive radio;Interference;Radio spectrum management;Channel capacity;AWGN;Receivers;Rayleigh channels;Licenses;Frequency","","255","","24","IEEE","20 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Implementation of linear controllers on a digital signal processor is straightforward, but realization of fuzzy controllers increases computational burden and memory requirements. For the boost converter, the performance of the fuzzy controller was superior in some respects to that of the PID controllers.

In grid environments, applications are always regarded as workflows. The problem of scheduling workflows in terms of certain quality of service (QoS) requirements is challenging and it significantly influences the performance of grids. By now, there have been some algorithms for grid workflow scheduling, but most of them can only tackle the problems with a single QoS parameter or with small-scale workflows. In this frame, this paper aims at proposing an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to schedule large-scale workflows with various QoS parameters. This algorithm enables users to specify their QoS preferences as well as define the minimum QoS thresholds for a certain application. The objective of this algorithm is to find a solution that meets all QoS constraints and optimizes the user-preferred QoS parameter. Based on the characteristics of workflow scheduling, we design seven new heuristics for the ACO approach and propose an adaptive scheme that allows artificial ants to select heuristics based on pheromone values. Experiments are done in ten workflow applications with at most 120 tasks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.2001722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663112","Ant colony optimization (ACO);grid computing;workflow scheduling;Ant colony optimization (ACO);grid computing;workflow scheduling","Ant colony optimization;Quality of service;Processor scheduling;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Concurrent computing;Scheduling algorithm;Application software;Pervasive computing;Computer applications","","254","2","38","IEEE","31 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Actual retrieval coverage is mapped and explained in detail using representative global monthly data. Statistical comparisons are made with coincident aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (ANG) retrieval results from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. The relationship between these results and the ones previously obtained for MISR and MODIS individually, based on comparisons with coincident ground-truth observations, is established. For the data examined, MISR and MODIS each obtain successful aerosol retrievals about 15% of the time, and coincident MISR-MODIS aerosol retrievals are obtained for about 6%-7% of the total overlap region. Cloud avoidance, glint and oblique-Sun exclusions, and other algorithm physical limitations account for these results. For both MISR and MODIS, successful retrievals are obtained for over 75% of locations where attempts are made. Where coincident AOD retrievals are obtained over ocean, the MISR-MODIS correlation coefficient is about 0.9; over land, the correlation coefficient is about 0.7. Differences are traced to specific known algorithm issues or conditions. Over-ocean ANG comparisons yield a correlation of 0.67, showing consistency in distinguishing aerosol air masses dominated by coarse-mode versus fine-mode particles. Sampling considerations imply that care must be taken when assessing monthly global aerosol direct radiative forcing and AOD trends with these products, but they can be used directly for many other applications, such as regional AOD gradient and aerosol air mass type mapping and aerosol transport model validation. Users are urged to take seriously the published product data-quality statements.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2023115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5238530","Aerosols;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR);remote sensing","Aerosols;MODIS;Information retrieval;Optical imaging;Spectroradiometers;Geometrical optics;Image retrieval;Instruments;Clouds;Oceans","","253","1","39","IEEE","15 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If rejection occurred even at the highest resolution, another multilayer perceptron is used as the final attempt to recognize the input numeral by combining the outputs of three classifiers of the previous stages.

These heuristics select subsets of complementary classifiers that, when combined, can perform better than the whole ensemble. The pruning methods investigated are based on modifying the order of aggregation of classifiers in the ensemble. In the original bagging algorithm, the order of aggregation is left unspecified. When this order is random, the generalization error typically decreases as the number of classifiers in the ensemble increases. If an appropriate ordering for the aggregation process is devised, the generalization error reaches a minimum at intermediate numbers of classifiers. This minimum lies below the asymptotic error of bagging. Pruned ensembles are obtained by retaining a fraction of the classifiers in the ordered ensemble. The performance of these pruned ensembles is evaluated in several benchmark classification tasks under different training conditions. The results of this empirical investigation show that ordered aggregation can be used for the efficient generation of pruned ensembles that are competitive, in terms of performance and robustness of classification, with computationally more costly methods that directly select optimal or near-optimal subensembles.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479485","Ensembles of classifiers;bagging;decision trees;ensemble selection;ensemble pruning;ordered aggregation.;Ensembles of classifiers;Bagging;Decision trees;Ensemble Selection;Ensemble Pruning;Ordered Aggregation","Bagging;Boosting;Training data;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Fluctuations;Sampling methods;Noise robustness;Size measurement","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","253","","49","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, these needs have been addressed by using high-performance computing solutions and installed facilities such as clusters and super computers, which are difficult to setup, maintain, and operate. Cloud computing provides scientists with a completely new model of utilizing the computing infrastructure. Compute resources, storage resources, as well as applications, can be dynamically provisioned (and integrated within the existing infrastructure) on a pay per use basis. These resources can be released when they are no more needed. Such services are often offered within the context of a service level agreement (SLA), which ensure the desired quality of service (QoS).

Persuasion can be generally defined as an attempt to change another's beliefs or behavior. The act of influencing others is fundamental to nearly every type of social interaction. Any agent desiring to seamlessly operate in a social manner will need to incorporate this type of core human behavior. As in human interaction, myriad aspects of a humanoid robot's appearance and behavior can significantly alter its persuasiveness - this work will focus on one particular factor: gender. In the current study, run at the Museum of Science in Boston, subjects interacted with a humanoid robot whose gender was varied. After a short interaction and persuasive appeal, subjects responded to a donation request made by the robot, and subsequently completed a post-study questionnaire. Findings showed that men were more likely to donate money to the female robot, while women showed little preference. Subjects also tended to rate the robot of the opposite sex as more credible, trustworthy, and engaging. In the case of trust and engagement the effect was much stronger between male subjects and the female robot. These results demonstrate the importance of considering robot and human gender in the design of HRI.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-3803-7","10.1109/IROS.2009.5354116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5354116","","Human robot interaction;Intelligent robots;Humanoid robots;Psychology;Educational robots;USA Councils;Laboratories;Hospitals","","252","","28","IEEE","15 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hierarchical Bayesian models are used to connect three elements in visual surveillance: low-level visual features, simple ""atomic"" activities, and interactions. Atomic activities are modeled as distributions over low-level visual features, and multi-agent interactions are modeled as distributions over atomic activities. These models are learnt in an unsupervised way. Given a long video sequence, moving pixels are clustered into different atomic activities and short video clips are clustered into different interactions. In this paper, we propose three hierarchical Bayesian models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) mixture model, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) mixture model, and Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Dual-HDP) model. They advance existing language models, such as LDA [1] and HDP [2]. Our data sets are challenging video sequences from crowded traffic scenes and train station scenes with many kinds of activities co-occurring. Without tracking and human labeling effort, our framework completes many challenging visual surveillance tasks of board interest such as: (1) discovering typical atomic activities and interactions; (2) segmenting long video sequences into different interactions; (3) segmenting motions into different activities; (4) detecting abnormality; and (5) supporting high-level queries on activities and interactions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.87","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731265","Vision and Scene Understanding;Artificial Intelligence;Computing Methodologies;Video analysis;Machine learning;Motion;Applications;Statistical;Computer vision;Algorithms;Clustering;Pattern Recognition;Computing Methodologies","Layout;Bayesian methods;Video sequences;Surveillance;Linear discriminant analysis;Unsupervised learning;Traffic control;Tracking;Humans;Labeling","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;Whole Body Imaging","252","4","43","IEEE","31 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By showing that a bilateral filter can be decomposed into a number of constant time spatial filters, our method yields a new class of constant time bilateral filters that can have arbitrary spatial and arbitrary range kernels. In contrast, the current available constant time algorithm requires the use of specific spatial or specific range kernels. Also, our algorithm lends itself to a parallel implementation leading to the first real-time O(1) algorithm that we know of. Meanwhile, our algorithm yields higher quality results since we are effectively quantizing the range function instead of quantizing both the range function and the input image. Empirical experiments show that our algorithm not only gives higher PSNR, but is about 10× faster than the state-of-the-art. It also has a small memory footprint, needed only 2% of the memory required by the state-of-the-art for obtaining the same quality as exact using 8-bit images.

HEVs are currently commercially available and PHEVs will be the next phase in the evolution of hybrid and electric vehicles. The batteries of the PHEVs are designed to be charged at home, from a standard outlet in the garage, or on a corporate car park. The electrical consumption for charging PHEVs may take up to 5% of the total electrical consumption in Belgium by 2030. These extra electrical loads have an impact on the distribution grid which is analyzed in terms of power losses and voltage deviations. Firstly, the uncoordinated charging is described where the vehicles are charged immediately when they are plugged in or after a fixed start delay. This uncoordinated power consumption on a local scale can lead to grid problems. Therefore coordinated charging is proposed to minimize the power losses and to maximize the main grid load factor. The optimal charge profile of the PHEVs is computed by minimizing the power losses. The exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, so stochastic programming is introduced.","","978-1-4244-3810-5","10.1109/PSCE.2009.4839973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4839973","battery charging;distribution grid;load flow analysis;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;stochastic programming","Hybrid electric vehicles;Batteries;Stochastic processes;Ice;Power generation;Internal combustion engines;Energy consumption;Load forecasting;Global warming;Voltage","","252","3","10","IEEE","24 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We experimentally test HNB in terms of classification accuracy, using the 36 UCI data sets selected by Weka, and compare it to naive Bayes (NB), selective Bayesian classifiers (SBC), naive Bayes tree (NBTree), tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN), and averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE). The experimental results show that HNB significantly outperforms NB, SBC, NBTree, TAN, and AODE. In many data mining applications, an accurate class probability estimation and ranking are also desirable. We study the class probability estimation and ranking performance, measured by conditional log likelihood (CLL) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), respectively, of naive Bayes and its improved models, such as SBC, NBTree, TAN, and AODE, and then compare HNB to them in terms of CLL and AUC.

The system utilizes a new algorithm for laser-based leg detection using the onboard laser range finder (LRF). The approach is based on the recognition of typical leg patterns extracted from laser scans, which are shown to also be very discriminative in cluttered environments. These patterns can be used to localize both static and walking persons, even when the robot moves. Furthermore, faces are detected using the robot's camera, and the information is fused to the legs' position using a sequential implementation of unscented Kalman filter. The proposed solution is feasible for service robots with a similar device configuration and has been successfully implemented on two different mobile platforms. Several experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that robust human tracking can be performed within complex indoor environments.

This disqualifies some of the well known decision making models such as ldquoFictitious Playrdquo (FP), in which each player must monitor the individual actions of every other player and must optimize over a high dimensional probability space. We will show that Joint Strategy Fictitious Play (JSFP), a close variant of FP, alleviates both the informational and computational burden of FP. Furthermore, we introduce JSFP with inertia, i.e., a probabilistic reluctance to change strategies, and establish the convergence to a pure Nash equilibrium in all generalized ordinal potential games in both cases of averaged or exponentially discounted historical data. We illustrate JSFP with inertia on the specific class of congestion games, a subset of generalized ordinal potential games.

Propagation measurements are performed on real humans in a multipath environment, considering different parts of the body separately. In addition, path loss has been numerically investigated with an anatomically correct model of the human body in free space using a 3-D electromagnetic solver. Path loss parameters and time-domain channel characteristics are extracted from the measurement and simulation data. A semi-empirical path loss model is presented for an antenna height above the body of 5 mm and antenna separations from 5 cm up to 40 cm. A time-domain analysis is performed and models are presented for the mean excess delay and the delay spread.

Two alternative ¿iterative¿ harmonic-rejection (HR) techniques are presented to achieve high HR robust to mismatch: a) an analog two-stage polyphase HR concept, which enhances the HR to more than 60 dB; b) a digital adaptive interference cancelling (AIC) technique, which can suppress one dominating harmonic by at least 80 dB. An accurate multiphase clock generator is presented for a mismatch-robust HR. A proof-of-concept receiver is implemented in 65 nm CMOS. Measurements show 34 dB gain, 4 dB NF, and + 3.5 dBm in-band IIP3 while the out-of-band IIP3 is +16 dBm without fine tuning. The measured RF bandwidth is up to 6 GHz and the 8-phase LO works up to 0.9 GHz (master clock up to 7.2 GHz). At 0.8 GHz LO, the analog two-stage polyphase HR achieves a second to sixth order HR > 60 dB over 40 chips, while the digital AIC technique achieves HR > 80 dB for the dominating harmonic.

This paper introduces the improved greedy traffic-aware routing protocol (GyTAR), which is an intersection-based geographical routing protocol that is capable of finding robust and optimal routes within urban environments. The main principle behind GyTAR is the dynamic and in-sequence selection of intersections through which data packets are forwarded to the destinations. The intersections are chosen considering parameters such as the remaining distance to the destination and the variation in vehicular traffic. Data forwarding between intersections in GyTAR adopts an improved greedy carry-and-forward mechanism. Evaluation of the proposed routing protocol shows significant performance improvement in comparison with other existing routing approaches. With the aid of extensive simulations, we also validate the optimality and sensitivity of significant GyTAR parameters.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2024341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061874","Geographic routing;multihop communication;performance evaluation;traffic density;vehicular communication","Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicles;Roads;Ad hoc networks;Robustness;Traffic control;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless communication;Manufacturing","","248","2","30","IEEE","2 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our study shows that for the SMS structure with a ${\rm GeO}_{2}$-doped MMF there exists a critical wavelength on either side of which the spectrum shows opposite spectral shift with a change in temperature/strain, whereas for structures with a ${\rm P}_{2}{\rm O}_{5}$-doped MMF it shows monotonic red shift with increasing temperature/strain. It has been found that the critical wavelength shifts toward higher wavelengths with decreasing “ $q$” value/doping concentration. Using different MMFs, both the red and blue spectral shifts have been observed experimentally. It has also been found that the SMS structure has higher sensitivity toward this critical wavelength.

We propose a two-phase training protocol for channel estimation: in the first phase, the two terminals send their training signals concurrently to the relay; and in the second phase, the relay amplifies the received signal and broadcasts it to both terminals. Each terminal then estimates the channel parameters required for data detection. First, we assume the channel parameters to be deterministic and derive the maximum-likelihood (ML) -based estimator. It is seen that the newly derived ML estimator is nonlinear and differs from the conventional least-square (LS) estimator. Due to the difficulty in obtaining a closed-form expression of the mean square error (MSE) for the ML estimator, we resort to the Crameacuter-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the estimation MSE for design of optimal training sequence. Secondly, we consider stochastic channels and focus on the class of linear estimators. In contrast to the conventional linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) -based estimator, we introduce a new type of estimator that aims at maximizing the effective receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after taking into consideration the channel estimation errors, thus referred to as the linear maximum SNR (LMSNR) estimator. Furthermore, we prove that orthogonal training design is optimal for both the CRLB- and the LMSNR-based design criteria.

We present a multi-view approach to solving this problem. In our approach we neither detect nor track objects from any single camera or camera pair; rather evidence is gathered from all the cameras into a synergistic framework and detection and tracking results are propagated back to each view. Unlike other multi-view approaches that require fully calibrated views our approach is purely image-based and uses only 2D constructs. To this end we develop a planar homographic occupancy constraint that fuses foreground likelihood information from multiple views, to resolve occlusions and localize people on a reference scene plane. For greater robustness this process is extended to multiple planes parallel to the reference plane in the framework of plane to plane homologies. Our fusion methodology also models scene clutter using the Schmieder and Weathersby clutter measure, which acts as a confidence prior, to assign higher fusion weight to views with lesser clutter. Detection and tracking are performed simultaneously by graph cuts segmentation of tracks in the space-time occupancy likelihood data. Experimental results with detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis, are demonstrated in challenging multi-view, crowded scenes.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497204","Tracking;Sensor fusion;Tracking;Sensor fusion","Layout;Cameras;Object detection;Robustness;Shape;Fuses;Sensor fusion;Testing;Solid modeling;Pixel","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;Whole Body Imaging","247","13","64","IEEE","25 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in order to estimate soil moisture of a bare surface accurately from radar measurements, the effects of surface roughness must be compensated for properly. Several algorithms have been developed to estimate soil moisture from a polarimetric radar image, all with limited ranges of applicability. No theoretical algorithm has been reported to retrieve volumetric soil moisture of a vegetated surface. In this paper, we examine a different approach to estimate soil moisture that exploits the fact that the backscattering cross section from a natural object changes over short timescales mainly due to variations in soil moisture. We develop a model function that expresses copolarized backscattering cross sections (sigmahh and sigmavv) in terms of volumetric soil moisture using L-band experimental data for both bare and vegetated surfaces. In order to estimate soil moisture, two unknowns in the model function must be determined. We propose a viable approach to determine these two unknowns using combined radiometer and radar data. This time-series approach also provides a framework to utilize a priori knowledge on soil moisture to improve the retrieval accuracy of volumetric soil moisture. We demonstrate that this time-series algorithm is a simple and robust way to estimate soil moisture for both bare and vegetated surfaces.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2014944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4810143","Moisture;polarimetric radar;soil;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);time series","Soil moisture;Radar polarimetry;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Electromagnetic scattering;Backscatter;Dielectric constant;Radar scattering;Radar measurements;Radar cross section","","246","","21","IEEE","3 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technology of wireless power transfer requires three main elements: large air gaps, high efficiency and a large amount of power. Though, there has been no such technology, recently, the technology of electromagnetic resonant couplings was proposed and named WiTricity. With this technology there are large air gaps, high efficiency and large amounts of power. In this paper, the feasibility of wireless power transfer for EVs by electromagnetic resonance coupling is studied. We studied small sized antennas that can be equipped on the bottom of a vehicle and we studied the electrical characteristics of the antenna with equivalent circuits, electromagnetic analysis and experimentation. The length of the air gaps between a transmitting antenna and a receiving antenna affect resonance frequencies. The resonance frequency changes from two to one depending on the length of the air gap. Until a certain distance, maximum efficiencies are not changed. Large air gaps are weak couplings. In a weak coupling at resonance, magnetic resonance couplings can transfer energy with high efficiency. The specification results at high power are proposed.

We explore SpMV methods that are well-suited to throughput-oriented architectures like the GPU and which exploit several common sparsity classes. The techniques we propose are efficient, successfully utilizing large percentages of peak bandwidth. Furthermore, they deliver excellent total throughput, averaging 16 GFLOP/s and 10 GFLOP/s in double precision for structured grid and unstructured mesh matrices, respectively, on a GeForce GTX 285.

One of the main weak points of the FC is slow dynamics dominated by a temperature and fuel-delivery system (pumps, valves, and, in some cases, a hydrogen reformer). As a result, fast load demand will cause a high voltage drop in a short time, which is recognized as a fuel-starvation phenomenon. Therefore, to employ an FC in vehicle applications, the electrical system must have at least an auxiliary power source to improve system performance when electrical loads demand high energy in a short time. The possibilities of using a supercapacitor or a battery bank as an auxiliary source with an FC main source are presented in detail. The studies of two hybrid power systems for vehicle applications, i.e., FC/battery and FC/supercapacitor hybrid power sources, are explained. Experimental results with small-scale devices (a polymer electrolyte membrane FC of 500 W, 40 A, and 13 V; a lead-acid battery module of 33 Ah and 48 V; and a supercapacitor module of 292 F, 500 A, and 30 V) in a laboratory authenticate that energy-storage devices can assist the FC to meet the vehicle power demand and help achieve better performance, as well as to substantiate the excellent control schemes during motor-drive cycles.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2028571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5184856","Battery;converters;current control;electric vehicles;fuel cells (FCs);power supplies;supercapacitor;voltage regulation","Battery powered vehicles;Supercapacitors;Fuel storage;Vehicle dynamics;Temperature;Valves;Hydrogen;Voltage;Electric vehicles;System performance","","246","2","45","IEEE","31 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Neural networks are very powerful as nonlinear signal processors, but obtained results are often far from satisfactory. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the reasons for these frustrations and show how to make these neural networks successful. The following are the main challenges of neural network applications: (1) Which neural network architectures should be used? (2) How large should a neural network be? (3) Which learning algorithms are most suitable? The multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture is unfortunately the preferred neural network topology of most researchers. It is the oldest neural network architecture, and it is compatible with all training softwares. However, the MLP topology is less powerful than other topologies such as bridged multilayer perceptron (BMLP), where connections across layers are allowed. The error-back propagation (EBP) algorithm is the most popular learning algorithm, but it is very slow and seldom gives adequate results. The EBP training process requires 100-1,000 times more iterations than the more advanced algorithms such as Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) or neuron by neuron (NBN) algorithms. What is most important is that the EBP algorithm is not only slow but often it is not able to find solutions for close-to-optimum neural networks.

This paper investigates the use of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) to schedule a significant number of varied interruptible loads over 16 h. The scheduling objective is to achieve a system requirement of total hourly curtailments while satisfying the operational constraints of the available interruptible loads, minimizing the total payment to them and minimizing the frequency of interruptions imposed upon them. This multiobjective optimization problem was simplified by using a single aggregate objective function. The BPSO algorithm proved capable of achieving near-optimal solutions in manageable computational time-frames for this relatively complex, nonlinear and noncontinuous problem. The effectiveness of the approach was further improved by dividing the swarm into several subswarms. The proposed scheduling technique demonstrated useful performance for a relatively challenging scheduling task, and would seem to offer some potential advantages in scheduling significant numbers of widely varied and technically complex interruptible loads.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2021219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4914742","Load dispatch;load management;optimization methods;particle swarm optimization;scheduling","Particle swarm optimization;Job shop scheduling;Load management;Processor scheduling;Energy consumption;Security;Frequency;Aggregates;Optimization methods;Energy management","","245","","17","IEEE","12 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a convex model of converter dynamics is obtained taking into account uncertainty of parameters. In addition, the LQR control for switching converters is reviewed. In order to apply the LQR control in the uncertain converter case, we propose to optimize the performance index by using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As a consequence, a new robust control method for dc-dc converters is derived. This LMI-LQR control is compared with classical LQR control when designing a boost regulator.

Taylor","Atlantic Sciences LLC, Laurel, MD, USA",Journal of Lightwave Technology,"14 Apr 2009","2009","27","7","901","914","The advent of digital signal processing (DSP) to optical coherent detection means that more phase estimation options are available, compared to the earlier generation where phase-locked loops (PLLs) were invariably deployed in synchronous coherent receivers. Several phase estimation methods are numerically modeled: the maximum a posteriori (MAP) phase estimate, decision directed estimate, power law-Wiener filter estimate and power law-PLL estimate. An asynchronous coherent detection case is also modeled. The phase estimates are evaluated with respect to their tolerance of finite laser linewidth and their suitability for implementation in a parallel digital processor. Laser phase noise causes transmission system performance to be degraded by excess bit errors and cycle slips. The optimal phase estimate is the MAP estimate, and it is also included as a baseline. The power law-Wiener filter phase estimate is found to perform only marginally worse than the MAP estimate. It must be recast using a look-ahead computation to be implemented in a parallel digital processor, and the impact is investigated of the increase in the number of computations required. Differential logical detection is often used to reduce the impact of cycle slip events, and the implications of this operation on the bit error rate are studied. It is found that by choosing the correct FEC scheme differential logical detection does not increase the Q-factor penalty.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2008.927778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4814842","Coherent detection;optical communications;phase estimation;synchronous detection","Phase estimation;Optical signal processing;Optical detectors;Phase detection;Digital signal processing;Optical filters;Optical receivers;Power filters;Laser modes;Laser noise","","244","6","43","IEEE","14 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MCSA is a method for motor diagnosis with stator-current signals. Although it is one of the most powerful online methods for diagnosing motor faults, it has some drawbacks that can degrade the performance and accuracy of a motor-diagnosis system. In particular, it is very difficult to detect broken rotor bars when the motor is operating at low slip or under no load, due to fast Fourier transform (FFT) frequency leakage and the small amplitude of the current components related to the fault. Therefore, advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms are proposed. They consist of a proper sample selection algorithm, a Hilbert transformation of the stator-sampled current, and spectral analysis via FFT of the modulus of the resultant time-dependent vector modulus for achieving MCSA efficiently. Experimental results obtained on a 1.1 kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor are discussed.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2008.2003207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4749311","Discrete Hilbert transforms;fault diagnosis;induction motors;signal analysis","Rotors;Induction motors;Stators;Signal resolution;Signal analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Degradation;Leak detection;Fault detection;Bars","","243","","41","IEEE","13 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"What Makes APIs Hard to Learn? Answers from Developers","M. P. Robillard","McGill University, Canada",IEEE Software,"16 Oct 2009","2009","26","6","27","34","The paper discusses the application program interface (API). Most software projects reuse components exposed through APIs. In fact, current-day software development technologies are becoming inseparable from the large APIs they provide. An API is the interface to implemented functionality that developers can access to perform various tasks. APIs support code reuse, provide high-level abstractions that facilitate programming tasks, and help unify the programming experience. A study of obstacles that professional Microsoft developers faced when learning to use APIs uncovered challenges and resulting implications for API users and designers. The article focuses on the obstacles to learning an API. Although learnability is only one dimension of usability, there's a clear relationship between the two, in that difficult-to-use APIs are likely to be difficult to learn as well. Many API usability studies focus on situations where developers are learning to use an API. The author concludes that as APIs keep growing larger, developers will need to learn a proportionally smaller fraction of the whole. In such situations, the way to foster more efficient API learning experiences is to include more sophisticated means for developers to identify the information and the resources they need-even for well-designed and documented APIs.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5287006","API usability;software documentation;code examples;API design;empirical study","Programming profession;Usability;Application software","","243","3","9","IEEE","16 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we consider the joint optimization of waveforms and receiving filters in the MIMO radar for the case of extended target in clutter. A novel iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the waveforms and receiving filters such that the detection performance can be maximized. The corresponding iterative algorithms are also developed for the case where only the statistics or the uncertainty set of the target impulse response is available. These algorithms guarantee that the SINR performance improves in each iteration step.

In many real-life applications, however, a good approximation to the Pareto set (PS), which is the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the decision space, is also required by a decision maker. This paper considers a class of multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), in which the dimensionalities of the PS and the PF manifolds are different so that a good approximation to the PF might not approximate the PS very well. It proposes a probabilistic model-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called MMEA, for approximating the PS and the PF simultaneously for an MOP in this class. In the modeling phase of MMEA, the population is clustered into a number of subpopulations based on their distribution in the objective space, the principal component analysis technique is used to estimate the dimensionality of the PS manifold in each subpopulation, and then a probabilistic model is built for modeling the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the decision space. Such a modeling procedure could promote the population diversity in both the decision and objective spaces. MMEA is compared with three other methods, KP1, Omni-Optimizer and RM-MEDA, on a set of test instances, five of which are proposed in this paper. The experimental results clearly suggest that, overall, MMEA performs significantly better than the three compared algorithms in approximating both the PS and the PF.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2009.2021467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5208353","Estimation of distribution algorithm;multiobjective optimization;Pareto optimality;principal component analysis","Evolutionary computation;Principal component analysis;Space technology;Computer science;Phase estimation;Testing;Pareto optimization;Europe;Decision making;Design engineering","","242","","47","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is based on a unique active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy, which actively estimates and compensates for internal dynamic changes of the drive axis and external disturbances in real time. The stability analysis shows that both the estimation error and the tracking error of the drive axis output are bounded and that the upper bounds of the errors monotonously decrease with the increase of the controller bandwidth. The control system is simulated and tested using a field-programmable-gate-array-based digital implementation on a piezoelectric vibrational gyroscope. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller not only drives the drive axis to vibrate along the desired trajectory but also compensates for manufacture imperfections in a robust fashion that makes the performance of the gyroscope insensitive to parameter variations and noises.

This paper focuses on utilizing sparse and redundant representations for image sequence denoising. In the single image setting, the K-SVD algorithm is used to train a sparsifying dictionary for the corrupted image. This paper generalizes the above algorithm by offering several extensions: i) the atoms used are 3-D; ii) the dictionary is propagated from one frame to the next, reducing the number of required iterations; and iii) averaging is done on patches in both spatial and temporal neighboring locations. These modifications lead to substantial benefits in complexity and denoising performance, compared to simply running the single image algorithm sequentially.

In this paper, the prospects for these alternative technologies to displace HDDs in 2020 are analyzed. In order to compare technologies, projections were made of storage density and performance in year 2020 for both hard disks and the alternative technologies, assuming the alternative technologies could solve their remaining problems and assuming that hard drives would continue to advance areal density at a pace of about 40% per year, which would result in a two-disk 2.5-in disk drive that stores approximately 40 Terabytes and costs about $40. A major conclusion of the study is that to compete with hard drives on a cost per terabyte basis will be challenging for any solid state technology, because the ITRS lithography roadmap limits the density that most alternative technologies can achieve. Those technologies with the best opportunity have a small cell size and the capability of storing multiple bits per cell. Phase change random access memory (PCRAM) and spin transfer torque random access memory (STTRAM) appear to meet these criteria. PCRAMs are being marketed by at least one supplier and therefore appear to be closer to practical realization. On the other hand, STTRAMs would appear to have a performance edge assuming they, too, can be brought to market with multiple bits per cell. Although there are technologies that are not limited by the lithography roadmap and thus have greater areal density potential, they tend to be further from practical realization.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2009.2024163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5257331","Emerging alternative nonvolatile memory;hard disk drive;NAND flash","Nonvolatile memory;Costs;Hard disks;Drives;Phase change random access memory;Flash memory;Solid state circuits;Lithography;Random access memory;Data storage systems","","240","7","52","IEEE","22 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These models are obtained as solutions of a genetic programming (GP) process, where selection is guided by a tradeoff between two competing objectives - numerical accuracy and the order of nonlinearity. The latter is a novel complexity measure that adopts the notion of the minimal degree of the best-fit polynomial, approximating an analytical function with a certain precision. Using nine regression problems, this paper presents and illustrates two different strategies for the use of the order of nonlinearity in symbolic regression via GP. The combination of optimization of the order of nonlinearity together with the numerical accuracy strongly outperforms ldquoconventionalrdquo optimization of a size-related expressional complexity and the accuracy with respect to extrapolative capabilities of solutions on all nine test problems. In addition to exploiting the new complexity measure, this paper also introduces a novel heuristic of alternating several optimization objectives in a 2-D optimization framework. Alternating the objectives at each generation in such a way allows us to exploit the effectiveness of 2-D optimization when more than two objectives are of interest (in this paper, these are accuracy, expressional complexity, and the order of nonlinearity). Results of the experiments on all test problems suggest that alternating the order of nonlinearity of GP individuals with their structural complexity produces solutions that are both compact and have smoother response surfaces, and, hence, contributes to better interpretability and understanding.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2008.926486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632147","Complexity;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;extrapolation;genetic programming (GP);industrial data analysis;model selection","Genetic programming;Predictive models;Response surface methodology;Extrapolation;Testing;Industrial relations;Polynomials;Data analysis;Buildings;Electrical equipment industry","","240","10","46","IEEE","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three-dimensional SAR imaging, also known as SAR tomography, uses multiple views to profile the scattering power at different heights. This technique has been shown to be capable of separating interfering target responses on real data. Differential SAR tomography has been recently proposed as a technique that extends the potentialities of SAR tomography to the target deformation monitoring. It performs a 4-D space-velocity imaging that enables not only separating interfering targets in elevation but also distinguishing their single slow deformation velocities. This work addresses for the first time the application of 4-D SAR imaging to real data to determine the height and mean deformation velocity of single scatterers and double-scattering mechanisms interfering at high resolution in the same pixel. It also discusses the postprocessing steps required to identify the presence of stable single and double scatterers after elevation-velocity focusing.

UWB is typically applied to short-range and therefore mainly indoor communications in environments characterized usually by dense multipath propagation. For this type of environment, MIMO systems allow for a substantial increase of spectral efficiency by exploiting the inherent array gain and spatial multiplexing gain of the systems. In this paper, we provide a brief overview for UWB-MIMO wireless technology. The overview covers channel capacity, space-time coding (STC), and beamforming. It is shown that the spectral efficiency is increased logarithmically and linearly, respectively, for single transmit and multiple receive antennas (SIMO) and MIMO systems. For multiple transmit and single receive antenna (MISO) systems, a threshold for the data transmission rate exists such that the spatial multiplexing gain can be obtained if the data rate is lower than this threshold, but it is not beneficial to deploy multiple transmit antennas if the required data rate is higher than the threshold. Two STC schemes for UWB-MIMO are briefly discussed, and their performance comparison is presented. A discussion about antenna selection is also presented, and the performance comparison between antenna selection and equal gain combiner is provided showing the diversity gain for some scenarios. For the beamforming, it is shown that the optimal beamformer is obtained if all the weighting filters in each antenna branch are identical. About the optimal beamformer, it is found that the amplitude of the side lobe is independent of the ray incidence angle, and the amplitude of the main lobe is increased by a fold of the element number in the array. Three kinds of beam patterns are defined, and the beamwidth of the main lobe is given. Experimental results based on an offline testbed are provided to verify some analytical results presented in this paper. Since UWB-MIMO is still in its research infancy, the aim of this paper is to present some first results on spatial multiplexing, STC, and beamforming to illustrate the potential of UWB-MIMO.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2008.2008784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796281","Beamforming;channel capacity;MIMO;space–time coding;ultra-wide-band communications","Ultra wideband technology;MIMO;Receiving antennas;Array signal processing;Wireless communication;Indoor communication;Space technology;Channel capacity;Data communication;Transmitting antennas","","240","1","86","IEEE","27 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the imagery may have high spatial resolution, the spectral resolution is low when lightweight off-the-shelf digital cameras are used, and the inclusion of texture measures can potentially increase the classification accuracy. Texture measures have been used widely in pixel-based image analysis, but their use in an object-based environment has not been well documented. Our objectives were to determine the most suitable texture measures and the optimal image analysis scale for differentiating rangeland vegetation using UAV imagery segmented at multiple scales. A decision tree was used to determine the optimal texture features for each segmentation scale. Results indicated the following: (1) The error rate of the decision tree was lower; (2) prediction success was higher; (3) class separability was greater; and (4) overall accuracy was higher (high 90% range) at coarser segmentation scales. The inclusion of texture measures increased classification accuracies at nearly all segmentation scales, and entropy was the texture measure with the highest score in most decision trees. The results demonstrate that UAVs are viable platforms for rangeland monitoring and that the drawbacks of low-cost off-the-shelf digital cameras can be overcome by including texture measures and using object-based image analysis which is highly suitable for very high resolution imagery.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2009355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4773214","Object-based classification;rangelands;scale;texture;unmanned aircraft","Unmanned aerial vehicles;Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Image resolution;Spatial resolution;Image segmentation;Decision trees;Monitoring;Digital cameras;Protocols","","240","","43","IEEE","3 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dynamics, which include vibration and creep, are modeled using linear transfer functions. A frequency-based method is used to invert the linear model to find an input that compensates for vibration and creep. The inverse is noncausal for nonminimum-phase systems. Similarly, the hysteresis is handled by an inverse-Preisach model. To avoid the complexity of finding the inverse-Preisach model, high- gain feedback control can be used to linearize the system's behavior. A feedforward input is then combined with the feedback system to compensate for the linear dynamics to achieve high-speed AFM imaging. Finally, recent efforts in feedforward control for an SPM application including the use of iteration to handle hysteresis as well as uncertainties and variations in the system model is discussed.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2008.930922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753744","","Atomic force microscopy;Force control;Control systems;Hysteresis;Creep;Transfer functions;Frequency;Feedback control;Scanning probe microscopy;Uncertainty","","240","","47","IEEE","19 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The control scheme is based on a fuzzy rule-based body slip angle (beta) observer. In the design strategy of the fuzzy observer, the vehicle dynamics is represented by Takagi-Sugeno-like fuzzy models. Initially, local equivalent vehicle models are built using the linear approximations of vehicle dynamics for low and high lateral acceleration operating regimes, respectively. The optimal beta observer is then designed for each local model using Kalman filter theory. Finally, local observers are combined to form the overall control system by using fuzzy rules. These fuzzy rules represent the qualitative relationships among the variables associated with the nonlinear and uncertain nature of vehicle dynamics, such as tire force saturation and the influence of road adherence. An adaptation mechanism for the fuzzy membership functions has been incorporated to improve the accuracy and performance of the system.

"Sharing Spectrum Through Spectrum Policy Reform and Cognitive Radio","J. M. Peha","Department of Engineering and Public Policy and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",Proceedings of the IEEE,"14 Apr 2009","2009","97","4","708","719","Traditionally, interference protection is guaranteed through a policy of spectrum licensing, whereby wireless systems get exclusive access to spectrum. This is an effective way to prevent interference, but it leads to highly inefficient use of spectrum. Cognitive radio along with software radio, spectrum sensors, mesh networks, and other emerging technologies can facilitate new forms of spectrum sharing that greatly improve spectral efficiency and alleviate scarcity, if policies are in place that support these forms of sharing. On the other hand, new technology that is inconsistent with spectrum policy will have little impact. This paper discusses policies that can enable or facilitate use of many spectrum-sharing arrangements, where the arrangements are categorized as being based on coexistence or cooperation and as sharing among equals or primary-secondary sharing. A shared spectrum band may be managed directly by the regulator, or this responsibility may be delegated in large part to a license-holder. The type of sharing arrangement and the entity that manages it have a great impact on which technical approaches are viable and effective. The most efficient and cost-effective form of spectrum sharing will depend on the type of systems involved, where systems under current consideration are as diverse as television broadcasters, cellular carriers, public safety systems, point-to-point links, and personal and local-area networks. In addition, while cognitive radio offers policy-makers the opportunity to improve spectral efficiency, cognitive radio also provides new challenges for policy enforcement. A responsible regulator will not allow a device into the marketplace that might harm other systems. Thus, designers must seek innovative ways to assure regulators that new devices will comply with policy requirements and will not cause harmful interference.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2013033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4812027","Band manager;cognitive radio;commons;etiquette;interruptible access;opportunistic access;secondary spectrum market;spectrum policy;spectrum sharing;unlicensed","Cognitive radio;Interference;Regulators;Protection;Licenses;Wireless sensor networks;Software radio;Mesh networks;TV;Radio broadcasting","","240","23","61","IEEE","7 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional iris segmentation methods often involve an exhaustive search of a large parameter space, which is time consuming and sensitive to noise. To address these problems, this paper presents a novel algorithm for accurate and fast iris segmentation. After efficient reflection removal, an Adaboost-cascade iris detector is first built to extract a rough position of the iris center. Edge points of iris boundaries are then detected, and an elastic model named pulling and pushing is established. Under this model, the center and radius of the circular iris boundaries are iteratively refined in a way driven by the restoring forces of Hooke's law. Furthermore, a smoothing spline-based edge fitting scheme is presented to deal with noncircular iris boundaries. After that, eyelids are localized via edge detection followed by curve fitting. The novelty here is the adoption of a rank filter for noise elimination and a histogram filter for tackling the shape irregularity of eyelids. Finally, eyelashes and shadows are detected via a learned prediction model. This model provides an adaptive threshold for eyelash and shadow detection by analyzing the intensity distributions of different iris regions. Experimental results on three challenging iris image databases demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4586378","Biometrics;iris segmentation;reflection removal;eyelid localization;eyelash and shadow detection;edge fitting.;Iris Segmentation;Iris Recognition;Biometrics;Edge and feature detection;Segmentation;Image Processing and Computer Vision;Computing Methodologies","Biometrics;Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Eyelids;Filters;Eyelashes;Iris recognition;Feature extraction;Acoustic reflection;Detectors","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Iris;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Subtraction Technique","240","2","39","IEEE","1 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There were two reasons for the interest in this snake research: one is the scientific interest in the mechanism of the snake's motion and another is the engineering interest in the future applications of snake-like robots. There were already several studies on the motion of the snake; however, these were not satisfactory. The analytical method was not always consistent, and the analysis was done in somewhat artificial conditions, such as the motion of the snake in a maze with multiple pegs. So, I decided to perform a more precise analysis on standard serpentine motion. I was especially interested in the simplicity of its shape and the versatility of its function, because of its expected future applications. The simple cord-like body of the snake becomes a leg when it moves among rocks, a body when it moves from branch to branch, and a hand when it coils around a prey. From these features of the snake, I could imagine multiple applications in future. Figure 1 shows the expected applications I dreamed in those days. I used them in the oral defense of my doctor's degree dissertation in 1976. Figure 1(a) shows a downsized snake-like robot that can be utilized as an active endoscope to go into intestines. Figure 1(b) shows an active rope for a crane that automatically wraps around an object. Figure 1(c) is a polar exploration vehicle. It will glide on ice using ski blades, and the long body will enable it to cross over a crevasse. Figure 1(d) is an active hose that will approach a fire automatically using hydraulically actuated joints driven by the high-pressure water inside the hose. Figure 1(e) was drawn later for a children's book, which shows a snake-like robot that does amphibious work.

While palmprint-based personal authentication systems have been developed, they mostly deal with low resolution (about 100 ppi) palmprints and only perform full-to-full matching. We propose a latent-to-full palmprint matching system that is needed in forensics. Our system deals with palmprints captured at 500 ppi and uses minutiae as features. Latent palmprint matching is a challenging problem because latents lifted at crime scenes are of poor quality, cover small area of palms and have complex background. Other difficulties include the presence of many creases and a large number of minutiae in palmprints. A robust algorithm to estimate ridge direction and frequency in palmprints is developed. This facilitates minutiae extraction even in poor quality palmprints. A fixed-length minutia descriptor, MinutiaCode, is utilized to capture distinctive information around each minutia and an alignment-based matching algorithm is used to match palmprints. Two sets of partial palmprints (150 live-scan partial palmprints and 100 latents) are matched to a background database of 10,200 full palmprints to test the proposed system. Rank-1 recognition rates of 78.7% and 69%, respectively, were achieved for live-scan palmprints and latents.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641933","fingerprint;palmprint;fingerprint;palmprint","Forensics;Fingerprint recognition;Friction;Skin;Fingers;Layout;Frequency estimation;Spatial databases;Sweat glands;Epidermis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Dermatoglyphics;Hand;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","238","3","38","IEEE","10 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a systematic approach to quantitatively estimate the similarity characteristics for each alignment task and propose a strategy selection method to automatically combine the matching strategies based on two estimated factors. In the approach, we consider both textual and structural characteristics of ontologies.

We present a framework to combine the best of both worlds, coined BARINEL. The program is modeled using abstractions of program traces (as in SFL) while Bayesian reasoning is used to deduce multiple-fault candidates and their probabilities (as in MBD). A particular feature of BARINEL is the usage of a probabilistic component model that accounts for the fact that faulty components may fail intermittently. Experimental results on both synthetic and real software programs show that BARINEL typically outperforms current SFL approaches at a cost complexity that is only marginally higher. In the context of single faults this superiority is established by formal proof.","1938-4300","978-1-4244-5259-0","10.1109/ASE.2009.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431781","Software fault diagnosis;program spectra;statistical and reasoning approaches","Fault diagnosis;Bayesian methods;Mathematical model;Logic;Computational complexity;Costs;Debugging;Software engineering;Embedded software;Mathematics","","238","1","40","IEEE","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this case, when the potential channels are identical (except for the availability probabilities) and independent, it is shown that, although the intuitive sensing order (i.e., descending order of the channel availability probabilities) is optimal when adaptive modulation is not used, it does not lead to optimality in general with adaptive modulation. Thus, a dynamic programming approach to the search for an optimal sensing order with adaptive modulation is presented. For some special cases, it is proved that a simple optimal sensing order does exist. More complex scenarios are then considered, e.g., in which the availability probability of each channel is unknown. Optimal strategies are developed to address the challenges created by this additional uncertainty.

The widely accepted output capacitance loss term is found to be redundant and erroneous based on the new modeling and measurement results. In addition, the existing method of approximating switching times with the power MOSFET gate charge parameters grossly overestimates the switching power loss.

In this approach, participating end-systems (or peers) form a randomly connected mesh and incorporate swarming content delivery to stream live content. Despite the growing popularity of this approach, neither the fundamental design tradeoffs nor the basic performance bottlenecks in mesh-based P2P streaming are well understood. In this paper, we follow a performance-driven approach to design PRIME, a scalable mesh-based P2P streaming mechanism for live content. The main design goal of PRIME is to minimize two performance bottlenecks, namely bandwidth bottleneck and content bottleneck. We show that the global pattern of delivery for each segment of live content should consist of a diffusion phase which is followed by a swarming phase. This leads to effective utilization of available resources to accommodate scalability and also minimizes content bottleneck. Using packet level simulations, we carefully examine the impact of overlay connectivity, packet scheduling scheme at individual peers and source behavior on the overall performance of the system.

Four types of network connectivity are quantified: global message connectivity, worst-case connectivity, network bisection connectivity, and k-connectivity. The problems of UAV deployment and movement are formulated to improve the different types of connectivity. Both problems are NP-hard. For the deployment case, some heuristic adaptive schemes are proposed to yield simple but effective solutions. In addition, a closed-form solution for the two-node one-UAV case is provided. For k-connectivity, we propose an algorithm that improves connectivity using Delaunay triangulation. To optimize the UAV movement, an algorithm that tracks changes in the network topology is constructed. The simulation results show that by only deploying a single UAV, the global message network connectivity and the worst-case network connectivity can be improved by up to 109% and 60%, respectively. The network bisection connectivity and the k -connectivity can also be significantly improved.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2015953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787021","Ad hoc network;network connectivity;unmanned air vehicle (UAV)","Mobile ad hoc networks;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Quality of service;Land vehicles;Wireless networks;Closed-form solution;Tracking;Network topology;Microcontrollers;Batteries","","235","","25","IEEE","24 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We describe two measurement campaigns to measure a large number of multi-hop networks in an ensemble of environments. The measurements show statistically significant correlations among shadowing experienced on different links in the network, with correlation coefficients up to 0.33. Finally, we analyze multi-hop paths in three and four node networks using both correlated and independent shadowing models and show that independent shadowing models can underestimate the probability of route failure by a factor of two or greater.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.071293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200964","Wireless sensor, ad hoc, mesh networks, shadowing, correlation, statistical channel model, wireless communication, measurement, performance","Fading;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks;Shadow mapping;Wireless mesh networks;Physical layer;Analytical models;Mesh networks;Radio link;Failure analysis","","235","2","38","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since user tagging is known to be uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a fundamental problem is how to interpret the relevance of a user-contributed tag with respect to the visual content the tag is describing. Intuitively, if different persons label visually similar images using the same tags, these tags are likely to reflect objective aspects of the visual content. Starting from this intuition, we propose in this paper a neighbor voting algorithm which accurately and efficiently learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors. Under a set of well-defined and realistic assumptions, we prove that our algorithm is a good tag relevance measurement for both image ranking and tag ranking. Three experiments on 3.5 million Flickr photos demonstrate the general applicability of our algorithm in both social image retrieval and image tag suggestion. Our tag relevance learning algorithm substantially improves upon baselines for all the experiments. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising for real-world applications.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2009.2030598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5208328","Multimedia indexing and retrieval;neighbor voting;social tagging;tag relevance learning","Voting;Tagging;Image retrieval;Multimedia databases;Cultural differences;Image analysis;Indexing;Music information retrieval;Resource management","","235","7","46","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, based on 3-D motion error analysis, a novel 3-D MOCO method is proposed. The main idea is to extract necessary motion parameters, i.e., forward velocity and displacement in line-of-sight direction, from radar raw data, based on an instantaneous Doppler rate estimate.

It arises in a variety of settings, including subset selection in regression, graphical model selection, signal denoising, compressive sensing, and constructive approximation. The sample complexity of a given method for subset recovery refers to the scaling of the required sample size n as a function of the signal dimension p, sparsity index k (number of non-zeroes in beta*), as well as the minimum value betamin of beta* over its support and other parameters of measurement matrix. This paper studies the information-theoretic limits of sparsity recovery: in particular, for a noisy linear observation model based on random measurement matrices drawn from general Gaussian measurement matrices, we derive both a set of sufficient conditions for exact support recovery using an exhaustive search decoder, as well as a set of necessary conditions that any decoder, regardless of its computational complexity, must satisfy for exact support recovery. This analysis of fundamental limits complements our previous work on sharp thresholds for support set recovery over the same set of random measurement ensembles using the polynomial-time Lasso method (lscr1-constrained quadratic programming).","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2009.2032816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319750","Compressed sensing;$\ell_1$-relaxation;Fano's method;high-dimensional statistical inference;information-theoretic bounds;Lasso;model selection;signal denoising;sparsity pattern;sparsity recovery;subset selection;support recovery","Particle measurements;Decoding;Graphical models;Signal denoising;Size measurement;Gaussian noise;Sufficient conditions;Computational complexity;Polynomials;Quadratic programming","","234","","36","IEEE","17 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This new generation of detectors, based on pixellated cadmium telluride (CdTe) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detector arrays electrically connected to application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for readout, will produce fast and highly efficient photon-counting and energy-dispersive X-ray imaging. There are a number of applications that can greatly benefit from these novel imagers including mammography, planar radiography, and computed tomography (CT). Systems based on this new detector technology can provide compositional analysis of tissue through spectroscopic X-ray imaging, significantly improve overall image quality, and may significantly reduce X-ray dose to the patient. A very high X-ray flux is utilized in many of these applications. For example, CT scanners can produce ~ 100 Mphotons/mm2 /s in the unattenuated beam. High flux is required in order to collect sufficient photon statistics in the measurement of the transmitted flux (attenuated beam) during the very short time frame of a CT scan. This high count rate combined with a need for high detection efficiency requires the development of detector structures that can provide a response signal much faster than the transit time of carriers over the whole detector thickness. We have developed CdTe and CZT detector array structures which are 3 mm thick with 16 times 16 pixels and a 1 mm pixel pitch. These structures, in the two different implementations presented here, utilize either a small pixel effect or a drift phenomenon.

"On peak versus average interference power constraints for protecting primary users in cognitive radio networks","R. Zhang","Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore",IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,"2 May 2009","2009","8","4","2112","2120","This paper considers spectrum sharing for wireless communication between a cognitive radio (CR) link and a primary radio (PR) link. It is assumed that the CR protects the PR transmission by applying the so-called ldquointerference-temperaturerdquo constraint, whereby the CR is allowed to transmit regardless of the PR's on/off status provided that the resultant interference power level at the PR receiver is kept below some predefined threshold. For the fading PR and CR channels, the interference-power constraint at the PR receiver is usually one of the following two types: one is to regulate the average interference power (AIP) over all different fading states, while the other is to limit the peak interference power (PIP) at each fading state. From the CR's perspective, given the same average and peak power threshold, the AIP constraint is more favorable than the PIP counterpart because of its more flexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over different fading states. On the contrary, from the perspective of protecting the PR, the more restrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option than the AIP. Some surprisingly, this paper shows that in terms of various forms of capacity limits achievable for the PR fading channel, e.g., the ergodic and outage capacities, the AIP constraint is also superior over the PIP. This result is based upon an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, where randomized interference powers over the fading states in the AIP case are more advantageous over deterministic ones in the PIP case for minimizing the resultant PR capacity losses. Therefore, the AIP constraint results in larger fading channel capacities than the PIP for both the CR and PR transmissions.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.080714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4907474","Cognitive radio;spectrum sharing;interference temperature;interference diversity;fading channel capacity","Interference constraints;Protection;Cognitive radio;Chromium;Fading;Radio transmitters;Wireless communication;Channel capacity;Bandwidth;Relays","","233","","20","IEEE","2 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a new analysis method of the GCF signals is discussed for detection of the gait phases. Human gaits are complicated, and the gait phases cannot be exactly distinguished by comparing sensor outputs to a threshold. This paper proposes a method by fuzzy logic for detecting the gait phases continuously and smoothly. The smooth and continuous detection of the gait phases enables a full use of information obtained from GCF sensors. For advanced rehabilitation systems, this paper also introduces a higher level algorithm that quantitatively monitors the amount of abnormalities in a human gait. The abnormalities detected by the proposed method include an improper GCF pattern as well as an incorrect sequence of the gait phases. To realize the monitoring algorithm, the gait phases are analyzed as a vector and the abnormalities are detected by simple kinematic equations. The proposed methods are implemented by using signals from sensor-embedded shoes called smart shoes. Each smart shoe has four GCF sensors installed between the cushion pad and the sole. The GCF sensor applies an air pressure sensor connected to an air bladder. A gait monitoring system that integrates the proposed methods is shown in this paper and verified for both normal and abnormal gaits.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2008.2008803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4813239","Abnormality detection;gait monitoring device;human gait phase detection;smart shoes","Monitoring;Sensor systems;Footwear;Phase detection;Humans;Intelligent sensors;Force measurement;Phase measurement;Signal analysis;Fuzzy logic","","233","16","24","IEEE","10 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a network where stations are randomly and homogeneously located in the Euclidean plane, there is a way to tune the bias of the coin so as to obtain the best possible compromise between spatial reuse and per transmitter throughput. This paper shows how to address this questions using stochastic geometry and more precisely Poisson shot noise field theory. The theory that is developed is fully computational and leads to new closed form expressions for various kinds of spatial averages (like e.g. outage, throughput or transport). It also allows one to derive general scaling laws that hold for general fading assumptions. We exemplify its flexibility by analyzing a natural variant of Spatial Aloha that we call Opportunistic Aloha and that consists in replacing the coin tossing by an evaluation of the quality of the channel of each station to its receiver and a selection of the stations with good channels (e.g. fading) conditions. We show how to adapt the general machinery to this variant and how to optimize and implement it. We show that when properly tuned, Opportunistic Aloha very significantly outperforms Spatial Aloha, with e.g. a mean throughput per unit area twice higher for Rayleigh fading scenarios with typical parameters.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2009.090908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226963","MAC layer, multiple access, outage, throughput, transport capacity, network design, optimization, point process, signal to interference ratio, stochastic geometry, stochastic process","Stochastic processes;Throughput;Rayleigh channels;Access protocols;Mobile ad hoc networks;Magnetic heads;Transmitters;Stochastic resonance;Geometry;Fading","","232","","16","IEEE","28 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The PRNU is an intrinsic property of all digital imaging sensors due to slight variations among individual pixels in their ability to convert photons to electrons. Consequently, every sensor casts a weak noise-like pattern onto every image it takes. This pattern, which plays the role of a sensor fingerprint, is essentially an unintentional stochastic spread-spectrum watermark that survives processing, such as lossy compression or filtering. This tutorial explains how this fingerprint can be estimated from images taken by the camera and later detected in a given image to establish image origin and integrity. Various forensic tasks are formulated as a two-channel hypothesis testing problem approached using the generalized likelihood ratio test. The performance of the introduced forensic methods is briefly illustrated on examples to give the reader a sense of the performance.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2008.931078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4806203","","Digital images;Image sensors;Fingerprint recognition;Testing;Digital forensics;Object recognition;Joining processes;History;Forgery;Pixel","","232","12","22","IEEE","27 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Without requiring transformers, the scheme proposed here allows the use of a single dc power source (e.g., a battery or a fuel cell stack) with the remaining n-1 dc sources being capacitors, which is referred to as hybrid cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter (HCMLI) in this paper. It is shown that the inverter can simultaneously maintain the dc voltage level of the capacitors and choose a fundamental frequency switching pattern to produce a nearly sinusoidal output. HCMLI using only a single dc source for each phase is promising for high-power motor drive applications as it significantly decreases the number of required dc power supplies, provides high-quality output power due to its high number of output levels, and results in high conversion efficiency and low thermal stress as it uses a fundamental frequency switching scheme. This paper mainly discusses control of seven-level HCMLI with fundamental frequency switching control and how its modulation index range can be extended using triplen harmonic compensation.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2008.2006678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4783514","Fundamental frequency modulation control;hybrid cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter (HCMLI);triplen harmonic compensation","Frequency;Inverters;Thermal stresses;Power capacitors;Transformers;Batteries;Fuel cells;Voltage;Motor drives;Power supplies","","232","1","34","IEEE","13 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Attention is focused on the design of an H infin filter such that the filter error system is stochastically stable and preserves a guaranteed H infin performance. A basis-dependent Lyapunov function approach is developed to design the H infin filter. By introducing some slack matrix variables, the coupling between the Lyapunov matrix and the system matrices is eliminated, which greatly facilitates the filter-design procedure.

The desired signals may also be subject to distortion imposed by the acoustic room impulse responses (RIRs). In this paper, a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer is designed for extracting the desired signals from multimicrophone measurements. The beamformer satisfies two sets of linear constraints. One set is dedicated to maintaining the desired signals, while the other set is chosen to mitigate both the stationary and nonstationary interferences. Unlike classical beamformers, which approximate the RIRs as delay-only filters, we take into account the entire RIR [or its respective acoustic transfer function (ATF)]. The LCMV beamformer is then reformulated in a generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) structure, consisting of a fixed beamformer (FBF), blocking matrix (BM), and adaptive noise canceler (ANC). It is shown that for spatially white noise field, the beamformer reduces to a FBF, satisfying the constraint sets, without power minimization. It is shown that the application of the adaptive ANC contributes to interference reduction, but only when the constraint sets are not completely satisfied. We show that relative transfer functions (RTFs), which relate the desired speech sources and the microphones, and a basis for the interference subspace suffice for constructing the beamformer. The RTFs are estimated by applying the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) procedure to the power spectral density (PSD) matrices of the received signals and the stationary noise. A basis for the interference subspace is estimated by collecting eigenvectors, calculated in segments where nonstationary interfering sources are active and the desired sources are inactive. The rank of the basis is then reduced by the application of the orthogonal triangular decomposition (QRD). This procedure relaxes the common requirement for nonoverlapping activity periods of the interference sources. A comprehensive experimental study in both simulated and real environments demonstrates the performance of the proposed beamformer.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2016395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5109760","Array signal processing;interference cancellation;speech enhancement;subspace methods","Array signal processing;Working environment noise;Speech;Interference constraints;Acoustic noise;Transfer functions;Acoustic distortion;Signal design;Acoustic measurements;Distortion measurement","","232","10","41","IEEE","23 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this paper presents Bi-Histogram Equalization with a Plateau Level (BHEPL) as one of the options for the system that requires a short processing time image enhancement. First, BHEPL divides the input histogram into two independent sub-histograms. This is done in order to maintain the mean brightness. Then, these sub-histograms are clipped based on the calculated plateau value. By doing this, excessive enhancement can be avoided. Experimental results show that this method only requires 34.20ms, in average, to process images of size 3648x2736 pixels (i.e. 10 Mega pixels images).

Because of the limited amount of radiation tissues can be exposed to, existing reconstruction algorithms for circular tomography require a great number of measurements and averaging, implying long acquisition times. Time-resolved PA imaging is therefore possible only at the cost of complex and expensive electronics. This paper suggests a new reconstruction strategy using the compressed sensing formalism which states that a small number of linear projections of a compressible image contain enough information for reconstruction.

Recent developments show that actuators based on active fluids, such as the magnetorheological (MR) fluids, can be viable alternatives in haptics. But these devices are desk- or floor-mounted and use relatively large MR brakes. In this research, we developed a compact MR brake that is about 25 mm in diameter, weighs 84 g, and can apply up to 899 Nmiddotmm torque. The compact size was achieved by stacking steel and aluminum rings to create a serpentine flux path through the fluid. Six brakes were used to build a force feedback glove called MR glove. The glove weighs 640 g and does not require any remote actuators. Results of usability experiments showed that the MR glove improved task completion times in grasping virtual objects and could convey stiffness information to the user.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2008.2010934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4806267","Force feedback;haptics;magnetorheological fluid (MRF);virtual reality (VR)","Haptic interfaces;Virtual reality;Actuators;Force feedback;Magnetic sensors;Cables;Lighting control;Man machine systems;Magnetic flux;Torque","","230","9","35","IEEE","27 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this investigation, wind turbine generators, photovoltaic panels, and storage batteries are used to build hybrid generation systems that are optimal in terms of multiple criteria including cost, reliability, and emissions. Multicriteria design facilitates the decision maker to make more rational evaluations. In this study, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to derive these nondominated solutions. Hybrid generation systems under different design scenarios are designed based on the proposed approach. First, a grid-linked hybrid system is designed without incoroprating system uncertainties. Then, adequacy evaluation is conducted based on probabilistic methods by accounting for equipment failures, time-dependent sources of energy, and stochastic generation/load variations. In particular, due to the unpredictability of wind speed and solar insolation as well as the random load variation, time-series models are adopted to reflect their stochastic characteristics. An adequacy evaluation procedure including time-dependent sources, is adopted. Sensitivity studies are also carried out to examine the impacts of different system parameters on the overall design performance.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2008.2005280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4749288","Adequacy evaluation;hybrid power generation system;multicriteria design;particle swarm optimization;probabilistic method;renewable energy;time-series models","Algorithm design and analysis;Power generation;Particle swarm optimization;Wind energy generation;Photovoltaic systems;Hybrid power systems;Wind power generation;Solar power generation;Stochastic processes;Load management","","230","1","24","IEEE","13 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, since the airgap field is produced by the stator-magnets alone, it is difficult to be regulated. Hence, a hybrid excitation method, i.e., by introducing a set of field windings into FSPM motor is employed. In this paper, a novel hybrid excitation flux-switching (HEFS) motor is proposed, in which the airgap field can be easily controlled and is favorable for hybrid vehicles. The preliminary topology, operation principle, design and static characteristics including phase flux-linkage, back-EMF waveforms under different excitations as well as cogging torque are evaluated based on finite element (FE) analysis.

Donor levels (E d) and densities (N D) are estimated by numerical calculations of free electron densities (n e) obtained by Hall measurements. It shows that the donor levels are rather deep, ~0.15 eV for c-IGZO and ~0.11 eV for a-IGZO. This analysis indicates that use of a simple analytical relation of ne prop exp(-Ed/2kT) can not always be used to estimate E d and N D even for a low n e film because the film can be in the saturation regime at room temperature if E d and N D are small, which is actually the case for a-IGZO. The temperature dependences of electron mobilities are analyzed using an analytical equation of the percolation conduction model, which reveals that distributed potential barriers exist above mobility edges in IGZO with average heights 30-100 meV and distribution widths 5-20 meV, which depend on atomic structure and deposition condition of IGZO films. High-quality a-IGZO films have the lowest potential barriers among the IGZO films examined, in spite that a-IGZO has a more disordered amorphous structure than c-IGZO have. It is explained by the partly disordered structure of c-IGZO.","1558-9323","","10.1109/JDT.2009.2022064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5331948","Amorphous-oxide semiconductor (AOS);percolation conduction;potential barrier;Hall effect","Crystallization;Amorphous materials;Analytical models;Zinc oxide;Density measurement;Temperature dependence;Temperature distribution;Electron mobility;Equations;Atomic layer deposition","","229","","37","IEEE","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To thwart 2O-DPA, higher order masking may be employed but it implies a nonnegligible overhead. In this context, there is a need to know how efficient a 2O-DPA can be, in order to evaluate the resistance of an implementation that uses first order masking and, possibly, some hardware countermeasures. Different methods of mounting a practical 2O-DPA attack have been proposed in the literature. However, it is not yet clear which of these methods is the most efficient. In this paper, we give a formal description of the higher order DPA that are mounted against software implementations. We then introduce a framework in which the attack efficiencies may be compared. The attacks we focus on involve the combining of several leakage signals and the computation of correlation coefficients to discriminate the wrong key hypotheses. In the second part of this paper, we pay particular attention to 2O-DPA that involves the product combining or the absolute difference combining. We study them under the assumption that the device leaks the Hamming weight of the processed data together with an independent Gaussian noise. After showing a way to improve the product combining, we argue that in this model, the product combining is more efficient not only than absolute difference combining, but also than all the other combining techniques proposed in the literature.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2009.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752810","Embedded systems security;cryptographic implementations;side-channel analysis;higher order differential power analysis.","Correlation;Optimized production technology;Hamming weight;Noise;Analytical models;Random variables;Computational modeling","","229","12","26","IEEE","19 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

IEEE 802.16e based WiMAX networks promise the best available quality of experience for mobile data service users. Unlike wireless LANs, WiMAX networks incorporate several quality of service (QoS) mechanisms at the Media Access Control (MAC) level for guaranteed services for data, voice and video. The problem of assuring QoS is basically that of how to allocate available resources among users in order to meet the QoS criteria such as delay, delay jitter and throughput requirements. IEEE standard does not include a standard scheduling mechanism and leaves it for implementer differentiation. Scheduling is, therefore, of special interest to all WiMAX equipment makers and service providers. This paper discusses the key issues and design factors to be considered for scheduler designers. In addition, we present an extensive survey of recent scheduling research. We classify the proposed mechanisms based on the use of channel conditions. The goals of scheduling are to achieve the optimal usage of resources, to assure the QoS guarantees, to maximize goodput and to minimize power consumption while ensuring feasible algorithm complexity and system scalability.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2009.090207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4769391","IEEE 802.16e, Mobile WiMAX, QoS, Resource Allocation, Scheduling, WiMAX","WiMAX;Quality of service;Mobile communication;OFDM;Resource management;Downlink;Delay","","228","1","81","IEEE","2 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We aim to maximize the minimum of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of the SUs, subject to the constraints of the total SU transmit power and the received interference power at the primary users (PUs) by optimizing the beamforming vectors at the SU transmitter based on imperfect channel state information (CSI). To model the uncertainty in CSI, we consider a bounded region for both cases of channel matrices and channel covariance matrices. As such, the optimization is done while satisfying the interference constraints for all possible CSI error realizations. We shall first derive equivalent conditions for the interference constraints and then convert the problems into the form of semi-definite programming (SDP) with the aid of rank relaxation, which leads to iterative algorithms for obtaining the robust optimal beamforming solution. Results demonstrate the achieved robustness and the performance gain over conventional approaches and that the proposed algorithms can obtain the exact robust optimal solution with high probability.

This is achieved through extracting holistic features from clouds of interest points accumulated over multiple temporal scales followed by automatic feature selection. Our approach avoids the non-trivial problems of selecting the optimal space-time descriptor, clustering algorithm for constructing a codebook, and selecting codebook size faced by previous interest points based methods.

In this paper, we introduce the complex LLL algorithm for direct application to reducing the basis of a complex lattice which is naturally defined by a complex-valued channel matrix. We derive an upper bound on proximity factors, which not only show the full diversity of complex LLL reduction-aided detectors, but also characterize the performance gap relative to the lattice decoder. Our analysis reveals that the complex LLL algorithm can reduce the complexity by nearly 50% compared to the traditional LLL algorithm, and this is confirmed by simulation.

In order to maintain the spatial rights of the primary data relation, we avoid layout adjustment techniques that improve set cluster continuity and density. Instead, we use a continuous, possibly concave, isocontour to delineate set membership, without disrupting the primary layout. Optimizations minimize cluster overlap and provide for calculation of the isocontours at interactive speeds.

A key and still open issue in iris recognition is how best to represent such textural information using a compact set of features (iris features). In this paper, we propose using ordinal measures for iris feature representation with the objective of characterizing qualitative relationships between iris regions rather than precise measurements of iris image structures. Such a representation may lose some image-specific information, but it achieves a good trade-off between distinctiveness and robustness. We show that ordinal measures are intrinsic features of iris patterns and largely invariant to illumination changes. Moreover, compactness and low computational complexity of ordinal measures enable highly efficient iris recognition. Ordinal measures are a general concept useful for image analysis and many variants can be derived for ordinal feature extraction. In this paper, we develop multilobe differential filters to compute ordinal measures with flexible intralobe and interlobe parameters such as location, scale, orientation, and distance. Experimental results on three public iris image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ordinal feature models.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641931","Biometrics;feature representation;iris recognition;multilobe differential filter;ordinal measures.;Biometrics;Iris Recognition","Iris recognition;Humans;Authentication;Robustness;Lighting;Computational complexity;Image texture analysis;Feature extraction;Filters;Image databases","Algorithms;Biometric Identification;Biometric Identification;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Iris","224","2","42","IEEE","10 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For local feature extraction, Gabor wavelets are exploited considering their biological relevance. After that, Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) is separately applied to the global Fourier features and each local patch of Gabor features. Thus, multiple FLD classifiers are obtained, each embodying different facial evidences for face recognition. Finally, all these classifiers are combined to form a hierarchical ensemble classifier. We evaluate the proposed method using two large-scale face databases: FERET and FRGC version 2.0.

We approach this problem using a gradient-based scheduling framework. Physical layer resources (bandwidth and power) are allocated to maximize the projection onto the gradient of a total system utility function which models application-layer Quality of Service (QoS). This is formulated as a convex optimization problem and solved using a dual decomposition approach.

Our approach accounts for the following two characteristics that sharply distinguish mm wave networking from that at lower carrier frequencies. First, mm wave links are inherently directional: directivity is required to overcome the higher path loss at smaller wavelengths, and it is feasible with compact, low-cost circuit board antenna arrays. Second, indoor mm wave links are highly susceptible to blockage because of the limited ability to diffract around obstacles such as the human body and furniture. We develop a diffraction-based model to determine network link connectivity as a function of the locations of stationary and moving obstacles. For a centralized WPAN controlled by an access point, it is shown that multihop communication, with the introduction of a small number of relay nodes, is effective in maintaining network connectivity in scenarios where single-hop communication would suffer unacceptable outages. The proposed multihop MAC protocol accounts for the fact that every link in the WPAN is highly directional, and is shown, using packet level simulations, to maintain high network utilization with low overhead.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2009.091010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5262296","Wireless personal area networks (WPAN), Millimeter wave WPANs, Millimeter wave propagation, 60 GHz  networks, Medium Access Control (MAC).

To define the edit operations, we use the paradigm of a graphical editing process and end up with a dynamic programming algorithm that we call time warp edit distance (TWED). TWED is slightly different in form from dynamic time warping (DTW), longest common subsequence (LCSS), or edit distance with real penalty (ERP) algorithms. In particular, it highlights a parameter that controls a kind of stiffness of the elastic measure along the time axis. We show that the similarity provided by TWED is a potentially useful metric in time series retrieval applications since it could benefit from the triangular inequality property to speed up the retrieval process while tuning the parameters of the elastic measure. In that context, a lower bound is derived to link the matching of time series into down sampled representation spaces to the matching into the original space. The empiric quality of the TWED distance is evaluated on a simple classification task. Compared to edit distance, DTW, LCSS, and ERP, TWED has proved to be quite effective on the considered experimental task.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.76","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479483","Pattern recognition;time series;algorithms;similarity measures.;Similarity measures;Dynamic programming","Extraterrestrial measurements;Time measurement;Enterprise resource planning;Particle measurements;Monitoring;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Computer Society;Costs;Discrete transforms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;Time Factors","224","","37","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The contribution of the different polarimetric indicators is estimated through a greedy forward and backward method. Results have been assessed with AIRSAR polarimetric data polarimetric data acquired over a dense tropical environment. The results are compared to those obtained with the standard Wishart approach, for single frequency and multifrequency bands.

The techniques to recover a good image from the contaminated one are called image destriping (for stripes) and image inpainting (for dead pixels). This paper presents a maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based algorithm for both destriping and inpainting problems. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it can constrain the solution space according to a priori knowledge during the destriping and inpainting processes. In the MAP framework, the likelihood probability density function (PDF) is constructed based on a linear image observation model, and a robust Huber-Markov model is used as the prior PDF. The gradient descent optimization method is employed to produce the desired image. The proposed algorithm has been tested using moderate resolution imaging spectrometer images for destriping and China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite and QuickBird images for simulated inpainting. The experiment results and quantitative analyses verify the efficacy of this algorithm.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2005780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4703209","Destriping;inpainting;maximum a posteriori (MAP);remotely sensed image;Destriping;inpainting;maximum a posteriori (MAP);remotely sensed image","Pixel;Probability density function;Robustness;Optimization methods;Testing;Image resolution;Spectroscopy;Earth;Satellites;Algorithm design and analysis","","223","","26","IEEE","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To support effective learning, an e-learning system should be able to discover and make use of the semantic communities and the emerging semantic relations in a dynamic complex network of learning resources. Previous graph-based community discovery approaches are limited in ability to discover semantic communities. This paper first suggests the semantic link network (SLN), a loosely coupled semantic data model that can semantically link resources and derive out implicit semantic links according to a set of relational reasoning rules. By studying the intrinsic relationship between semantic communities and the semantic space of SLN, approaches to discovering reasoning-constraint, rule-constraint, and classification-constraint semantic communities are proposed. Further, the approaches, principles, and strategies for discovering emerging semantics in dynamic SLNs are studied. The basic laws of the semantic link network motion are revealed for the first time. An e-learning environment incorporating the proposed approaches, principles, and strategies to support effective discovery and learning is suggested.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564467","Community discovery;e-learning;emerging semantics;semantic community;Semantic Link Network.;Computer Applications;Education","Electronic learning;Data models;Web sites;Service oriented architecture;Organizing;Complex networks;Image resolution;Videos;Relational databases","","223","1","43","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Just-noticeable distortion (JND) profile is an efficient model to represent those perceptual redundancies. Human eyes are usually not sensitive to the distortion below the JND threshold. In this paper, a DCT based JND model for monochrome pictures is proposed. This model incorporates the spatial contrast sensitivity function (CSF), the luminance adaptation effect, and the contrast masking effect based on block classification. Gamma correction is also considered to compensate the original luminance adaptation effect which gives more accurate results. In order to extend the proposed JND profile to video images, the temporal modulation factor is included by incorporating the temporal CSF and the eye movement compensation. Moreover, a psychophysical experiment was designed to parameterize the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed model is consistent with the human visual system (HVS). Compared with the other JND profiles, the proposed model can tolerate more distortion and has much better perceptual quality. This model can be easily applied in many related areas, such as compression, watermarking, error protection, perceptual distortion metric, and so on.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2013518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4783051","Contrast sensitivity function (CSF);discrete cosine transform (DCT);gamma correction;just-noticeable distortion (JND)","Discrete cosine transforms;Video compression;Redundancy;Humans;Compression algorithms;Eyes;Psychology;Visual system;Watermarking;Protection","","223","3","36","IEEE","13 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a comprehensive list of landmarks is mined from two sources: (1) ~20 million GPS-tagged photos and (2) online tour guide Web pages. Candidate images for each landmark are then obtained from photo sharing Websites or by querying an image search engine. Second, landmark visual models are built by pruning candidate images using efficient image matching and unsupervised clustering techniques. Finally, the landmarks and their visual models are validated by checking authorship of their member images. The resulting landmark recognition engine incorporates 5312 landmarks from 1259 cities in 144 countries.

However, in a grid-connected system, an LCL filter may cause resonance which is a disaster for the system's stability. In order to solve the problem, a two-current-loop control strategy, which includes grid-current outer loop and filter-capacitor-current inner loop, is adopted here. The implementation of this strategy is easy, but the tuning procedure is complex since the outer and inner controllers cannot cooperate well if the parameters of the controllers are not suitable. There is no literature which mentions a method to help give out accurate parameters of the controller. The difficulty of designing the controller is that only two feedbacks cannot provide complete information of a three-order LCL filter. A specific method is proposed in this paper to design the controller. The advantage of this method is to provide a way to maximize the utilization of the two feedbacks to get good system performance through parameter determination. The practicability of the method is tested by using bode diagram, and the antidistortion ability of the system is analyzed. Finally, experimental results verify the availability and correctness of the proposed method.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2009.2021175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4909027","Grid connected;LCL filter;renewable energy generation;two-current-loop controller","Control systems;Inverters;Feedback;Switching frequency;Power harmonic filters;Resonance;Stability;Information filtering;Information filters;System performance","","222","2","22","IEEE","5 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the design of a simple and robust ADAS in mind, we are interested in determining the most important driver cues for distinguishing driver intent. Eye gaze may provide a more accurate proxy than head movement for determining driver attention, whereas the measurement of head motion is less cumbersome and more reliable in harsh driving conditions. We use a lane-change intent-prediction system (McCall et al., 2007) to determine the relative usefulness of each cue for determining intent. Various combinations of input data are presented to a discriminative classifier, which is trained to output a prediction of probable lane-change maneuver at a particular point in the future. Quantitative results from a naturalistic driving study are presented and show that head motion, when combined with lane position and vehicle dynamics, is a reliable cue for lane-change intent prediction. The addition of eye gaze does not improve performance as much as simpler head dynamics cues. The advantage of head data over eye data is shown to be statistically significant (p < 0.01) 3 s ahead of lane-change situations, indicating that there may be a biological basis for head motion to begin earlier than eye motion during ""lane-change""-related gaze shifts.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2009.2026675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5173535","Driver-assistance systems;driver behavior;driver intent inference;intelligent vehicles;machine vision;sparse Bayesian learning","Magnetic heads;Vehicle dynamics;Road accidents;Intelligent sensors;Intelligent systems;Robustness;Intelligent vehicles;Alarm systems;Sensor systems;Intelligent transportation systems","","221","4","46","IEEE","24 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a sigma-point Kalman smoother (SPKS)-based location and tracking algorithm as a superior alternative for indoor positioning. The proposed SPKS fuses a dynamic model of human walking with a number of low-cost sensor observations to track 2-D position and velocity. Available sensors include Wi-Fi received signal strength indication (RSSI), binary infra-red (IR) motion sensors, and binary foot-switches.

This model consists of two phases: In the first phase, the secondary user (SU) listens to the spectrum allocated to the primary user (PU) to detect the state of the PU; in the second phase, the SU adapts its transit power based on the sensing results. If the PU is inactive, the SU allocates the transmit power based on its own benefit. However, if the PU is active, the interference power constraint is imposed to protect the PU. Under this new model, the evaluation of the ergodic capacity of the SU is formulated as an optimization problem over the transmit power and the sensing time. Due to the complexity of this problem, two simplified versions, which are referred to as the perfect sensing case and the imperfect sensing case, are studied in this paper. For the perfect sensing case, the Lagrange dual decomposition is applied to derive the optimal power allocation policy to achieve the ergodic capacity. For the imperfect sensing case, an iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal sensing time and the corresponding power allocation strategy. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the proposed studies. It is shown that the SU can achieve a significant capacity gain under the proposed model, compared with that under the opportunistic spectrum access or the conventional spectrum sharing model.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2018258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804658","Cognitive radio (CR);convex optimization;dual decomposition;ergodic capactiy;fading channels;opportunistic spectrum access;optimal power control;spectrum sharing","Cognitive radio;Chromium;Radio spectrum management;Senior members;Phase detection;Interference constraints;Protection;Constraint optimization;Lagrangian functions;Iterative algorithms","","220","","12","IEEE","24 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A within-subject controlled user study examined professional military mechanics using our system to complete 18 common tasks under field conditions. These tasks included installing and removing fasteners and indicator lights, and connecting cables, all within the cramped interior of an armored personnel carrier turret. An augmented reality condition was tested against two baseline conditions: an untracked headworn display with text and graphics and a fixed flat panel display representing an improved version of the laptop-based documentation currently employed in practice. The augmented reality condition allowed mechanics to locate tasks more quickly than when using either baseline, and in some instances, resulted in less overall head movement.

The proposed method indirectly generates the compensation current reference by using an equivalent conductance of the fundamental component using APF's dc-link voltage control. The proposed control can selectively choose harmonic current components by real-time fast Fourier transform to generate the compensation current. The compensation current is represented in a rotating coordinate system with chosen switching states from a switching table implemented in a field-programmable gate array. In addition, a three-phase four-wire APF based on a three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter is also presented. The proposed APF eliminates harmonics in all three phases as well as the neutral current. A three-phase three-wire NPC inverter system can be used as a three-phase four-wire system since the split dc capacitors provide a neutral connection. To regulate and balance the split dc-capacitor voltages, a new control method using a sign cubical hysteresis controller is proposed. The characteristics of the APF system with an LCL-ripple filter are investigated and compared with traditional current control strategies to evaluate the inherent advantages.

In contrast to previously reported work, where the effect of interference is ignored, the effect of multi-user interference in AF schemes is analyzed. It is shown that the interference changes the statistical description of the conventional AF protocol and a statistical expression is subsequently derived. Asymptotic analysis of the expression shows that interference limits the diversity gain of the system and the related channel capacity is bounded by a stationary point. In addition, it is proven that previously proposed relay selection criteria for multi-relay scenarios become inefficient in the presence of interference. Based on consideration of the interference term, two extensions to the conventional max-min selection scheme suitable for different system setups are proposed. The extensions investigated are appropriate for legacy architectures with limitations on their flexibility where the max-min operation is pre-designed. A theoretical framework for selecting when to apply the proposed selection criteria is also presented. The algorithm investigated is based on some welldefined capacity approximations and incorporates the outage probabilities averaged over the fading statistics.

To obtain ZVS with the proposed modulation strategy, the buck+boost inductance is selected and the switches are gated in a way that the inductor current has a negative offset current at the beginning and the end of each pulse period. This allows the MOSFET switches to turn on when the antiparallel body diode is conducting. As the novel modulation strategy is a software-only solution, there are no additional expenses for the active or passive components compared to conventional modulation implementations. Furthermore, an analytical and simulation investigation predicts an excellent efficiency over the complete operating range and a higher power density for a nonisolated multiphase converter equipped with the low-loss modulation. Experimental measurements performed with 12 kW, 17.4 kW/L prototypes in stand-alone and multiphase configuration verify the low-loss operation over a wide output power range and a maximum efficiency of 98.3% is achieved.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2009.2015881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071726","DC--DC power conversion;fuel cells;power conversion","Zero voltage switching;DC-DC power converters;Fuel cell vehicles;Pulse modulation;Switches;Hybrid electric vehicles;Inductance;Inductors;MOSFET circuits;Diodes","","219","12","19","IEEE","12 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from the typical multi-view stereo methods, our approach not only imposes the photo-consistency constraint, but also explicitly associates the geometric coherence with multiple frames in a statistical way. It thus can naturally maintain the temporal coherence of the recovered dense depth maps without over-smoothing. To make the inference tractable, we introduce an iterative optimization scheme by first initializing the disparity maps using a segmentation prior and then refining the disparities by means of bundle optimization. Instead of defining the visibility parameters, our method implicitly models the reconstruction noise as well as the probabilistic visibility. After bundle optimization, we introduce an efficient space-time fusion algorithm to further reduce the reconstruction noise.

These hyperlinks are the basis for navigating and crawling the Web.Technologically, the core idea of Linked Data is to use HTTP URLs not only to identify Web documents, but also to identify arbitrary real world entities.Data about these entities is represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Whenever a Web client resolves one of these URLs, the corresponding Web server provides an RDF/ XML or RDFa description of the identified entity. These descriptions can contain links to entities described by other data sources.The Web of Linked Data can be seen as an additional layer that is tightly interwoven with the classic document Web. The author mentions the application of Linked Data in media, publications, life sciences, geographic data, user-generated content, and cross-domain data sources.

DRAND runs in O(\delta ) time and message complexity where \delta is the maximum size of a two-hop neighborhood in a wireless network while message complexity remains O(\delta ), assuming that message delays can be bounded by an unknown constant. DRAND is the first fully distributed version of RAND. The algorithm is suitable for a wireless network where most nodes do not move, such as wireless mesh networks and wireless sensor networks. We implement the algorithm in TinyOS and demonstrate its performance in a real testbed of Mica2 nodes. The algorithm does not require any time synchronization and is shown to be effective in adapting to local topology changes without incurring global overhead in the scheduling. Because of these features, it can also be used even for other scheduling problems such as frequency or code scheduling (for FDMA or CDMA) or local identifier assignment for wireless networks where time synchronization is not enforced. We further evaluate the effect of the time-varying nature of wireless links on the conflict-free property of DRAND-assigned time slots.

Unlike standard fuzzing techniques, which randomly change parts of the input file with little or no information about the underlying syntactic structure of the file, BuzzFuzz uses dynamic taint tracing to automatically locate regions of original seed input files that influence values used at key program attack points (points where the program may contain an error). BuzzFuzz then automatically generates new fuzzed test input files by fuzzing these identified regions of the original seed input files. Because these new test files typically preserve the underlying syntactic structure of the original seed input files, they tend to make it past the initial input parsing components to exercise code deep within the semantic core of the computation. We have used BuzzFuzz to automatically find errors in two open-source applications: Swfdec (an Adobe Flash player) and MuPDF (a PDF viewer). Our results indicate that our new directed fuzzing technique can effectively expose errors located deep within large programs. Because the directed fuzzing technique uses taint to automatically discover and exploit information about the input file format, it is especially appropriate for testing programs that have complex, highly structured input file formats.","1558-1225","978-1-4244-3453-4","10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5070546","","Libraries;Automatic testing;Character generation;Law;Legal factors;Instruments;Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Laboratories;Open source software","","217","3","24","IEEE","10 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Human intelligence is based on the functions of language. From this fact it is very natural to characterize an intelligent system by language: capability of handling language or capability of working with language. Discussing some issues of language related to intelligence, we focus on language functions of the brain in this talk. There are three approaches to elucidate the language functions of the brain: top-down, intermediate, and bottom-up. In this talk, we shall first see some examples of top-down and intermediate approaches, and then discuss a bottom-up approach. As a top-down approach we show computational models of language in which four principles are realized, and as an intermediate approach, we introduce the stratification in the brain shown by aphasia studies. As a bottom-up approach, we have conducted brain experiments, aiming to elucidate the difference of brain activities during processing ideational meaning and interpersonal meaning. In the experiments, two kinds of sentences with and without honorific expressions were sequentially shown to subjects, where texts with honorific expressions contain interpersonal meaning and texts without honorific expressions mainly hold ideational meaning. Electroencephalograms were measured to acquire event-related potentials. Then using equivalent current dipole source localization method, we analyzed the neuronal activation of the brain. It was found that the brain activities for understanding sentences with honorific expressions are different from those produced for understanding sentences without honorific expressions.

The PDE model is used to explain the progressive loss of closed-loop stability with increasing number of vehicles, and to devise ways to combat this loss of stability. If every vehicle uses the same controller, we show that the least stable closed-loop eigenvalue approaches zero as O(1/N2) in the limit of a large number (N) of vehicles. We then show how to ameliorate this loss of stability by small amounts of ""mistuning"", i.e., changing the controller gains from their nominal values.

Wall reflections are often stronger than target reflections, and they tend to persist over a long duration of time. Therefore, weak and close by targets behind walls become obscured and invisible in the image. In this paper, we apply spatial filters across the antenna array to remove, or at least significantly mitigate, the spatial zero-frequency and low-frequency components which correspond to wall reflections. Unmasking the behind-the-wall targets via the application of spatial filters recognizes the fact that the wall electromagnetic (EM) responses do not significantly differ when viewed by the different antennas along the axis of a real or synthesized array aperture which is parallel to the wall. The proposed approach is tested with experimental data using solid wall, multilayered wall, and cinder block wall. It is shown that the wall reflections can be effectively reduced by spatial preprocessing prior to beamforming, producing similar imaging results to those achieved when a background scene without the target is available.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5109740","Notch filtering;spatial processing;through-the-wall radar","Filtering;Radar imaging;Optical reflection;Spatial filters;Antenna arrays;Radio frequency;Reflector antennas;Antenna accessories;Electromagnetic reflection;Target recognition","","216","1","28","IEEE","23 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the performance metrics thus delivered are sometimes considered to be less objective, because the definition of a ldquocorrect detectionrdquo is not unique. Based on a critical review of existing performance metrics, selected methods for the evaluation of building detection results are presented. These methods are used to evaluate the results of two different building detection algorithms in two test sites. A comparison of the evaluation techniques shows that they highlight different properties of the building detection results. As a consequence, a comprehensive evaluation strategy involving quality metrics derived by different methods is proposed.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2012488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797789","Airborne laser scanning (ALS);automatic building extraction;metrics;object detection;object-based error assessment;performance evaluation","Measurement;Object detection;Error analysis;Performance evaluation;Laser applications","","216","","21","IEEE","4 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the enhancements over 3G wireless systems is that in LTE DRX mode can be enabled even when the user equipment is registered with the evolved node-B. However, there is a need to optimize the DRX parameters, so as to maximize power saving without incurring network re-entry and packet delay. In particular, care should be exercised for real-time services. In this article the power saving methods in both network attached and network idle modes as outlined in LTE are explained. The optimum criteria to select the DRX mode are defined for different applications.

The complexity of the problem calls for an integrated solution that extracts as much visual information as possible and combines it through cognitive feedback cycles. We propose such an approach, which jointly estimates camera position, stereo depth, object detection, and tracking. The interplay between those components is represented by a graphical model. Since the model has to incorporate object-object interactions and temporal links to past frames, direct inference is intractable. We, therefore, propose a two-stage procedure: for each frame, we first solve a simplified version of the model (disregarding interactions and temporal continuity) to estimate the scene geometry and an overcomplete set of object detections. Conditioned on these results, we then address object interactions, tracking, and prediction in a second step. The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver robust tracking performance in scenes of realistic complexity.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967605","Mobile vision;multiobject tracking;pedestrian detection;stereo depth;visual odometry;graphical model.","Robustness;Object detection;Layout;Data mining;Feedback;Cameras;Graphical models;Solid modeling;Geometry;Video sequences","Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Computer Graphics;Feedback;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Locomotion;Models, Theoretical;Motion;Motor Vehicles;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Video Recording","216","3","61","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This scheme can be considered as a extension of the zero-forcing (ZF) channel inversion to the case where each receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. One of the limitation of the BD is that the sum rate does not grow linearly with the number of users and transmit antennas at low and medium signal-to-noise ratio regime, since the complete suppression of multi-user interference is achieved at the expense of noise enhancement. Also it performs poorly under imperfect channel state information. In this paper, we propose a generalized minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel inversion algorithm for users with multiple antennas to overcome the drawbacks of the BD for multiuser MIMO systems. We first introduce a generalized ZF channel inversion algorithm as a new approach of the conventional BD. Applying this idea to the MMSE channel inversion for identifying orthonormal basis vectors of the precoder, and employing the MMSE criterion for finding its combining matrix, the proposed scheme increases the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at each user's receiver. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme exhibits a linear growth of the sum rate, as opposed to the BD scheme. For block fading channels with four transmit antennas, the proposed scheme provides a 3 dB gain over the conventional BD scheme at 1% frame error rate. Also, we present a modified precoding method for systems with channel estimation errors and show that the proposed algorithm is robust to channel estimation errors.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2009.11.070404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336870","Multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multiuser, broadcast channels (BC), linear precoding, minimum meansquared error (MMSE)","MIMO;Signal to noise ratio;Channel estimation;Broadcasting;Receiving antennas;Interference suppression;Channel state information;Vectors;Signal processing;Fading","","216","3","26","IEEE","20 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a consequence delay tolerant networking research has received considerable attention in the recent years as a means to obviate to the gap between ad hoc network research and real applications. In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of the Context-aware Adaptive Routing (CAR) protocol for delay tolerant unicast communication in intermittently connected mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol is based on the idea of exploiting nodes as carriers of messages among network partitions to achieve delivery. The choice of the best carrier is made using Kalman filter based prediction techniques and utility theory. We discuss the implementation of CAR over an opportunistic networking framework, outlining possible applications of the general principles at the basis of the proposed approach. The large scale performance of the CAR protocol are evaluated using simulations based on a social network founded mobility model, a purely random one and real traces from Dartmouth College.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2008.107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4585387","Wireless communication;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Routing protocols","Disruption tolerant networking;Ad hoc networks;Context;Routing protocols;Unicast;Mobile communication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Utility theory;Large-scale systems;Social network services","","215","5","33","IEEE","1 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The implementation of these principles with computational parsimony, by exploitation of the statistics of natural images, is investigated. It is shown that Barlow's principle of inference by the detection of suspicious coincidences enables computationally efficient saliency measures which are nearly optimal for classification. This principle is adopted for the solution of the two fundamental problems in discriminant saliency, feature selection and saliency detection. The resulting saliency detector is shown to have a number of interesting properties, and act effectively as a focus of attention mechanism for the selection of interest points according to their relevance for visual recognition. Experimental evidence shows that the selected points have good performance with respect to 1) the ability to localize objects embedded in significant amounts of clutter, 2) the ability to capture information relevant for image classification, and 3) the richness of the set of visual attributes that can be considered salient.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770107","visual saliency;interest point detection;coincidence detection;visual recognition;object detection from cluttered scenes;infomax feature selection;saliency measures;natural image statistics","Object detection;Computer vision;Detectors;Layout;Statistics;Focusing;Machine vision;Robustness;Psychology;Biological system modeling","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biomimetics;Discriminant Analysis;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Visual Perception","215","","67","IEEE","2 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the complex nature of most real-life problems, only an approximation to such an optimal set can be obtained within reasonable (computing) time. To compare such approximations, and thereby the performance of multiobjective optimizers providing them, unary quality measures are usually applied. Among these, the hypervolume indicator (or S-metric) is of particular relevance due to its favorable properties. Moreover, this indicator has been successfully integrated into stochastic optimizers, such as evolutionary algorithms, where it serves as a guidance criterion for finding good approximations to the Pareto front. Recent results show that computing the hypervolume indicator can be seen as solving a specialized version of Klee's Measure Problem. In general, Klee's Measure Problem can be solved with ${\cal O}(n \log n + n^{d/2}\log n)$ comparisons for an input instance of size  $n$ in $d$ dimensions; as of this writing, it is unknown whether a lower bound higher than $\Omega (n \log n)$ can be proven. In this paper, we derive a lower bound of $\Omega (n\log n)$ for the complexity of computing the hypervolume indicator in any number of dimensions  $d≫1$ by reducing the so-called uniformgap problem to it. For the 3-D case, we also present a matching upper bound of ${\cal O}(n\log n)$ comparisons that is obtained by extending an algorithm for finding the maxima of a point set.

In this article, UWMAC, a distributed Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol designed for UW-ASNs, is introduced. The proposed MAC protocol is a transmitter-based Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme that incorporates a novel closed-loop distributed algorithm to jointly set the optimal transmit power and code length. CDMA is the most promising physical layer and multiple access technique for UW-ASNs because it is robust to frequency-selective fading, it compensates for the effect of multipath at the receiver, and it allows receivers to distinguish among signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple devices. UW-MAC aims at achieving three objectives, i.e., guarantee i) high network throughput, ii) low channel access delay, and iii) low energy consumption. It is demonstrated that UW-MAC simultaneously achieves these three objectives in deep water communications (where the ocean depth is more than 100 m), which are usually not severely affected by multipath. In shallow water communications, which may be heavily affected by multipath, it dynamically finds the optimal trade-off among these objectives according to the application requirements. UW-MAC is the first protocol that leverages CDMA properties to achieve multiple access to the scarce underwater bandwidth, while other protocols tailored for this environment have considered CDMA merely from a physical layer perspective. Experiments show that UW-MAC outperforms many existing MAC protocols tuned for the underwater environment under different architecture scenarios and simulation settings.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.080195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4907458","Wireless networking;sensor networks;underwater acoustic communications;MAC;CDMA;performance","Media Access Protocol;Underwater acoustics;Acoustic sensors;Access protocols;Multiaccess communication;Physical layer;Underwater vehicles;Collaboration;Monitoring;Distributed algorithms","","215","1","26","IEEE","2 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We do not assume that the background is well-approximated by a plane or that the camera center remains stationary during motion. The method operates entirely using 2D image measurements without requiring an explicit 3D reconstruction of the scene. A sparse model of background is built by robustly estimating a compact trajectory basis from trajectories of salient features across the video, and the background is `subtracted' by removing trajectories that lie within the space spanned by the basis.

The walking surface is assumed to be rigid and flat; the contact between the robot and the walking surface is assumed to inhibit yaw rotation. The studied robot has 8 DOF in the single support phase and six actuators. In addition to the reduced number of actuators, the interest of studying robots with point feet is that the feedback control solution must explicitly account for the robot's natural dynamics in order to achieve balance while walking. We use an extension of the method of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics (HZD), a very successful method for planar bipeds, in order to simultaneously compute a periodic orbit and an autonomous feedback controller that realizes the orbit, for a 3-D (spatial) bipedal walking robot. This method allows the computations for the controller design and the periodic orbit to be carried out on a 2-DOF subsystem of the 8-DOF robot model. The stability of the walking gait under closed-loop control is evaluated with the linearization of the restricted PoincarÉ map of the HZD. Most periodic walking gaits for this robot are unstable when the controlled outputs are selected to be the actuated coordinates. Three strategies are explored to produce stable walking. The first strategy consists of imposing a stability condition during the search of a periodic gait by optimization. The second strategy uses an event-based controller to modify the eigenvalues of the (linearized) PoincarÉ map. In the third approach, the effect of output selection on the zero dynamics is discussed and a pertinent choice of outputs is proposed, leading to stabilization without the use of a supplemental event-based controller.

The primary and secondary windings of the transcutaneous transformer are positioned outside and inside the human body, respectively. In such a transformer, the alignment and gap may change with external positioning. As a result, the coupling coefficient of the transcutaneous transformer is also varying, and so are the two large leakage inductances and the mutual inductance. Resonant-tank circuits with varying resonant-frequency are formed from the transformer inductors and external capacitors. For a given range of coupling coefficients, an operating frequency corresponding to a particular coupling coefficient can be found, for which the voltage transfer function is insensitive to load. Prior works have used frequency modulation to regulate the output voltage under varying load and transformer coupling. The use of frequency modulation may require a wide control frequency range which may extend well above the load insensitive frequency. In this paper, study of the input-to-output voltage transfer function is carried out, and a control method is proposed to lock the switching frequency at just above the load insensitive frequency for optimized efficiency at heavy loads. Specifically, operation at above resonant of the resonant circuits is maintained under varying coupling-coefficient. Using a digital-phase-lock-loop (PLL), zero-voltage switching is achieved in a full-bridge converter which is also programmed to provide output voltage regulation via pulsewidth modulation (PWM). A prototype transcutaneous power regulator is built and found to to perform excellently with high efficiency and tight regulation under variations of the alignment or gap of the transcutaneous transformer, load and input voltage.

To reduce chopper ripple, the amplifier employs a continuous-time AC-coupled ripple reduction loop. Due to its continuous-time nature, the loop causes no noise folding to DC and hence offers improved noise performance over auto-zeroed amplifiers. The loop reduces chopper ripple by more than 60 dB, to levels below the amplifier's own input-referred noise.

The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of copper (~17.5 times 10-6/degC) is a few times higher than that of silicon (~2.5 times10-6/degC). Thus, when the copper filled through silicon via (TSV) is subjected to temperature loadings, there is a very large local thermal expansion mismatch between the copper and the silicon/dielectric (e.g., SiO2), which will create very large stresses and strains at the interfaces between the copper and the silicon and between the copper and the dielectric. These stresses/strains can be high enough to introduce delamination between the interfaces. In this paper, the nonlinear thermal stresses and strains at the interfaces between the copper, silicon, and dielectric have been determined for a wide-range of aspect ratios (of the silicon thickness and the TSV diameter). One of the major applications of TSV is as an interposer. Because of Moore's (scaling/integration) law, the silicon chip is getting bigger, the pin-out is getting higher, and the pitch is getting finer. Thus, the conventional substrates, e.g., BT (bismaleimide triazine) cannot support these kinds of silicon chips anymore and a silicon interposer (substrate) is needed to redistribute the very fine-pitch and high pin-count pads on the chip to much larger pitch and less pin-count through the silicon vias on the silicon substrate. Depending on the via-size and pitch of the copper filled TSV, the effective CTE of the copper filled TSV interposer could be as high as 10 times 10-6/degC. Consequently, the global thermal expansion mismatch between the silicon chip and the copper filled TSV substrate can be very large and the bumps (usually very small, e.g., microbumps) between them may not be able to survive under thermal conditions. In this study, the nonlinear stresses and strains in the microbumps between the silicon chip and copper filled TSV interposer (with and without underfills) have been determined for a wide-range of via sizes and pitches, and various temperature conditions. These results should be useful for 1) making a decision if underfill is necessary for the reliability of microbumps and 2) selecting underfill materials to minimize the stresses and strains in the microbumps.","1557-9980","","10.1109/TADVP.2009.2021661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170003","Copper;modeling;strain;stress","Thermal stresses;Capacitive sensors;Copper;Through-silicon vias;Silicon;Thermal expansion;Dielectrics;Temperature;Tungsten;Thermal loading","","212","9","9","IEEE","21 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These conditions may affect the outcome of the multiple-input converter synthesis and lead to different configurations from those suggested before in the literature. Although simultaneous power delivery from all sources is not required, it should be possible to independently control the power drained from each input with some degree of freedom.

These rules are used to identify the only feasible input cell that complies with all assumptions and conditions. Unfeasible input cells are also shown.

But under unbalanced grid voltage condition, the severe problems are not the transient overcurrent, but the electric torque pulsation and dc voltage ripple in the back-to-back VSCs. This paper develops dynamic models in MATLAB/Simulink, validates it through experiments, investigates the behavior of DFIG during unbalanced grid voltage condition, and proposes new controllers in separated positive and negative sequence. Methods to separate positive and negative sequence components in real time are also developed, and their responses to unsymmetrical voltage dip are compared.

In order to effectively perform such clustering, we employ as features the local weight functions derived from our earlier work on steering kernel regression . These weights are exceedingly informative and robust in conveying reliable local structural information about the image even in the presence of significant amounts of noise. Next, we model each region (or cluster)-which may not be spatially contiguous-by ldquolearningrdquo a best basis describing the patches within that cluster using principal components analysis. This learned basis (or ldquodictionaryrdquo) is then employed to optimally estimate the underlying pixel values using a kernel regression framework. An iterated version of the proposed algorithm is also presented which leads to further performance enhancements.

We propose a novel \emph{occlusion-aware} surveillance algorithm based on a decomposition of the surveillance problem into a variant of the 3D art gallery problem and an instance of traveling salesman problem for Dubins vehicles.

The controller acts on two levels. On the first level, continuous within-stride control asymptotically imposes a (virtual) holonomic constraint corresponding to a desired torso posture, and creates an invariant surface on which the two-degree-of-freedom restriction dynamics of the closed-loop system (i.e., the hybrid zero dynamics) is diffeomorphic to the center-of-mass dynamics of a spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). On the second level, event-based control stabilizes the closed-loop hybrid system along a periodic orbit of the SLIP dynamics. The controller's performance is discussed through comparison with a second control law that creates a one-degree-of-freedom non-compliant hybrid zero dynamics. Both controllers induce identical steady-state behaviors (i.e., periodic solutions). Under transient conditions, however, the controller inducing a compliant hybrid zero dynamics based on the SLIP accommodates significantly larger disturbances, with less actuator effort, and without violation of the unilateral ground force constraints.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2009.2024565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5175424","Dynamic running;Hybrid Zero Dynamics (HZD);legged robots;Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP)","Springs;Robot kinematics;Control systems;Animals;Context modeling;Torso;Actuators;Leg;Predictive models;Motion control","","212","","54","IEEE","28 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem could be formalized as a penalized least-squares problem in which sparsity is usually induced by a lscr1-norm penalty on the coefficients. Such an approach known as the Lasso or Basis Pursuit Denoising has been shown to perform reasonably well in some situations. However, it was also proved that nonconvex penalties like the pseudo lscrq-norm with q < 1 or smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty are able to recover sparsity in a more efficient way than the Lasso. Several algorithms have been proposed for solving the resulting nonconvex least-squares problem. This paper proposes a generic algorithm to address such a sparsity recovery problem for some class of nonconvex penalties. Our main contribution is that the proposed methodology is based on an iterative algorithm which solves at each iteration a convex weighted Lasso problem. It relies on the family of nonconvex penalties which can be decomposed as a difference of convex functions (DC). This allows us to apply DC programming which is a generic and principled way for solving nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem. We also show that several algorithms in the literature dealing with nonconvex penalties are particular instances of our algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generic framework compared to existing algorithms, including iterative reweighted least-squares methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2026004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5109694","DC programming;lasso;nonconvex regularization;signal representation;sparsity;variable selection","Iterative algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Signal representations;Dictionaries;Input variables;Signal processing;Sparse matrices;Machine learning;Noise reduction;Iterative methods","","211","","20","IEEE","23 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Computer models that accurately simulate the relevant behavior of PV systems would thus be of high value. However, most of today's models either do not accurately model the dynamics of the maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) or anti-islanding algorithms, or they involve excessive computational overhead for this application. To address this need, a Matlab/Simulink model of a single-phase grid-connected PV inverter has been developed and experimentally tested. The development of the PV array model, the integration of the MPPT with an averaged model of the power electronics, and the Simulink implementation are described. It is experimentally demonstrated that the model works well in predicting the general behaviors of single-phase grid-connected PV systems. This paper concludes with a discussion of the need for a full gradient-based MPPT model, as opposed to a commonly used simplified MPPT model.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2008.2003206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4785259","Inverters;islanding detection;modeling and simulation;photovoltaics (PVs)","MATLAB;Mathematical model;Photovoltaic systems;Power system modeling;Power system dynamics;Power system simulation;Power engineering computing;Voltage;Solar power generation;Power engineering and energy","","211","","16","IEEE","18 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning has gained much attention in this domain. However, as a crucial factor of these algorithms, the estimation of pairwise similarity has not been sufficiently studied. Generally, the similarity of two samples is estimated based on the Euclidean distance between them. But we will show that the similarity between two samples is not merely related to their distance but also related to the distribution of surrounding samples and labels. It is shown that the traditional distance-based similarity measure may lead to high classification error rates even on several simple datasets. To address this issue, we propose a novel neighborhood similarity measure, which explores the local sample and label distributions. We show that the neighborhood similarity between two samples simultaneously takes into account three characteristics: 1) their distance; 2) the distribution difference of the surrounding samples; and 3) the distribution difference of surrounding labels.

The empirical fitting parameters are mostly eliminated from the characteristic equations. The developed models are also in close correspondence to several physical, parametric, and limiting models for current-voltage and mobility characteristics. An essential practical feature of the TFT compact dc model is that the model is both upgradable and reducible, allowing for easier implementation and modifications and also simultaneously allowing for separation of characterization techniques.

Cloud providers can offer users two payment plans, i.e., reservation and on-demand plans for resource provisioning. Price of resources in reservation plan is generally cheaper than that in on-demand plan. However, since the reservation plan has to be acquired in advance, it may not fully meet future demands in which the on-demand plan can be used to guarantee the availability to the user. In this paper, we propose an optimal virtual machine placement (OVMP) algorithm. This algorithm can minimize the cost spending in each plan for hosting virtual machines in a multiple cloud provider environment under future demand and price uncertainty. OVMP algorithm makes a decision based on the optimal solution of stochastic integer programming (SIP) to rent resources from cloud providers. The performance of OVMP algorithm is evaluated by numerical studies and simulation. The results clearly show that the proposed OVMP algorithm can minimize users' budgets. This algorithm can be applied to provision resources in emerging cloud computing environments.","","978-1-4244-5338-2","10.1109/APSCC.2009.5394134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394134","","Virtual machining;Cloud computing;Resource management;Availability;Costs;Uncertainty;Stochastic processes;Linear programming;Computational modeling;Numerical simulation","","211","11","26","IEEE","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, stabilizing control and guidance of these vehicles is a difficult task because of the nonlinear dynamic behavior. In addition, the small payload and the reduced processing power of the onboard electronics are further limitations for any control system implementation.

In this paper, we propose a simple opportunistic adaptive routing protocol (SOAR) to explicitly support multiple simultaneous flows in wireless mesh networks. SOAR incorporates the following four major components to achieve high throughput and fairness: 1) adaptive forwarding path selection to leverage path diversity while minimizing duplicate transmissions, 2) priority timer-based forwarding to let only the best forwarding node forward the packet, 3) local loss recovery to efficiently detect and retransmit lost packets, and 4) adaptive rate control to determine an appropriate sending rate according to the current network conditions. We implement SOAR in both NS-2 simulation and an 18-node wireless mesh testbed.

We present Extreme Binning, a scalable deduplication technique for non-traditional backup workloads that are made up of individual files with no locality among consecutive files in a given window of time. Due to lack of locality, existing techniques perform poorly on these workloads. Extreme Binning exploits file similarity instead of locality, and makes only one disk access for chunk lookup per file, which gives reasonable throughput. Multi-node backup systems built with Extreme Binning scale gracefully with the amount of input data; more backup nodes can be added to boost throughput. Each file is allocated using a stateless routing algorithm to only one node, allowing for maximum parallelization, and each backup node is autonomous with no dependency across nodes, making data management tasks robust with low overhead.","2375-0227","978-1-4244-4927-9","10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366623","","Throughput;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Milling machines;Space technology;Routing;Robustness;Web pages;Digital images;Electronic mail","","210","129","41","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to exploit such multiple sources of information to make better inferences on entities remains an interesting open problem. In this paper, we focus on the problem of clustering the vertices based on multiple graphs in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. As one of our contributions, we propose Linked Matrix Factorization (LMF) as a novel way of fusing information from multiple graph sources. In LMF, each graph is approximated by matrix factorization with a graph-specific factor and a factor common to all graphs, where the common factor provides features for all vertices.

Most typically the configuration and provisioning of these datacenters, as far as the services for the subscribers go, is highly automated, to the point of the service being delivered within seconds of the subscriber request. Additionally, the datacenters typically use hypervisor based virtualization as a technique to deliver these services. The concept of a cloud operated by one service provider or enterprise interoperating with a clouds operated by another is a powerful idea. So far that is limited to use cases where code running on one cloud explicitly references a service on another cloud. There is no implicit and transparent interoperability. Use cases for interoperability, as well as work-in-progress around inter-cloud protocols and formats for enabling those use cases, are discussed in this paper.","","978-1-4244-3851-8","10.1109/ICIW.2009.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5072540","Cloud Computing;Intercloud","Protocols;Cloud computing","","209","28","48","IEEE","12 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the networking literature, this phenomenon is typically abstracted using a wireless channel interference model. The level of detail in the interference model, evidently determines the accuracy of the results based upon the model. Several works in the networking literature have made use of simplistic interference models, e.g., fixed ranges for communication and interference, the capture threshold model (used in the ns2 network simulator), the protocol model, and so on. At the same time, fairly complex interference models such as those based on the SINR (signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio) have also been proposed and used. We investigate the impact of the choice of the interference model, on the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the performance of wireless networks, by comparing different wireless interference models. We find that both in the case of random access networks, as well as in the case of scheduled networks (where node transmissions are scheduled to be completely conflict-free), different interference models can produce significantly different results. Therefore, a lot of caution should be exercised before accepting or interpreting results based on simplified interference models. Further, we feel that an SINR-based model is the minimum level of detail that should be employed to model wireless channel interference in a networking context.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2009.080720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4927481","Channel modeling;interference;SINR;conflict graphs;conflict sets","Interference;Decoding;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless networks;Wireless communication;Context modeling;Laboratories;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Attenuation","","209","","17","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variant behavior. In spite of much research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a combination of a feature selection technique and cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA) is proposed for this purpose. The feature selection method is an improved version of the mutual information (MI) technique. The CNEA is composed of cascaded forecasters where each forecaster consists of a neural network (NN) and an evolutionary algorithm (EA). An iterative search procedure is also incorporated in our solution strategy to fine-tune the adjustable parameters of both the MI technique and CNEA. The price forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated by means of real data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) and Spanish electricity markets. The method is also compared with some of the most recent price forecast techniques.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2006997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696026","Cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA);iterative search procedure;mutual information (MI);price forecast","Economic forecasting;Electricity supply industry;Mutual information;Costs;Neural networks;Fuzzy neural networks;Uncertainty;Iterative algorithms;Pricing;Production","","209","","31","IEEE","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The identification of a critical security parameter, the external-cavity round-trip time (the time delay in the laser dynamics), is performed using both the auto-correlation function and delayed mutual information methods applied to the chaotic time-series. The influence on the time-delay identification of the experimentally tunable parameters, i.e., the feedback rate, the pumping current, and the time-delay value, is carefully studied.

FSO links are highly weather-dependent and different weather effects reduce the link availability. Employing a hybrid network consisting of an FSO link and a back up link in the GHz frequency range renders high availability besides providing comparable data rates. In this paper effects of fog, rain and snow on FSO/GHz hybrid network are studied so that GHz frequencies with best complementary behaviour can be selected as a back up link. As a prime conclusion of the article, it is suggested that free space optical links can be supplemented with 40 GHz RF links to achieve near carrier class availability.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2009.091218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342328","Optical wireless, Radio frequency, Fog, Rain, Snow, Hybrid network, Weather influence, Attenuation, Simulation","Radio frequency;Availability;Optical attenuators;High speed optical techniques;Biomedical optical imaging;Back;Rain;Snow;Video on demand;Artificial satellites","","209","","32","IEEE","1 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method consists of several steps. First, the lung region is segmented from the CT data using a fuzzy thresholding method. Then, the volumetric shape index map, which is based on local Gaussian and mean curvatures, and the “dot” map, which is based on the eigenvalues of a Hessian matrix, are calculated for each voxel within the lungs to enhance objects of a specific shape with high spherical elements (such as nodule objects). The combination of the shape index (local shape information) and “dot” features (local intensity dispersion information) provides a good structure descriptor for the initial nodule candidates generation. Antigeometric diffusion, which diffuses across the image edges, is used as a preprocessing step. The smoothness of image edges enables the accurate calculation of voxel-based geometric features. Adaptive thresholding and modified expectation–maximization methods are employed to segment potential nodule objects. Rule-based filtering is first used to remove easily dismissible nonnodule objects. This is followed by a weighted support vector machine (SVM) classification to further reduce the number of false positive (FP) objects. The proposed method has been trained and validated on a clinical dataset of 108 thoracic CT scans using a wide range of tube dose levels that contain 220 nodules (185 solid nodules and 35 GGO nodules) determined by a ground truth reading process. The data were randomly split into training and testing datasets. The experimental results using the independent dataset indicate an average detection rate of 90.2%, with approximately 8.2 FP/scan. Some challenging nodules such as nonspherical nodules and low-contrast part-solid and nonsolid nodules were identified, while most tissues such as blood vessels were excluded. The method's high detection rate, fast computation, and applicability to different imaging conditions and nodule types shows much promise for clinical applications.

In this paper we propose an approach that uses local features to count the number of people in each foreground blob segment, so that the total crowd estimate is the sum of the group sizes. This results in an approach that is scalable to crowd volumes not seen in the training data, and can be trained on a very small data set. As a local approach is used, the proposed algorithm can easily be used to estimate crowd density throughout different regions of the scene and be used in a multi-camera environment. A unique localised approach to ground truth annotation reduces the required training data is also presented, as a localised approach to crowd counting has different training requirements to a holistic one. Testing on a large pedestrian database compares the proposed technique to existing holistic techniques and demonstrates improved accuracy, and superior performance when test conditions are unseen in the training set, or a minimal training set is used.","","978-1-4244-5297-2","10.1109/DICTA.2009.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5384975","Crowd Counting;Crowd Density;Local Features;Foreground segmentation","Training data;Layout;Cameras;Testing;Spatial databases;Digital images;Computer applications;Laboratories;Australia;Safety","","208","2","16","IEEE","19 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance of an automated iris recognition system is affected by the accuracy of the segmentation process used to localize the iris structure. Most segmentation models in the literature assume that the pupillary, limbic, and eyelid boundaries are circular or elliptical in shape. Hence, they focus on determining model parameters that best fit these hypotheses. However, it is difficult to segment iris images acquired under nonideal conditions using such conic models. In this paper, we describe a novel iris segmentation scheme employing geodesic active contours (GACs) to extract the iris from the surrounding structures. Since active contours can 1) assume any shape and 2) segment multiple objects simultaneously, they mitigate some of the concerns associated with traditional iris segmentation models. The proposed scheme elicits the iris texture in an iterative fashion and is guided by both local and global properties of the image. The matching accuracy of an iris recognition system is observed to improve upon application of the proposed segmentation algorithm. Experimental results on the CASIA v3.0 and WVU nonideal iris databases indicate the efficacy of the proposed technique.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2033225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5272431","Geodesic active contours (GACs);iriscodes;iris recognition;iris segmentation;level sets;snakes","Active contours;Image segmentation;Robust stability;Iris recognition;Biometrics;Authentication;Eyelids;Active shape model;Iterative algorithms;Image databases","","208","3","41","IEEE","29 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The theory shows that the thermal design is an indispensable part of the electrical circuit design and will strongly influence the peak luminous output of LED systems. It can be used to explain why the optimal operating power, at which maximum luminous flux is generated, may not occur at the rated power of the LEDs.

Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git, a very popular DSCM used in high-profile projects. Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, giving rise to new questions such as ldquoHow do contributions flow between developers to the official project repository?rdquo However, there are pitfalls. Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories. The semantics of terms common to SCMs and DSCMs sometimes differ markedly, potentially creating confusion.

Optimizing the PSC geometries to maximize the power transfer efficiency of the wireless link is imperative to reduce the size of the external energy source, heating of the tissue, and interference with other devices. Implantable devices need to be hermetically sealed in biocompatible materials and placed in a conductive environment with high permittivity (tissue), which can affect the PSC characteristics. We have constructed a detailed model that includes the effects of the surrounding environment on the PSC parasitic components and eventually on the power transfer efficiency. We have combined this model with an iterative design method that starts with a set of realistic design constraints and ends with the optimal PSC geometries. We applied our design methodology to optimize the wireless link of a 1-cm 2 implantable device example, operating at 13.56 MHz. Measurement results showed that optimized PSC pairs, coated with 0.3 mm of silicone, achieved 72.2%, 51.8%, and 30.8% efficiencies at a face-to-face relative distance of 10 mm in air, saline, and muscle, respectively. The PSC, which was optimized for air, could only bear 40.8% and 21.8% efficiencies in saline and muscle, respectively, showing that by including the PSC tissue environment in the design process the result can be more than a 9% improvement in the power transfer efficiency.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2025366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223583","Implantable microelectronic devices;inductive wireless links;neuroprostheses;power transmission efficiency;printed spiral coils (PSCs);telemetry","Spirals;Coils;Muscles;Geometry;Design methodology;Design optimization;Power transmission;Neural prosthesis;Interference constraints;Heat transfer","","207","3","33","IEEE","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reconstruction of indoor environments from photographs is particularly challenging due to texture-poor planar surfaces such as uniformly-painted walls. Our system first uses structure-from-motion, multi-view stereo, and a stereo algorithm specifically designed for Manhattan-world scenes (scenes consisting predominantly of piece-wise planar surfaces with dominant directions) to calibrate the cameras and to recover initial 3D geometry in the form of oriented points and depth maps. Next, the initial geometry is fused into a 3D model with a novel depth-map integration algorithm that, again, makes use of Manhattan-world assumptions and produces simplified 3D models. Finally, the system enables the exploration of reconstructed environments with an interactive, image-based 3D viewer. We demonstrate results on several challenging datasets, including a 3D reconstruction and image-based walk-through of an entire floor of a house, the first result of this kind from an automated computer vision system.","2380-7504","978-1-4244-4420-5","10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459145","","Image reconstruction;Layout;Surface reconstruction;Stereo vision;Geometry;Solid modeling;Buildings;Visualization;Indoor environments;Surface texture","","207","17","26","IEEE","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method entails quantification and treatment of uncertainty and relies on the rank based selection operator of evolutionary algorithms. The proposed uncertainty handling is implemented in the context of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and verified on test functions. The present method is independent of the uncertainty distribution, prevents premature convergence of the evolution strategy and is well suited for online optimization as it requires only a small number of additional function evaluations. The algorithm is applied in an experimental setup to the online optimization of feedback controllers of thermoacoustic instabilities of gas turbine combustors. In order to mitigate these instabilities, gain-delay or model-based H infin controllers sense the pressure and command secondary fuel injectors. The parameters of these controllers are usually specified via a trial and error procedure. We demonstrate that their online optimization with the proposed methodology enhances, in an automated fashion, the online performance of the controllers, even under highly unsteady operating conditions, and it also compensates for uncertainties in the model-building and design process.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2008.924423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4634579","Covariance matrix adaptation;combustion;evolutionary algorithms (EAs);gain-delay control;gas turbines;thermo acoustic instabilities","Uncertainty;Optimization methods;Feedback control;Combustion;Automatic control;Evolutionary computation;Covariance matrix;Testing;Convergence;Adaptive control","","206","1","58","IEEE","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They are typically deployed indoors to improve coverage and provide excellent user experience, including high data rates. Cellular operators benefit from reduced infrastructure and operational expenses for capacity upgrades and coverage improvements. Femtocells also bring unique challenges, such as unplanned deployment, user installation, restricted access, and interoperability with existing handsets and network infrastructure. Although femtocells may cause some interference to other users in the network, with the use of proper interference management techniques, this can be well controlled. We present interference management techniques for both downlink and uplink of femtocells operating based on 3GPP Release 7 standards (also known as HSPA+). Femtocell carrier selection and femtocell DL Tx power self-calibration are proposed as key interference management methods for downlink. For uplink interference management, adaptive attenuation at the femtocell and limiting the Tx power of the femtocell users are proposed. Different interference models and their analysis are presented. In addition, coverage performance and capacity results are presented to quantify the benefits of femtocells. We demonstrate that in addition to coverage enhancements, significant capacity improvements are achieved on both downlink and uplink when femtocells are deployed in 3G UMTS/HSPA+ networks.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2009.5277462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5277462","","Performance analysis;3G mobile communication;Femtocells;Telephone sets;Terminology;Macrocell networks;Radio frequency;Downlink;Electromagnetic interference;Analytical models","","206","16","8","IEEE","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

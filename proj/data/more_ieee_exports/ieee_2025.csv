In this paper, we propose a new method to construct the binary polar codes with the modified multiplicative repetition (MR)-based matrix. Different from the original construction, we first design a $2\times 2\ q\text{-ary}$ kernel to guarantee the single-level polarization effect. Then, by replacing the new-designed binary companion matrix, a novel strategy is further developed to enhance the polarization in the bit level, resulting in a better distance property. Finally, the SD-based Monte-Carlo (SDMC) method is used to construct MR-based binary polar codes, while the resulting codes without the butterfly pattern are decoded by the SD algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method with the SD algorithm can achieve a maximum performance gain of 0.27 dB compared to the original method with slightly lower complexity.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2024.9010030","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62261003,62361003,61961004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817720","polar codes;sphere decoding;generator matrix;multiplicative repetition;Monte-Carlo method","Monte Carlo methods;Codes;Simulation;Performance gain;Benchmark testing;Generators;Decoding;Polar codes;Kernel;Computational complexity","","1","","19","","30 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

We focus on SWOT’s water surface elevation (WSE) and water surface slope (WSS) products at the reach level, comparing the measurements to in situ data. Our analysis shows that about half of SWOT’s WSE and WSS measurements fall within the desired error budgets, though WSS lacks linear correlation with in situ data.

The analysis of the current–voltage characteristics indicated that defect-assisted carrier transport dominates within the space charge region. Continuous laser exposure at constant optical power caused a decrease in open-circuit voltage (Voc). The study of the dark current–voltage curves highlights a change in the saturation current (IS) and ideality factor (n), whose increment follows a square-root dependence on time. This behavior is attributed to diffusion of Na ions toward the junction. Conversely, the Voc decay (which is correlated with the turn-on voltage decrease in dark I–V curve) is ascribed to a light-induced defect generation that enhances leakage current at the CdS/CIGS interface.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2024.3492281","Fotovoltaico ad alta efficienza; Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10770815","Blue wavelength;carrier transport;CdS/CIGS interface;Cu(InGa)Se  $_2$   (CIGS) solar cells;defect-assisted;degradation;Na diffusion;one-diode model","Stress;Photovoltaic cells;Degradation;Market research;Voltage;Photovoltaic systems;Lighting;Laser beams;Temperature measurement;Optical saturation","","","","28","CCBYNCND","28 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By burying a Bragg grating within the semiconductor, a narrow and temperature-stable spectrum can be achieved. In this paper, we investigate the factors limiting the power enhancement of distributed feedback (DFB) lasers and characterize the grown gratings using transmission electron microscopy. We discuss the effects of grating coupling strength, wavelength detuning, and oxygen contamination in the grating region on performance. Under optimized growth conditions, a high-performance 780 nm DFB laser based on InGaAsP/InGaP gratings has been developed, achieving a continuous output power exceeding 10 W, which is the highest power for a 780 nm DFB laser to date.

These requirements pose significant challenges to maintaining magnetothermal stability of the superconducting wires. This paper explores the technical aspects of non-traditional measurements of the Minimum Quench Energy (MQE) triggered by an ultra-violet pulsed laser. The advantage of a pulsed laser as opposed to the more commonly used resistive heaters is the speed: the laser deposits the energy in nanoseconds, significantly faster than the characteristic time of temperature diffusion in the samples tested. Methods for calibration of the energy absorbed by the wire are also discussed. The stability of internal tin and powder-in-tube Nb3Sn wire designs, originally specified for the requirements of the quadrupole (MQXF) magnets for the High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider, was evaluated under applied magnetic fields ranging from 5 T to 15 T and at both 1.9 K and 4.2 K. Notable trends were observed in the energy required to induce a quench at a constant current level as a function of the magnetic field. These trends persisted even as the superconductor approached current levels where premature quenches occur. Results suggest that the superconductor applied in the MQXF magnets cannot be quenched at the operating point by the energy available in this study, with a considerable margin.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3513943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10787240","Critical current;critical current measurement;minimum quench energy (MQE);Nb  $_3$  Sn wire;stability","Fiber lasers;Wires;Superconducting magnets;Optical fibers;Measurement by laser beam;Energy measurement;Temperature measurement;Thermal stability;Surface emitting lasers;Magnetic field measurement","","","","16","CCBY","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies have empirically investigated, either numerically or experimentally, the impact of individual design parameters on the outputs and performance of flux pumps, but they were only able to provide qualitative relations that are not suitable for proper designing actions. In this study, we propose a new approach based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to generate effective flux pump designs. A finite element (FE) model, previously validated against experimental results, was employed in this procedure to provide a relation between the design parameters of the flux pump and the objective function of the optimization problem, that is the maximum efficiency during persistent operation. The FE model is exploited in the form of a function that is fed into AI-based optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization.

To address this, CERN has recently introduced a conceptual design for a 40 T solenoid characterized by very compact pancake coils. Due to the high magnetic field and operating current density (approximately 600 A/mm2), the Lorentz forces acting on the winding are extremely large. Consequently, the mechanical design, along with quench protection, represents a significant challenge in the development of this magnet. An additional mechanical complexity is constituted by the strong anisotropy and low strength of ReBCO tapes. This article focuses on the proposed mechanical design of the 40 T solenoid. The primary objective of this design is to keep the stresses induced in the coils by Lorentz forces below materials admissible limits. Initially, the paper presents a conceptual design based on analytical calculations relying on the application of a radial pre-compression (approximately 200 MPa) to the pancake coils by shrink-fitting, prior to energization. Subsequently, a finite element analysis is performed, introducing various nonlinearities (material, geometric, plasticity) to optimize the magnet's design. The study also investigates a hybrid solution, in which the initial coil loading is obtained by a combination of shrink fitting and mechanical compression by a clamped conical connection based on shrink discs. The highly anisotropic mechanical properties of the tape, which are not extensively documented in current literature, were investigated by a series of dedicated tests relying on specially designed tooling. This design and experimental testing complement the simulation efforts by allowing to derive and implement in the models more accurate material properties. In conclusion, the proposed magnet design exemplifies a synergistic integration of experimental work and simulation efforts, advancing the development of UHF magnets for the Muon Collider.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3504472","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10763435","Muon-collider;ReBCO;solenoid;ultra-high-field","Coils;Stress;Solenoids;Magnets;Cooling;Superconducting magnets;Copper;Magnetic fields;Finite element analysis;Mesons","","","","10","CCBY","21 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we utilized a rotational magnetization measurement technique to locate degradation within stacked REBCO tapes. To validate the principle of defect detection using this approach, we measured the magnetization of samples consisting of 10 layers of stacked REBCO tapes. The measurement yielded a magnetization signal with two peak values per rotation, demonstrating the potential for detailed defect analysis. Additionally, variations in the intensity and waveform of the magnetization signal were observed, correlating with the position of degraded REBCO tapes.

We consider three exemplary yet realistic MC-SAR systems, and we conduct simulations and analyses on synthetic SAR data considering different radar backscatter distributions, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2024.3510433","European Space Agency Project “Data volume reduction for multichannel SAR”(grant numbers:4000140269/22/NL/AS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10772623","Data volume reduction (DVR);multichannel (MC) synthetic aperture radar (SAR);raw data quantization;SAR","Azimuth;Synthetic aperture radar;Doppler effect;Quantization (signal);Backscatter;Encoding;Autocorrelation;Transform coding;Redundancy;Linear predictive coding","","","","16","CCBY","2 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is due to the need for two or more cascaded SQUID stages to obtain sufficiently large power gain over a sufficient bandwidth, and due to moderate obtainable multiplexing factors, which forces implementation of many parallel readout chains to serve all the sensor pixels. We suggest an arrangement where one bias line and one flux setpoint line are shared by two cascaded SQUID stages on a single chip, halving the number of lines two cascaded stages would ordinarily require. The stages are connected in series, sharing a single supply current, dual to ordinary integrated transistor circuits in which many transistor stages are connected in parallel and share a single supply voltage. We show experimental results at T = 4.2 K for a proof-of-concept amplifier chip, fabricated in the VTT Micronova foundry, using SWAPS Josephson junctions (Grönberg et al., 2017) at JC = 20 μA/(μm)2 critical current density.

To achieve such high node throughputs, it is important to expand the wavelength bandwidth and support more WDM fibers. Therefore, the transponder aggregator (TPA) that provides the colorless, directionless, and contentionless (CDC) function of the network node also needs to respond to these changes. As a TPA suitable for such ultra-high throughput reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexing (ROADM) nodes, we propose a multicast switch (MCS) that consists of 1 × N splitters and M × 1 switches facing each other and utilizes a silica-based planar lightwave circuit (PLC) platform. The CDC-ROADM nodes have a trade-off between the number of connected WDM fibers and the number of transponders that can be accommodated by a single TPA. Therefore, increasing the WDM fibers results in a decrease in the transponders that can be accommodated by a single MCS, but at the same time reduces the splitting loss in that switch. As a result, the number of optical amplifiers used for add/drop functions can be reduced. In addition, because the handling unit is larger, the increase in the number of required MCS units is limited, and highly integrated PLC-based MCSs become practical. In this paper, we demonstrate MCSs supporting 300-nm bandwidth and 32- and 64-degree nodes for the first time ever. The insertion loss of the prototype was less than 8.0 dB in all paths, including connections with common single-mode fiber, and the extinction ratio was greater than 40 dB.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2024.3520988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10812056","ROADM;WSS;multicast switch;planar lightwave circuit","Transponders;Optical switches;Throughput;Wavelength division multiplexing;Optical fiber amplifiers;Bandwidth;Insertion loss;Optical network units;Costs;Optical losses","","","","31","CCBY","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current methods for measuring ac losses can be difficult to implement for superconducting samples that are large or have complex geometries. This article presents a new method, known as the drag-torque method, for measuring ac losses. The present measurement system involves suspending the superconducting sample holder, which is cooled by liquid nitrogen, in the air using a pair of air-bearing journals. When the sample is placed in a rotating magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet rotor, ac losses are induced in the superconducting material. As a result, the sample holder tends to rotate with the permanent magnet rotor and is stopped by a load cell. By measuring the torque exerted on the load cell, the ac losses can be calculated. This method can be applied to complex superconducting samples, such as coils and stacks of superconducting tapes.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3487978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10738193","AC losses;high-temperature superconducting (HTS);superconducting motor","High-temperature superconductors;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic fields;Loss measurement;Superconducting magnets;Rotors;Magnetic hysteresis;Superconducting films;Current measurement;Eddy currents","","","","28","CCBY","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The assessment shows that fusing the outputs of individual models is more promising on the OREBA-DIS dataset. Subsequently, we conduct experiments using different score-level and decision-level fusion approaches. Our results from fusion show that the score-level fusion approach of max score model performs best of all considered fusion approaches. On the OREBA-DIS dataset, the max score fusion approach ( $F_{1} =0.871$ ) outperforms both individual video ( $F_{1} =0.855$ ) and inertial ( $F_{1} =0.806$ ) models.

The methodology involves three essential steps: (i) estimating rated kW, (ii) initializing rated kWh of the BESSs, and (iii) iteratively adjusting the BESS size based on heuristic rules to prevent State of Charge (SoC) limit violations following the load cycle. Three realistic load cycles for the BESSs out of which one load cycle is generated based on maximum error values and the other load cycles are generated based on the mean and  $1\sigma $  of the Normal Distribution Curve (NDC) of forecast errors of WES located at Agasthianpalli, Tamil Nadu, India. Two simple yet effective heuristic rules have been proposed to optimize the BESS size, ensuring maximum SoC at the start of each day and maintaining SoC within limits throughout the day. This leads to two scenarios considering a single set of the BESS to serve the load cycle and two sets of the BESS operating alternatively, reaching maximum SoC on the subsequent day by charging from the grid. Cost analysis indicates that scenario 1 is more favorable in terms of both cost and BESS size, surpassing scenario 2 by 8.89% and 9.95%, respectively. This analysis results in shorter payback period for scenario 1. Validation using Genetic Algorithm (GA) is done by comparing the costs of BESSs, emphasizing the suitability of the proposed technique.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3373056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10458937","Battery energy storage systems;battery sizing;state of charge;wind generation;heuristic-based technique","Costs;Forecasting;Wind power generation;Batteries;Genetic algorithms;Loading;Behavioral sciences;Energy storage;Storage management;Size measurement;State of charge;Heuristic algorithms","","3","","37","CCBYNCND","4 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here we explicitly model the entire set of voxels within a brain mask as nodes of high-resolution, subject-specific graphs. Methods: We define the strength of local voxel-to-voxel connections using diffusion tensors and orientation distribution functions derived from diffusion MRI data. We study the graphs' Laplacian spectral properties on data from the Human Connectome Project. We then assess the extent of inter-subject variability of the Laplacian eigenmodes via a procrustes validation scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the extent to which functional MRI data are shaped by the underlying anatomical structure via graph signal processing. Results: The graph Laplacian eigenmodes manifest highly resolved spatial profiles, reflecting distributed patterns that correspond to major white matter pathways. We show that the intrinsic dimensionality of the eigenspace of such high-resolution graphs is only a mere fraction of the graph dimensions. By projecting task and resting-state data on low-frequency graph Laplacian eigenmodes, we show that brain activity can be well approximated by a small subset of low-frequency components.

Accurate assessment of these properties during the early stages of drug development is challenging due to resource-intensive experimental evaluation and limited comprehensive data availability. To overcome these obstacles, there has been a growing reliance on computational and predictive tools, leveraging recent advancements in machine learning and graph-based methodologies. This study presents an innovative approach that harnesses the power of optimal transport (OT) theory to construct three graph kernels for predicting drug ADMET properties. This approach involves the use of graph matching to create a similarity matrix, which is subsequently integrated into a predictive model. Results: Through extensive evaluations on 19 distinct ADMET datasets, the potential of this methodology becomes evident. The OT-based graph kernels exhibits exceptional performance, outperforming state-of-the-art graph deep learning models in 9 out of 19 datasets, even surpassing the most impactful Graph Neural Network (GNN) that excels in 4 datasets. Furthermore, they are very competitive in 2 additional datasets.

Despite the drive to convert forests to agricultural land, detailed information on land use changes and the resulting impacts on soil carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the region is lacking. Therefore, this work aims to address the information gap by estimating the amount of land cover changes. The study is driven by the urgent need to develop suitable methodologies for detecting and mapping land cover dynamics in Northern Ontario for forest and agricultural lands. Predominant land cover classes in the study area are mapped in order to quantify the changes from 2002 to 2022. Drawing on nascent technology and tools such as machine learning and Google Earth Engine's cloud computing, the satellite images from Landsat and Sentinel are used to examine the trend of land cover and land use changes.

Such maneuverability is achieved due to the ability of the omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and direction. In doing so, the rotors' settling time, which is induced by inherent rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account and does not require additional rotor state measurement. This is achieved by integrating a linear rotor dynamics model into the vehicle's equations of motion and designing a PD controller to compensate for the effects introduced by rotor dynamics. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments, where we demonstrate significantly improved tracking performance in multiple aggressive maneuvers compared with a baseline geometric PD controller.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2024.3518922","NASA ULI(grant numbers:80NSSC22M0070); NSF-AoF RI(grant numbers:2133656); NSF M3X(grant numbers:2431216); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10804067","Aggressive maneuvers;geometric control;omnidirectional multirotors;rotor dynamics","Rotors;Vehicle dynamics;Aerodynamics;PD control;Mathematical models;PI control;Delays;Tracking;Stability analysis;Servomotors","","1","","34","CCBY","16 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This strategy establishes an SAGVN model that incorporates air and space networks to expand the options for vehicular TO, and enhances the edge-computing resources of the system by deploying edge servers. To minimize the system average cost, we use the JTRSS algorithm to decompose the original problem into a number of subproblems.

To address the issue of over-segmentation in existing action segmentation methods, which leads to classification errors and reduced segmentation quality, this paper proposes a global spatial-temporal information encoder-decoder based action segmentation method. The method proposed in this paper uses the global temporal information captured by refinement layer to assist the Encoder-Decoder (ED) structure in judging the action segmentation point more accurately and, at the same time, suppress the excessive segmentation phenomenon caused by the ED structure.

Autistic children experience difficulties in recognizing emotions and expressing emotions, along with intense emotional upheavals called meltdowns. These outbreaks lead to immense physical and emotional distress in children with autism. Generalized emotion recognition classifiers cannot handle the variations in the prototypical display of affect experienced by ASD children. This paper looks at developing a personalized multimodal neural framework, m_AutNet, that can effectively identify the emotions of autistic children by combining data from their facial and vocal expression modalities. The proposed network includes a personalized facial feature extraction module (that incorporates a distance metric to cluster embeddings with similar labels together and marginalizes dissimilar embeddings), and an audio modality CNN feature extractor that works on speech expression samples of autistic children. Domain adaptation of the multimodal features is achieved through a generative adversarial network tuned with the Wasserstein metric to form a domain-invariant distribution alignment of the feature vectors. A classifier performs emotion classification on this domain space following adaptation. The proposed algorithm shows higher performance than state-of-the-art affect recognition classifiers for autistic children, with an accuracy of 88.25%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3403087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10535108","Autism;affective computing;domain adaptation;data fusion;generative adversarial network;multimodal neural network;personalized neural network;Wasserstein GAN","Emotion recognition;Generative adversarial networks;Measurement;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Training;Pediatrics;Autism;Affective computing;Data integration;Multisensory integration","","1","","78","CCBYNCND","20 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hydrologic activity of the three active subglacial lakes (Totten1, Totten2, and Wilkes1) located on Totten Glacier may affect the ice sheet mass balance in the region on time scales of decades. In this article, we utilized laser altimetry data (ICESat and ICESat-2) and radar altimetry data (CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3) to establish a 20-year time series of surface ice sheet elevation changes for three subglacial lakes, employing different least squares fitting methods, and this analysis aimed to study their hydrological activities. Additionally, we combined REMA and BedMachine data to acquire the subglacial drainage pathways in the region, analyzing the hydrological connections among the three subglacial lakes. The results indicate that Totten1 and Totten2 exhibited frequent inflow and outflow throughout the observation period, with periodic characteristics in lake activities. From 2003 to 2009, Wilkes1 showed an ascending trend in surface ice sheet elevation, followed by a relatively stable state. The characteristics of lake activities changes and subglacial drainage pathways indicate connections among these three subglacial lakes. This article highlights that CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 radar data can fill the gaps between ICESat and ICESat-2 data.

Moreover, when it comes to evaluating the payoffs in practical attack and defense games in infrastructure networks, the lack of consideration for the fuzziness and uncertainty of subjective human judgment brings forth significant challenges to the analysis of strategic interactions among decision makers. This paper employs intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) to depict such uncertain payoffs, and introduce a theoretical framework for analyzing the attack and defense game in infrastructure networks based on intuitionistic fuzzy theory. We take the changes in three complex network metrics as the universe of discourse, and intuitionistic fuzzy sets are employed based on this universe of discourse to reflect the satisfaction of decision makers. We employ an algorithm based on intuitionistic fuzzy theory to find the Nash equilibrium, and conduct experiments on both local and global networks. Results show that: (1) the utilization of intuitionistic fuzzy sets to depict the payoffs of attack and defense games in infrastructure networks can reflect the unique characteristics of decision makers' subjective preferences.

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully used to model interaction and spatio-temporal information in POI recommendations, but the data sparsity of POI recommendations affects the training of GNNs. Although some existing GNN-based POI recommendation approaches try to use social relationships or user attributes to alleviate the data sparsity problem, such auxiliary information is not always available for privacy reasons. Self-supervised learning gives a new idea to alleviate the data sparsity problem, but most existing self-supervised recommendation methods cannot be directly used in the spatio-temporal graph of POI recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph contrastive learning method, HestGCL, to compensate for existing GNN-based methods' shortcomings. To model spatio-temporal information, we generate spatio-temporally specific views and design view-specific heterogeneous graph neural networks to model spatial and temporal information, respectively. To alleviate data sparsity, we propose a cross-view contrastive strategy to capture differences and correlations among views, providing more supervision signals and boosting the overall performance collaboratively. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HestGCL, which significantly outperforms existing methods.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2023.9010148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10676346","point-of-interest recommendation;graph neural network;self-supervised learning","Training;Data privacy;Correlation;Contrastive learning;Benchmark testing;Boosting;Graph neural networks","","1","","39","","11 Sep 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Multitasking on board of conventional transport modes is studied by several researchers, but limited efforts are focusing on multitasking in case of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). In this paper, the effects of multitasking on behavior of travelers on board of conventional cars (cars), AVs, and SAVs are analyzed. Furthermore, finding the impact of several factors on the travel time, the acceptability of SAVs, and conducting onboard activities are assessed. The study considers solely main trip purposes within urban areas. A stated preference (SP) survey is distributed in Budapest, Hungary, and 276 participants are collected. An SP includes discrete choice experiment (DCE) that is designed to mimic the realistic situation when AV is on the market. The DCE considers the attributes and attributes levels of the alternatives where rationality is maintained in the design. A transport mode choice model, which includes several variables influencing the choice of a transport mode, is developed. In addition, an SP includes Likert scale and sociodemographic sections. Likert scale and exploratory factor analysis (EPA) are used to understand the impact of some factors on the travel time, the acceptability of SAVs as transport modes, and conducting onboard activities. The multinomial logit (MNL) model is applied, where a transport mode choice model of cars, AVs, and SAVs is developed. The results of the developed model show that travelers are willing to choose AVs over cars, and SAVs over AVs. Moreover, travelers with high income are more willing to use AVs over SAVs and more likely to use cars than SAVs. Besides, people from the older age group prefer using SAVs more than other age groups. The results demonstrate the probability of selecting a transport mode with active activities on board is larger than the probability of choosing a transport mode with passive activities. Besides, the findings of EFA and Likert scale analyses demonstrate that the waiting time has the largest negative effect on the travel time, seat availability affects the conduction of onboard activities, and the internal design of SAVs influences the use of SAVs as transport modes. The results of current research can be beneficial to transport planners, transport operators, and vehicle manufacturers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3412393","Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary from the National Research(grant numbers:TKP2021-NVA-02); Development and Innovation Fund(grant numbers:TKP2021-NVA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10552706","Autonomous vehicle;multitasking;onboard activities;value of travel time","Multitasking;Automobiles;Costs;Surveys;Shared transport;Autonomous vehicles","","1","","84","CCBY","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite the development of numerous advanced methods for detecting small targets, improving overall performance in complex scenes remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a joint partial tensor correlated total variation and k-means clustering (PTCTV-KMC) method that integrates local and global features. The proposed method comprises two stages: seed point (i.e., candidate target) search and seed point discrimination. In the seed point search stage, a tensor low-rank sparse decomposition model is first used to decompose the IR image into target and background images. To reduce residual noise and background edges in the target image, we designed a partial tensor correlated total variation (PTCTV) norm. This norm effectively constrains the global low-rankness and local smoothness of the background, and enhances the model's focus on image detail information. Subsequently, leveraging the global sparsity of the target, a density peak search technique is employed to locate seed points in the target image. In the seed point discrimination stage, k-means clustering is utilized to improve the accuracy of the local contrast measure (LCM) in scenarios with uncertain target distribution and mixed background components. By calculating the LCM for each seed point, we further suppress background clutter and enhance real targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior overall performance compared to advanced methods and achieves satisfactory computational speed.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3454150","Shanghai Pujiang Program(grant numbers:23PJ1414800); Open Research Topics of the National Key Laboratory for Multi-Spectrum Information Intelligent Processing Technology(grant numbers:6142113230203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10666784","Density peak search;infrared (IR) small target detection;k-means clustering;local contrast measure (LCM);partial tensor correlated total variation (PTCTV)","Tensors;Noise;Clutter;TV;Image edge detection;Gray-scale;Filtering","","1","","77","CCBYNCND","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this contribution, we extend the application of Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization to deal with Grassmann manifold. The proposed model returns a set of prototype subspaces and a relevance vector. While prototypes model typical behaviours within classes, the relevance factors specify the most discriminative principal vectors (or images) for the classification task. They both provide insights into the model’s decisions by highlighting influential images and pixels for predictions. Moreover, due to learning prototypes, the model complexity of the new method during inference is independent of dataset size, unlike previous works. We applied it to several recognition tasks including handwritten digit recognition, face recognition, activity recognition, and object recognition. Experiments demonstrate that it outperforms previous works with lower complexity and can successfully model the variation, such as handwritten style or lighting conditions.

We propose here a novel self-supervised contrastive learning neural network (NN) architecture to optimize the sum spectral efficiency through joint active and passive beamforming design in multi-user RIS-aided MIMO systems.

Leveraging the proposed self-supervised design helps to greatly reduce the computational complexity during the training phase.

MCS enables the platform to provide data-based service by incentivizing mobile users to perform sensing tasks and gathering sensing data from them. An extremely important problem in MCS is how to achieve effective task allocation in the context of participatory sensing, where mobile users are selectively recruited to perform tasks. However, most current work in this aspect does not consider the condition where multiple time constraints coexist, but models the problem from a single time constraint. Moreover, only a very small number of studies have paid attention to the characteristics of user destinations. Therefore, according to the shortcomings of the above research, we propose a multi-time-constrained task allocation based on origin-destination users (TAOD) problem in MCS for orienteering application, which is proved to be NP-hard. In order to solve the TAOD problem, we firstly design a path reconnection algorithm based on double-ended priority queue (PR-DEPQ) for the single-user scenario. Then, we extend the PR-DEPQ to multi-user task allocation scenario and present a multi-user path reconnection algorithm based on sensing value priority (MUPR).

In structural biology, this process is necessary to semi-automatically composite large mesoscale models of complex protein assemblies and complete cellular structures that are based on measured cryo-EM data. The current approaches require manual fitting in three dimensions to start, resulting in approximately aligned structures followed by an automated fine-tuning of the alignment. The DiffFit approach enables domain scientists to fit new structures automatically and visualize the results for inspection and interactive revision. The fitting begins with differentiable three-dimensional (3D) rigid transformations of the protein atom coordinates followed by sampling the density values at the atom coordinates from the target cryo-EM volume. To ensure a meaningful correlation between the sampled densities and the protein structure, we proposed a novel loss function based on a multi-resolution volume-array approach and the exploitation of the negative space. This loss function serves as a critical metric for assessing the fitting quality, ensuring the fitting accuracy and an improved visualization of the results. We assessed the placement quality of DiffFit with several large, realistic datasets and found it to be superior to that of previous methods. We further evaluated our method in two use cases: automating the integration of known composite structures into larger protein complexes and facilitating the fitting of predicted protein domains into volume densities to aid researchers in identifying unknown proteins. We implemented our algorithm as an open-source plugin (github.com/nanovis/DiffFit) in ChimeraX, a leading visualization software in the field.

To remedy these, in this paper we propose a Haze Density and Semantic Awareness Network (HDSA-Net) for HSI dehazing. Our dual-awareness network not only provides low-level physical information guidance but also high-level semantic guidance for haze removal. Specifically, we estimate the haze density by considering both internal spectral characteristics and external dehazing effects. Based on this, we build a Haze Density Awareness (HDA) block, which enables the network to perceive and focus on difficult dehazing regions with high density. Moreover, we design a Semantic information Extraction Block (SEB) based on the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by several Semantic information Perception Blocks (SPBs), to provide semantic guidance for HSI dehazing. In particular, SEB adapts SAM for the special HSI data and SPBs enable the network to progressively recover semantic information via channel-level coarse guidance and pixel-level fine guidance. The experimental results on simulated and real datasets show the superiority of HDSA-Net over state-of-the-art methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3525072","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371084,62371083,62201111,62301096,62176035); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China(grant numbers:CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX1418); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022MD723727,2024T171109,2021MD703940); Special Funding for Chongqing Postdoctoral Research Project(grant numbers:2022CQBSHTB2041,2022CQBSHTB3086,2021XM3036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820032","Deep learning;dehazing;haze removal;SAM;hyperspectral images","Semantics;Remote sensing;Image restoration;Estimation;Feature extraction;Atmospheric modeling;Scattering;Learning systems;Earth;Deep learning","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper explores the direct detection of R-peaks by assigning categorical labels to each member of the observed values in the ECG sequence and proposes a convolutional encoder-decoder network and training strategy for processing the sequence annotation task. Specifically, the encoder is a stacked convolutional layer equipped with a gating linear unit (GLU), and the decoder is a recurrent neural network.

To address the issue of unbalanced sequence labels, we adopt and fine-tune the focal loss function, promoting superior prediction and faster convergence.

However, efficient support of network security remains challenging even for a standardized IoT network protocol such as the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). It incorporates limited protection from external security attacks but stays considerably vulnerable to internal routing attacks. The inherent design of RPL, particularly its topology establishment and maintenance mechanism, makes it easy to initiate more damaging attacks such as flooding attacks. Given the constrained characteristics of IoT devices, flooding IoT networks can easily lead to resource exhaustion and network performance degradation. This paper introduces a new variant of the flooding attack namely the Destination Advertisement Object Flooding (DAOF) attack. It is based on using routing communications, particularly the DAO messages, to disseminate unnecessary routing traffic which instigate excessive transmissions of control messages across the network. As demonstrated by the experimental results of this study, the DAOF attack can increase network overhead by more than 65% even in a relatively small-scale setup. Additionally, it can notably lead to high energy consumption with an average increase of 36% and low QoS performance with an average latency increase of 150%. For effective mitigation of the DAOF attack, a new lightweight solution based on a simple collaboration among RPL nodes is presented in this paper. It is referred to as DAOF-Secure RPL (DAOF-SRPL). It is based on simple in-protocol modifications to provide RPL with effective security support against the DAOF attack. In contrast to RPL in the attack scenarios, DAOF-SRPL achieved a reduction of over 80% in the total transmission rates of control messages. Meanwhile, it was able to maintain energy consumption and latency at minimal levels while preserving the same PDR results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525798","Qassim University(grant numbers:QU-APC-2024-9/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824786","Internet of Things (IoT);Wireless Networks;Network Security;Energy Efficiency","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For inter-class and intra-class problems, we designed a Gated Global-Local Attention (GGLA) mechanism that captures dependency information of query points in both horizontal and vertical directions, thereby obtaining global information indirectly. Simultaneously, local information is captured through multiple convolutions with a gating layer. The gating mechanism within the GGLA dynamically balances the contributions of global and local information, enabling the model to adaptively focus on the most relevant features for accurate classification. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-branch ensemble network to address the issue of image variety. This network uses two branches to extract image features at different resolutions for fusion, thereby expanding the network receptive field. Additionally, we utilized an Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) to generate images that balance MRI data and implemented multiple preprocessing techniques to tackle inherent noise in MRI images. These techniques enhance the clarity of MRI images while preserving essential details. This results in a clear improvement in the identification of tumor boundaries, crucial for accurate surgical planning and treatment strategies.

The purpose of this research is to address the problem of high-precision retrieval of the Chl-a concentration in small coastal waters. In this article, a singular value decomposition and deep neural network (SVD-DNN) Chl-a inversion model for Hong Kong coastal waters were constructed.

At the same time, a comparative analysis was performed with Chl-a retrieval models created using a feature selection method based on the correlation of band combinations. These models are validated using the Landsat 8 OLI and synchronously measured Chl-a dataset (N = 149 samples). Results show that the developed SVD-DNN model has the best retrieval accuracy [mean R = 0.90, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.21, mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.05], outperforming the SVD-RF and SVD-SVM models. The SVD-DNN model shows superior retrieval performance when the Chl-a concentration is below 6 micrograms per liter (RMSE = 0.66, MAE = 0.67). The proposed model also shows better temporal generalization ability in 2013, 2014, and 2016 compared to the other models. This study demonstrates that the developed and validated SVD-DNN model has excellent robustness and generalization ability and can be used in combination with Landsat data for long-term retrieval of Chl-a across different time series.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3495221","Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(grant numbers:ZR2023MD082); National Key R&D Program(grant numbers:2019YFE0126700); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10759649","Chlorophyll;class II water;remote sensing inversion;singular value decomposition (SVD)","Sea measurements;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Water pollution;Pollution measurement;Atmospheric modeling;Atmospheric measurements;Vectors;Spatial resolution;Landsat","","","","30","CCBY","20 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Estimation and management of energy transfer between humans and robots is essential for enhancing safety during the rehabilitation. Traditional control methods, which rely on coordinate-based monitoring of robot velocity and external forces, often fail in unstructured environments due to their susceptibility to sensor noise and limited adaptability to individual patient needs. This paper introduces the concept of transactive energy, a coordinate-invariant entity that captures the energy dynamics between the human and the robot during robot-assisted rehabilitation and can be used for personalized robot control. However, estimation of such energy transfer is a complex process and therefore, we have developed a transformer-based model to predict the transactive potential energy. The proposed model is implemented on an ankle rehabilitation robot which is a compliant parallel robot and provides the required three rotational degrees of freedom (DOF). The model learns from the data obtained from the experiments carried out using the ankle robot with five stroke patients on two types of controllers: an impedance controller operated in zero impedance control mode and a trajectory tracking controller. This study provides a baseline, for future research on energy-based control mechanisms in pHRI applications, by utilizing the advanced deep learning models.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3515175","Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship through the University of Canberra; Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan, under the Faculty-Development Competitive Research Grants Program for 2024–2026(grant numbers:201223FD8813); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10793448","Transactive energy;neurorehabilitation;energy transfer;physical human–robot interaction;transformer model;adaptive learning","Robots;Ankle;Robot kinematics;Impedance;Adaptation models;Assistive robots;Human-robot interaction;Energy exchange;Transactive energy;Robot sensing systems","","","","49","CCBY","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Early detection of these conditions is crucial due to the risk of severe complications if intervention is delayed. Extensive research supports the notion that nail-fold capillary morphology serves as a critical biomarker for various disease processes, with the degree of capillary structural damage potentially reflecting the involvement of internal organs. This study proposes a non-invasive methodology for detecting nail-fold capillary morphology by integrating an object detection model for improvement within a deep learning framework. We conducted an ablation study to enhance YOLOv8’s performance in detecting nail-fold capillaries and classifying their morphology. Our enhancements included adding a detection layer to improve the detection of various-sized objects, implementing Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanisms, and incorporating data augmentation techniques and hyper-parameter tuning. These modifications yielded a notable improvement in mean Average Precision at IoU 0.50 (mAP@50), with increases of 3.7% in mAP, 3.6% in precision, and 2.5% in recall compared to the baseline YOLOv8 model. This culminated in a mAP@50 score of 79.9%. We also utilized Slicing-Aided Hyperinference (SAHI) to enhance inference performance on untrained multi-scale images and smaller capillaries, demonstrating significant effectiveness in real-time testing scenarios. The results from this research are promising for advancing early-stage diabetes detection using nail-fold image analysis and could potentially enable real-time applications in clinical environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3521937","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea; Ministry of Education(grant numbers:NRF-2021R1I1A3055210); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) through the Artificial Intelligence Convergence Innovation Human Resources Development; Korean Government through the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea(grant numbers:IITP-2023-RS-2023-00256629); MSIT through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program by the Institute for Information Communications Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2024-RS-2024-00437718); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10813368","Nail-fold capillaries;YOLOv8;ECA attention;diabetes;capillaroscopy;SAHI;object detection;deep learning","Diabetes;Real-time systems;Microscopy;YOLO;Thumb;Morphology;Transformers;Visualization;Tuning;Monitoring","","","","60","CCBY","24 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Results: Features at 891 and 768 nm discriminate between subjects with and without leptomeningeal $\beta$-amyloid. The variation of optical taxonomic signal with source-detector distance indicates that both signals come from the leptomeninges and not cerebral cortex.

FEM models in this context are convenient for testing hypothesises about the effects of different stimulation parameters and exploring different electrode designs before moving to in vitro and in vivo experiments. The methods presented in this paper are motivated by assessing differentiation errors from different mesh sizes and the transitions between different materials in the model. We aim to support the development of transparent and reproducible modelling experiments. Accurate and reproducible models are essential, given the importance of the applications in which these models are used. However, a dearth of literature is devoted to promoting best practices in finite element modelling for biophysical models. We evaluate the impact of differentiation errors on calculating the Activating Function and predicting action potentials in a Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) axon model. We found that poor spatial discretisation facilitates the generation of double-derivative noise. However, it does not generate false predictions of action potentials on the H-H model. Activation thresholds were higher (57.5 mA) for coarser meshes than Fine and Extremely Fine (55 mA). Implementing Multiscale meshes with the finest refined sizes reduced material transition discontinuities reflected in the activating function calculation. Our findings support using the finest spatial discretisations possible within computational constraints, which may rely on adaptive meshing techniques. We advocate coupling the extracellular field to H-H-based axons to further limit potential error sources.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3525343","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre; ANID-FOVI(grant numbers:220205); CONICYT- PFCHA/Doctorado Nacional(grant numbers:2020?21202217); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820855","Electrical stimulation;finite element modelling;peripheral nervous system;central nervous system","Mathematical models;Finite element analysis;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Brain modeling;Axons;Solid modeling;Electrodes;Adaptation models;Thigh","","","","","CCBYNCND","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This collusion creates misleading advantages for the involved agents, deceiving others and distorting the actual reputation perception of the colluding members. Although the well-known EigenTrust algorithm can be fruitfully used to detect colluded agents, two important issues arise which limit its effectiveness: 1) it requires input information about which agents can be a-priori considered particularly trustworthy; and 2) it is not designed to handle situations in which we have several, different groups of colluded agents. These problems lead EigenTrust, to produce a significant number of false positives in some real situations. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues. We introduce an automatic procedure to provide EigenTrust with the necessary inputs, and we propose an appropriate algorithm that combines EigenTrust with a clustering process. This procedure groups agents based on their reputation scores to tackle the presence of different groups of colluded agents.

Recently deep learning based methods achieved great success in RSI-SRR, making RSI-SRR more efficient and accurate. However, homogeneous low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution RSI pairs from the same sensor are often difficult to obtain, and the use of simulated image pairs makes it difficult to apply these methods in real scenarios. Some RSI-SRR methods attempt to reconstruct image resolution from heterogeneous RSIs. But these methods, on the one hand, are difficult to deal with large-scale RSI-SRR; and on the other hand, they do not take into account the domain differences of heterogeneous RSIs. To address the above challenges, this article proposes a scale-decoupling super-resolution network with domain transfer for heterogeneous RSIs (SDDT-SR). The SDDT-SR breaks down the large-scale SSR (x8) into two cascaded smaller-scale steps (x2, x4), progressively restoring spatial details of the images. Specifically, in SDDT-SR, an SR module with domain transfer (DTSR) is designed to transfer the LR image from a specific domain to another one, and an SR module with unpaired learning (ULSR) is designed to further up-sample the output of DTSR to the target resolution. Experiments on SGSRD and satellite-UAV heterogeneous image change detection dataset (HTCD) dataset show that SDDT-SR outperforms existing methods in both metrics and visualization, with the fréchet inception distance (FID) of 181.8679 on SGSRD and of 163.3831 on HTCD.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3507104","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3903402); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2024M763736); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42222106); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976234); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10769009","Deep learning (DL);heterogeneous images;remote sensing;super-resolution;unpaired dataset","Image reconstruction;Human-robot interaction;Superresolution;Remote sensing;Generative adversarial networks;Accuracy;Generators;Training;Spatial resolution;Frequency-domain analysis","","","","35","CCBY","27 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model includes a pretrained feature extractor to process ultrasound images, an upsampling block to generate speech, and discriminators to ensure the similarity and fidelity of the reconstructed speech. Finally, both objective and subjective evaluations were conducted for the reconstructed speech. The reconstructed speech demonstrated high intelligibility in both Mandarin phonemes and tones. The character error rate of phonemes in automatic speech recognition was 0.2605, and tone error rate obtained from dictation tests was 0.1784, respectively. Objective results showed high similarity between the reconstructed and ground truth speech. Subjective perception results also indicated an acceptable level of naturalness. The proposed method demonstrates its capability to reconstruct tonal Mandarin speech from ultrasound tongue images. However, future research should concentrate on specific conditions of laryngectomees, aiming to enhance and optimize model performance. This will be achieved by enlarging training datasets, investigating the impact of ultrasound tongue imaging parameters, and further refining this method.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3520498","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:32071315,12372299); Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) Japan(grant numbers:JPMJCR19A3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10810495","Ultrasound tongue image;speech reconstruction;end-to-end;generative adversarial networks (GANs);Mandarin speech","Tongue;Ultrasonic imaging;Image reconstruction;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Training;Speech enhancement;Autoencoders;Vocoders;Transducers","","","","51","CCBY","20 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between the top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy. The current study examines how changing the meta-prior w in the interaction phase affects the counter force generated when an experimenter attempts to induce movement pattern transitions familiar to the robot through its prior training. The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Finally, the study examines how different levels of disturbances, pattern level, and cognitive level can be resolved internally across different layers. Our experimental results indicated that 1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when w is set with larger/smaller values; 2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions; and 3) when the robot was disturbed in the cognitive level, the disturbance was resolved more in the higher layer as compared to the case with disturbance in the pattern level.

While ETC is more efficient, an inappropriate proportion of ETC lanes can increase congestion, making optimal ETC lane selection crucial. This paper proposes a novel framework combining deep learning and multi-objective optimization to improve toll plaza efficiency. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model with Optuna hyperparameter tuning predicts average queue lengths for various ETC lane proportions. The predictions guide the identification of the ideal ETC lane configuration to minimize queue lengths and balance traffic flow between MTC and ETC lanes. The framework dynamically adjusts ETC lane proportions based on real-time traffic data to ensure optimal lane allocations during peak hours. A multi-objective optimization function is applied to balance key objectives such as minimizing queue length, reducing queue time, lowering operational costs, and optimizing ETC utilization. Simulations with real-world data from high-traffic toll plazas demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness, reducing queue lengths by up to 95.03% during peak hours, decreasing operational costs by 28.72%, and improving overall toll plaza performance. The results are visualized with graphs showing predicted average queue lengths across different ETC lane proportions, aiding stakeholders in understanding the relationship between ETC adoption and congestion. The framework provides insights into operational costs and resource allocation, enhancing financial and operational planning.

However, the effects of using inadequate reference plots for modeling have not been thoroughly investigated. The interaction between topographic and biological factors results in a more complex distribution of forest attributes, leading to significant uncertainty and challenges in obtaining reliable information. This study presents a protocol that uses a 4-way factorial experimental design to establish appropriate sampling schemes aimed at reducing uncertainty and bias in estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) using the kNN technique. The research was conducted in a mixed forest within a subtropical region affected by wildfires, pine wilt disease, and agricultural activities. A total of 252 sampling schemes, incorporating various sampling methods, feature counts, neighbor counts (k), and reference-target distances (RTD), were utilized to generate corresponding AGB-kNN models. The performance of the models was assessed against measured AGB using a tree-based IPCC-compliant method with a high-resolution orthoimage and canopy-height-model data. Results indicated that these sampling schemes produced AGB estimations with average error rates ranging from 13% to 241%. The optimal kNN model utilized spectral, biophysical, and topographic features through a systematic sampling approach, with k set at 30 and RTD at 900 meters. Findings suggest that systematic sampling outperformed random and cluster sampling, with models that used moderate k and RTD generally providing less biased estimates. This protocol effectively identifies suitable kNN-AGB models, enhancing the ability to delineate areas with low biomass productivity for precision management, while also supporting forest improvement initiatives and biomass-related studies.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3486737","National Science and Technology Council(grant numbers:109-2221-E-415-003,110-2221-E-415-007-MY2); Forestry and Nature Conservation, Taiwan(grant numbers:TFBC-1060113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10742446","Adaptable precision management;Airborne laser scanning (ALS) lidar;carbon accounting;forest degradation;information uncertainty;k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approach estimated AGB (kNN-AGB) modeling;sampling scheme","Forestry;Biological system modeling;Estimation;Biomass;Measurement;Uncertainty;Systematics;Random forests;Carbon;Sampling methods","","","","80","CCBYNCND","4 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional methods of sharing data at the edge have issues with security, speed, and consensus. The goal is to develop a Blockchain-based Secure Data Sharing Framework (BSDSF) capable of improving data integrity, latency, and overall network efficiency for edge-cloud computing applications. BSDSF proposes using blockchain technology with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and smart contract-based validation as a new method of secure data sharing. It has a two-tiered consensus protocol to meet the needs of edge computing, which requires instantaneous responses. BSDSF employs Byzantine fault tolerance to deal with errors and protect against attacks. Smart contracts automate validation and consensus operations, while edge computing processes data at the attack site. Node validation and failure detection methods monitor network quality and dependability, while system security ensures secure communication between nodes. BSDSF is an important step toward digital freedom and trust by protecting security and improving transaction reliability. The framework demonstrates a reduction in transaction latency by up to 30% and an increase in throughput by 25% compared to traditional edge computing models, positioning BSDSF as a pivotal solution for fostering digital freedom and trust in edge computing environments.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2024.9010051","Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University(grant numbers:RGP2/230/44); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817767","Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT);blockchain-driven;edge computing networks;consensus contract;data validation contract;node validation contract","Fault tolerance;Data integrity;Fault tolerant systems;Smart contracts;Throughput;Real-time systems;Consensus protocol;Security;Standards;Edge computing","","","","22","","30 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To stimulate vehicles to participate in cooperative perception while blocking the spreading of worms through V2V communications, we design an incentive mechanism, in which the utility of each sensory data requester and that of each sensory data provider are defined, respectively, to maximize the total utility of all the vehicles. To deal with the highly non-convex problem, we propose a pairing and resource allocation (PRA) scheme based on the Stackelberg game theory.

Some of these algorithms focus on reducing the number of communication rounds by allowing clients to skip frequent interactions with the parameter server. In this work, our primary concern is the overall energy consumption during model training in federated learning. We challenge the conventional notion that reducing the frequency of communication leads to energy savings and present evidence that for nonindependent and nonidentical (non-IID) data distribution, increasing the frequency of communication can, in fact, result in greater energy conservation. Our contribution comprises two key aspects: first, we introduce a quantized version of the recently proposed algorithm called federated primal-dual (FedPD) (Zhang et al., 2021), which we refer to as quantized FedPD (QFedPD). Importantly, we substantiate the convergence guarantees for QFedPD. Second, we explore the tradeoff between quantization and communication skipping in the proposed approach. Our analysis demonstrates that applying quantization without skipping communication, using QFedPD, yields the most significant energy-saving benefits for non-IID data distribution. Intriguingly, when dealing with non-IID data distribution, the preferred strategy is to maximize energy efficiency, allowing all clients to transmit at every iteration while quantizing their updates.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2024.3464239","European Commission Through (Horizon Europe SNS JU ADROIT6G Project)(grant numbers:101095363); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10684263","Computation then aggregation protocol (CTA);distributed optimization;energy-efficient learning;federated learning (FL);model quantization","Quantization (signal);Convergence;Computational modeling;Optimization;Data models;Stochastic processes;Servers","","","","26","CCBY","19 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we investigate a UAV-assisted MEC system with stochastic computing tasks. The system seeks to minimize overall energy consumption by optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation, and the UAV’s trajectory scheduling. This objective corresponds to a stochastic optimization problem. Given the problem’s non-convex nature and the temporal coupling of variables, the Lyapunov optimization method is employed to analyze the task queue, breaking down the original optimization problem into three independent and more manageable subproblems. A joint optimization algorithm with iterative solving is proposed for solving the three sub-problems and then obtaining the stochastic computation offloading, resource allocation, and trajectory scheduling strategy.

Echocardiogram based classification of heart valve conditions is vital for effectively diagnosing and managing heart disease. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) alongside a 3D-Echo Fusion approach and a Dual Attention Model for heart valve disease classification using echocardiogram videos. Our method employs a CNN-based encoder to extract spatial features from individual video frames, which are then enhanced through a 3D-Echo Fusion technique to capture comprehensive volumetric information. An RNN models the temporal dynamics of heart valve motion, while the Dual Attention Model refines the classification process by enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features. This integration results in a classification accuracy of 98.7% and an AUC score of 0.85, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in heart valve disease classification. The high accuracy and interpretability of the model provide potential clinical benefits by supporting decision-making and improving patient care.

In order to enhance energy efficiency in multiplex networked industrial chains under time-of-use price, a coarse time granularity task scheduling approach has been adopted. This approach adjusts the distribution of electricity supply based on task deadlines, dividing it into longer periods to facilitate batch access to task information. However, traditional simplex-network task assignment optimization methods are unable to achieve a globally optimal solution for cross-layer links in multiplex networked industrial chains. Existing solutions struggle to balance execution costs and completion efficiency in time-of-use price scenarios. Therefore, this paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming model for solving the problem scenario and two algorithms: an exact algorithm based on the branch-and-bound method and a multi-objective heuristic algorithm based on cross-layer policy propagation.

We introduce the parametrized grid-based filter, that uses the plant age of the crops as a parameter to model the phenology dynamics. Accordingly, the nonstationary transition matrix is defined to characterize the transitions between discrete phenological stages in numerical scale. At the update step, the combination between the observation and the predicted parametrized evolution is exploited to jointly estimate both phenology and plant age. The method is applied on dense time series of dual-pol VV-VH Sentinel-1 (S1) radar images to estimate the phenological stages of rice (defined in the BBCH scale) in Sevilla, Spain, during four annual seasons, from 2017 to 2020. Phenology is accurately estimated when the evolution model is trained with actual ground data, showing $0.96\leq R^{2}\leq 0.99$. Regarding the plant age, when more than four S1 images are considered, its estimates reach stable and accurate values (with a maximum error of 5 days), exhibiting $R^{2}$ close to unity. A comparison with the previous GBF shows that this is outperformed by the proposed estimation strategy, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed dynamical framework in obtaining improved and realistic phenology estimates, according to the particular time epoch in the crops life. Finally, when the plant age is unknown, which is the case on most real monitoring scenarios, our method performs significantly better, indicating that the knowledge of sowing date is no longer needed during the remote sensing-based phenology estimation.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3516212","European Funds for Regional Development; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Agencia Estatal de Investigacion, AEI)(grant numbers:PID2020-117303GB-C22/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10794648","Agriculture;Bayesian filtering;phenology;remote sensing;synthetic aperture radar","Phenology;Crops;Remote sensing;Monitoring;Estimation;Predictive models;Temperature measurement;Spaceborne radar;Real-time systems;Random forests","","","","32","CCBY","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We formulate the problem in the special Euclidean groups  ${SE}(2)$  and  ${SE}(3)$ , where the kinematics are described as rigid body motion (RBM). We consider the condition for separating two ellipsoidal rigid bodies by employing a signed distance from a supporting hyperplane of a rigid body to the other rigid body. Although a positive value of this signed distance implies that the two rigid bodies are collision-free, a naively designed supporting hyperplane yields a smaller value than the actual distance. To avoid such a conservative evaluation, the supporting hyperplane is rotated so that the signed distance from the supporting hyperplane to the other rigid body is maximized. We prove that the maximum value of this optimization problem is equal to the actual distance between two ellipsoidal rigid bodies, hence eliminating excessive conservativeness. We leverage this signed distance as a CBF to prevent collision while the supporting hyperplane is rotated via a gradient-based input. The designed CBF is integrated into a quadratic programming (QP) problem, where each rigid body calculates its collision-free input in a distributed manner, given communication among rigid bodies. We exemplify that our method can be extended to other kinematic models.

LEO SATCOM excels in delivering versatile information services across expansive areas, facilitating both unicast and multicast transmissions via high-speed broadband capability. Nonetheless, given the broadband coverage of LEO SATCOM, traffic demand distribution within the service area is non-uniform, and the time/frequency/power resources available at LEO satellites remain significantly limited. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a rate-matching framework for non-orthogonal unicast and multicast (NOUM) transmission. Our approach aims to minimize the difference between offered rates and traffic demands for both unicast and multicast messages. By multiplexing unicast and multicast transmissions over the same radio resource, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed to manage interference between unicast and multicast streams, as well as inter-user interference under imperfect channel state information at the LEO satellite. To address the formulated problem’s non-smoothness and non-convexity, the common rate is approximated using the LogSumExp technique. Thereafter, we represent the common rate portion as the ratio of the approximated function, converting the problem into an unconstrained form. A generalized power iteration (GPI)-based algorithm, coined GPI-RS-NOUM, is proposed upon this reformulation. Through comprehensive numerical analysis across diverse simulation setups, we demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms various benchmarks for LEO SATCOM with uneven traffic demands.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2024.3460073","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(grant numbers:2022R1A2C4002065); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:2024-00359235,2024-00436887,2022-0-00704,2021-0-00260,2021-0-00467,2021-0-00847); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10680149","NOUM transmission;LEO SATCOM;rate-matching;RSMA;heterogeneous traffic demands","Unicast;Low earth orbit satellites;Streams;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Antennas;Quality of service","","","","40","CCBYNCND","13 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These distortions have multiple effects on communication channels, including higher bit error rate (BER), reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and restricted channel capacity. It has been determined that impulsive noise is one of the most detrimental noise types in hybrid power line communication-visible light communication (PLC/VLC) systems. Several techniques to combat impulsive noise in telecommunication systems have been discussed in scholarly research. Most impulsive mitigation methods discussed in the literature require knowledge of the noise parameters in order to function properly. Their principle of operation is based on prior knowledge of impulsive noise characteristics such as probability of occurrence of impulsive noise and noise power at the receiver, to ascertain the optimum blanking threshold. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is extremely difficult to determine such parameters in real-life applications due to the dynamic nature of impulsive noise. Thus, in this paper, we exploit the dynamic peak threshold estimation (DPTE) method in asymmetrically clipped optical-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) based hybrid PLC/VLC system. This is essential for determining the ideal blanking threshold without prior knowledge concerning the distinctive characteristics of impulsive noise. The acquired results demonstrate that the proposed method does not only eliminates the need to know impulsive noise parameters, but also enhances the receiver’s output SNR. Moreover, the results showed a clear correlation between the optimal blanking threshold and the peak-to-average power value of the ACO-OFDM symbol which we leveraged to ascertain the optimal blanking threshold.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820356","Dynamic peak threshold estimation;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;PLC/VLC systems;power line communication;signal-to-noise ratio;visible light communication","Noise;Blanking;Peak to average power ratio;Signal to noise ratio;Visible light communication;Prevention and mitigation;Distortion;Bit error rate;System performance;Symbols","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Our design aims to achieve precise identification of falls by extracting a variety of features obtained from the simultaneous acquisition of acceleration and angular velocity data using a single sensor. To enhance detection accuracy and reduce false alarms, we establish a classifier based on the joint acceleration and Euler angle feature (JAEF) analysis. With the aid of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, human activities are classified into eight categories: going upstairs, going downstairs, running, walking, falling forward, falling backward, falling left, and falling right. In particular, we introduce a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of fall detection algorithms by introducing the Equal Signal Amplitude Difference method. Through experimental demonstration, the proposed method exhibits a remarkable sensitivity of 99.25%, precision of 98.75%, and excels in classification accuracy.

Within the physical layer security (PLS) paradigm, the secret key generation (SKG) technique exploits the wireless channel’s randomness to generate symmetric secret keys for message encryption/decryption by legitimate communication nodes. The SKG procedure involves various steps such as wireless channel probing, quantization, information reconciliation, and privacy amplification to render effective symmetric secret key bits. This work proposes a novel multi-level channel quantization scheme, which for the given distribution of the channel envelopes’ gain, ensures an identical likelihood of the envelope samples falling into each quantization interval. Inspired by the classical companding transform (CT), the proposed probability integral transform (PIT)–based quantization scheme works in three sequential steps. First, average contiguous duration (ACD), a second-order fading statistics metric, is considered to select and bias the channel samples that are more likely to fall in the same quantization interval. Subsequently, by using an invertible transform the envelope values are transformed into samples drawn from a uniform distribution, which are then processed through a uniform quantizer. The proposed PIT-based transformation and quantization scheme aims to enhance the trade-offs between the SKG performance metrics namely the key generation rate (KGR), key disagreement rate (KDR), and the key randomness properties. A comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed PIT-based quantization scheme for generalized gamma (GG) fading channels is conducted and its performance is evaluated in relation to several channel and system parameters. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed scheme with its counterparts in the literature is also provided to demonstrate its relative performance gains, where our proposed scheme is observed to outperform the existing schemes. Notably, when the correlation of the reciprocal channel is set to  $\rho =0.8$ , the samples excursion qualification threshold is set to  $L=3$ , and GG fading conditions set as defined by  $\alpha =2$ ,  $\xi =1$ , and  $\upsilon =1$ , the proposed algorithm, which employs sample biasing and transformation, offers an average improvement of 0.02% in KGR and 0.15% in KDR performance compared to the conventional UQ scheme. Additionally, the algorithm demonstrates superior performance in all considered eight the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests, exemplified by an average P-value of 0.78 in the frequency monobit test. Furthermore, for the considered system and channel parameters the proposed algorithm provides an average improvement of 0.06% in KDR compared to cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based non-uniform quantization (CDF-NUQ).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523105","HEC-NRPU(grant numbers:20-14731); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10816322","6G;beyond 5G;key bits;physical layer security;quantization;secret key generation","Quantization (signal);Wireless communication;Communication system security;Wireless sensor networks;Vectors;Transforms;Rayleigh channels;Physical layer security;Electronic mail;Eavesdropping","","","","57","CCBY","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To answer these questions, we developed a functioning prototype that we used as a technology probe. We conducted an in-depth exploratory study with 10 participant pairs to analyze their interaction choices, the interplay between the input modalities, and their collaboration. While touch was the most used modality, we found that participants preferred speech commands for global operations, used them for distant interaction, and that speech interaction contributed to the awareness of the partner's actions. Furthermore, the likelihood of using speech commands during collaboration was related to the personality trait of agreeableness. Regarding collaboration styles, participants interacted with speech equally often whether they were in loosely or closely coupled collaboration. While the partners stood closer to each other during close collaboration, they did not distance themselves to use speech commands.

The possibility of having short-term predictions of the intensity of lightning phenomena would allow the near-real-time monitoring of the evolution of these events. Such knowledge would help in defining operational strategies to mitigate effects on the population and the infrastructure. In this context, this article proposes a multidisciplinary approach aiming at developing a regression algorithm to nowcast the density of cloud-to-ground lightning strokes 1 h in advance. The algorithm is developed on the basis of a joint combination of remote sensing data, numerical weather prediction model outcomes, and lightning observations. The possible dependence between the meteorological data and the density of lightning is estimated using Gaussian process regression models. Separate models are created for positive and negative strokes and for strokes occurrences over the land or sea. The experimental results indicate that the model quite accurately estimates low numbers of strokes, whereas larger numbers of strokes are estimated with higher errors. Nevertheless, their presence is correctly detected. This suggests the potential of the method as a processing tool to support the management of weather-related hazards.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3501976","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10756564","Lightning;nowcasting;Gaussian process regression;numerical weather prediction;satellite infrared imagery;satellite precipitation radar","Climate change;Lightning;Gaussian processes;Weather forecasting;Infrared imaging;Satellite images;Precipitation;Remote sensing;Numerical models;Predictive models","","","","84","CCBY","18 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent traces, shared by leading cloud data center enterprises like Google and Alibaba, reveal that the constant increase in data center services and computational power is accompanied by a growing variability in service demand requirements. The number of cores needed for a job can vary widely, ranging from one to several thousands, and the number of seconds a core is held by a job can span more than five orders of magnitude. In this context of extreme variability, the policies governing the allocation of cores to jobs play a crucial role in the performance of data centers. It is widely acknowledged that the First-In First-Out (FIFO) policy tends to underutilize available computing capacity due to the varying magnitudes of core requests. However, the impact of the extreme variability in service demands on job waiting and response times, that has been deeply investigated in traditional queuing models, is not as well understood in the case of data centers, as we will show. To address this issue, we investigate the dynamics of a data center cluster through analytical models in simple cases, and discrete event simulations based on real data. Our findings emphasize the significant impact of service demand variability, both in terms of requested cores and service times, and allow us to provide insight for enhancing data center performance.

Automated mapping is crucial in several agricultural applications, including crop wear assessment and yield forecasting. The high-resolution multispectral optical data can deliver essential spatial-spectral characteristics; however, these are typically impeded by unfavorable weather and obstructions, resulting in poor classification. Recent advancements in multisensor data fusion techniques have focused on integrating optical data with auxiliary synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to mitigate misclassification issues. However, current optical-SAR fusion techniques have yet to effectively address the incorporation of spatial-spectral characteristics with long-term temporal dependencies of satellite image time series (SITS). This article proposes an optical-SAR deep fusion framework, STA-AgriNet, that integrates a U-Net encoder–decoder with spatial-temporal attention frameworks to enable superior extraction of long-term spatial-temporal dependencies for reliable crop-type mapping. The spectral spatial feature mapper (SSFM), mixed parallel spatial attention (MPSA), and spatio-temporal attention mapper (STAM) modules of the STA-AgriNet extract key classification-defining, discriminative patterns for semantic segmentation. The STA-AgriNet framework is evaluated against current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and demonstrates superior performance across multiple metrics, achieving an accuracy of 83.61% with a minimal inference time of 10.09 s and a compact parameter count of 0.97 million. The model also excels in other key evaluation metrics, establishing its overall effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing techniques.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3510468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10772604","Crop mapping;data fusion;Sentinel-1;Sentinel-2;spatial attention;temporal attention","Crops;Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Accuracy;Optical sensors;Adaptive optics;Vegetation mapping;Sentinel-1;Data mining;Phenology","","","","34","CCBY","2 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the modality discrepancy between RGB and IR images poses a significant challenge for re-ID. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Proxy-based Embedding Alignment (PEA) method to align the RGB and IR modalities in the embedding space. PEA introduces modality-specific identity proxies and leverages the sample-to-proxy relations to learn the model. Specifically, PEA focuses on three types of alignments: intra-modality alignment, inter-modality alignment, and cycle alignment. Intra-modality alignment aims to align sample features and proxies of the same identity within a modality. Inter-modality alignment aims to align sample features and proxies of the same identity across different modalities. Cycle alignment requires that a proxy is aligned with itself after tracing it along a cross-modality cycle (e.g., IR→RGB→IR). By integrating these alignments into the training process, PEA effectively mitigates the impact of modality discrepancy and learns discriminative features across modalities. We conduct extensive experiments on several RGB-IR re-ID datasets, and the results show that PEA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on SYSU-MM01 dataset, PEA achieves 71.0% mAP under the multi-shot setting of the indoor-search protocol, surpassing the best-performing method by 7.2%.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2023.9010113","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFFO602103,2021YFF0602102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494932","cross-modality person re-identification;feature alignment;cycle consistency;metric learning","Measurement;Training;Feature extraction;Vectors;Task analysis;Protocols;Optimization","","","","55","","8 Apr 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, it still lacks a comprehensive investigation on both the spatial distribution and inherent influencing factors of potential landslides across the entire LP due to its vast extension, active tectonic movement, diverse geomorphic types, and climate variations. We first apply interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology to identify 2052 potential landslides across the LP, which exhibit three landslide concentrated zones. Then, we adopt XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to model the effects of topographic, geomorphic, geological, hydrological factors on the landslides, and SHAP (Shapley additive explanation) algorithm to boost the interpretability and diaphaneity of modeling process. Considering the spatial differentiation of influencing factors for a wide area, we compare the patterns revealed by whole region modeling and subregion modeling. The results indicate that the subregion modeling is superior to whole region modeling, especially in revealing the distribution patterns of influencing factors with spatial heterogeneity. The influencing factors can be divided into two categories, those with spatial heterogeneity (i.e., elevation, fault, and road) and those without spatial heterogeneity (i.e., rain, river, and NDVI). The subregion modeling results indicate that rainfall has the greatest contribution to landslide development in all zones, and fault, NDVI and elevation are the subdominant factors in three zones, respectively.

To address this issue, this study adopts a hybrid approach that combines convolutional neural networks and a transformer model. The technique comprises three key components: a spectral-spatial convolutional module (SSCM), a spatial attention module (SAM), and a transformer module (TM). Each component facilitates the others in the process of classification. SSCM is used to extract shallow features with the help of dilated convolutional layers, while the SAM enhances spatial features for further processing. In addition, a TM with a local neighborhood attention mechanism is employed to extract local semantic information.

Then, aiming at the problem that finite element model (FEM) is difficult to analyze the variation law of the outer stator torque when the rotor yoke is saturated caused by the high inner stator current, a new quasi-3D equivalent magnetic network (EMN) model with invariable air-gap permeance and accounting for saturation and flux leakage is proposed by using superposition method.

According to the quasi-3D EMN results, the proposed IBPMM has 3 times short-term overload capacity, and the outer stator torque decreases by only approximately 0.5% at the maximum inner boost current.

However, during a fault, it is crucial to implement a function that limits their output current to prevent short circuit currents from exceeding their capacity. This raises concerns about the potential deterioration of transient stability in the power system. The influence of current limiting on transient stability depends on the current-limiting methodology. However, comprehensive theoretical evaluations are still lacking. This paper presents the theoretical evaluation of the influence of current limiting on transient stability for various current limitation algorithms. Accordingly, an equivalent virtual impedance (EVI) is proposed as a universal metric. EVI represents an impedance virtually assumed between the voltage source simulated in GFM control and the connection point of the inverter, and is computed so that the current through the EVI matches the limited output current. The transient stability is then assessed for various current-limiting algorithms based on the electric circuit characteristic of EVI. Finally, time-domain simulation is conducted to evaluate the consistency of the assessment.","2644-1314","","10.1109/OJPEL.2024.3520111","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)(grant numbers:JPNP22003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10806746","Current limiting;grid forming;power system;short circuit ratio;transient stability;virtual impedance","Impedance;Power system stability;Transient analysis;Limiting;Circuit stability;Voltage control;Numerical stability;Grid forming;Stability criteria;Synchronous generators","","","","45","CCBY","18 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) provides thermal infrared measurements, which can be translated into LST, for 40 years with high temporal resolution. However, the time series suffers from discontinuities caused by the orbit drift of the carrying National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites. In this article, a new orbit drift correction (ODC) method is proposed, which uses geostationary Spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager LST to create an AVHRR daily maximum LST time series over Europe. The orbit drift corrected AVHRR LST is validated in three ways: First, observations from the same day but different NOAA platforms are intercompared; second, the orbit drift corrected time series is compared to the climate change initiative (CCI) LST product by the European Space Agency; and third, the orbit drift corrected time series is compared to air temperature (T2m) measurements. The cross-platform comparison and the comparison to CCI LST shows that the ODC method successfully minimized the discontinuities between the NOAA platforms and also spurious trends within the individual platforms. The mean absolute difference (MAD) for the cross-platform comparison is improved from 4.13 to 1.86 K, while the MAD for the comparison with CCI LST is improved from 2.39 to 2.04 K. The comparison with T2m shows both a high correlation of the anomalies and a high accordance of the trends and climatological patterns. Furthermore, it is shown that the ODC works consistently for all land cover types, however results are better in Central than in Southern Europe. This is explained by the higher daily LST amplitude and the consequently higher impacts of the orbit drift on the LST in lower latitudes. The resulting long-term LST dataset with its unique temporal coverage and resolution enables numerous studies regarding climate and global change including land atmosphere interactions and phenomena like heat waves and droughts.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3514734","German Aerospace Center TIMELINE; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10787383","Advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR);climate change;daytime normalization;land surface temperature (LST);orbit drift correction (ODC)","Climate change;Electron mobility;Satellite images;Land surface temperature;Time series analysis;Long short term memory;Sea measurements;Ocean temperature;Extraterrestrial measurements;Market research;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","","","","47","CCBY","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The 3-D semantics derived from TMMs serve as the foundation in many applications, such as urban planning, forestry, and smart city. Although 3-D TMM provides more features than 2-D images, current classification methods have not fully utilized these features, particularly the stereoscopic hierarchical structure of different objects. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical object-based method for the classification of TMMs, consisting of three key steps: 1) the TMM is first hierarchically segmented into ground surface meshes and off-ground 3-D objects using a cloth-simulated filtering algorithm; 2) the ground surface mesh is projected to 2-D ortho-image, where object-based image classification is used to classify pixels. The resulting semantic labels of pixels are then mapped back to the corresponding mesh model; 3) instance-level 3-D objects are created through connected component analysis of off-ground meshes, and then classified via a 3-D object-based approach. The 3-D semantic model is generated by merging the outcomes of steps 2) and 3).

This method utilizes a resonator to conduct concurrent measurements at the three lowest quasi-TE01p modes across various temperatures, combined with an algorithm to fit the loss tangent dependence on frequency and temperature. Our technique serves as a preliminary step to characterize dielectrics used in Hakki-Coleman resonators for surface resistance measurements. Consequently, parameters for dielectric characterization—such as sample size and modes used—are determined by the requirements of subsequent surface resistance measurements, rather than optimizing the determination of the material’s intrinsic dielectric properties. Despite this focus, our measurements on rutile align well with existing literature. We conducted measurements on three samples of single-crystal titanium dioxide from the same production batch, covering a frequency range from 6.0 to 9.4 GHz, with uncertainties of less than than 0.7% for permittivity and 13% for loss tangent. These measurements revealed sample-to-sample differences that cannot be attributed to measurement uncertainty alone. Our findings suggest that the previous approach of using multiple rutile crystals with varying sizes to assess the frequency dependence of dielectric loss may lead to significant uncertainty in predicting loss tangent due to variations in sample properties. We describe the possible extension of this technique to characterize other dielectrics beyond rutile, including commercial dielectrics, across frequency and temperature. We aslo discuss its potential widespread application in the use of Hakki-Coleman resonators for quality control of materials used in particle accelerators, such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh).","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2024.3522383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10821521","Dielectric loss;loss tangent;permittivity;dielectric resonator","Dielectrics;Temperature measurement;Frequency measurement;Resonant frequency;Permittivity measurement;Dielectric loss measurement;Permittivity;Loss measurement;Resonance;Q-factor","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, current deep learning methods relying on spatial features still exhibit limitations in accurately detecting changed edge regions and insignificant areas. To overcome this limitation, we propose the multiscale spatial-frequency feature fusion network (MSFNet) for change detection. The network aims to enhance the detection capability of change edge and insignificant regions. In the encoding stage, we introduce a frequency difference feature extraction module to enhance the frequency difference features by extracting high-frequency information that represents changes and low-frequency information that represents invariance at each feature scale. This approach effectively mitigates the issue of incomplete change information caused by relying solely on a single spatial feature dimension for feature extraction. In the decoding stage, a spatial frequency difference fusion module is introduced to map the extracted frequency difference information back to the spatial domain. This module enhances the network's semantic modeling capability for change regions while mitigating the degradation of edge detection accuracy resulting from information loss during feature extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that MSFNet has remarkable performance on both the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets, with an F1 score of 91.66 and an IoU of 84.41 on the LEVIR-CD dataset, and an F1 score of 90.87 and an IoU of 82.80 on the WHU-CD dataset.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3481424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10726802","Changed edge regions and insignificant areas;frequency difference feature;remote sensing change detection (CD);semantic modeling capability","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Transformers;Frequency-domain analysis;Image edge detection;Semantics;Accuracy;Data mining;Deep learning;Computational complexity","","","","44","CCBYNCND","21 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, we consider it an effective method for attacking cryptography. According to Origin Quantum Computing, QA computers are able to factor numbers several orders of magnitude larger than universal quantum computers. We try to transform the integer factorization problem in RSA attacks into a combinatorial optimization problem by using the QA algorithm of D-Wave quantum computer, and attack RSA-2048 which is composed of a class of special integers.

The follower robot is equipped with an elongated tool that through a small incision passes inside the patient's body, where sensitive structures may exist.

However, the DMSP-OLS sensor has no on-board calibration, the DMSP-OLS and NPP-VIIRS data are not spatially consistent and continuous due to the differences in spatial resolution and sensor design between satellites, which makes it difficult to use both datasets at the same time for spatio-temporal consistency analysis. Based on this, this study proposed a new approach for systematically calibrating the DMSP-OLS and NPP-VIIRS NTL data, and rapidly generated a continuously consistent NTL dataset from 1992 to 2022. First, the DMSP-OLS data were calibrated using the invariant target method. Secondly, the NPP-VIIRS data were subjected to outlier elimination and time-series comparability calibration. Third, a new fourth-degree polynomial fit calibration model is proposed to calibrate the NPP-VIIRS data into the DMSP-OLS data scale. Finally, this research obtained a long-time series (1992–2022) “DMSP-OLS-like” NTL dataset, and analyzed the dynamics NTLs at different scales. Compared with other fitting methods, the “DMSP-OLS-like” dataset in this research has a clearer city hierarchy. It significantly reduces the saturation phenomenon and spillover effect, has a good spatial pattern and spatio-temporal consistency, and is highly compatible with the relevant socioeconomic reference quantities. The correlation coefficients R2 of total DN with population, GDP, and electricity consumption were 0.922, 0.922, and 0.988, respectively. The results showed that the proposed approach was effective, which is superior to those of existing researches.

Signal processing procedures that tend to collapse in the presence of model mismatches can be effectively improved and made robust by incorporating the selective use of data-driven techniques. This paper explores the use of neural network (NN)-based receivers to improve the reception of a Rate Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) system. The intention is to explore several alternatives to conventional successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques, which are known to be ineffective in the presence of channel state information (CSI) and model errors. The focus is on NN-based architectures that do not need to be retrained at each channel realization. The main idea is to replace some of the basic operations in a conventional multi-antenna SIC receiver by their NN-based equivalents, following a hybrid Model/Data-driven based approach that preserves the main procedures in the model-based signal demodulation chain. Three different architectures are explored along with their performance and computational complexity, characterized under different degrees of model uncertainty, including imperfect channel state information and non-linear channels. We evaluate the performance of data-driven architectures in overloaded scenario to analyze its effectiveness against conventional benchmarks.

To address these problems, an improved significance object detection network — CGDINet (Coordinate Attention-Group Consensus Aggregation Module-Depth Auxiliary Module-Inverse Saliency Pyramid Reconstruction Network)—is proposed. CGDINet introduces the Group Consensus Aggregation Module (GCAM) embedded with the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism, named CAGM (Coordinate Attention-Group Consensus Aggregation Module), to enhance global feature capture capabilities and improve the processing of directional features.

Prior experimental studies indicate that underground mines suffer from severe radio frequency (RF) signal attenuation of 50 dB loss. Due to this severe signal attenuation characteristic, the currently deployed radio frequency energy harvesting (RF-EH) testbed cannot be deployed in underground mines. In this study, we designed and performed an empirical study with a military grade class A radio frequency wireless power transfer (RF-WPT) testbed experimenting with various digital modulation schemes. The various digital modulation schemes experimented included: BPSK, DBPSK, QPSK, OQPSK, Pi4DQPSK, 8PSK, D8PSK,16PSK, QAM16, QAM 64, QAM 256, QAM 1024, 2ASK, 2FSK, 4FSK, 8FSK, 16FSK, and OFDM. With the proposed testbed, we successfully performed long distance WPT in an underground mine at 20 meters by harvesting 4.2 volts DC with a Powercast P21XXCSR-EVB RF-EH receiver. We are specifically interested in understanding the optimal digital modulation scheme from the perspective of WPT efficiency in real world deployment scenario. Based on the outcome of this study, the optimal modulation scheme/s for WPT and wireless information transfer (WIT) in a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) ecosystem is established. Amongst the various digital modulation schemes experimented with, 2ASK, 2FSK, 4FSK, 8FSK, 16 FSK and Pi4DQPSK exhibited high performance based on the maximum power transfer distance. Therefore, we recommend them as good candidates for WPT digital modulation schemes. The research also compared the impact of using Yagi and omnidirectional antennas. It was observed that there is a 5 meters performance loss between these antennas. Additionally, we mimicked a multipath wireless channel by introducing an N directional 15 dB coupler at the transmitter side, it was observed that underground mines lack multipath effect and hence, antenna diversity and MIMO technology will perform poorly in such environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525068","CDC-NIOSH U60(grant numbers:CDC-NIOSH U60); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820323","WPT;RF;RF-RH;RF-WPT;WIT;SWIPT energy harvesting;underground mines;far field;RF-EH;OFDM;2ASK;2FSK;4FSK;8FSK;16 FSK and Pi4DQPSK;N directional 15 dB coupler","Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Digital modulation;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer;Modulation;Energy harvesting;OFDM;Frequency shift keying;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","CCBYNCND","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The second method uses the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST), which employs predefined filters in network layers. We compare its performance with the S-DDL method. WST is a convolutional network with predefined wavelet filters that do not need to be learned, requiring lower processing time and complexity. Both methods can be directly applied to raw image data without time-consuming pre-processing, as the first layers act like denoising filters to achieve sparse significant image structures. We assess the methods on the Optical Coherence Tomography Image Database (OCTID), consisting of 572 spectral domain OCT volumetric scans in five categories. Our proposed S-DDL and WST-based methods achieved 97.2% accuracy in diagnosing AMD, MH, and Normal categories of OCT images. Additionally, WST achieved 100% accuracy in diagnosing DR or AMD from Normal images. These results are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our proposed method outperforms other methods in detecting one abnormality.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3522122","Elite Researcher Grant Committee from the National Institute for Medical Research Development, Tehran, Iran(grant numbers:995304); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation under the Georg Forster Fellowship for experienced researchers; Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(grant numbers:2402224); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10813162","Deep dictionary learning;optical coherence tomography image database;wavelet scattering transform","Dictionaries;Deep learning;Retina;Filters;Accuracy;Training;Vectors;Optical coherence tomography;Noise reduction;Minimization","","","","47","CCBY","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An increasingly large number of data is being generated at the edge, stretching the limited capacity of edge storage systems. Improving resource utilization for edge storage systems has become a significant challenge in recent years. Existing solutions attempt to achieve this goal through data placement optimization, data partitioning, data sharing, etc. These approaches overlook the data redundancy in edge storage systems, which produces substantial storage resource wastage. This motivates the need for an approach for data deduplication at the edge. However, existing data deduplication methods rely on centralized control, which is not always feasible in practical edge computing environments. This article presents Ripple, the first approach that enables edge servers to deduplicate their data in a decentralized manner. At its core, it builds a data index for each edge server, enabling them to deduplicate data without central control. With Ripple, edge servers can 1) identify data duplicates; 2) remove redundant data without violating data retrieval latency constraints; and 3) ensure data availability after deduplication. The results of trace-driven experiments conducted in a testbed system demonstrate the usefulness of Ripple in practice. Compared with the state-of-the-art approach, Ripple improves the deduplication ratio by up to 16.79% and reduces data retrieval latency by an average of 60.42%.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2024.3493953","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB4502400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10747114","Edge computing;data redundancy;data retrieval latency;data deduplication;data index","Servers;Redundancy;Cloud computing;Distributed databases;Web sites;Video on demand;Metadata;Memory;Low latency communication;Indexes","","","","36","CCBYNCND","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many CD methods based on deep learning demonstrate strong performance, but their effectiveness is influenced by the choice of encoder and the challenge of accurately delineating the edges of change regions. In this article, we propose a Laplacian pyramid network with hybrid encoder and edge guidance (HE-LPNet) to solve these issues. Specifically, the hybrid encoder combines the advantages of convolutional neural networks and transformer, resulting in extracted features that are more fine-grained. Meanwhile, the hybrid encoder incorporates the vision foundation models, leading to enhanced generalization of the overall model. In addition to feature extraction, the image is processed to generate a Laplacian pyramid, which is then fused with the features extracted by the hybrid encoder to enhance the salient features at the pixel-level. In the decoder stage, weighted guided attention is designed to selectively apply channel and spatial attention to the fused features, improving the network's ability to discriminate change regions. Furthermore, we present an edge-guided loss to capture edge information in change regions.

However, applying existing semantic segmentation methods to spacecraft component recognition still encounters issues with false detections, missed detections and unclear boundaries of spacecraft components. In order to address these issues, we propose a Multi-scale Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion Network (MASFFN) for spacecraft component recognition. The MASFFN comprises a Spatial Attention-aware Encoder (SAE) and a Multi-scale Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion-based Decoder (Multi-ASFFD).

Second, the Multiscale Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion Module (M-ASFFM) within the Multi-ASFFD cascades four Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) blocks to fuse low-level, middle-level and high-level features at various scales to enrich the semantic information for different spacecraft components. Finally, a compound loss function comprising the cross-entropy and boundary losses is presented to guide the MASFFN better focus on the unclear component edge.

These IEDs can enhance power systems by providing up-to-date information to operators and ensuring proper operations of power system components. However, incorrect configuration settings in IEDs can trigger malfunctions, such as unintended circuit breaker trips, leading to cascading failures, widespread outages, and reduced power system reliability. Therefore, before deploying IEDs in an actual power system, it is essential to validate their settings to prevent potential catastrophic incidents. To ensure an effective testing environment for modern IEDs, it demands not only technical proficiency but also a thorough understanding of the underlying principles governing their operation. Accordingly, many power engineers have to undergo specialised training provided by companies and vendors to acquire the requisite skills and knowledge for their roles. However, in educational institutions, equipping future power engineers with the necessary knowledge and skills for testing IEDs has remained challenges. These difficulties stem from the need for specialised, often costly equipment, along with a flexible academic environment that accommodates both in-person and remote learning. With the support of real-time simulation and hardware-in-the-loop technologies, these challenges can be addressed by utilising virtual and realistic IED devices, making it easier for learners to gain hands-on experiences in a controlled and safe environment without disrupting actual power supplies or damaging expensive equipment. For this reason, this article introduces the concept of “IED-in-the-loop” as an educational aid to enhance the existing electrical power engineering curriculum. This concept helps students gain a basic understanding of real-world devices through laboratory experiments, paving the way for future power engineers. Furthermore, universities, research institutes, and industry companies can use this aid as an additional training course for their students and employees.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3512779","Research Council of Norway, Department of Electrical Engineering, IT, and Cybernetics, University of South-Eastern Norway, Porsgrunn; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781414","IEDs;hardware-in-the-loop;protection relays;real-time simulation;relay testing","Testing;Protection;Relays;Power systems;Real-time systems;Software;Power system reliability;Standards;Local area networks;Knowledge engineering","","","","35","CCBYNCND","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is achieved by filling the cavity of FZL with the Loil according to the required FL of 50 and 142mm. The FL is achieved for both TE ( $E_{x}$ ) and TM ( $E_{y}$ ) polarization, thus providing polarization insensitive tuning. To minimize the impact of the FZL walls on tuning performance, the FZL is additively manufactured with controlled infill percentage and pattern. The Loil and walls of the FZL are characterized for their dielectric constant and loss tangent at 28 GHz using cavity resonator and free-space methods, respectively. In addition, an average increase of 7.4 dBi (5.49 times improvement in the received power) in the realized gain is achieved throughout the band with maximum gain of 22.5 dBi (meas: 20.2 dBi) around 28GHz. Also, the average efficiency of the FZL is 89% throughout the band, thus having very low insertion loss. Because the FZL provides dual polarization, the data throughput is increased by utilizing orthogonal polarization simultaneously for the bifocal case in mm-wave communication.

Five DEMs were produced from five interferometric pairs. The five DEMs were fused to generate a more reliable fused DEM.

The results showed that all Sentinel-1 DEMs performed better than ASTER GDEM, four of DEMs had higher accuracies than NASADEM. The fused DEM with the vertical error of 9.08 m for steep terrain (slope>20°) revealed higher accuracy than three global DEMs. The accuracy of DEM was related to terrain slope and land cover type. The accuracies of DEMs decreased as slope increased. The DEMs in glacier area revealed higher errors than those in bare rock. Besides, there was no clear relationship between the perpendicular baseline and vertical accuracy of DEM. The interferometric pair with the shortest baseline (43 m) produced the worst quality DEM, while the interferometric pair with slightly shorter baseline (69 m) produced the highest quality DEM.

In these paradigms, operational schedules are formulated on the ground and subsequently uploaded to the spacecraft for execution. Execution involves either systematically acquiring vast amounts of data (mow-the-lawn) or targeting specific areas of interest as defined by end users or operators. We aim to depart from these traditional methodologies by integrating onboard artificial intelligence, near real-time communication, and new observing strategies in one system called CogniSAT-6.

Annotated corpora with semantic roles are a critical factor in improving the performance of semantic-based models. Besides, Arabic as a low resourced language, have to pay more attention to alternative methods to build such annotated corpora. To this end, two traditional methods have been intensively used, namely, manual annotation and crowed-resourced annotation. The former is highly precise but it demands substantial training and extensive resources, while, the latter, reduce human effort but often results in lower-quality annotations. Recently, Large language model (LLM) based conversational systems like ChatGPT have emerged as a promising tool for text annotation across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we leverage ChatGPT for two main sub-tasks in Arabic language processing. (1) Creating an Arabic annotated resource with emotional semantic roles from an English corpus, using cross-lingual annotation projection approach. (2) Annotating the Arabic corpus of emotional sentences with emotion categories and semantic roles. Furthermore, we evaluate ChatGPT’s potential for translating English sentences into Arabic. From the perspective of generalization, we test the performance of open-LLMs, specifically, mBERT, and mBART for the same tasks. The evaluation process includes assessing the impact of sentence complexity on the performance of ChatGPT, and open-LLMs in semantic role labeling, and cross-lingual annotation projection. We compared the obtained zero-shot annotation accuracy with that of human base annotations, where the GPT results achieved an accuracy of 0.94 for cross-lingual projection and 0.76 in semantic role labelling, While the open-LLMs achieved notable accuracies of 0.72, and 0.38 respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820541","Semantic Role Labeling;Cross-lingual Annotation Projection;Emotion Analysis;ChatGPT;Arabic language","Chatbots;Annotations;Semantics;Translation;Labeling;Accuracy;Training;Sentiment analysis;Manuals;Large language models","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Existing studies employ model cleaning methods to find inconsistent local models. Model cleaning methods measure the cosine similarity between local models and the global model. The inconsistent local model is cleaned out and will not be aggregated for the next global model. However, model cleaning methods incur negative effects such as large computation overheads and limited updates. In this paper, we propose a data distribution optimization method, called federated distribution optimization (FedDO), aiming to overcome the shortcomings of model cleaning methods. FedDO calculates the gradient of the Jensen-Shannon divergence to decrease the discrepancy between selected clients' data distribution and the overall data distribution. We test our method on the multi-classification regression model, the multi-layer perceptron, and the convolutional neural network model on a handwritten digital image dataset.

However, current autonomous driving technology is mainly based on reactive controllers that attempt to respond to the various events the car encounters. Yet, achieving a truly safe and reliable autonomous system necessitates anticipating such events and planning the correct actions in advance to avoid undesirable behavior. Recent advances in deep learning have shown remarkable performance in predicting future frames from video sequences. However, most of these approaches can only handle a few moving elements in the scene and perform poorly when the camera is in motion. This is mainly due to the difficulty of disentangling camera intrinsic motion from object-dependent motion. In this work, we equip autonomous cars with an object-oriented next-frame predictor that leverages Transformer architecture to extract, for each moving object in the scene, a spatial transformation applied to the object to predict its configuration in the next frame. Static elements of the scene are then used to estimate camera intrinsic motion, which is applied to the background to predict how it will be viewed in the next frame. Notably, our approach significantly reduces the complexity typically associated with such models by requiring the estimation of only 14 parameters per moving object, independent of image resolution. We have validated the generalization capabilities of our model through training on simulated datasets and testing on real-world datasets. The results indicate that our model not only outperforms existing models trained solely on real data but also exhibits superior resilience to occlusions and incomplete data in the input sequences. These findings underscore the potential of our model to significantly improve the predictive analytics capabilities of autonomous driving systems, thereby enhancing their safety and reliability in dynamic environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3524997","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(grant numbers:871479); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10823095","Next frame prediction;Moving camera;Image reconstruction;Deep learning;Projective and affine transforms","Cameras;Automobiles;Predictive models;Vehicle dynamics;Training;Object oriented modeling;Dynamics;Data models;Vectors;Symbols","","","","","CCBYNCND","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Previous research has focused on binary change detection (BCD), limiting its practical applications. Therefore, semantic change detection (SCD), which can detect multiple change classes, is gradually becoming a more mainstream task. Most existing SCD methods use convolutional neural networks as the backbone to extract multiscale features and use relatively simple decoder structures, leading to unsatisfactory detection accuracy. We propose a multitask network for SCD, and in the encoder, given the great success of segment anything module (SAM) and vision transformer (VIT) in the field of general-purpose segmentation task, we introduce SAM-VIT into the backbone to enhance the encoder's ability to capture long-range contextual semantic relationships. We propose a transformer-based decoder structure for the semantic segmentation branch to extract local and global features effectively. We propose a convolutional attention-based change extractor for the BCD branch to enhance temporal information fusion. Also, we analyze in detail the semantic inconsistency that affects the performance of SCD. First, we introduce contrastive loss to establish the correlation between the output features of the BCD branch and the segmentation branch. Second, we design a bitemporal graph semantic interaction module to maintain semantic consistency between the output features of the two segmentation branches; the module assigns pixels with different land cover types to the corresponding graph nodes based on clustering techniques and then uses cross-attention to model the correlation between bitemporal semantic features in the graph space. Finally, a self-learning training scheme based on pseudolabel further mitigates the problem of semantic inconsistency. SCDVit achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular high-resolution datasets. Meanwhile, adequate quantitative and qualitative analyses highlight the potential of SAM-VIT for change detection and the effectiveness of the module designed based on semantic consistency.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3514926","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42371452); System for Urban Fine Management(grant numbers:06-Y30F04-9001-20/22); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10793098","Change detection (CD);graph convolutional network (GCN);graph learning;remote sensing;semantic segmentation (SS);transformer","Semantics;Feature extraction;Decoding;Transformers;Remote sensing;Multitasking;Accuracy;Training;Correlation;Semantic segmentation","","","","43","CCBY","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The spatial–temporal information has not been fully utilized, and there is a serious imbalance in their exploitation, especially the lack of long-term temporal characteristics. In this article, a novel method based on the spatial–temporal feature fusion tensor model is proposed to solve these problems. By directly stacking raw infrared images, the sequence can be transformed into a third-order tensor, where the spatial–temporal features are not reduced or destroyed. Its horizontal and lateral slices can be viewed as 2-D images, showing the change of gray values of horizontal/vertical fixed spatial pixels over time. Then, a new tensor composed of several serial slices are decomposed into low-rank background components and sparse target components, which can make full use of the temporal similarity and spatial correlation of background. The partial tubal nuclear norm is introduced to constrain the low-rank background, and the tensor robust principal component analysis problem is solved quickly by the alternating direction method of multipliers. By superimposing all the decomposed sparse components into the target tensor, small target can be segmented from the reconstructed target image. Experimental results of synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in visual and numerical results for targets with different sizes, velocities, and SCR values under different complex backgrounds.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3491221","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61921001); Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation(grant numbers:SAST2021-035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10742415","Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM);partial tubal nuclear norm (PTNN);small target detection;spatial–temporal tensor;tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA)","Tensors;Object detection;Image sequences;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Aerodynamics;Weight measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Remote sensing;Optimization","","","","72","CCBYNCND","4 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This research introduces a cooperative-schedule priority transmission protocol (CSPTP), designed to overcome these challenges. CSPTP leverages a multi-resolution discrete wavelet transform to compress captured images, decomposing them into sub-bands with varying levels of importance. The protocol establishes a data path consisting of path nodes and cooperative nodes to efficiently manage the bursty nature of image packets. Priority levels are assigned to nodes based on their roles in image transmission and to packets based on their importance in image reconstruction. Nodes collaborate through overhearing, which enhances transmission reliability and accelerates packet delivery. The proposed protocol was rigorously evaluated through comparative analyses and experimental validation. Analytical results demonstrated that CSPTP significantly reduces image transmission time and balances energy consumption, outperforming existing protocols. Experimental validation further confirmed substantial improvements in packet delivery reliability, achieving success rates of 99.5% for important packets and 98.3% for other packets when the source multimedia node is at level five, and 99% and 96%, respectively, at level eight.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523481","Basic Science Research Program(grant numbers:2020R1I1A3057142); Priority Research Center Program through the National Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019R1A6A1A03032988); Korea Basic Science Institute (National Research Facilities and Equipment Center) Grant funded by the Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2022R1A6C101A741); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817561","Transmission protocol;wavelet transform;image compression;reliability;end-to-end delay;energy efficiency","Protocols;Reliability;Image communication;Image reconstruction;Image coding;Energy consumption;Discrete wavelet transforms;Energy efficiency;Delays;Wireless communication","","","","38","CCBY","27 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of pansharpening methods is to combine the rich spectral-spatial information contained in MS and PAN images to generate the high-resolution multispectral image. Most existing pansharpening methods either separately extract feature information from MS and PAN images or extract feature information after concatenating MS and PAN images, lacking the utilization of complementary information throughout the feature extraction process. Motivated by the advancements in optimization algorithm and the state space model, we introduce a convolutional dictionary learning with state space model for pansharpeningin this article. Our network comprises two parts: the encoder and the decoder. In the encoder part, we begin by building an observation model to capture the common and unique information between MS and PAN images. Subsequently, we continuously iterate and optimize the network parameters using the approximate gradient algorithm. Meanwhile, we utilize the powerful long-range dependence modeling capability of the SSM to comprehensively extract feature information from the images.

To satisfy the needs of high precision and low cost in future green wireless communication, the conventional hybrid analog and digital MIMO receive structure emerges a natural choice. But it exists an issue of the phase ambiguity in direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and requires at least two time-slots to complete one-time DOA measurement with the first time-slot generating the set of candidate solutions and the second one to find a true direction by received beamforming over this set, which will lead to a low time-efficiency. To address this problem,a new heterogeneous sub-connected hybrid analog and digital ( $\mathrm {H}^{2}$ AD) MIMO structure is proposed with an intrinsic ability of removing phase ambiguity, and then a corresponding new framework is developed to implement a rapid high-precision DOA estimation using only single time-slot. The proposed framework consists of two steps: 1) form a set of candidate solutions using existing methods like MUSIC; 2) find the class of the true solutions and compute the class mean. To infer the set of true solutions, we propose two new clustering methods: weight global minimum distance (WGMD) and weight local minimum distance (WLMD). Next, we also enhance two classic clustering methods: accelerating local weighted k-means (ALW-K-means) and improved density. Additionally, the corresponding closed-form expression of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed frameworks using the above four clustering can approach the CRLB in almost all signal to noise ratio (SNR) regions except for extremely low SNR (SNR  $\lt -5$  dB). Four clustering methods have an accuracy decreasing order as follows: WGMD, improved DBSCAN, ALW-K-means and WLMD.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3506874","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171217,U22A2002); Hainan Province Science and Technology Special Fund(grant numbers:ZDYF2024GXJS292); Scientific Research Fund Project of Hainan University(grant numbers:KYQD(ZR)-21008); Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Technology, Hainan University(grant numbers:XTCX2022XXC07); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFF0612900); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767772","DOA;massive MIMO;H²AD;machine learning","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Radio frequency;Antenna arrays;Machine learning;Signal to noise ratio;Costs;Computational complexity;Maximum likelihood estimation;Linear antenna arrays;Clustering methods","","","","40","CCBY","26 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reliable signal acquisition requires accurate EMG electrode placement. Conventional electrode placement methods are challenging due to altered post-surgical anatomy. This study investigated the application of ultrasound imaging for placement of EMG electrodes in TTAs. Four residual limb muscles, Tibialis Anterior (TA), Peroneus Longus (PL), Gastrocnemius Medial (GM), and Gastrocnemius Lateral (GL), were examined in 9 unilateral TTAs. Ultrasound was used to identify each muscle belly’s thickest part and fiber orientation. A Certified Prosthetist Orthotist (CPO) then performed palpation to identify muscle bellies, blinded to ultrasound findings. Distances between ultrasound- and palpation-identified spots were measured. EMG data were contrasted between methods in terms of root mean square (RMS) amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The results indicated that Ultrasound-guided placement produced slightly higher, though non-significant, signal amplitudes (p =0.06) and significantly higher SNR (p =0.04). Moreover, palpation misidentified muscles in four cases. In 72.2% of cases, the distance between ultrasound- and palpation-identified spots was more than 10 mm. The mean distance was the greatest for PL and GL. Relying on palpation to identify PL and TA in TTAs may provide irrelevant EMG due to erroneous placement. Using ultrasound imaging can avoid this and, in addition to accurate muscle identification, may improve signal amplitude and SNR. In conclusion, ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool for enhancing the accuracy of EMG electrode placement in TTAs, which may lead to better prosthetic control outcomes.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3520720","Technology Development Fund at the Icelandic Center for Research(grant numbers:2215370-0611); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10810499","Electrode positioning;EMG;muscle identification;prosthetic control;residual limb muscle;RMS amplitude;signal-to-noise ratio","Muscles;Ultrasonic imaging;Electrodes;Electromyography;Signal to noise ratio;Limbs;Imaging;Accuracy;Prosthetics;Legged locomotion","","","","34","CCBY","20 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach is compared with the classical way of selecting a configuration by doing a grid search among several configurations of hyperparameters and model selection choices and choosing the one that performs best on a validation set. The experimental results, using datasets from time series forecasting competitions, show that, in line with previous works, the use of an ensemble produces a robust model, outperforming the approach that uses a grid search for obtaining the best configuration on a validation set and almost any specific configuration.

This simple and cost-effective method suffers from limited accuracy due to its high susceptibility to environmental factors. The introduction of angle-of-arrival (AoA) functionality in BLE v5.1 significantly improved accuracy by enabling signal phase measurements. AoA exploits the phase difference of the received signal across spatially distributed antennas to estimate the direction of arrival and then pinpoint the location using triangulation. In contrast, the multicarrier phase difference (MCPD) leverages the phase difference of the signal at a single antenna but across different frequencies. The phase difference is used to estimate the distance, which allows the location to be determined using multilateration. MCPD is a recent addition to the BLE standard known as channel sounding, but unfortunately, real-world evaluations of this method are scarce. This article addresses this gap by experimentally analyzing the performance of MCPD in an indoor environment. We conduct comprehensive experiments in a 100 m2 office space, comparing the accuracy of MCPD with RSSI and AoA-based approaches in the same area. The results show that the MCPD technique yields similar localization accuracy to the AoA method, with a mean localization error of 0.98 and 1.26 m, respectively, while avoiding the need for complex antenna arrays. In addition, MCPD significantly outperforms RSSI-based methods, which have a mean localization error of 3.83 m.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2024.3495030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10755009","Angle of arrival (AOA);Bluetooth low energy (BLE);channel sounding;indoor positioning;Internet of Things (IoT);multicarrier phase difference (MCPD);radio communication;received signal strength indicator (RSSI)","Location awareness;Accuracy;Antenna measurements;Antenna arrays;Estimation;Phase measurement;Receiving antennas;Distance measurement;Standards;Semiconductor device measurement","","","","33","CCBYNCND","15 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, current approaches mainly focus on simple networks that model only pairwise interactions between two nodes, whereas higher-order groupwise interactions among an arbitrary number of nodes are ubiquitous in the real world, which can be better modeled as hypernetwork. The structural difference between a simple and a hypernetwork restricts the direct application of simple ND methods to a hypernetwork. Although some hypernetwork centrality measures (e.g., betweenness) can be used for hypernetwork dismantling, they face the problem of balancing effectiveness and efficiency. Therefore, we propose a betweenness approximation-based hypernetwork dismantling method with a Hypergraph Neural Network (HNN). The proposed approach, called “HND”, trains a transferable HNN-based regression model on plenty of generated small-scale synthetic hypernetworks in a supervised way, utilizing the well-trained model to approximate the betweenness of the nodes.

Although the theoretical structure of the bimodal distribution is elegant, the BLISS implementation suffers from several side-channel vulnerabilities. The primary issue arises from the fact that the probability mass function of the bimodal discrete Gaussian distribution is a transcendental function, which makes it difficult to implement solely with integers in constant-time. To address this issue, we introduce a new distribution called ‘Generalized Centered Binomial Distribution (GCBD)’ that can replace the (bimodal) discrete Gaussian distribution. As a generalized form of the centered binomial distribution (CBD), GCBD is simple and efficient in sampling integers from distributions with large standard deviations. GCBD sampling consists of sampling uniformly random bit-strings and integer addition/subtraction operations, allowing for efficient constant-time implementation. Furthermore, bimodal rejection sampling using GCBD can be implemented only with integer operations in constant-time, with the help of the Newton-Raphson method. By incorporating the bimodal GCBD rejection sampling into BLISS, we present a new variant of BLISS that can be implemented in constant-time, thereby eliminating the side-channel vulnerabilities associated with timing attacks. Finally, we compare the performance of our variant to GALACTICS, a previous constant-time implementation of BLISS. While the signing algorithm of our variant is about 3.3 times slower than that of GALACTICS, GCBD can serve as an alternative to the discrete Gaussian distribution for designing bimodal lattice signatures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523521","Military Crypto Research Center, Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and Agency for Defense Development (ADD)(grant numbers:UD210027XD); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP), Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)], Block Chain Privacy Preserving Techniques Based on Data Encryption(grant numbers:2021-0-00518); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817596","Post-quantum cryptography;lattice-based signatures;bimodal;binomial distribution","Gaussian distribution;Standards;Polynomials;Digital signatures;Lattices;Timing;Random variables;Newton method;Hypercubes;Cryptography","","","","16","CCBY","30 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent research has applied deep learning to predict VTEC maps, treating them either as images or sequences using convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks, or Transformers. However, these approaches overlook the intrinsic non-Euclidean (spherical) nature of VTEC maps. To address this, our study proposes a novel spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN) framework, termed GNNTrans. GNNTrans leverages a graph convolutional network to capture the spherical characteristics of VTEC maps. It integrates external factors, such as the Dst-index and ap index, through an attention mechanism for focused feature extraction and employs a transformer mechanism to model temporal patterns. Two variants of GNNTrans, isotropic and pyramid, were explored to determine the optimal structure. The pyramid model emerged as the top performer, achieving a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.52 total electron content units (TECU). The isotropic model also outperformed the homogeneous CNN model in handling the spherical nature of VTEC maps, achieving 2.58 TECU compared to the CNN model's 2.65 TECU. Furthermore, GNNTrans surpassed the CODE one-day forecasting product across various dimensions, reducing the RMSE to around 3.3 and 1.3 TECU in 2014 and 2018, respectively, compared to C1P's 4.5 and 1.8 TECU.

If the key prior knowledge that describes the target is incorporated into the network, this problem can be effectively mitigated. Fortunately, electromagnetic scattering feature (ESF) elegantly and accurately models SAR targets, which describe the intrinsic properties of targets in SAR images. Therefore, how to perceive and integrate ESFs emerges as an essential issue. To address this problem, the adaptive scattering feature awareness and fusion network is proposed to obtain the more holistic target description. Specifically, the scattering structure intelligent awareness module is designed to automatically distinguish and screen the critical scattering information from the SAR image. Subsequently, in the feature fusion phase, the adaptive feature fusion module fuses the scattering domain ESFs and image domain deep features deeply and hierarchically by narrowing the distribution gap between them. In addition, a novel azimuth angle-guided classifier is employed to capture the association information between azimuth angle and target features. The physical laws inherent in ESF and azimuth angle guide the network training period, which improves feature discrimination and mitigates the pressure of data inadequacy. Experimental results on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition dataset and full aspect stationary targets-vehicle dataset demonstrate that adaptive scattering feature awareness and fusion network achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR target recognition tasks.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3493856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10747116","Azimuth angle information;electromagnetic scattering feature (ESF);local scattering structure;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);target recognition","Scattering;Azimuth;Feature extraction;Target recognition;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar;Estimation;Adaptation models;Training;Image recognition","","","","41","CCBYNCND","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, creating a LC map requires collecting high-quality labeled data, a process that is both costly and time-consuming. To mitigate the need to collect large volume of labeled data, we propose a deep learning framework called REFeD (data Reuse with Effective Feature Disentanglement for land cover mapping), which leverages already available out-of-year reference data to enhance the production of up-to-date LC maps. To this end, REFeD integrates remote sensing and reference data from different domains (e.g., historical and recent data) utilizing a disentanglement strategy based on contrastive learning. By separating domain-invariant and domain-specific features, REFeD isolates useful information associated to the downstream LC mapping task and mitigates distribution shifts between domains. Moreover, REFeD incorporates an effective supervision scheme to reinforce feature disentanglement through multiple levels of supervision at different granularities.

However, due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels and the limited coherence time, the pilot signals must be short, and the number of orthogonal pilot sequences is finite. Consequently, pilot signal reuse across neighboring cells leads to pilot contamination, significantly degrading channel estimation accuracy. Traditional methods like minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation require prior knowledge of the channel covariance matrix, which is often unavailable. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based channel estimation approach that effectively mitigates the dual challenges of channel aging and pilot contamination. The method leverages two distinct convolutional neural networks (CNNs): one for processing pilot signals to suppress inter-cell interference and another for data signals to address both inter-cell and intra-cell interference. To further enhance estimation accuracy, a smoothing filter is employed to minimize local distortions caused by incorrect symbol detection in the time domain. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, particularly at normalized Doppler frequencies above 0.01, where it significantly outperforms conventional techniques and interpolation-based approaches. The results highlight the proposed method’s robustness in maintaining high channel estimation accuracy in dynamic and interference-prone environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3518763","JST ASPIRE(grant numbers:JPMJAP2326); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10804105","Channel aging;channel estimation;convolutional neural network;massive MIMO;pilot contamination","Channel estimation;Covariance matrices;Contamination;Aging;Massive MIMO;Estimation;Convolutional neural networks;Accuracy;Interference;Symbols","","","","30","CCBY","16 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method considers the directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) for the transmission system, whereas in previous studies, the effect of protective mechanisms on the transient stability was largely ignored. When protective relays are activated in power system, the configuration of the power system is altered to mitigate the risk of the power system becoming unstable. The present study considers the operation of DOCRs in transmission lines for the transient stability so that the proposed method can respond to changes in the configuration of the case study system. In addition, WLS-SVM is employed for an online assessment of the transient stability. WLS-SVM not only is effective in response due to its faster speed, but also is resistant to noise and has excellent performance against the measurement errors of PMUs. To extract the characteristics of the vectors that are fed into the WLS-SVM algorithm, principal component analysis is used. The findings of the suggested technique reveal that it has higher accuracy and optimum performance, as compared to the extreme learning machine method, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system method, and the back-propagation neural network method.

In this article, we propose an approach to compute $k$ geodesic paths using the concept of a novel neighborhood-augmented graph, on which graph search algorithms can compute multiple optimal paths that are topo-geometrically distinct. Our approach does not require complex geometric constructions, and the resulting paths are not restricted to distinct topological classes, making the algorithm suitable for problems where finding and distinguishing between geodesic paths are of interest.

This study researches few-shot transfer learning and provides an innovative approach for contrail segmentation with a few labeled images. The methodology leverages backbone segmentation models, which are pre-trained on existing image datasets and finetuned using an augmented contrail-specific dataset.

Active learning plays an important role for training data reduction, resulting in an order of magnitude less training data compared with conventional methods and three or more orders of magnitude less compared with CNN-Unet. Our improvements focus on boosting both the pipeline's robustness and efficiency by integrating a feature-embedding neural network prior to graph construction.

However, HSI classification still faces various challenges, including insufficient spectral-spatial representation, excessive redundant information, and difficulties in effectively integrating features of different scales, etc., which may lead to reduced classification accuracy. In order to reduce the computational cost and improve the classification accuracy of land cover categories, an efficient spectral-spatial fusion method (ESSF) is proposed, which is based on the following modules: a multiscale feature fusion module (MSFFM), an efficient adaptive spectral-spatial feature extraction module (EASSFEM), and a context-aware fusion network (CFN). First, the MSFFM utilizes CNNs to extract and fuse features from various scales to comprehensively capture detailed spectral information in HSIs. Second, the EASSFEM dynamically adjusts the feature extraction process to optimize the fusion and representation of spectral-spatial features. In addition, it incorporates an adaptive attention mechanism to enhance the focus on relevant spectral-spatial features. Finally, the CFN enhances the model's ability to understand contextual relationships within the images, thereby improving classification accuracy.

A prime example is the website fingerprinting attack (WFA), which targets anonymity networks like Tor, enabling attackers to unveil users' protected browsing activities from traffic data. While state-of-the-art WFAs have achieved remarkable results, they often rely on unrealistic single-website assumptions. In this paper, we undertake an exhaustive exploration of multi-tab website fingerprinting attacks (MTWFAs) in more realistic scenarios. We delve into MTWFAs and introduce MTWFA-SEG, a task involving the fine-grained packet-level classification within multi-tab Tor traffic. By employing deep learning models, we reveal their potential to threaten user privacy by discerning visited websites and browsing session timing. We design an improved fully convolutional model for MTWFA-SEG, which are enhanced by both network architecture advances and traffic data instincts. In the evaluations on interlocking browsing datasets, the proposed models achieve remarkable accuracy rates of over 68.6%, 71.8%, and 76.1% in closed, imbalanced open, and balanced open-world settings, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed models exhibit substantial robustness across diverse train-test settings. We further validate our designs in a coarse-grained task, MTWFA-MultiLabel, where they not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also demonstrate high robustness in challenging situations.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2024.9010073","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172378,61572448,61827810); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1707701); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10786942","website fingerprinting;multi-tab website fingerprinting;anonymity network;deep learning;side-channel attack","Deep learning;Privacy;Accuracy;Side-channel attacks;Fingerprint recognition;Network architecture;Robustness;Data models;Timing;Security","","","","47","","9 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, the rapid topology changes, high vehicle mobility, and frequent link disconnections make routing in VANETs a challenging task, necessitating the development of efficient routing protocols. Moreover, as VANET services provided in our daily lives become more extensive and situations in which they are provided simultaneously to an increasing number of users become more frequent, numerous data delivery optimization algorithms have been researched to address these issues. Alongside this, the research related to Unnamed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has also been utilized as a solution to solve the physical data link disconnection problem of VANETs. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol called PSUV (Particle Swarm UAV-VANET). First, we have solved the software-related issues of VANETs by measuring data transmission availability of vehicles existing in the topology and conducting topology optimization by creating a vehicle routing table, utilizing a mathematical value calculation formula that combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) from Swarm Intelligence (SI) and the directional vector information of the vehicle. Furthermore, by utilizing UAVs, we address the physical disconnectivity issues that arise during data transmission in VANETs, thereby minimizing the delay and maximizing the total data rate under realistic conditions. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed protocol in various circumstances in an NS-3 simulation.

This article starts by studying the electromagnetic (EM) backscattering mechanism and the physical properties of SAR. We construct a heterogeneous graph for the first time to fully exploit both the EM scattering information of the target components and their interactions. Moreover, the multilevel multihead attention mechanism is introduced to the graph net to learn features from various topological structure levels. Additionally, we include a convolutional neural network based feature extraction net to replenish intuitive visual features. The above two nets form the lightweight dual-stream framework (LDSF). LDSF uses a feature fusion subnetwork to adaptively fuse the dual-stream features to maximize the final classification performance.

Nevertheless, current change detection models are inadequate when it comes to model semantic interactions in pairings of temporal images. This leads to poor identification of identical semantic targets that have unique features. In this article, we put forth a proposal for a multilevel intertemporal semantic guidance network (MISGNet) that would effectively derive representations of semantic changes. The bitemporal images' multilevel features are initially extracted using a transformer feature extractor. These extracted features are then bidirectionally semantically augmented using a semantic guidance module (SGM) in order to acquire more comprehensive semantic representations. Particularly, in order to obtain the object's semantic representation, the land cover objects in the multilevel features of the bitemporal images are soft clustered and mapped to the graph space, with each vertex representing an object in the graph. Then, bidirectional semantic enhancement is achieved through the use of intertemporal nonlocal operations, which strengthen the semantic representation of the bitemporal images. Moreover, a multilevel difference aggregation module (MDAM) is implemented in order to enhance the efficacy of summarizing distinctions between different levels and highlighting semantic changes in features. This is achieved through the utilization of pixelwise addition and pixelwise multiplication. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets provide irrefutable evidence that our model outperforms alternative methods across various evaluation metrics.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3508692","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42276185); Shandong Province Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:ZR2020MD096,ZR2020MD099); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10771701","Change detection (CD);difference aggregates;remote sensing;semantic guidance","Feature extraction;Semantics;Convolutional neural networks;Transformers;Remote sensing;Training;Streams;Data mining;Accuracy;Recurrent neural networks","","","","65","CCBY","28 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We recruited 12 healthy controls (age  $= 29.0\pm 2.9$  years, female = 5) and 20 participants with focal CNS lesions.

Movement features concerning movement efficiency (average velocity, peak velocity), accuracy (spatial error when pointing to the nose) and motor planning (timing and spatial occurrence of velocity peak, velocity and deviation from ideal trajectory at 150ms after the movement onset) were computed. Both the groups of participants with CNS lesions performed the movement slower than healthy controls. When comparing results from the two groups of patients, we showed that participants with cerebellar lesions were characterized by greater trial-to-trial variability of the velocity peak (repeated measure ANOVA group effect: F = 5.242, p = 0.012) and its timing (condition*group interaction: F = 5.38, p = 0.011).

The method consists of maximizing the visibility of frequency-domain interference of optical sidebands about an optical carrier at the receiver node. The sidebands are generated by phase modulation of the optical carrier by an radio-frequency (RF) signal whose phase can be dynamically varied. The phase-variable RF signal is generated by the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) at the transmitter and the receiver using GTX transceivers. In order to facilitate this, we use square waveforms for RF signal instead of the conventional sinusoidal signals. We derive mathematical expressions for sideband power as a function of the phase difference between RF signals at transmitter and receiver. The phase is adjusted using dynamic phase shifter module, implemented by the FPGA. We propose a complete workflow that allows transmitter and receiver synchronization to within 12.6 ps directly over the quantum channel of QKD systems. Once synchronized, the same system can be switched over to quantum transmission by user-defined time delay. The workflow was implemented on a Xilinx Kintex-7 KC705 FPGA board.

This approach harnesses the power of multiple data assets while ensuring their privacy. Despite the benefits, it relies on a central server to manage the training process and lacks quantification of the quality of data assets, which raises privacy and fairness concerns.

Successive MQXFS magnets were used as testbeds for potential changes (including pre-load fine tuning) to be implemented in the series, and to better understand the stress dependence of Nb$_\text{3}$Sn magnet performance. In this paper we report the findings of the short model MQXFS7, where we investigated the effect of higher azimuthal pre-load on the performance of this magnet assembled with coils wound from Nb$_\text{3}$Sn Restacked-Rod-Process (RRP) conductors, which are the baseline for MQXF magnets, and Powder-In-Tube (PIT) conductors, which were initially considered as a potential candidate but subsequently set aside. Starting at the baseline level of 110 MPa azimuthal preload at 1.9 K (corresponding to a full preload at nominal current, which is 77% of the short sample limit at 1.9 K), we increased the pre-load in steps of 20 MPa up to 190 MPa. The magnet was able to operate above 90% of the short sample limit indicating a large range of possible preloads. Indications of performance degradation at 90-95% of the short sample limit were found in the PIT conductor at 170 and 190 MPa. The test included a significant set of observables, such as the ramp rate dependency on the quench current, and V-I measurements to see growing resistance in segments of the coil.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3507751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10770825","High stress;low beta quadrupole;Nb  $_\text{3}$  Sn;quench;superconducting magnets","Superconducting magnets;Magnetomechanical effects;Coils;Training;Stress;Saturation magnetization;Voltage;Conductors;Superconductivity;Protection","","","","19","CCBY","28 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study aimed to develop and evaluate deep learning (DL) models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN) and temporal convolutional networks (TCN), by comparing F1 scores and temporal error percentiles between predicted and target gait events using IMU placed at clinical locations [head (HD), pelvis (PV), wrist (WR), and foot (FT)] in young and older adults. Our findings demonstrated that TCN consistently scored higher F1 scores with lower standard error across both young and older adult groups. Specifically, the TCN with HD sensor achieved the highest F1 scores of 95.9% in younger individuals and 93.8% in older participants for heel strike, highlighting the robustness of TCN models in capturing temporal dependencies for accurate gait event detection. In contrast, CNN models exhibited a higher standard of error, with up to 20% differences between age groups showing age-dependent influence. Temporal error analysis showed comparable performance between CNN and TCN models across most placements. Integrating gyroscope data with accelerometer signals improved F1 score, particularly for HD and FT sensors. This article systematically evaluates optimal sensor placements and demonstrates the robust performance of TCN models, laying a foundation for future research.

Existing load-shedding techniques face limitations such as over-shedding due to fixed voltage thresholds and time delays, predetermined load-shedding actions that fail to account for disturbance magnitude, and delayed stabilization caused by sequential load-shedding steps. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel load-shedding strategy for islanded DC microgrids that integrates a short-timer mechanism with Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization. The proposed approach reduces reliance on communication systems and achieves optimal load-shedding decisions using local voltage measurements. Simulation results on a DC microgrid model adapted from the IEEE 37-bus network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.The scheme results in a 20% reduction in unnecessary load shedding, an 18% improvement in voltage stabilization (measured as the final voltage after a disturbance), and a 25% decrease in response time compared to conventional methods. The results show that the proposed strategy ensures that the DC bus voltage remains above the critical threshold of 720 V, enhancing system reliability by minimizing voltage transients, reducing regulation time, and maintaining power balance. These improvements highlight the potential of the proposed scheme to support robust, secure, and resilient DC microgrid operation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824763","DC microgrid;distributed energy resources;load shedding;mixed-integer linear programming;optimization;resilience","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As a result, efficient and accurate landslide extraction remains a challenging issue within the global research community. To address this problem, a novel automatic landslide hazard remote sensing image identification model, MultiResUNet-BFDC, is proposed. Initially, null convolutions with various null rates are introduced to replace some standard convolutions, thereby expanding the sensory field without increasing the parameter count and making the model more suitable for multi-scale landslide segmentation. Additionally, the Canny operator is employed to design a lightweight boundary-focused attention (BFA) mechanism, enhancing the model’s ability to emphasize landslide edge features. Furthermore, a new hybrid loss function, adaptive focal and Dice loss (AFD loss), is introduced through the adaptive AdaLoss algorithm by combining focal loss and Dice loss, improving the model’s ability to handle unbalanced samples.

In this study, the capabilities of three-baseline PolInSAR in BIOMASS configuration and the spaceborne system-induced impacts are systematically evaluated. First, the BIOMASS data were simulated using the airborne P-band SAR acquisitions collected over two different tropical forests in Paracou, French Guiana, and Mondah, Gabon. Second, the forest height was retrieved using a three-baseline algorithm based on polarimetric coherence optimization with multi-baseline joint diagonalization. Finally, the impacts of spaceborne PolInSAR were quantified and analyzed. The results show that the performance of PolInSAR inversion in the spaceborne configuration decreases compared to that of the original airborne data. However, the three-baseline method still yields acceptable results, with a root-mean-square error ranging from 4.92 to 6.07 m and a correlation coefficient (R2) from 0.32 to 0.85, within hectare-scale forest height statistics.

Deep learning plays an important role in extracting motor-related information from sEMG signals. However, most studies prioritize model accuracy without sufficient consideration of model efficiency, including the model size, power consumption, and the computational speed of the model. This leads to impractical power consumption, heat dissipation levels and processing time in wearable computation scenarios. Here, we propose an efficient Transformer method that employs the EMSA (Efficient Multiple Self-Attention) and pruning mechanism to improve efficiency and accuracy concurrently, when estimating finger joint angles from sEMG signals. The proposed method does not only achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but can also be deployed on wearable devices to satisfy real-time applications. We applied the proposed model on the Ninapro DB2-dataset to estimate finger joint angles during grasping tasks. RNN series models, Convolution series models, and Transformer series models were used as reference models for comparison. In addition to common model accuracy, the deployment performance of the models was tested on microprocessors, such as Intel CPU i5, Apple M1, and Raspberry Pi 4B. When tested on 38 subjects of the Ninapro DB2, the proposed model resulted in a correlation coefficient of  $0.82~\pm ~0.04$ , root mean squared error (RMSE) of  $10.77~\pm ~1.48$ , and normalized RMSE of  $0.11~\pm ~0.01$ , which were all similar to the results achieved by the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference methods. Further, the computational time of the proposed methods was 65.99 ms on the Raspberry Pi 4B, which outperformed all the RNN series models and the Transformer series models. The model size and the power (the minimum size and power are 0.39 MB and 2.28 w) consumption of the proposed model also outperformed that of all reference Transformer methods. These experimental results indicate that our model can maintain the accuracy of the SOTA methods while significantly improving efficiency, thus being a promising approach for real-life applications in wearable devices.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3514938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10789212","sEMG;continuous estimation;finger kinematics;Transformer;model efficiency","Transformers;Accuracy;Estimation;Computational modeling;Electromyography;Training;Grasping;Feature extraction;Convolution;Deep learning","","","","32","CCBY","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, passive cooling necessitates intelligent thermal control via traffic management, i.e., the instantaneous data traffic or throughput of a PCBS directly impacts its thermal performance. This is particularly challenging for outdoor deployment of PCBSs because the heat dissipation efficiency is uncertain and fluctuates over time. What is more, the PCBSs are interference-coupled in multi-cell scenarios. Thus, a higher-throughput PCBS leads to higher interference to the other PCBSs, which, in turn, would require more resource consumption to meet their respective throughput targets. In this paper, we address online decision-making for maximizing the total downlink throughput for a multi-PCBS system subject to constraints related on operating temperature. We demonstrate that a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, specifically soft actor-critic (SAC), can successfully perform throughput maximization while keeping the PCBSs cool, by adapting the throughput to time-varying heat dissipation conditions. Furthermore, we design a denial and reward mechanism that effectively mitigates the risk of overheating during the exploration phase of RL. Simulation results show that our approach achieves up to 88.6% of the global optimum. This is very promising, as our approach operates without prior knowledge of future heat dissipation efficiency, which is required by the global optimum.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3517619","Swedish Research Council(grant numbers:2022-04123); EU MSCA Project IPOSEE(grant numbers:101086219); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10802970","Reinforcement learning;interference;passive cooling;throughput maximization;thermal management","Throughput;Interference;Cooling;Heating systems;Base stations;Load modeling;Thermal management;Baseband;Optimization;Signal to noise ratio","","","","49","CCBY","16 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While many mangroves worldwide have faced substantial losses, China has seen notable recovery. Understanding the expansion patterns of mangroves necessitates high-resolution, large-scale monitoring of their coverage over time. In this study, we divided coastal zones based on geomorphic and sedimentary environments and generated annual mangrove coverage from 2016 to 2022 using multi-source high-resolution data and a U-Net model. By analyzing morphological changes of mangrove patches in different coastal zones of the Guangxi Beibu Gulf, we summarized expansion patterns and calculated expansion and degradation rates from area changes. Our findings reveal a 1,413 ha increase in mangrove area from 2016 to 2022. Estuarine mangroves experienced an initial increase followed by a decrease, while gulf mangroves showed an initial decrease followed by an increase. Three distinct expansion patterns were identified: (1) regular mangroves expanding parallel to coastlines; (2) mangroves expanding in estuarine areas where freshwater and seawater meet; and (3) independent mangrove patches expanding into surrounding wetlands. In summary, stable and changing mangrove areas were in a ratio of 7:3, with expansion areas at 70.5% and degradation areas at 29.5%. The loss of mangroves in Guangxi Beibu Gulf is primarily due to intense human activities, with minimal contributions from sea level rise and marine dynamics.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3454976","National Natural Science Foundation Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A2022,42101369,2023GXNSFBA026278); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10666156","Coastal zones;expansion patterns;Guangxi Beibu gulf;mangrove forest;remote sensing","Sea measurements;Wetlands;Spatial resolution;Forestry;Image resolution;Feature extraction;Earth","","","","57","CCBYNCND","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we shift from the traditional focus on single-chart annotations to characterize the nuanced but crucial communication role of text in the complex environment of interactive dashboards. Through a survey and analysis of 190 dashboards in the wild, plus 13 expert interview sessions with experienced dashboard authors, we highlight the distinctive nature of text as an integral component of the dashboard experience, while delving into the categories, semantic levels, and functional roles of text, and exploring how these text elements are coalesced by dashboard authors to guide and inform dashboard users. Our contributions are threefold. First, we distill qualitative and quantitative findings from our studies to characterize current practices of text use in dashboards, including a categorization of text-based components and design patterns. Second, we leverage current practices and existing literature to propose, discuss, and validate recommended practices for text in dashboards, embodied as a set of 12 heuristics that underscore the semantic and functional role of text in offering navigational cues, contextualizing data insights, supporting reading order, among other concerns. Third, we reflect on our findings to identify gaps and propose opportunities for data visualization researchers to push the boundaries on text usage for dashboards, from authoring support and interactivity to text generation and content personalization.

This prompts the need for a consensus model suitable for VANETs. A hierarchical reputation consensus model for VANET has been proposed. The model dynamically partitions consensus groups based on vehicles’ global reputation, which restricts malicious nodes from participating in consensus to improve consensus efficiency. Secondly, an improved event reliability assessment mechanism is introduced into the reputation model to detect the authenticity of the events and mitigate the fabrication of false events. Finally, a hierarchical directed gossip consensus model based on directed acyclic graph (DAG) called as HDGgraph has been proposed. It is aimed at addressing the challenge of achieving consensus when vehicle communication synchronization cannot be guaranteed. In HDGgraph, vehicles can construct a DAG locally and implement virtual voting to achieve local consensus, which can reduce system communication overhead and significantly improve consensus efficiency.

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems that share the same frequency band and signaling strategies, such as a single radio frequency emission, address these congestion issues. In this work, we propose novel chaotic signal processing techniques and waveform design methods for ISAC systems. First, we consider a family of chaotic oscillators and use their output to encode the information. Next, we multiplex the information carrying chaotic signals to improve the data rates significantly and further use it for ISAC transmission. We show that a simple correlator can accurately decode the information with low bit-error rates. The performance of the multiplexed waveform is robust in the Rician multipath channel. Using correlation and ambiguity function analysis, we claim that the proposed waveforms are excellent candidates for high-resolution radar imaging.

The SAR images generated using multiplexed chaos-based waveforms are of similar quality compared to traditionally used linear frequency-modulated waveforms. The most important feature of the proposed multiplexed chaos-based waveforms is their inherent resilience to intentional and nonintentional interference.","2832-7357","","10.1109/TRS.2024.3513293","Union College; Faculty Research Funds (FRF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781422","Anti-jamming;chaos;correlations;integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems;multiplexing;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging","Chaotic communication;Radar;Radar imaging;Multiplexing;Integrated sensing and communication;Radar polarimetry;Radio frequency;Synthetic aperture radar;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Wireless communication","","","","68","CCBY","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Medical knowledge extraction methods based on edge computing deploy deep learning models on edge devices to achieve localized entity and relation extraction. This approach avoids transferring substantial sensitive data to cloud data centers, effectively safeguarding the privacy of healthcare services. However, existing relation extraction methods mainly employ a sequential pipeline approach, which classifies relations between determined entities after entity recognition. This mode faces challenges such as error propagation between tasks, insufficient consideration of dependencies between the two subtasks, and the neglect of interrelations between different relations within a sentence. To address these challenges, a joint extraction model with parameter sharing in edge computing is proposed, named CoEx-Bert. This model leverages shared parameterization between two models to jointly extract entities and relations. Specifically, CoEx-Bert employs two models, each separately sharing hidden layer parameters, and combines these two loss functions for joint backpropagation to optimize the model parameters. Additionally, it effectively resolves the issue of entity overlapping when extracting knowledge from unstructured Uygur medical texts by considering contextual relations. Finally, this model is deployed on edge devices for real-time extraction and inference of Uygur medical knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that CoEx-Bert outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy, recall, and F1-score of 90.65%, 92.45%, and 91.54%, respectively, in the Uygur traditional medical literature dataset. These improvements represent a 6.45% increase in accuracy, a 9.45% increase in recall, and a 7.95% increase in F1-score compared to the baseline.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2024.9010006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10786944","BERT;pre-training;joint extraction;edge computing","Performance evaluation;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Named entity recognition;Medical services;Predictive models;Information retrieval;Real-time systems;Data models;Edge computing","","","","33","","9 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling is used to analyze key factors. These factors include performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, and personal norms. The aim is to explore their impact on the intention to use carbon footprint tracking applications. The results show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and personal norms significantly affect usage intention. Performance expectancy is the strongest predictor. Social influence and personal norms emphasize the role of external social factors and moral obligations in shaping user behavior. Additionally, ascription of responsibility has a stronger mediating effect on usage intention than awareness of consequences.

As the complexity of virtualizing a full infrastructure required unprecedented effort, the initial idea of combining satellite and terrestrial networks has not been fully implemented in 5G yet. 6G networks are expected to further bring NS to a substrate network that is more heterogeneous, due to the full integration between terrestrial and satellite networks. NS describes the process of accommodating virtual networks, typically composed of nodes and links with the respective requirements, into the main infrastructure. This is an NP-Hard problem, typically also known as Virtual Network Embedding (VNE). Existing VNE solutions are designed per use-case and lack flexibility, adaptation and traffic-awareness, especially in such dynamic satellite environment. In this work, we investigate the VNE implementation to integrated satellite-terrestrial networks and propose a novel flexible framework, named Slice-Aware VNE for Satellite-Terrestrial (SAST-VNE), which 1) operates based on traffic prioritization; 2) jointly optimizes the load-balancing and the migration cost when network congestion occurs; and 3) provides a near-optimal solution. We compare SAST-VNE to existing well-known near-optimal VNE algorithms such as VINEYard and CEVNE and the shortest-path SN-VNE solution for satellite networks. The simulations showed that SAST-VNE reduces the migration costs between 10% and 40% during satellite handovers while maintaining the network load under control. Furthermore, when congestion occurs, SAST-VNE proved to be flexible in matching the priority of the slice, i.e., tolerated latency, with the time complexity and optimality of the solution.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2024.3460066","Luxembourg National Research Fund via the Industrial Partnership Block Grant (IPBG) through the Project INtegrated Satellite–TeRrestrial Systems for Ubiquitous Beyond 5G CommunicaTions (INSTRUCT)(grant numbers:FNR/IPBG19/14016225); Project AutonomouS NetWork Slicing for IntEgrated SateLlite-TerrestriaL Transport Networks (ASWELL)(grant numbers:FNR/C19/IS/13718904); Project Distributed and Risk-aware Multi-Agent ReinfOrcement Learning for ResoUrces and Control Management in MulTIlayer Ground-Air-Space NEtworks (RUTINE)(grant numbers:C22/IS/17220888); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10685080","Network slicing;virtual network embedding;integrated satellite-terrestrial","Substrates;Space-air-ground integrated networks;Satellites;6G mobile communication;Handover;Costs;Minimization","","","","19","CCBY","20 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the NF and FF differ in many aspects, it is critical to identify their corresponding regions. In this article, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the existing NF-FF boundaries, then introduce a novel NF-FF demarcation method based on effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) of the channel. Since EDoF is intimately related to channel capacity, the EDoF-based border is able to characterize key channel performance more accurately than the classic Rayleigh distance and other representative benchmarks.

Fast and effective image retrieval over a wide range of databases is a difficult task in this modern research era. Various content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems have been developed to store and retrieve related images to meet the needs of these systems. However, the existing systems lack high accuracy due to problems in foreground and background objects distinction and high semantic gap. The proposed model presents a three-phase approach including image analysis, synthesis, and indexing to improve image retrieval efficiency and accuracy by integrating deep features of CNN models. Initially, color images are converted to grayscale images and the analysis phase accelerates the feature extraction process by applying intensity functions, outer boundary detection, thresholding, connected component labeling, and intensity inversion techniques to efficiently process grayscale images. These features are further refined through synthesis phase containing comprehensive steps, such as the use of multi-scale detection, enumeration, local binarization, invariance and covariance computations to improve the precision of the extracted data. The deep features of CNN models such as VGG19, InceptionV3 and AlexNet are combined with hand-crafted feature vectors to overcome semantic gap and improve image content analysis. This fusion provides a significant increase in image retrieval precision. Finally, integrating bag-of-words (BOW) model in indexing phase significantly improves the accuracy of image retrieval. The model is evaluated on Cifar-10, Cifar-100, and Caltech-101 datasets. The results are evaluated in terms of precision, recall, average retrieval precision (ARP), average retrieval recall (ARR), mean average precision (MAP), and mean average recall (MAR).

However, the lack of effective models to elucidate the mechanical responses of deep tissue during assisted repositioning and identify the optimal tilt angle has hindered the implementation of effective automatic assisted repositioning systems for long-term care patients. Therefore, this study developed a novel computational model that integrates the buttocks with a support mattress to simulate automatic assisted repositioning, thereby analyzing deep tissue responses and optimizing tilt angles for effective load offloading. Inverse modeling was used to reconstruct the 3D shape of the buttocks, nodal equivalence techniques were employed to simplify the mesh and accurately represent internal tissue contacts, and soft tissue parameters were optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Finally, finite element (FE) analysis was conducted to evaluate the biomechanical responses and optimize the repositioning strategies. Model validation demonstrated a deformation error of  $6.93~\pm ~7.41$  mm (mean ± standard deviation) and interface pressure differences within 22.4%, demonstrating the efficacy and bio-fidelity of the system. Repositioning simulations at angles from 0° to 30° showed a 20% reduction in total soft tissue strain, with peak equivalent stress decreasing by 22.27% at the mattress- to-buttock interface and by 20.43% at the muscle-to-adipose tissue interface. These simulations suggest that a 30° turning angle is beneficial for alleviating pressure concentration, which may inspire the design and optimization of automatic assisted repositioning strategies in rehabilitation practices.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3520146","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFC2005901); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:31800824); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2024CDJXY-017,2022CDJXY-026); Chongqing Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX1543,CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX0047); Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chengdu-Chongqing Two-City Economic Circle(grant numbers:KJCXZD2020009); State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Green Vehicle and Mobility(grant numbers:KFY2411); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807345","Pressure ulcers;buttocks;assisted repositioning;finite element","Buttocks;Magnetic resonance imaging;Muscles;Iron;Strain;Gravity;Biological tissues;Biomechanics;Surface reconstruction;Skin","","","","38","CCBY","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The matched filter (MF) is the main method used to retrieve methane enhancement from hyperspectral imaging. However, many false positive retrievals occur over heterogeneous land surfaces because of the confusion between methane absorption and surface reflectance spectra. This hinders the accurate quantification of methane point source emissions from hyperspectral imaging. To overcome this hindrance, we present an improved matched filter that includes background filtering to mitigate the reflectance spectra mismatch between the target and background. By analyzing the land cover shortwave-infrared spectral library, we found that wideband spectral slopes can be used to distinguish between surface types. Based on this, we designed the background sample filtering process and verified its performance using simulation and the advanced hyperspectral imager data. The results show that the improved matched filter can effectively reduce false retrievals over heterogeneous land surfaces and obtain a more realistic methane plume. For example, near an emission source with a $\Delta$XCH$_{4}$ of 1000 ppb, the simulated retrieval bias can be less than 1.3% using a 1% filter threshold.

However, interchannel phase errors present in practical applications severely degrade the quality of 3-D reconstruction results. The current state-of-the-art methods for interchannel phase error estimation and compensation fall into two categories: calibrator-based methods and data-driven methods relying on synthetic aperture radar echo measurements. These methods face challenges, such as unavailability of the calibrator, reliance on single constraint criteria, and heavy computational burden. In this article, we propose an innovative and efficient method for estimating interchannel phase errors in TomoSAR imaging. We consider the phase errors as parameters to be estimated and optimize the estimation based on a joint constraint criterion of minimum mean square error and minimum entropy. In addition, our approach introduces a joint iterative solution framework, which incorporates a modified accelerated iterative shrinkage-threshold sparse recovery algorithm and an adaptive momentum optimizer for interchannel phase error estimation in a gradient descent manner. Compared to conventional phase error calibration methods in a two-step iterative framework, our proposed method considers image features and parameter coupling relationships, thus achieving higher precision estimation while saving computational costs.

Acquiring large amounts of financial data for training deep learning models is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. This paper proposes a Noise Visibility Function-Differential Privacy Generative Adversarial Network (NVF-DPGAN) model, which generates privacy preserving data similar to the original data, and can be applied to data augmentation for deep learning. This study conducts experiments using financial data from China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. It compares the generated data with real data from various perspectives, including mean, probability density distribution, and correlation. The experimental results show that the two datasets exhibit similar characteristics. A time series forecasting model is trained on the generated data and the real data separately, and their prediction results are closely aligned. NVF-DPGAN model is feasible and practical in terms of financial data enhancement and privacy protection.

The modal behavior of the photonic lantern is investigated along the transition via electromagnetic modal analysis, at the wavelength ${\bm{\lambda}} \ = \ \text{3.34}\ {\bm{\mu} \mathbf{m}}$.

However, existing methods often overlook the distribution discrepancies across images caused by changes in imaging time. Meanwhile, the spectral and spatial features of hyperspectral images still have great potential for further development in extracting and detecting changes. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel approach called domain alignment dynamic spectral and spatial feature fusion (DADSSFF) for hyperspectral change detection. First, DADSSFF uses the main network to optimize the alignment of the mean (first-order statistics) and correlation (variance, second-order statistics) of the bitemporal images, coordinating features across both levels to alleviate the issue of inconsistent feature distribution. Second, the Kullback–Leibler divergence is employed to increase the interaction between the two auxiliary networks and the main network, enhancing the extraction of spectral and spatial attention features from bitemporal hyperspectral images. Finally, the cosine similarity is applied to measure the weights of the spectral and spatial features, enabling a dynamic evaluation of their importance. The effectiveness of DADSSFF is demonstrated by experimental results on three classical hyperspectral change detection datasets.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3495217","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62222116,62171417,62071438); Key Science and Technology Project of Ministry of Emergency Management of the People's Republic of China(grant numbers:2024EMST070706); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10748394","Cosine similarity;domain alignment;hyperspectral change detection;Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD);spectral and spatial attention","Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Convolutional neural networks;Attention mechanisms;Correlation;Data mining;Logic gates;Imaging;Earth;Recurrent neural networks","","","","59","CCBYNCND","8 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, this paper proposes a user-privacy-controllable data augmentation model that generates synthetic substitutes to replace original data, ensuring anonymity. The model mitigates the data sparsity problem by introducing a global average user-item vector and an attention mechanism. The global vector captures the overall user interest trend, reducing noise and outliers, which allows for a more accurate representation of user interests and a precise selection of items to replace, even in sparse data environments. Additionally, the model dynamically generates synthetic substitutes that align with user interests based on privacy preferences, prioritizing replacing low-interest items, thus achieving a good balance between privacy protection and data utility. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the model effectively protects privacy while maintaining high data utility, outperforming existing mainstream methods in personalized privacy protection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525513","Gansu Province Higher Education Institutions Industrial Support Program(grant numbers:2020C-29); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820329","Recommendation System;User Privacy;Synthetic Data","","","","","","CCBYNCND","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, further analysis is conducted on postpolarization decomposition by exploiting the surrounding area of the archeological sites. This research proposed the double-bounce over surface scattering area (DoS) and double-bounce over volume scattering area (DoV) as novel descriptors to extract information in PolSAR images. These novel descriptors acted as filters to gain the presence of double bounce scattering from the dihedral-shaped archeological objects, distinguishing it from the surrounding surface scattering and volume scattering. Further, three variants of the surrounding area are examined, i.e. fixed area, area with homogeneity, and area with both homogeneity and connectivity. The proposed descriptors were validated using the scale model of the manmade structure or model of archeological objects under the vegetation canopy. Then the proposed descriptors are applied to the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 image in the archaeological site in Muaro Jambi, Sumatera island, Indonesia to investigate the buried and vegetation-covered structures. Quantitatively, the scattering mechanism is analyzed on both scale model and satellite data. The proposed descriptors were evaluated for classifying: restored site, unrestored sites and vegetation in Muaro Jambi site. The information quality and its ability to classify between oriented structures and natural targets are evaluated. The information quality shows that the proposed descriptors have richer information up to 204%, especially in vegetation areas, and potentially indicate hidden features. For classification, the DoS descriptor provides a better classification of oblique buildings versus natural targets. With further research, the proposed descriptors could be employed to detect other hidden archeological artifacts in vegetationcovered areas.","1745-1345","","10.23919/transcom.2024SNI0001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820154","Ratio double-bounce;polarimetric SAR;archeological object;polarimetric decomposition","Scattering;Vegetation mapping;Synthetic aperture radar;Image restoration;Buildings;Spaceborne radar;Soil;Vegetation;Remote sensing;Radar polarimetry","","","","","","2 Jan 2025","","","IEICE","IEICE Early Access Articles"

The purpose of this study is to investigate emotion identification by machine learning using electroencephalography (EEG) data. Current research in EEG-based emotion recognition faces significant challenges due to the high-dimensionality and variability of EEG signals, which complicate accurate classification. Traditional methods often struggle to extract relevant features from noisy and high-dimensional data, and they typically fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies within EEG signals. Recent progress in machine learning by deep neural networks has opened up opportunities to develop methods highly efficient and practicable as to serve useful real-world applications.

"Comprehensive Fault Location on Transmission Lines Considering Variation in Line Parameters and Saturation in Current Transformers","D. C. Huynh; L. D.

This paper proposes an innovative approach to a fault location by solving an optimization problem. The process relies on transmission line parameters, which can vary significantly under various operating conditions. Inaccurate parameters can severely affect fault location results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a parameter estimation process. Additionally, when faults occur near transmission line terminals, high fault currents can cause current transformer (CT) saturation and secondary current distortion, further impacting fault location accuracy. Instead of using currents distorted by CT saturation, this paper proposes to estimate the currents for inputting into the fault location procedure. To achieve accurate parameter and current estimation at both terminals of the transmission line, advanced artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms such as Chaos ABC algorithm and Chaos particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ABC algorithm are employed. These are enhanced variants designed to improve exploitation ability, leading to better convergence values and reduced iteration requirements. The proposal is applied for locating three-line (L-L-L), three-line to-ground (L-L-L-G), two-line (L-L), two-line to-ground (L-L-G), and line-to-ground (L-G) faults on the transmission line with various locations. More specifically, the transmission line parameter variations and the CT saturation are considered to enhance the practicality of the fault location problem. Numerical results and comparisons confirm the proposal’s effectiveness, being better than the previous traditional fault location technique such as the impedance-based (IB) technique, as well as other meta-heuristic algorithms such as a grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, a gravitational search (GS) algorithm, and an inclined planes optimization (IPO) algorithm.

Self-verification of the calibration image results in a star-based calibration accuracy is better than 0.3 pixels. Further verification of the star image that leads to an interior orientation accuracy is better than 0.6 pixels. The accuracy of geometric positioning without control is verified by ground images of different regions to be 30 m. The interior orientation accuracy of ground images processed by star-based calibration parameters is better than 1.5 m. The ground image corrected using the star-based calibration parameters is well overlaid on the reference image. The accuracies obtained with star-based and ground-based calibrations are comparable. However, ground calibration fields require high maintenance costs and may suffer from harsh imaging conditions. Contrarily, star-based calibration is not affected by the weather and climate conditions on the ground, which can be photographed from any location along the satellite orbit.

However, the openness of IoV networks and the exponential growth of V2X links have expanded potential attack surfaces, increasing the risk of security and privacy breaches. In response to these challenges, this article proposes a privacy-preserving and secure communication framework for IoV networks, addressing critical security challenges in V2X communication. By leveraging lightweight cryptographic mechanisms such as hash functions, quadratic residuosity, and Legendre symbols, the proposed scheme ensures secure authentication, group key sharing, and pseudonym management within IoV networks. The proposed scheme’s security and privacy features, along with its correctness, have been rigorously validated against various security threats where other state-of-the-art schemes fail.

The severity of pelvic fractures in trauma victims is frequently assessed by grading the fracture according to the Tile AO/OTA classification in whole-body Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Due to the high volume of whole-body CT scans generated in trauma centers, the overall information content of a single whole-body CT scan and low manual CT reading speed, an automatic approach to Tile classification would provide substantial value, e.g., to prioritize the reading sequence of the trauma radiologists or enable them to focus on other major injuries in multi-trauma patients. In such a high-stakes scenario, an automated method for Tile grading should ideally be transparent such that the symbolic information provided by the method follows the same logic a radiologist or orthopedic surgeon would use to determine the fracture grade. This paper introduces an automated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist radiologists in fracture detection and Tile grading. To achieve interpretability despite processing high-dimensional whole-body CT images, we design a neurosymbolic algorithm that operates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans. The algorithm first detects relevant pelvic fractures on CTs with high specificity using Faster-RCNN. To generate robust fracture detections and associated detection (un)certainties, we perform test-time augmentation of the CT scans to apply fracture detection several times in a self-ensembling approach. The fracture detections are interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical best practices to infer an initial Tile grade. We apply a Bayesian causal model to recover likely co-occurring fractures that may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating point of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and corresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides fracture location and types, as well as information on important counterfactuals that would invalidate the system’s recommendation. Our approach achieves an AUC of 0.89/0.74 for translational and rotational instability,which is comparable to radiologist performance. Despite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not compromise on performance compared to previous black-box methods.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2024.3428836","National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)(grant numbers:R01 GM148987); NIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)(grant numbers:K08 EB027141); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10605832","Bayesian inference;deep learning;explainable machine learning;human-computer interaction","Computed tomography;Injuries;Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Artificial intelligence;Deep learning;Three-dimensional displays","","","","65","CCBY","22 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eye-tracking data from 139 participants were recorded with an emotional induction paradigm in which each participant observed a set of positive and negative emotional stimuli. The data were analyzed to find differences between groups, where the most significant features were selected to train prediction models. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling. Four algorithms support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and gradient boosting (GB) were trained with hyperparameter optimization and 5-fold cross-validation. The RF algorithm achieved the highest accuracy at 84%, followed by SVM, GB, and the MLP neural network. Performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, precision recall area under the curve (PR-AUC), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) were also used to evaluate the models.

Existing approaches may, however, be inefficient in real-world applications due to insufficient modeling knowledge and initially unknowable parameters in online scenarios. Thus, we propose the Uncertain and Dynamic Orienteering Problem (UDOP), modeling travel costs as distributions with unknown and time-variant parameters. UDOP also associates uncertain travel costs with dynamic prizes and prize-collection costs for its objective and budget constraints. To address UDOP, we develop an ADaptive Approach for Probabilistic paThs, ADAPT, iteratively performing ‘execution’ and ‘online planning’ based on an initial ‘offline’ solution. The execution phase updates the system status and records online cost observations. The online planner employs a Bayesian approach to adaptively estimate power consumption and optimize path sequence based on safety beliefs. We evaluate ADAPT in a practical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) charging scheduling problem for Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks. The UAV must optimize its path to recharge sensor nodes efficiently while managing its energy under uncertain conditions. ADAPT maintains comparable solution quality and computation time while offering superior robustness. Extensive simulations show that ADAPT achieves a 100% Mission Success Rate (MSR) across all tested scenarios, outperforming comparable heuristic-based and frequentist approaches that fail up to 70% (under challenging conditions) and averaging 67% MSR, respectively.

The quality of the produced images is affected by the number of CBCT projections available for reconstruction. Interpolation techniques have been used to generate intermediary projections to be used, along with the original projections, for reconstruction. Transfer learning is a powerful approach that harnesses the ability to reuse pre-trained models in solving new problems. Methods: Several state-of-the-art pre-trained deep learning models, used for video frame interpolation, are utilized in this work to generate intermediary projections. Moreover, a novel regression predictive modeling approach is also proposed to achieve the same objective. Digital phantom and clinical datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results: The results show that the Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation (RIFE) algorithm outperforms the others in terms of the Structural Similarity Index Method (SSIM): 0.986 $\pm$ 0.010, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR): 44.13 $\pm$ 2.76, and Mean Square Error (MSE): 18.86 $\pm$ 206.90 across all datasets. Moreover, the interpolated projections were used along with the original ones to reconstruct a 4D-CBCT image that was compared to that reconstructed from the original projections only.

One of the most significant challenges is the variability in the sensing qualities of the participating devices while they are initially unknown and must be learned over time to optimize task assignments. This paper tackles the dual challenges of managing task diversity to mitigate data redundancy and optimizing task assignment amidst the inherent variability of worker performance. We introduce a novel model that dynamically adjusts task weights based on assignment frequency to promote diversity and incorporates a flexible approach to account for the different qualities of task completion, especially in scenarios with overlapping task assignments. Our strategy aims to maximize the overall weighted quality of data collected within the constraints of a predefined budget.

However, subjective procedures remain prevalent in the literature, particularly within decision methods and three-way decision (3WD) approaches. Traditional 3WD often utilizes a subjectively defined, fixed risk avoidance coefficient that reflects human perception of battlefield information. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a dynamic multi-target TA method within an intuitionistic fuzzy environment, eliminating subjective parameter settings in the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and incorporating an objective 3WD (O3WD) approach. The O3WD quantifies uncertainty through cosine entropy, modeling its relationship with risk avoidance coefficients non-linearly. Given the complex interplay of factors—such as sensor accuracy and environmental conditions—that contribute unpredictably to uncertainty, this concept better captures the dynamics inherent in TA. Two case studies were conducted to evaluate the O3WD’s effectiveness in target categorization across a range of  $\gamma $  values, a parameter that controls the curvature of the risk function. The first case showed that the proposed method excelled in recent TA methods in threat ranking. An objective analysis of attribute uncertainties revealed that the compared methods applied overly high-risk avoidance coefficients, leading to inaccurate decisions, a finding also supported by the second case. The proposed method enables precise categorization based on attribute uncertainty without parameter adjustments, highlighting its effectiveness and suitability for multi-target TA in real-world scenarios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523817","Brazilian Air Force under the Postgraduate Program in Operational Applications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817603","Decision-making process;intuitionistic fuzzy numbers;risk avoidance coefficient;threat assessment;three-way decision;TOPSIS method;weighted heronian mean operator","Uncertainty;Threat assessment;Correlation;Decision making;Wearable Health Monitoring Systems;Fuzzy sets;Terminology;Rough sets;Fuzzy set theory;Computational modeling","","","","48","CCBY","27 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This gap is exacerbated by the fact that the development and research of technologies, such as caption glasses, aimed at bridging this divide, primarily focus on sign languages used in countries with prominent tech industries, including European countries and USA. Consequently, there is a lack of resources and attention devoted to sign language recognition and translation systems for languages spoken in Africa. This research addresses this issue by concentrating on twenty-two common gestures in Kinyarwanda sign language. Through extensive exploration and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms, the study identifies the most effective approach for recognizing and translating these gestures. To validate the effectiveness of the developed system, real-world Kinyarwanda sign language video data is utilized for thorough training and testing. The research successfully culminates in the creation of a functional web application capable of accurately recognizing the 22 Kinyarwanda sign language gestures, both in live video feeds and recorded videos. This achievement represents a significant outcome of the research, as it addresses the specific needs of the Kinyarwanda signing community. By providing a reliable and accessible tool for gesture recognition and translation, the research contributes to narrowing the communication gap between individuals with hearing disabilities who use Kinyarwanda sign language and the wider society.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2025.10755056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10755056","Computer vision;Kinyarwanda;LSTM;Machine learning;MediaPipe;Reduced Inequalities;Sign Language","Sign language;Accuracy;Training;Auditory system;Sensors;Assistive technologies;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Africa;Data models","","","","","","15 Nov 2024","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

To simultaneously address these two challenges, in this paper, a non-orthogonal modulation based multi-carrier differential chaos shift keying system (namely MCNO-DCSK) is proposed and demonstrated. The most remarkable feature of MCNO-DCSK is that the strict orthogonality between subcarriers is no longer required. In this way, frequency intervals between subcarriers can be much smaller than ever, which leads to a high spectral efficiency. Meanwhile, the frequency interval can be set more flexibly to make the symbol more difficult to be deciphered. Therefore, a high level of security can also be guaranteed. In this design, multiple modulated non-orthogonal subcarriers are sequentially delayed and directly superimposed in time domain to construct the MCNO-DCSK symbol. At the receiver, information bits are demodulated through solving a system of linear equations. The spectral efficiency, computational complexity, and security are analyzed, and the bit-error-rate expressions are derived. Moreover, as subcarriers are non-orthogonal and time delayed, the MCNO-DCSK will suffer severe interference over the multi-path channel. Therefore, the effect of the multi-path interference on the system performance is discussed, and a method to mitigate this interference is designed. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of MCNO-DCSK.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2024.9010057","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFE0111600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001077,61801074,61971083); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10574207","maritime communications;chaotic communications;Multi-Carrier Differential chaos Shift Keying (MC-DCSK);non-orthogonal modulation;high spectral efficiency","Security;Spectral efficiency;Maritime communications;Chaotic communication;Frequency modulation;Symbols;Receivers","","","","41","","26 Jun 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The stochastic nature of these FMs introduces variability, which often results in inaccurate comparisons of the controllers' performance. To address this issue, a parametric statistical methodology has recently been proposed. However, it presents certain limitations, such as the assumption of normality. In response to this, the adoption of a non-parametric methodology is suggested in this work, which promises a precise evaluation of the efficiency of current controllers. In this study, we demonstrate that, under parametric approach, when the assumption of normality is violated, there is a significant increase in Type I error. Furthermore, we show that the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test offers greater sensitivity compared to its parametric counterpart under these circumstances. Thus, the newly proposed methodology aims to optimize the decision-making process in designing high-performance current controllers for applications in power converters and electric motors. This allows for design decisions grounded in rigorous and statistically-based evaluations.

Existing SAR adversarial attack algorithms require access to the network structure, parameters, and training data, which are often inaccessible in real-world scenarios. To address this problem, this study proposes an intermediate layer feature attack algorithm that does not rely on training data for the adversary model. Electromagnetic simulation is used to obtain the simulated SAR local data domain during the training stage. A lightweight generator, TinyResNet, is introduced to quickly construct adversarial examples through a one-step mapping process. In addition, the transferability of these examples across different models is improved by eliminating the intermediate layer features of the model. Finally, a domain-agnostic feature attention module is utilized to reduce discrepancies between different data domains from a model perspective, further improving the transferability of adversarial examples across domains. Experimental results on five SAR datasets of ground vehicles, ships, and scene types demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms 13 mainstream adversarial attack algorithms in terms of cross-model and cross-data domain transferability. In particular, the proposed method improves the cross-domain attack success rate by 43.74%–48.88% on the MSTAR dataset.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3507374","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42201472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10768976","Adversarial example;automatic target recognition (ATR);deep neural network (DNN);synthetic aperture radar (SAR);transferability","Perturbation methods;Closed box;Synthetic aperture radar;Generators;Data models;Radar polarimetry;Target recognition;Training data;Artificial neural networks;Training","","","","62","CCBY","27 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, the link signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved, and higher throughput can be achieved. Here, we demonstrate a fully-optoelectronic 300 GHz band multi-channel link using a novel low-barrier Schottky mixer driven with a photonically generated local oscillator (LO) signal in the receiver using a modified uni-travelling-carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD). This combines the efficient down-conversion of Schottky-based mixers and the advantages of photonic LO signals such as tuneability, remote generation and distribution, and the reuse of coherent technology used in fibre networks. Up to three frequency channels are generated in the transmitter which is also based on a MUTC-PD photomixer. We achieve a maximum aggregate line rate of 180Gbps over a distance of 1.5 meters, utilizing 16-QAM format and optical intensity modulation.

Currently, Bayesian FL strategies are impaired by large communication costs that need to be reduced to provide more sustainable training platforms. This letter investigates the impact of compression strategies in centralized Bayesian FL setups, where a Parameter Sever (PS) is tasked to supervise the learning process. The goal is to study how compression affects the ability of Bayesian FL systems to provide high-quality, yet well-calibrated ML models. The analysis is carried out in the healthcare domain, where the prediction reliability is particularly critical, focusing on a medical imaging task. Numerical results show that applying aggressive compression policies highly reduces the ability of Bayesian FL systems to provide accurate and reliable ML models.

This requires image translation—converting imagery from one sensor domain to another while preserving the original content. Denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) are potential state-of-the-art solutions for such domain translation due to their proven superiority in multiple image-to-image translation tasks in computer vision. However, these models struggle with reproducing radiometric features of large-scale multipatch imagery, resulting in inconsistencies across the full image. This renders downstream tasks like heterogeneous change detection impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method that leverages denoising diffusion for effective multisensor optical image translation over large areas. Our approach super-resolves large-scale low spatial resolution images into high-resolution equivalents from disparate optical sensors, ensuring uniformity across hundreds of patches. Our contributions lie in new forward and reverse diffusion processes that address the challenges of large-scale image translation. Extensive experiments using paired Sentinel-II (10 m) and Planet Dove (3 m) images demonstrate that our approach provides precise domain adaptation, preserving image content while improving radiometric accuracy and feature representation. A thorough image quality assessment and comparisons with the standard DDIM framework and five other leading methods are presented. We reach a mean learned perceptual image patch similarity of 0.1884 and a Fréchet Inception Distance of 45.64, expressively outperforming all compared methods, including DDIM, ShuffleMixer, and SwinIR.

In this paper, we introduce a framework to balance learnability and expressivity in a visualization authoring system. Adopting insights from learnability studies, such as multimodal interaction and visualization literacy, we explore the design space of blending multiple visualization authoring interfaces for supporting authoring tasks in a complementary and flexible manner. To evaluate the effectiveness of blending interfaces, we implemented a proof-of-concept system, Blace, that combines four common visualization authoring interfaces–template-based, shelf configuration, natural language, and code editor–that are tightly linked to one another to help users easily relate unfamiliar interfaces to more familiar ones. Using the system, we conducted a user study with 12 domain experts who regularly visualize genomics data as part of their analysis workflow. Participants with varied visualization and programming backgrounds were able to successfully reproduce unfamiliar visualization examples without a guided tutorial in the study. Feedback from a post-study qualitative questionnaire further suggests that blending interfaces enabled participants to learn the system easily and assisted them in confidently editing unfamiliar visualization grammar in the code editor, enabling expressive customization.

Nonetheless, owing to the ambiguity of ASD severity labels and individual differences in ASD severity, current fMRI-based methods for identifying ASD severity still do not achieve satisfactory performance. Besides, the potential association between brain functional networks(BFN) and ASD symptom severity remains under investigation. To address these problems, we propose a low&high-level BFN distance method and an adaptive multi-label distribution(HBFND-AMLD) technique for ASD severity identification. First, a low-level and high-level BFN distance(HBFND) is proposed to construct BFN that reflects differences in ASD severity. This method can measure the distance between the ASD and the health control(HC) on the low-order and high-order BFN respectively, which can distinguish the severity of ASD. After that, a multi-task network is proposed for ASD severity identification which considers the individual differences of ASD severity in communication and society, which considers the individual differences in language and social skills of ASD patients. Finally, a novel adaptive label distribution(ALD) technique is employed to train the ASD severity identification model, effectively preventing network overfitting by restricting label probability distribution. We evaluate the proposed framework on the public ABIDE I dataset. The promising results obtained by our framework outperform the state-of-the-art methods with an increase in identification performance, indicating that it has a potential clinical prospect for practical ASD severity diagnosis.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3516216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10821533","Autism spectrum disorder;functional magnetic resonance imaging;high-level brain functional network;label distribution learning","Training;Adaptation models;Autism;Adaptive systems;Accuracy;Transfer learning;Semisupervised learning;Brain modeling;Probability distribution;Overfitting","","","","48","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To harness the potential of eVTOL travel in ameliorating transportation carbon emissions and alleviating ground transportation congestion, the judicious selection of optimal eVTOL stop sites emerges as a pivotal consideration. This study delineates a framework for the delineation of intra-city and short-distance inter-city eVTOL site selection predicated on comprehensive analysis of ground transportation system interconnections. The initial phase of the framework entails the identification of potential optimal take-off and landing sites through a multi-faceted assessment of factors encompassing vehicular and passenger traffic flows, regional economic dynamics, travel behavioral patterns, and prevailing eVTOL flight regulations across heterogeneous ground transportation networks. Employing an enhanced iteration of the K-means algorithm, this phase undertakes the clustering of optimal takeoff and landing locations, thereby discerning their spatial distribution to effectively alleviate ground traffic congestion while aligning with eVTOL vertical port requirements and airspace regulatory mandates. The second phase involves the establishment of a demand gravity model to validate the optimal take-off and landing coordinate sites of eVTOL and further assess a service index indicative of traffic flow optimization. The case shows that six optimal eVTOL take-off and landing locations have been discerned by our model within the Beijing-Tianjin-Xiong'an (Hebei) region. These locations are anticipated to yield a cumulative service index of 75,465 instances, thereby efficaciously mitigating travel pressure on ground transportation infrastructure.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2024.3506277","Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(grant numbers:3122024QD18); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62206062); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767205","Urban air mobility (UAM);electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL);takeoff and landing sites;multi-factor site selection","Transportation;Atmospheric modeling;Vehicle dynamics;Urban areas;Safety;Noise;Heuristic algorithms;Aircraft;Vectors;Meteorology","","","","55","CCBY","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the quality of radar data, machine learning and fuzzy logic algorithms are often used to identify and classify non-meteorological clutter in weather data. However, these methods often require dozens of texture features as inputs and need to manually adjust the thresholds to cope with different clutter types, which leads to significant time costs. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale weighted connected UNet to address these challenges by combining the channel attention feature fusion module and the UNet structure model. The task of recognizing non-meteorological clutter is regarded as a semantic segmentation problem, which eliminates the need to manually set thresholds for clutter pixel-level classification. Additionally, the channel-focused feature fusion mechanism is able to analyze the deep latent features of the input parameters and suppress the useless features, so that only six polarization parameters are required as inputs. Furthermore, the model incorporates full-scale deep supervision to improve the edge segmentation accuracy of clutter and meteorological echoes.

With the rapid progress of deep learning technology, the deep learning-based super-resolution technology for remote sensing images has also made remarkable achievements. However, these methods encounter several challenges. They often struggle with processing long-range spatial information that encompasses complex scene changes, adversely affecting the image's coherence and accuracy. Furthermore, the lack of connectivity in feature extraction blocks hinders effective feature utilization in deeper network layers, leading to issues such as gradient vanishing and exploding. Additionally, constraints in the spatial domain of previous methods frequently result in severe shape distortion and blurring. To address these issues, this study proposes the CFFormer, a new super-resolution framework that employs the Swin Transformer as its core architecture and incorporates the Channel Fourier Block (CFB) to refine features in the frequency domain. The Global Attention Block (GAB) is also integrated to enhance global information capture, thereby improving the extraction of spatial features. To increase model stability and feature utilization efficiency, a Jump-Joint Fusion Mechanism is designed, culminating in a Residual Fusion Swin Transformer Block (RFSTB) that alleviates the gradient vanishing issue and optimizes feature reuse. Experimental results confirm the CFFormer's superior performance in remote sensing image reconstruction, demonstrating outstanding perceptual quality and reliability. Notably, the CFFormer achieves a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 29.83 dB on the UcMercedx4 dataset, surpassing the SwinIR method by approximately 0.5 dB, indicating a substantial enhancement.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3492044","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFC3101601); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972240); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10742930","Convolutional neural network (CNN);fast Fourier transform (FFT);remote sensing image processing;super resolution (SR);transformer","Superresolution;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Feature extraction;Fast Fourier transforms;Deep learning;Current transformers;Image reconstruction;Convolutional neural networks;Frequency-domain analysis","","","","49","CCBY","5 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we focus on system design for a UAV-mounted-RIS system and investigate joint optimization for the RIS’s phase shift and the UAV’s trajectory. To cope with the practical issue of inaccessible information on the user terminals’ (UTs) location and channel state, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based solution is proposed to find the optimal policy with finite steps of “trial-and-error”. As the action space is continuous, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is applied to train the RL model. However, the online interaction between the agent and environment may lead to instability during the training and the assumption of (first-order) Markovian state transition could be impractical in real-world problems. Therefore, the decision transformer (DT) algorithm is employed as an alternative for RL model training to adapt to more general situations of state transition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL solutions are highly efficient in model training along with acceptable performance close to the benchmark, which relies on conventional optimization algorithms with the UT’s locations and channel parameters explicitly known beforehand.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3502576","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L232040,L223030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10758222","UAV-aided communications;reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS);reinforcement learning;trajectory design;phase shift configuration","Trajectory;Wireless communication;Training;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Optimization;Relays;Wireless sensor networks;System analysis and design;Reinforcement learning;Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces","","","","43","CCBY","19 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Satellite observations are crucial in studies aimed at understanding and monitoring the Earth's atmosphere and surface properties. The forward modeling problem computes radiances or reflectances based on surface and atmospheric state knowledge using radiative transfer modeling (RTM). RTTOV, a widely utilized RTM, serves both operational and research applications. This study presents a machine learning (ML) emulator designed to significantly accelerate the acquisition of satellite observations across 36 spectral channels. The ML model predicted 369 303 points across these 36 channels in less than 14 s, showcasing its potential over the much more costly RTTOV emulations. We employ supervised learning to compare the performance of three ML models: Random forest (RF), neural networks (NN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). These models were trained on high-resolution large-eddy simulations in a realistic weather prediction setting over Germany and forward-simulated MODIS-based spectral channels. Our approach achieves strong correlations between predicted and reference data across most of the 36 channels in the test dataset. The $R^{2}$ metric averaged across the 36 channels is 0.91 for the RF model, 0.93 for the NN model, and 0.90 for the CNN model. The normalized RMSE averaged across the 36 channels is 4.07% for the RF model, 3.69% for the NN model, and 4.35% for the CNN model. We discuss the performance of the models in the validation and combined test dataset, as well as in independent channels and timesteps to understand how robust the model is to different data distributions. Overall, the results highlight the potential of ML to replace costly RTM models while maintaining high accuracy in emulating radiance and reflectance.

"RHLS: A Robust Hybrid Level Set Model Using Global-Local Signed Energy-Based Pressure Force for Medical Image Segmentation","M. Almasganj; E.

While Level Set Models (LSMs) are widely used for segmentation, their effectiveness in these scenarios remains limited. This paper proposes a novel Robust Hybrid Level Set (RHLS) model specifically designed to address these limitations in medical image segmentation. The RHLS model tackles noise and intensity inhomogeneity by incorporating both global and local information into its energy function through a Signed Pressure Force (SPF) formulation. It leverages three distinct energy terms: Global Region-Based Term (GRT) which enhances robustness against various noise types using the Huber loss function, Global-Local Region-Based Term (GLRT) which promotes accurate contour propagation while mitigating noise influence, and Local Region-Based Term (LRT) which improves detection of faint edges and mitigates intensity inhomogeneity. These terms, combined with a regularization term, enable the RHLS model to exploit the strengths of both region-based and edge-based approaches. This leads to superior handling of noise and intensity variations compared to existing methods. Extensive evaluation using synthetic and real medical images demonstrates the effectiveness of the RHLS model. It achieves an average accuracy of 97.2% and 95.6% on synthetic and real medical data, respectively, using the Dice similarity measure. These results validate the model’s ability to handle various noise types and intensity variations, showcasing its potential for improved medical image segmentation tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3522113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10813349","Global and local region-based force;level set;biomedical image segmentation;noise and intensity inhomogeneity","Noise;Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Nonhomogeneous media;Level set;Image edge detection;Adaptation models;Medical diagnostic imaging;Fitting;Computational modeling","","","","35","CCBY","24 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their functions in high productivity, strong carbon sequestration capacity, and rich ecosystem services are crucial for achieving the sustainable development goals. Although various classification methods have been extensively applied in large-scale mangrove observations, they necessitate considerable sample collection and postprocessing, which hampers the long-term identification of mangroves. This study proposes a hybrid identification method that combines the time-frequency threshold of the mangrove index with a random forest binary classifier. It efficiently identifies mangroves over large-scale areas with low postprocessing and high accuracy. The hybrid method was applied to Landsat 8 OLI data to derive the mangrove distribution in China using Google Earth Engine. It demonstrated an overall accuracy rate of 92.86% and an F1 score of 0.92, a significant improvement over using either method alone. Specifically, the method utilized a small sample size to successfully obtain pure and accurate mangrove classification. The feature selection indicates that the short-wave infrared band and its associated remote sensing indices play a pivotal role in differentiating mangroves from other confusable land classes. Additionally, this method was successfully applied to Landsat 5 data, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.49%, with substantial agreement between the classification results of the two sensors.

We provide a procedure for constructing short NB QC-RL-LDPC codes with low encoding complexity and optimized graph structures.

Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of the constructed short NB QC-RL-LDPC codes, compared to the 5G standard binary coding with IR. Further exploration shows that, when the NB QC-RL-LDPC coding over GF(2q) is combined with adaptive 2X -ary digital modulations, which provides flexibility in diversifying modulation orders by mixing higher order modulations for initial HR transmission with a lower order for IR, it can improve performance in the low-SNR regime.

The approach comprises a network partitioning method and a two-layer frequency control scheme. The partitioning method utilizes a community detection algorithm in which the weights between the buses are calculated based on the electrical distances. After partitioning the buses into different groups, an optimization-based frequency control system with two layers is established to aggregate and dis-aggregate the inertia and droop coefficients so that frequency regulation and economical operation can be achieved.

This platform involves cascading multiple metasurfaces, each acting as a digitally programmable physical layer within a diffractive neural network. SIM enable the implementation of signal-processing transformations directly in the electromagnetic wave domain, eliminating the need for expensive, high-precision, and power-intensive digital platforms. However, existing studies employing SIM in wireless communication applications rely solely on nearly passive structures that control only the phase of the meta-atoms in each layer. In this study, we propose a SIM-aided downlink multiuser transmission scheme, where the SIM at the base station (BS) end is designed by combining nearly passive layers with phase-only reconfiguration capabilities and active layers integrated with amplifier chips to enable amplitude control. Our optimal design aims at maximizing the sum rate for the best group of users by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the wave-based beamforming at the SIM. In addition to the standard sum-power constraint at the BS, our optimization framework includes two additional constraints: (i) a per-stream power preserving constraint to prevent propagation losses across the SIM, and (ii) an amplitude constraint to account for power limitations for each active layer. To further reduce the complexity of the optimal beamforming solution, we explore a simple yet suboptimal zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming design, where the wave-based transformation implemented by the SIM is selected to eliminate interference among user streams. Finally, extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that incorporating both nearly passive and active layers within the SIM significantly enhances capacity compared to previously reported phase-only coding SIM. Additionally, the numerical results reveal that low-complexity ZF beamforming approaches optimality in terms of maximum sum rate even for a relatively small number of users.","2644-125X","","10.1109/OJCOMS.2025.3526126","European Union under the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) of NextGenerationEU, partnership on ``Telecommunications of the Future"(grant numbers:PE00000001 - program ``RESTART"); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824842","Active metasurfaces;downlink transmission;diffractive deep neural networks (D2NN);optimal sum-rate maximum beamforming;phase and amplitude control;reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS);stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM);zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper proposes a path-planning approach based on deep reinforcement learning for a quadrotor equipped with only a monocular camera.

The former module uses a convolutional encoder-decoder network to learn image depth from visual cues self-supervised, with the output serving as input for the latter module. The latter module uses dueling double deep recurrent Q-learning to make decisions in high-dimensional and partially observable state spaces. To reduce meaningless explorations, we introduce the Insight Memory Pool alongside the regular memory pool to provide a rapid boost in learning by emphasizing early sampling from it and relying on the agent's experiences later. Once the agent has gained enough knowledge from the insightful data, we transition to a targeted exploration phase by employing the Boltzmann behavior policy, which relies on the refined Q-value estimates. To validate our approach, we tested the model in three diverse environments simulated with AirSim: a dynamic city street, a downtown, and a pillar world, each with different weather conditions.

The data ingestion technique, as a potential candidate, facilitates comprehensive ionospheric predictions with high temporal resolution for local regions. In this study, total electron content (TEC) observations from local reference stations were input into the NeQuick-2 background model to enhance its performance. The accuracy of ionospheric predictions at a 5-min resolution with the updated NeQuick-2 model was investigated for a selected geomagnetic storm period in Solar Cycle 25. The results indicate that the updated NeQuick-2 model with a 5-min resolution can provide reliable ionospheric predictions, although the model accuracy is somewhat affected during storm time. Specifically, the TEC accuracy of the updated model is comparable to that of the IGS global ionospheric model but with smaller and more stable offsets. Compared to the standard NeQuick-2 model, the updated model demonstrates a significant reduction in both the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) from approximately 2 TECu to approximately 0.2 TECu and from approximately 8 TECu to nearly 4 TECu, respectively. For frequency of the F2 layer, the updated model outperforms the standard model with a smaller bias and a decreased RMSE from approximately 1.3 MHz to approximately 1.0 MHz. The electron density profiles from the updated model align more closely with the COSMIC-2 observations than those from the standard model.

To induce degradation, we submitted the devices to highly accelerated stress tests: in the current step stress, we tested the degradation of the devices as a function of the stress current, whereas with a constant current stress, we evaluated the degradation as a function of the stress time. Both experiments confirmed that the device with more QDLs (5×QDLs) has better reliability than the structure with a lower number of DWELLs (3×QLDs), while exhibiting the very same degradation modes. We hypothesize that a higher number of active layers favors the redistribution of carriers across the active layers, lowering carrier density and therefore non-radiative recombination rates. This is beneficial in terms of reliability, as the non-radiative recombination lowers the radiative efficiency of the laser and, in turn, can enhance degradation via recombination-enhanced defect reaction (REDR). To support our assumption, we employed a quantum-corrected Poisson-drift-diffusion simulation tool to evaluate the carrier distribution and the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination rate within the active region. The simulation results confirmed that the device with five QDLs has a lower carrier concentration per DWELLs and, therefore, a lower SRH recombination rate per active layer, thus resulting in a lower degradation rate.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2024.3430050","U.S. Defense Advanced Research Project Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10601191","Degradation;quantum dot;dot-in-a-well layers (DWELL);defects;Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH)","Stress;Degradation;Radiative recombination;Optical devices;Current density;Threshold current;Quantum dot lasers","","","","28","CCBYNCND","17 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose a novel RGBT tracking model, called challenge-based Feature complementary Fusion Network (FcFNet), especially aiming at noncooperative scenarios. In particular, we first decouple the mixed challenging attributes and adaptively combine features at each layer using the challenge branch fusion module (CBFM), forming more discriminative target representations. Subsequently, we employ two nonshared convolution kernels in each layer and one shared convolution kernel to, respectively, extract individual and common features of different modalities. By applying the dynamic convolution fusion module (DCFM), the nonshared and shared convolution kernels are reweighted dynamically. Finally, we embed the feature-enhanced aggregation and dynamic kernel weights into the backbone network, which forms the FcFNet. Experimental evaluations conducted on the GTOT and RGBT234 datasets demonstrate a notable enhancement in detection performance, with an absolute improvement of 2.4% in success rate and 3.3% in precision rate when leveraging the CBFM and DCFM. The proposed FcFNet exhibits competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, especially in continuous tracking tasks for noncooperative targets.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3518460","Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2023137); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10803956","Challenge modeling;cross-modal interaction;deep learning;noncooperative targets;RGBT tracking","Target tracking;Feature extraction;Object tracking;Kernel;Convolution;Training;Couplings;Lighting;Deep learning;Convolutional neural networks","","","","38","CCBY","16 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, there is a lack of evaluation of the effectiveness of downscaled precipitation data in drought monitoring in existing research works. In this article, based on the case study in Northeast China, the 10-km monthly Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for global precipitation measurement (GPM IMERG) precipitation data were downscaled to 1 km. Then, the 1-km Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at multiple temporal scales (i.e., 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) was calculated based on the downscaled precipitation data. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted to assess the effectiveness of downscaled precipitation data in drought monitoring. The results indicated that the SPI calculated from 1-km downscaled results can reproduce more detailed spatial distribution patterns of meteorological drought compared to the SPI derived from the 10-km original GPM. The correlation coefficients between the 1-km SPI and that from station data are above 0.88 for validations at both spatial and temporal dimensions.

However, in practical applications, remote sensing images are easily affected by factors, such as cloud cover and changes in illumination, resulting in significant noise and blurriness in the images. These interference factors significantly reduce the accuracy of existing object detection models. Therefore, this article presents a novel and highly robust methodology for detecting PWD, termed YOLOv8-RD. We synthesized the benefits of residual learning and fuzzy deep neural networks to develop a residual fuzzy module (ResFuzzy), which adeptly filters image noise and refines background features with enhanced smoothness. Simultaneously, we integrated a detail processing module into the ResFuzzy module to enhance the low-frequency detail features transmitted in residual learning. Furthermore, by incorporating the dynamic upsampling operator, our model can dynamically adjust the sampling step size based on the variations in the input feature map during the upsampling process, thereby effectively recovering detail from the feature map. Our model exhibited exceptional robustness to severe noise.

The main goal of RA is to optimally place spare cells rapidly to achieve the highest repair rate, resulting in the development of various RA methods. In modern memory architectures, complex spare structures are essential for improving repair rates. However, traditional RA methods can be too time-consuming for such structures, limiting the repair of multiple memories. This paper proposes a method called RAPID, which leverages GPU technology for the parallel repair of multiple memories. RAPID generates repair cases by segmenting areas based on available spare types, ensuring efficient GPU memory use and enabling simultaneous repairs. Repair cases are applied immediately upon fault detection during testing, significantly reducing repair time.

To monitor the operational health of the smart grids, the power system state estimation is a crucial task and becomes challenging when a false data injection occurs. In this work, two non-iterative computation methods based on total least squares are proposed for estimating the state vector from the measurement results contaminated by the additive noise and the malicious attack that can arise in the power transmission systems. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed algorithms and to illustrate their performance, numerical simulation is conducted taking into account two IEEE power system standards, such as IEEE 9-bus and 14-bus models. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-and-attack-to-noise ratio (SANR), and phase-to-attack ratio are examples of the situational quality that can exist in the power distribution systems. These ratios are considered as the investigational aspects for comparing the performance of the proposed methods and corresponding low-rank approaches. Numerical results reveal that our proposed techniques consume much less computational time than two former works for all ranges of the SNR and the SANR. Regarding the estimation accuracy, for moderate and high regions of the SNR and the SANR, the two new methods provide significantly less root-mean-squared error and normalized bias norm than the two previous approaches. For the problem size solvability point of view, the traditional low-rank methods suffer from the trivial solution caused by too many unknown convex optimization variables due to a large number of time samples, whereas the proposed TLS-based algorithms can handle a large power distribution system with a large number of time samples.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3519328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10804763","Power system state estimation;false data attack;convex optimization;total least squares","State estimation;Power systems;Power system stability;Vectors;Noise measurement;Terminology;Smart grids;Signal to noise ratio;Reactive power;Pollution measurement","","","","66","CCBY","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we implement a control strategy for the collaborative manipulation of a cable-suspended platform. The latter is an articulated and partially deformable object that can be used as a base where to place the transported object. In this way, the human and the robot are not rigidly coupled, ensuring a greater flexibility in the partners' motions and a safer interaction. However, the uncertain dynamics of the platform introduces a greater possibility of unintended collisions with external objects, which must be distinguished from contacts arising when a load is placed on or removed from the platform. This letter proposes a contact detection and distinction strategy to address this challenge.

Embedding on heterogeneous graphs has become an essential tool for analyzing and understanding such graphs. Although these meticulously designed methods make progress, they are limited by model design and computational resources, making it difficult to scale to large-scale heterogeneous graph data and hindering the application and promotion of these methods. In this paper, we propose Restage, a relation structure-aware hierarchical heterogeneous graph embedding framework. Under this framework, embedding only a smaller-scale graph with existing graph representation learning methods is sufficient to obtain node representations on the original heterogeneous graph. We consider two types of relation structures in heterogeneous graphs: interaction relations and affiliation relations. Firstly, we design a relation structure-aware coarsening method to successively coarsen the original graph to the top-level layer, resulting in a smaller-scale graph. Secondly, we allow any unsupervised representation learning methods to obtain node embeddings on the top-level graph. Finally, we design a relation structure-aware refinement method to successively refine the node embeddings from the top-level graph back to the original graph, obtaining node embeddings on the original graph. Experimental results on three public heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the enhanced scalability of representation learning methods by the proposed Restage. On another large-scale graph, the speed of existing representation learning methods is increased by up to eighteen times at most.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2023.9010147","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:1876001,61602003,61673020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10676347","heterogeneous graph;graph embedding;relation structure;hierarchical","Representation learning;Scalability;Computational modeling;Merging;Data models;Topology","","","","44","","11 Sep 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To overcome the limitations imposed by cables, a retinal implant architecture in which near-infrared illumination carries both power and data through the pupil to a digital stimulation controller is presented. A high efficiency multi-junction photovoltaic cell transduces the optical power to a CMOS stimulator capable of delivering flexible interleaved sequential stimulation through a diamond microelectrode array. To demonstrate the capacity to elicit a neural response with this approach while complying with the optical irradiance limit at the pupil, fluorescence imaging with a calcium indicator is used on a degenerate rat retina. The power delivered by the laser at the permissible irradiance of 4 mW/mm2 at 850 nm is shown to be sufficient to both power the stimulator ASIC and elicit a response in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), with the ability to generate of up to 35 000 pulses per second at the average stimulation threshold.

These systems were evaluated across accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall using the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), time-domain features, etc. The aforementioned gave adequate results over the dataset of voice recordings of the vowel that either have a balanced dataset across all the classes or multiple voice pathologies are selected to bring the balance in the dataset equal to healthy subjects. In real-world scenarios, anticipating imbalance and a small amount of data is often associated with voice disorders. Vocal Cord Paralysis is one such voice pathology with limited data. In this paper, the proposed stacked ensemble model, InceptionV3-EfficientNetB0-ViT-B/16, is employed to classify Vocal Cord Paralysis (VCP) and healthy subjects over an imbalanced dataset in hand using spectrograms as a feature. Voice samples from the Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD) for healthy and VCP are selected of the vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ over neutral, high, low, and low-high-low pitch conditions and the phrase. Further, using the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), the voice samples are preprocessed, and each sample is augmented at various frequencies. The results from the experiments express that the proposed stacked model achieved an excellent accuracy of 94.11% for the vowel /a/ at normal and low-high-low pitch conditions using an imbalanced dataset. In addition, the proposed model’s robustness and trustworthiness are proven by the False Discovery Rate of 0.07142, Cohen Kappa of 0.82105, Mathew’s Correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.83452, and F1-score 0.91005. The vowels /i/ and /u/, were also evaluated over the proposed model, and 88.23% accuracy is procured over most pitch conditions for the vowels and 90% for the phrase. Overall, the proposed method exhibited a powerful and successful capability for diagnosis throughout an unbalanced dataset without overtly favoring the majority class of healthy individuals and maintained an adequate balance in precisely recognizing the minority class VCP.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824769","Deep Learning;Healthcare;Imbalanced Data;Spectrograms;Stacked Generalization;Transfer Learning;Vision Transformers;Vocal Cord Paralysis;Voice Pathology","","","","","","CCBYNCND","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These algorithms must ensure proper synchronization even in the case of disturbances such as voltage-sags and phase-jumps, which are common in high-voltage and low-voltage ride-through applications. Therefore, the development of robust synchronization algorithms in these situations is of interest. In this article, a nonlinear synchronization algorithm suitable for application in grid-following inverters operating under fault ride-through conditions is proposed. This algorithm is called multilevel limit cycle oscillator frequency-locked loop (MLCO-FLL), and it is used as a prefilter for a synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL). This algorithm is robust against phase-jumps and variations in the voltage, both representing important features for fault ride-through applications. Also, it automatically detects the operation at different voltage levels without state machines or logic conditions. These features might be of interest in other research fields, where the detection of orbits is important. A comparison with other linear and nonlinear synchronization algorithms showed that MLCO-FLL features important advances. Moreover, in future, it is possible to improve its performance once its characteristics and parameters are examined in detail.

In spite of global efforts like the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to limit the increase in global temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, projections indicate that this threshold will likely be exceeded, causing severe climatic disruptions, that will affect vulnerable regions and populations, altering weather patterns and compromising food security, water resources, and economic stability. This study integrates a data-driven downscaling system within an emission control framework aimed at controlling temperature anomalies by reducing CO2 emissions and evaluating its impact on cereal production in North Africa. The approach employs a simplified autoregressive model with exogenous input (ARX) for downscaling. During the validation phase, the ARX models show strong agreement with data, effectively reproducing global temperatures (correlation close to 1 and a normalized mean absolute error around 0.02) and local temperature (correlation of 0.75 and a normalized mean absolute error of 0.2). Moreover, an ARX model is also used to establish links between cereal production, global and regional temperature anomalies and CO2 emissions. This model demonstrates reasonably good agreement with the data, achieving a correlation of 0.72 and a normalized mean absolute error of 0.18. Once validated, the models are integrated into a decision support system based on model predictive control aimed to balance global and regional climate objectives with economic considerations. North Africa is an ideal case study since it is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, despite contributing only 1.76% of global carbon emissions in 2022. The region faces significant risks from increased aridity and heat, threatening agriculture, ecosystems, and socio-economic stability. The results of this research highlight the urgent need for environmental and climate-resilient measures to achieve sustainable development and enhance resilience against climate impacts.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820341","data-driven modelling;climate change;optimization;socio-economic stability","Climate change;Data models;Optimization;Socioeconomics;Greenhouse gases;Global warming;Weather forecasting;Globalization;Food security;Temperature measurement;Water resources;Sustainable development;Food manufacturing","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, extending the converter operation in the overmodulation zone (OMZ) remains a problem. A key limitation of existing control methods in the OMZ is using the duty cycles calculated for the LMZ without considering the voltage or current reference vectors. This approach can lead to inaccurate calculations and a slower transient response when switching between the two operational zones. To overcome this challenge, a novel reference vector calculation method is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach simplifies the duty cycle calculation and ensures optimal performance in the OMZ by introducing new vector calculations and dividing the OMZ into two subzones.

The ZnO nanowires, with their high surface area, act as an efficient gas adsorption layer. The resonator’s driving mechanism was optimized using finite element method (FEM) simulations, revealing that a coupled resonator pair exhibited 45.52 times higher sensitivity than a single resonator. Out-of-phase modes showed greater sensitivity than in-phase modes. Resonators R1 and R2 driven together had the lowest sensitivity, while Resonator 1, with a zinc oxide layer and driven individually, demonstrated the highest sensitivity. Additionally, the sensitivity of the coupled resonator increased with the decrease in dc bias voltage. Comprehensive materials characterization of the ZnO nanowires was conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm their structural and chemical properties. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results showed that after ammonia adsorption, ZnO nanowires exhibited additional absorption bands at approximately 1430 cm $^{-{1}}$ , 1633 cm $^{-{1}}$ , and within the broad range of 3100 to 3550 cm $^{-{1}}$ . The sensor’s gas-sensing performance was evaluated with varying ammonia concentrations, achieving a very high sensitivity of 0.0026 ppm $^{-{1}}$  in the 25–100 ppm range at room temperature.

With the characteristics of low storage and high efficiency, deep hashing algorithms have been widely used in image retrieval. However, with the crazy growth of the number of remote sensing images, effective retrieval and management of these massive data has become an urgent issue to be addressed. At present, many retrieval methods mainly extract the global features of images, which cannot distinguish images with different visual representations but similar semantic information effectively. To solve this problem, we propose a deep orthogonal fusion method based on global and local feature fusion called DOFSH. First, by designing an effective local feature extraction module, the remote sensing image retrieval system can better adapt to complex ground objects and background scenarios, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of retrieval. Second, by designing a satisfactory local and global fusion scheme, these two features are integrated into a compact descriptor to achieve single-stage remote sensing image retrieval. Finally, to solve the problem that the uncontrollable distribution of remote sensing image dataset is incompatible with contrast loss, a loss function is designed to adapt to the characteristics of remote sensing image dataset. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of retrieval performance on the NWPU-RESISC45, AID, and AISION remote sensing image datasets.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3511256","Ph.D. Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Sanya Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City(grant numbers:HSPHDSRF-2023-03-002); NSFC(grant numbers:62101393); Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:624MS035); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022ZD0160604); NSFC(grant numbers:62176194); Key Research and Development Program of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2023BAB083); Project of Sanya Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City(grant numbers:SCKJ-JYRC-2022-76,SKJC-2022-PTDX-031); Project of Sanya Science and Education Innovation Park of Wuhan University of Technology(grant numbers:2021KF0031); Hainan Provinces “Nanhai New Star” Technology Innovation Talent Platform Project(grant numbers:NHXXRCXM202361); Youth Fund Project of Hainan Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:6220N344); Sanya Science and Education Innovation Park of Wuhan University of Technology(grant numbers:2022KF0020); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(grant numbers:cstc2021jcyj-msxmX1148); MindSpore; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271484); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61925112); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2023-YBGY225); High performance Computing Platform of YZBSTCACC; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10777395","Image retrieval;local features;orthogonal fusion;remote sensing","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Sensors;Image retrieval;Semantics;Manuals;Convolutional neural networks;Transformers;Technological innovation;Quantization (signal)","","","","67","CCBY","4 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compensatory strategies like tenodesis grasp, whereby wrist extension passively closes the fingers, remain; this is effective for small and light objects but insufficient for heavier ones. Typically, wearable assistive exoskeletons are designed to actuate a person’s fingers, however, such devices are sensitive to anatomical variability, such as hand size and joint contractures. The Dorsal Grasper is a wearable device designed to address this challenge by leveraging voluntary wrist extension and providing human-robot collaborative grasping capabilities with underactuated supernumerary fingers on the back of the hand. In this study, we introduce kinematic assessment methods that we use to show how the Dorsal Grasper expands the graspable workspace and reduces trunk motion, especially in situations where the use of a wheelchair restricts the individual’s posture.

To alleviate adverse environmental impacts, such as fog, and enhance the precision and robustness of the model, this study introduces an improved dark channel prior (DCP) dehazing algorithm and proposes the TDR-Model based on the MobileNetV3. Employing the quad-tree spatial hierarchy search strategy, guided filtering, tolerance mechansim, and multi-scale color restoration (MSRCR) algorithm, an innovative improved version of DCP dehazing algorithm is realized. Image preprocessing with the improved DCP dehazing algorithm obtains more authentic dehazed images. Moreover, MobileNetV3 is improved by the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and Omni-Dimensional Dynamic Convolution(ODC), improving the accuracy of disease feature recognition. The experiment results demonstrate that, with the parameter size remaining nearly unchanged (a slight reduction of 0.04M), an increase of 16.88% is achieved in accuracy compared to the original version for foggy images.

Here, we present a rigorous model to explain for the first time the origin of these peaks. In particular, the frequencies of the spectral RIN peaks are analytically described as the result of the non-trivial interaction among transverse modes by addressing the laser dynamics and the related noise features through a time-domain mode expansion approach, accounting for coherent effects in multimode competition, spatial hole burning, and carrier diffusion. The laser modulation performance is addressed through dynamical simulations with PAM2 and PAM4 modulations, which clearly demonstrate the potential for high-bitrate optical interconnects. Finally, we address the effect of the oxide aperture aspect ratio via electromagnetic simulations, demonstrating how the ellipticity affects the modal frequency detuning and the RIN, thus providing design guidelines for VCSELs with low RIN performance and outlining a clear roadmap for a substantially improved bandwidth-power trade-off in these devices.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2024.3446312","Research Contract(grant numbers:DM 1062/2021); Programma Operativo Nazionale; European Commission; Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan; Telecommunications of the Future(grant numbers:PE00000001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10640188","Coherent mode coupling;elliptical oxide aperture;frequency mixing;multimode VCSELs;relative intensity noise","Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Apertures;Laser modes;Optical receivers;Bandwidth;Optical variables measurement;Modulation","","","","25","CCBY","20 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of the existing methods are based on either the traditional neural network sequence model or graph neural network model that has become more popularity in recent years. Among these two types of models, the latter solve the former's problem of neglecting the correlation among news sentences. However, one layer of the graph neural network only considers the information of nodes directly connected to the current nodes and omits the important information carried by distant nodes. As such, this study proposes the Extendable-to-Global Heterogeneous Graph Attention network (namely EGHGAT) to manage heterogeneous graphs by cleverly extending local attention to global attention and addressing the drawback of local attention that can only collect information from directly connected nodes. The shortest distance matrix is computed among all nodes on the graph. Specifically, the shortest distance information is used to enable the current nodes to aggregate information from more distant nodes by considering the influence of different node types on the current nodes in the current network layer. This mechanism highlights the importance of directly or indirectly connected nodes and the effect of different node types on the current nodes, which can substantially enhance the performance of the model. Information from an external knowledge base is used to compare the contextual entity representation with the entity representation of the corresponding knowledge base to capture its consistency with news content. Experimental results from the benchmark dataset reveal that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach.

A typical approach to SED is to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a supervised manner such that the model predicts frame-wise event activities. Since the predicted activities often contain fine insertion and deletion errors due to their temporal fluctuations, post-processing has been applied to obtain more accurate onset and offset boundaries. Existing post-processing methods are, however, non-differentiable and prohibit end-to-end (E2E) training. In this paper, we propose an E2E detection method based on a probabilistic formulation of sound event sequences called a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). The HSMM is utilized to transform frame-wise features predicted by a DNN into posterior probabilities of sound events represented by their class labels and temporal boundaries. We jointly train the DNN and HSMM in a supervised E2E manner by maximizing the event-wise posterior probabilities of the HSMM. This objective is a differentiable function thanks to the forward-backward algorithm of the HSMM.

The feedforward control method based on disturbance estimated from the system model output and sensor output is currently a commonly used strategy for disturbance compensation due to its ability to directly counteract the disturbances. This disturbance feedforward compensation method behaves sensitively in case of model mismatch caused by internal disturbances, which may lead to a significant reduction in the disturbance compensation effect or even cause system instability. In this paper, unlike disturbance feedforward compensation, a pure disturbance sliding-mode feedback control (DSMFBC) based on disturbance observation without additional sensors is proposed, ensuring faster and precise compensation for disturbance. In case of model mismatch, the observed disturbance is used to build the disturbance feedback control to maintain a more efficient disturbance compensation through the robustness that feedback naturally possesses. To achieve a stronger anti-disturbance capability, a sliding-mode nonlinear control method is used to design the control law. The experimental setup of PTS based on the fast-steering mirror (FSM) demonstrates that the method has better dynamic performance and disturbance rejection ratio.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2024.3511573","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12403085); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20230423); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2023NSFSC1438); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10778198","Disturbance feedback control;disturbance rejection;model mismatch;photoelectric tracking system;sliding-mode","Feedback control;Feedforward systems;Accuracy;Charge coupled devices;Target tracking;Mirrors;Mathematical models;Robustness;Disturbance observers;Noise","","","","32","CCBY","4 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the VSC-based systems are first represented as admittance-based models in the Laplace domain, and then they are discretized and formulated to construct a Thévenin equivalent impedance matrix and history voltages that can be interfaced seamlessly with external systems in SV-based simulators. By replacing VSC subsystems with Thévenin equivalent circuits, the proposed DIBM technique significantly reduces the number of states and eliminates the need for fictitious snubbers that may be needed in SV-based EMT simulators for compatible interfacing. The effectiveness of the proposed DIBM approach over the conventional method that uses average value models of VSCs is demonstrated on a seven-bus VSC-based system in offline (MATLAB Simscape Electrical) and real-time (OPAL-RT) EMT simulators.

A common NP-hard problem in communication engineering is the Channel Assignment Problem (CAP) for wireless access points (APs), with a determined number of stations (STAs) connected to them. The performance of the complete network depends on the interference and noise among the different clusters of devices and the obstacles or elements placed in the physical transmission space. To address the CAP, a new environmentally adaptive approach is proposed for the Coral Reefs Optimization with Substrate Layers (CRO-SL) algorithm, introducing new environmental agents: algae (representing tabu positions) and ocean water acidification (lowering fitness thresholds). The Environmentally Adaptive CRO-SL (EnvAdapt-CRO-SL) implementation aims to improve solution exploration, enhancing computational efficacy in generating new candidate solutions within the coral reef population. An exhaustive comparative analysis of four configurations of the proposed EnvAdapt-CRO-SL variant assesses the impact of each environmental agent on the algorithm’s performance. Additionally, external benchmarks against four different metaheuristics, along with an analysis of the influence of pseudorandom number generators on initialization and search operators, and a robust optimization case study, provide deeper insights.

The core challenge addressed herein is the development of robust algorithms that enable the accurate identification of MI tasks, thereby empowering individuals with mobility impairments to control devices and interfaces through cognitive commands.

This research leverages the superlet transform (SLT) to transform EEG signals into a two-dimensional (2-D) high-resolution spectral representation. This 2-D representation of segmented MI-EEG signals is then processed through an adapted pretrained residual network, which classifies the MI-EEG signals. The effectiveness of the suggested technique is evident as the achieved classification accuracy is 99.9% for binary tasks and 96.4% for multi-class tasks, representing a significant advancement over existing methods.

In particular, in an abstract input–output setting, we show that $\varrho$-passivity is preserved under a class of interconnections, thereby extending the existing passivity results. Moreover, we explore the relationship between $\varrho$-passivity and stability, and we derive sufficient conditions for high-gain, low-gain, and causal stabilizability by static output feedback. Finally, in contrast to the standard passivity notion, we prove that $\varrho$-passivity is preserved under sampling for a class of nonlinear systems and discretization methods.

While binary classification methods have been commonly used for this purpose, recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements offer new opportunities for software teams to create more robust software. To address challenges in Software Defect Prediction (SDP), we conducted a thorough bibliographic survey of 79 research articles from the year 2011 to 2023 that examined previous models, datasets, data validation techniques, defect detection, prediction methods, and SDP tools. The survey revealed that previous research often lacked appropriate datasets with the necessary characteristics and data validation methods. Additionally, many standard datasets suffer from a lack of labels, which hinders effective defect detection. Systematic literature reviews on SDP are scarce, further emphasizing the importance of this study. Based on the findings, we provide crucial recommendations for designing effective SDP models and tools. The proposed survey outlines an architecture for constructing SDP datasets with the appropriate characteristics, as well as multi-label classification and data validation methodologies for software defects.

For example, when applied to drug discovery, one may want to optimize small molecules for higher affinity against a specific target, improved bioavailability, and solubility. However, many such existing models face challenges in producing molecules that not only possess the desired properties but can be synthesized in practice. On the other hand, there exist synthetic route decoding models that can decode a molecule’s synthetic route using known reactants and reaction templates and translate it into a synthesizable version of that molecule. However, these models may not be suitable for generating molecules with diverse optimized properties. In this paper, we aim to combine the strengths of the generative and synthetic route decoding models to overcome the shortcomings of the respective models when used separately. Specifically, we propose a practical framework for enhancing the synthesizability of property-optimized molecules suggested by VAE models by retraining the original baseline model with a constrained dataset curated using a synthetic route decoder. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply the framework to a hierarchical molecular generation model built on a VAE and show that the enhanced model can effectively produce diverse molecules with significantly improved synthesizability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817611","Generative molecular design (GMD);molecule optimization;synthesizability;variational autoencoder (VAE)","Optimization;Decoding;Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Chemicals;Translation;Solid modeling;Accuracy;Training;Hands","","","","42","CCBY","27 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Behavioral experiments showed that the number of hidden objects is underestimated in partially occluded scenes compared with an estimation based on the density of visible objects and the amount of occlusion. It is still unknown at which processing level this (under)estimation of the number of hidden objects occurs. We studied this question using a passive viewing task in which observers viewed a game board that was initially partially occluded and later was uncovered to reveal its hidden parts. We simultaneously measured the electroencephalographic responses to the partially occluded board presentation and its uncovering. We hypothesized that if the underestimation is a result of early sensory processing, it would be observed in the activities of P1 and N1, whereas if it is because of higher level processes such as expectancy, it would be reflected in P3 activities. Our data showed that P1 amplitude increased with numerosity in both occluded and uncovered states, indicating a link between P1 and simple stimulus features. The N1 amplitude was highest when both the initially visible and uncovered areas of the board were completely filled with game pieces, suggesting that the N1 component is sensitive to the overall Gestalt. Finally, we observed that P3 activity was reduced when the density of game pieces in the uncovered parts matched the initially visible parts, implying a relationship between the P3 component and expectation mismatch. Overall, our results suggest that inferences about the number of hidden items are reflected in high-level processing.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_02264","European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:101001250); The Adaptive Mind(grant numbers:Excellence Program of the Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Art); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824736","","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

To meet such demand, IoT and edge devices, which are small enough to be adopted in various environments while having sufficient computing capabilities, are being widely adopted. However, as devices are utilized in IoT and edge environments, which have harsh restrictions compared to traditional server environments, they are often limited by low computational and memory resources, in addition to the limited electrical power supply. This necessitates a unique approach for small IoT devices that are required to run complex tasks. In this paper, we propose a concurrent multi-frame processing scheme for real-time object detection algorithms. To do this, we first divide the video into individual frames and group the frames according to the number of cores in the device. Then, we allocate a group of frames per core to perform the object detection, resulting in parallel detection of multiple frames. We implement our scheme in YOLO (You Only Look Once), one of the most popular real-time object detection algorithms, on a state-of-the-art, resource-constrained IoT edge device, Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano, using real-world video and image datasets, including MS-COCO, ImageNet, PascalVOC, DOTA, animal videos, and car-traffic videos.

Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in classifying medical images by successfully detecting retinal disorders such as AMD. This paper addresses multiple shortcomings in conventional AMD diagnostic techniques by exploring the detection and explanation of various AMD subtypes from numerical features extracted with a ViT model from fundus images through cascaded artificial intelligence (AI) models using transformers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The data were preprocessed to recognize intricate disease-related patterns. The best test results using the cascade method for each model type show that the MLP model achieved an accuracy of 91.86% (with a sensitivity of 92.22% and a specificity of 95.74%). The Transformer model achieved its highest accuracy of 83.72% (with a sensitivity of 83.86% and a specificity of 89.74%). The CNN model demonstrated the best performance, with an accuracy of 94.19% (with a sensitivity of 93.84% and a specificity of 96.00%).

However, neural networks provide this performance at a higher computational cost and complexity, due to high-throughput traffic conditions necessitating specialized hardware for real-time operations. This paper presents lightweight models for encoding characteristics of Internet-of-Things (IoT) network packets; 1) we present two strategies to encode packets (regardless of their size, encryption, and protocol) to integer vectors: a shallow lightweight neural network and compression. With a public dataset containing about 8 million packets emitted by 22 IoT device types, we show the encoded packets can form complete (up to 80%) and homogeneous (up to 89%) clusters; 2) we demonstrate the efficacy of our generated encodings in the downstream classification task and quantify their computing costs. We train three multi-class models to predict the IoT class given network packets and show our models can achieve the same levels of accuracy (94%) as deep neural network embeddings but with computing costs up to 10 times lower; 3) we examine how the amount of packet data (headers and payload) can affect the prediction quality. We demonstrate how the choice of Internet Protocol (IP) payloads strikes a balance between prediction accuracy (99%) and cost. Along with the cost-efficacy of models, this capability can result in rapid and accurate predictions, meeting the requirements of network operators.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3517613","Commonwealth of Australia through the Defence Science and Technology Group, Department of Defence; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10802939","Feature engineering;packet embedding;network behavior characterization;IoT devices","Neural networks;Encoding;Accuracy;Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Costs;Machine learning;Data models;Feature extraction;Vectors","","","","42","CCBY","16 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, collecting these samples is challenging due to complex geological environments and inconvenient transportation conditions across large areas. To address this issue, a satellite sample simulation strategy was developed to transform ground-based local-area soil spectral samples into satellite-simulated spectral samples. Subsequently, a transfer learning (TL) approach was implemented to encode the spectra-SOM relationship learned from the satellite-simulated sample set into a basic neural network model. Finally, by fine-tuning this model with only a small number of satellite spectral samples, a robust SOM satellite mapping model was established. The results indicated that a total of 846 satellite-simulated spectral samples were generated, and the differences between the satellite-simulated spectral samples and the satellite spectral samples were minimized. The optimal TL-based SOM satellite mapping model (TL-half model) had an R2 of 0.90 and RPIQ of 4.02, representing a 12.50% improvement over the traditional SOM mapping model (R2 = 0.80; RPIQ = 3.10).

Our findings revealed that Yunnan experienced four drought events from 2011 to 2020, with the third and fourth drought events between 2019 and 2020 being particularly severe. The occurrence of these drought events was primarily attributed to a relative lack of precipitation. Among the components of TWS, water storage in groundwater, canopy, soil, and lake were identified as having the highest contribution rates to drought. We also applied random forest to simulate the contribution rates of each TWS component to drought in other regions of China. Our analysis confirmed that groundwater in the North China Plain, lake, and soil water in the Yangtze River middle-downstream Plain, snow, and groundwater in Tianshan Mountain were the components with the highest contribution rates to drought, respectively. Finally, we found that the contribution of TWS components to drought in different regions of Yunnan Province was significantly different. This novel method was valuable for hydrological drought management.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3507853","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42374008,41974012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10770157","Drought index;GRACE;hydrological drought;random forests (RFs);terrestrial water storage (TWS)","Droughts;Indexes;Data models;Precipitation;Radio frequency;Monitoring;Satellites;Water storage;Soil moisture;Rivers","","","","63","CCBY","27 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, these methods directly construct graphs on raw data, which may be easily affected by noises and then degrade the clustering performance, as the constructed topology is not credible for the training procedure. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called spatial-spectral adaptive graph convolutional subspace clustering (S2AGCSC).

Fusion and analysis of multivariate time series can help uncover their intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics, and contribute to the discovery of complex and subtle anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Multi-scale Convolution Fusion and Memory-augmented Adversarial AutoEncoder (MCFMAAE) for multivariate time series anomaly detection. It is an encoder-decoder-based framework with four main components. Multi-scale convolution fusion module fuses multi-sensor signals and captures various scales of temporal information. Self-attention-based encoder adopts the multi-head attention mechanism for sequence modeling to capture global context information. Memory module is introduced to explore the internal structure of normal samples, capturing it into the latent space, and thus remembering the typical pattern. Finally, the decoder is used to reconstruct the signals, and then a process is coming to calculate the anomaly score. Moreover, an additional discriminator is added to the model, which enhances the representation ability of autoencoder and avoids overfitting.

This paper reviews the key achievements leading to the first demonstration of a passively modelocked optically pumped thin-disk semiconductor laser, where both the saturable absorber and the gain quantum wells are integrated into a single semiconductor chip, known as the Modelocked Integrated eXternal-cavity Surface Emitting Laser (MIXSEL). This GaSb-based MIXSEL operates at a center wavelength of 2 $\rm \mu$m, supporting both single and dual-comb operations, with an average output power of 30 to 50 mW, pulse repetition rates of approximately 4 GHz, and picosecond pulse durations. It enables initial proof-of-principle dual-comb spectroscopy measurements. For this, we optimized continuous wave (cw) Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VECSEL) operation at 2 $\rm \mu$m without an intracavity heatspreader, enhanced group delay dispersion (GDD) compensation, and introduced an additional pump mirror integration. Compared to previous results, we achieved a significant performance increase with pump-DBR 2-$\rm \mu$m VECSEL with an average output power of 6 W, an optical pump efficiency of 30% and a reduced thermal resistance of 1.9 K/W. Additionally, the better GDD compensation improved modelocking at 2 $\rm \mu$m with a SESAM (Semiconductor Saturable Absorber Mirror), producing near-transform-limited femtosecond pulses with a duration of 331 fs, an average power of 30 mW at a pulse repetition rate of 2.77 GHz. Successful integration of the saturable absorber within the MIXSEL chip required matching of the cavity mode sizes on both the SESAM and the VECSEL chip.

While 2D image-based anomaly detection has been extensively explored, combining two-dimensional (2D) images with three-dimensional (3D) point clouds remains less studied. Existing multimodal methods often combine features from different modalities, leading to feature interference and degraded performance. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised industrial anomaly detection that leverages both visual and geometric information. Specifcally, we use pre-trained 2D and 3D models to extract visual features from color images and geometric features from 3D point clouds. Instead of directly fusing these features, we propose a geometric feature reconstruction network that predicts 3D geometric features from the 2D visual features. During training, we minimize the difference between the predicted geometric features and the extracted geometric features, enabling the model to learn how 2D appearance correlates with 3D structure in anomaly-free images. During inference, this learned relationship allows the model to detect anomalies: signifcant discrepancies between the reconstructed and actual geometric features indicate abnormal regions. Evaluated on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average image-level AUROC score of 0.968, surpassing previous approaches. Additionally, it provides fast inference at 8.2 frames per second with a memory footprint of only 1045 MB, making it highly effcient for industrial applications","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820339","Industrial anomaly detection;image-based anomaly detection;3D point clouds","Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Anomaly detection;Point cloud compression;Training;Solid modeling;Nearest neighbor methods;Transformers","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

FxDO-FxSMC is proposed to address the issues of finite time convergence and large initial conditions present in existing sliding mode controllers. FxDO-FxSMC uses an arbitrary sliding surface to stabilize the buck converter in the presence of both matched and mismatched disturbances while ensuring arbitrary fixed-time convergence. First, the buck converter’s modified state-space model, which contains both matched and mismatched disturbances, is defined. Secondly, an arbitrary fixed-time disturbance observer is designed to predict disturbances. Finally, an arbitrary FXSMC is constructed by defining the sliding surface with an arbitrary term and estimated mismatched disturbance. The FxDO-FxSMC method (i) tackles an arbitrary fixed time sliding surface for the buck converter with mismatched disturbance, a feature not achievable with the current finite/fixed time sliding mode control; (ii) allows the user to adjust the convergence time of the proposed method, regardless of the initial conditions; and (iii) concurrently mitigates chattering issues. Additionally, Lyapunov stability is carried out. To highlight the advantages of the proposed combined structure, it is compared with the classical SMC, integral SMC (ISMC), disturbance observer-based SMC (DO-SMC), and finitetime disturbance observer-based non-singular terminal SMC (FnDO-NTSMC). As a result of the simulation tests, the chattering rate value (CRV) has been enhanced by 36.19% according to FnDO-NTSMC, which provided the best response compared to other traditional techniques. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller effectively reduces overshoot, steady state error, and response time compared to traditional and other controllers. We evaluated system performance using dynamic response MSE, RMSE, and MAE for fair comparison. DO-SMC outperformed existing approaches in RMSE and MAE; however, the proposed controller improved 174.27% and 99.26%. The simulation results prove that the proposed controller design exhibits more rapid convergence and dynamic response to disturbances, regardless of initial conditions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820343","Arbitrary convergence time;arbitrary time stability;buck converter;fixed-time disturbance observer;fixed-time sliding mode control;matched-mismatched disturbance;nonlinear control","Convergence;Buck converters;Sliding mode control;Voltage control;Voltage fluctuations;Uncertainty;Robustness;Fluctuations;Dynamic response;Voltage measurement","","","","","CCBYNCND","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, to address this issue, we propose SCA-CVENet, which is an efficient spatial-channel-attention collaborative cost volume enhancement network for high-quality depth map reconstruction. The main contributions of SCA-CVENet are the channel attention weight (CAW)-based cost volume enhancement module that can effectively filter the redundant channel information of the feature volumes to boost the feature representation of the cost volumes, and the spatial attention weight (SAW)-based cost volume enhancement module that can significantly improve the robustness of the cost volumes in textureless and repetitive texture areas, to produce more accurate and complete depth map reconstruction results. First, a weight-sharing hierarchical feature extraction subnetwork is adopted to extract robust multi-scale feature maps. Second, the SAW generation subnetwork is adopted, which incorporates the group-wise correlation (GWC)-based cost volume adaptive fusion module and 3D hourglass module to produce an accurate SAW. Finally, the coarse-to-fine cascade depth prediction subnetwork incorporates the CAW- and SAW-based cost volume enhancement modules into the cascade network architecture to predict a high-quality depth map. Three publicly available benchmark datasets—the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Tanks & Temples datasets—were utilized to validate the performance of SCA-CVENet, and the comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that SCA-CVENet obtains a superior performance on all the datasets in terms of accuracy and completeness.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525302","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:No.42001417); the Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:No. KJQN202300647); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820522","Depth prediction;multi-view depth map reconstruction;channel attention weight (CAW);spatial attention weight (SAW);cascade network architecture","Costs;Image reconstruction;Accuracy;Three-dimensional displays;Reconstruction algorithms;Robustness;Information filters;Memory management;Feature extraction;Collaboration","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, most of these methods often focus on local spatial-spectral information but ignore the high-order correlations contained in multitemporal HSIs. To address this issue, this article proposes a hypergraph self-supervised learning (HG-SSL) based joint spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation algorithm (HyperSST) for downstream HSI-CD. Inspired by the process of human brain perception, HyperSST uniformly models the spectral-spatial-temporal correlations in the form of high-order interactions and skillfully exploits the vertex-level, hyperedge-level, and vertex/hyperedge-level inherent structures within the unlabeled multitemporal HSIs. Specifically, two types of hyperedges, spectral-spatial correlation hyperedge and temporal correlation hyperedge, are first formulated to fully exploit the high-order spectral, spatial, and temporal interactions contained in bitemporal images. Second, two SSL strategies namely contrastive spectral-spatial features learning and generative temporal features learning are skillfully designed to exploit the inherent characteristics of hypergraph models and extract discriminative latent feature representations for downstream tasks. The former captures changes in both attribute space and structure space, while the latter apprehends the changes in temporal space. Third, the learned joint spectral-spatial-temporal features provide a comprehensive representation to qualify the changes between multitemporal images. Extensive experiments on four challenging HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3483560","Foundation Program of the Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Complex Electronic System Simulation(grant numbers:614201001032203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10723090","Contrastive learning;generative learning;hypergraph model;hyperspectral image change detection (HSI-CD);self-supervised learning (SSL);spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation","Feature extraction;Correlation;Transformers;Data models;Mathematical models;Contrastive learning;Representation learning;Principal component analysis;Manuals;Image reconstruction","","","","66","CCBYNCND","18 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, analytical expressions are derived to characterize the FL convergence rate, accounting for key features from both communication and algorithmic aspects, including transmission reliability, scheduling policies, and momentum method. First, the analysis reveals that either delicately designed user scheduling policies or expanding higher bandwidth to accommodate more clients in each communication round can expedite model training in networks with reliable connections. However, these methods become ineffective when the connection is erratic.

To address these challenges, we propose an advanced high-resolution image segmentation network, high-resolution network, integrated with a shadow-inclusive edge perception module. Our approach involves introducing a shadow-inclusive contour transition module (SCTM) during the feature extraction stage to enhance the features of blurry boundaries. The proposed SCTM and shadow-aware attention module significantly enhance attention maps, improve responses in blurry boundary regions, and increase consistency between predictions and ground truth, setting a new benchmark for building semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery. This enriched information is then fed into an attention module that concurrently focuses on boundary and channel features, surpassing traditional semantic segmentation methods.

One emerging trend in cancer treatment is the utilization of Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs), facilitated by nanotechnology. Nanoparticles, ranging from 1 nm to 1000 nm, act as carriers for chemotherapeutic agents, enabling precise drug delivery. The triggered release of these agents is vital for advancing this novel drug delivery system. Our research investigated this multifaceted delivery capability using liposomes and metal organic frameworks as nanocarriers and utilizing all three targeting techniques: passive, active, and triggered. Liposomes are modified using targeting ligands to render them more targeted toward certain cancers. Moieties are conjugated to the surfaces of these nanocarriers to allow for their binding to receptors overexpressed on cancer cells, thus increasing the accumulation of the agent at the tumor site. A novel class of nanocarriers, namely metal organic frameworks, has emerged, showing promise in cancer treatment. Triggering techniques (both intrinsic and extrinsic) can be used to release therapeutic agents from nanoparticles, thus enhancing the efficacy of drug delivery. In this study, we develop a predictive model combining experimental measurements with deep learning techniques. The model accurately predicts drug release from liposomes and MOFs under various conditions, including low- and high-frequency ultrasound (extrinsic triggering), microwave exposure (extrinsic triggering), ultraviolet light exposure (extrinsic triggering), and different pH levels (intrinsic triggering). The deep learning-based predictions significantly outperform linear predictions, proving the utility of advanced computational methods in drug delivery.

Traditional methods require a long time to evaluate and rely heavily on human experience. Therefore, based on the key factors affecting landslides, this paper designs a geological disaster prediction model based on Monte Carlo neural network (MCNN). Firstly, based on the weights of evidence method, a correlation analysis was conducted on common factors affecting landslides, and several key factors that have the greatest impact on landslide disasters, including geological lithology, slope gradient, slope type, and rainfall, were identified. Then, based on the monitoring data of Lanzhou City, 18 367 data records were collected and collated to form a dataset. Subsequently, these multiple key influencing factors were used as inputs to train and test the landslide disaster prediction model based on MCNN. After determining the hyperparameters of the model, the training and prediction capabilities of the model were evaluated. Through comparison with several other artificial intelligence models, it was found that the prediction accuracy of the model studied in this paper reached 89%, and the Macro-Precision, Macro-Recall, and Macro-F1 indicators were also higher than other models. The area under curve (AUC) index reached 0.8755, higher than the AUC value based on a single influencing factor in traditional methods.

Traditional assessments of muscle fatigue are primarily constrained by their dependence on maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs), which not only rely heavily on participant motivation, reducing measurement accuracy, but also require large, stationary equipment such as isokinetic dynamometers, limiting their application to discrete assessments in lab-based environments. In this work, we introduce a wearable muscle fatigue tracking strategy that employs low-profile single-element ultrasound and electrical stimulation. This integrated approach demonstrates that muscle deformation from electrically-induced muscle contractions correlates with muscle fatigue, thus circumventing the need for bulky hardware and eliminating the variability associated with human volition. We define a deformation index, which fuses stimulation-induced changes in muscle thickness with baseline muscle swelling to track muscle fatigue. Our results demonstrate that the deformation index reliably tracks muscle fatigue ( ${r} = 0.85~\pm ~0.15$ ), under specific conditions, namely extended joint angles and increased stimulation, as measured by changes in knee extension torque during a series of dynamic, volitional fatiguing contractions on 8 subjects on an isokinetic dynamometer. This approach has the potential to enable real-time, semi-continuous muscle fatigue monitoring in unconstrained environments.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3511267","Harvard Move Laboratory and in part by the Harvard John A.

The increasing reliance on mobile devices significantly raises the risk of malware attacks, especially for non-technical users who often grant permissions without thorough evaluation, leading to potentially devastating effects. This paper introduces PermGuard, a scalable framework for Android malware detection that maps permissions into exploitation techniques and employs incremental learning to detect malicious apps. It presents a novel technique for constructing the PermGuard dataset by mapping Android permissions to exploitation techniques, providing a comprehensive understanding of how permissions can be misused by malware. The dataset consists of 55,911 benign and 55,911 malware apps, providing a balanced and comprehensive foundation for analysis. Additionally, a new strategy using similarity-based selective training reduces the amount of data required for the training of an incremental learning-based model, focusing on the most relevant data to improve efficiency. To ensure robustness and accuracy, the model adopts a test-then-train approach, initially testing on application data to identify weaknesses and refine the training process. The framework’s resilience is tested against adversarial attacks, demonstrating its ability to withstand attempts to bypass or deceive detection mechanisms and enhance overall security. Designed for scalability, PermGuard can handle large and continuously growing datasets, making it suitable for real-world applications. Empirical results indicate that the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9933 on real datasets and 0.9828 on synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong resilience against both real and adversarial attacks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523629","Researchers Supporting Project, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(grant numbers:RSPD2025R846); Open Access funding was provided by Qatar National Library; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817609","Android malware detection;machine learning;permissions exploitation;cybersecurity;mobile security","Malware;Operating systems;Security;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Internet;Training;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","","","","57","CCBY","27 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is still a challenge in improving SCD performance, specifically in designing a fine-grained network structure that can handle the two subtasks of change region localization and semantic information recognition in parallel. In this context, a novel multitask Siamese network, termed EGMS-Net, is proposed to boost the performance of SCD, which consists of three core components. First, a coarse-to-fine multitask Siamese network is constructed to obtain semantic information and change information at multiple levels. Second, an adaptive change information enhancement method based on spatial-spectral collaborative attention mechanism is proposed, which can assist the accurate localization of change regions without significantly increasing the model parameters.

Although deep learning has significantly advanced the field of accurate and efficient automatic brain tumor segmentation, several challenges still persist. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture called the Dual Encoder Mirror Difference Residual U-Net (DEMD-ResUNet). This approach incorporates dual encoders that process both the original and horizontally flipped images. Additionally, residual blocks are employed to substitute the original convolutional blocks in the encoder section of the U-Net structure. This modification not only streamlines network training but also mitigates issues related to network degradation and the loss of detailed information. To further enhance feature representation, we propose a Multimodal Difference Feature Augmentation (MDFA) module, which effectively highlights abnormal regions in both the original and mirrored brain tumor images to facilitate better feature discrimination. Moreover, a Mirror Difference Feature Fusion (MDFF) module is integrated between the dual encoders and the decoder. This module efficiently transfers features from both the original and mirrored images to the decoder, leveraging the symmetrical information inherent in the images and subsequently boosting the segmentation performance of the model. Ablation experiments conducted on the DEMD-ResUNet model demonstrate the efficacy of its various modules and hyperparameter settings. When evaluated on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2019 datasets, our model achieves impressive Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) values of 0.862, 0.925, and 0.905 for Enhanced tumor (ET), Whole tumor (WT), and Tumor core (TC) in the former, and 0.869, 0.922, and 0.916 in the latter, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3522682","Hainan Province Natural Science Foundation for Youths(grant numbers:823QN258); Hainan Province Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:620QN282,621MS054); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62062005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10815934","Multimodal MRI;brain tumor segmentation;mirror difference;residual U-Net","Image segmentation;Brain tumors;Tumors;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain modeling;Mirrors;Decoding;Deep learning","","","","54","CCBY","26 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard to diagnose screw loosening. Disadvantages of CT include low sensitivity and specificity for the detection of loosened screws as well as the need for radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to provide a proof of concept of a novel, non-invasive, inductive sensing device for transcutaneous detection of screw loosening using a pulse induction metal detector. Materials/Methods: Two fresh frozen human cadavers were initially instrumented in the lumbar spinal region (L1 to L5). After assessment of the sensing device behavior using a wooden beam and 3D printed place holders of predefined distances, the ability of implant detection and screw stability determination were assessed during two experiments. Pedicle screw loosening was induced using 3D printed drill/loosening guides during the instrumentation of the lumbar spine. Screw stability was determined by applying weight to the spinous processes of interest and measuring the relative movement of the pedicle screw using the inductive sensor coil. Results: The sensitivity of our detection coil for an implant movement measurement showed to be high at close distances (60mV voltage change per mm movement), with signal amplitude vanishing at sensing distances of 50mm or greater. Signal amplitude significantly (p < .05) differed with the number of instrumented levels. When differentiating between instrumentation with and without loosened screws, significant (p < .05) mean differences were found in half of all comparative cases. All these differences were smaller than the predefined signal voltage threshold of (60 mV/mm). Discussion/Conclusion: In this study, the feasibility of a new, inductive and non-invasive sensor concept was tested. While the basic principle of the approach is promising, our implementation was not successful in demonstrating sufficient sensitivity for the required detectability. It appears conceivable that the concept can be successfully implemented with more sensitive sensors and more complex evaluation methods.","2644-1276","","10.1109/OJEMB.2024.3482878","Innosuisse – Swiss Innovation Agency(grant numbers:102.528 IP-LS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10720821","Inductive sensing;lumbar spine;lumbar fusion;pedicle screw loosening;pulse induction","Fasteners;Sensors;Metals;Detectors;Coils;Spine;Sensor fusion;Sensitivity;Three-dimensional displays;Voltage measurement","","","","13","CCBY","17 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate acquisition and monitoring of SWC information is crucial for water-saving agriculture and soil protection. Optical remote sensing technology has the advantages of high efficiency, continuity, noncontact, and wide regional coverage, which is one of the most commonly used SWC estimating methods. First, this work studies the best modeling band and puts forward the band that is sensitive to SWC but insensitive to the illumination and view angle as the modeling band. Then, the process of the internal reflection of incident radiation caused by the water layer around soil particles is added to improve the SWAP-Hapke model. This work innovatively proposed using absorbance instead of reflectance to select the modeling band and establish an improved SWAP-Hapke model. In addition, a complete multiangle and multi-SWC gradient dataset is used to improve the estimation accuracy of model parameters. Finally, the multiangle retrieval accuracy of the improved SWAP-Hapke model was evaluated. The results show that the improved SWAP-Hapke model based on absorbance has obviously higher retrieval accuracy in different view and illumination directions, and its accuracy is less affected by the illumination and view geometry. The average R2 of the improved SWAP-Hapke model established by using reflectance and absorbance can reach 0.89 and 0.92, and the average of the root-mean-square error is 4% and 2.4%.

Despite substantial research on social media use during crises, a significant gap remains in detecting crisis-related misinformation. Detecting deviations in information is fundamental for identifying and curbing the spread of misinformation. This study introduces a novel Information Switching Pattern Model to identify dynamic shifts in perspectives among users who mention each other in crisisrelated narratives on social media. These shifts serve as evidence of crisis misinformation affecting user-mention network interactions. The study utilizes advanced natural language processing, network science, and census data to analyze geotagged tweets related to compound disaster events in Oklahoma in 2022. The impact of misinformation is revealed by distinct engagement patterns among various user types, such as bots, private organizations, non-profits, government agencies, and news media throughout different disaster stages. These patterns show how different disasters influence public sentiment, highlight the heightened vulnerability of mobile home communities, and underscore the importance of education and transportation access in crisis response.

This study investigated the characteristics of PD signals, including electricity, sound, and pressure, during arc discharge through transformer arc discharge experiments. During the experiment, the ultra-high frequency (UHF) electromagnetic PD signal excited by arc discharge demonstrated good continuity, yet the amplitude of the pulse signal was low. The high-frequency current PD signal merely generates a pulse signal at the instant of arc initiation. The mediate-frequency current PD signal emerges in the form of periodic pulse signals. The amplitude of the low-frequency current PD signal is the highest and shows a continuous periodic pattern. Additionally, arc discharge leads to rapid pressure variations accompanied by audible and ultrasonic signals.

However, the inherent characteristics of the shared wireless medium, such as fading, interference, and openness, pose significant challenges to achieving consensus within these networks, especially in the presence of malicious jamming attacks. To cope with the severe consensus problem, in this paper, we present a distributed jamming-resilient consensus algorithm for blockchain networks in wireless environments, where the adversary can jam the communication channel by injecting jamming signals. Based on a non-binary slight jamming model, we propose a distributed four-stage algorithm to achieve consensus in the wireless blockchain network, including leader election, leader broadcast, leader aggregation, and leader announcement stages. With high probability, we prove that our jamming-resilient algorithm can ensure the validity, agreement, termination, and total order properties of consensus with the time complexity of $O(n)$.

The use of deep learning (DL) models for segmentation in hyperspectral imagery offers advantages for remote sensing applications. In this work, we train and test 20 models for multiclass segmentation in hyperspectral imagery, selected for their potential in future space deployment. These models include 1-D and 2-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the latest vision transformers (ViTs). We propose a lightweight 1D-CNN model, 1D-Justo-LiuNet, which outperforms state-of-the-art models in the hypespectral domain. 1D-Justo-LiuNet exceeds the performance of 2D-CNN UNets and outperforms Apple's lightweight vision transformers designed for mobile inference. 1D-Justo-LiuNet achieves the highest accuracy (0.93) with the smallest model size (4563 parameters) among all tested models, while maintaining fast inference. Unlike 2D-CNNs and ViTs, which encode both spectral and spatial information, 1D-Justo-LiuNet focuses solely on the rich spectral features in hyperspectral data, benefitting from the high-dimensional feature space. Our findings are validated across various satellite datasets, with the HYPSO-1 mission serving as the primary case study for sea, land, and cloud segmentation. We further confirm our conclusions through generalization tests on other hyperspectral missions, such as NASA's EO-1.

Traditional unsupervised clustering methods often struggle with the complexity of these data due to limitations in scalability and generalization capabilities. In response, this paper proposes a new unsupervised learning approach called deep temporal joint clustering (DTJC) designed for efficient pixel-wise clustering of SITS data. DTJC optimizes the reconstruction of temporal information along with clustering objectives, which not only preserves the temporal dynamics of the original data but also creates a feature space conducive to clustering. Experimental results show that DTJC achieves optimal clustering performance across four publicly available multi-spectral SITS datasets, including TimeSen2Crop, Cerrado Biome, Reunion Island, and Imperial datasets. Compared to traditional K-means and projection algorithms, DTJC significantly improves clustering accuracy, especially in environments with complex geographical distributions. Leveraging the principles of the K-means clustering algorithm, DTJC showcases remarkable performance improvements over traditional optimized K-means and projection algorithms in land cover analysis, heralding a new era in the unsupervised learning landscape of SITS data. The DTJC method greatly enhances the efficiency of SITS data analysis without the need for labeled data, making it a powerful tool for automated land cover classification and environmental monitoring.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3502247","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3900503); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10758232","Clustering;deep learning;joint optimization;satellite image time series (SITS);unsupervised","Time series analysis;Land surface;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Satellite images;Image reconstruction;Crops;Accuracy;Grasslands;Training","","","","55","CCBYNCND","19 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Within the current density range of 0–30 A/cm2, a thicker QB layer leads to a higher internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for Micro-LEDs. Conversely, when the current density is in the range of 30–100 A/cm2, employing a thinner QB layer in the LED structure can yield higher IQE values.

Here, semi-active switching, which manipulates the piezoelectric charge, is executed to suppress vibration. State-dependent discontinuity of the semi-active input trajectory owing to the switching makes it challenging to formulate a prediction-based optimization strategy in conventional methods. Incorporating the dynamical model of disturbance is also crucial to compensate for those undesired effects effectively. The proposed GP-enhanced disturbance predictor, which combines the empirical model and GP regression, provides the disturbance trajectory over a finite time horizon. The empirical model approximates the periodic disturbance with known frequencies, while the GP regression model handles other unknown components, enabling the predictor to function under different conditions. Furthermore, the predicted disturbance trajectory is applied for control optimization, allowing the controller to determine the optimal control input trajectory that compensates for future disturbances. The proposed strategy employs the tree-based scheme to formulate a prediction and optimization algorithm that determines the optimal semi-active input trajectory. Further, it includes a statistically oriented switching criterion that reduces the computational costs by selecting the trajectory to be predicted. This criterion utilizes kernel density estimation to learn the probability density function of suppression performance, allowing the controller to adaptively select trajectories to predict online while not excluding promising ones. The effectiveness of the proposed statistically oriented predictive switching vibration control with tree-based formulation and optimization (S-PSTFO) strategy was validated through experiments, demonstrating superior suppression performance over the conventional method.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2024.3463333","Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (KAKENHI)(grant numbers:22H01675,23K22945); Grant-in-Aid for Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Fellows (KAKENHI)(grant numbers:20J11339); JSPS Core-to-Core Program, A.

It is important to promptly react to spill accidents for early detection and monitoring. Improving the effectiveness of monitoring techniques for oil spills helps mitigate their environmental damage to the ecosystem. In this work, we present a new edge-based approach for the accurate detection and thickness estimation (DATE) of thick oil slicks within the range of 1 to 10 mm. The DATE approach is based on U-net models that are designed to process multiple C- and X-band radar backscattering from drones under different ocean conditions. The models are trained on synthetically generated oil spill scenarios based on fluid-dynamic and Monte-Carlo simulations. Simulation results show a high probability of detection that exceeds 90% for all possible thicknesses even at low wind speeds, which is not the case when using state-of-the-art satellite-based synthetic aperture radar techniques whose performance significantly degrades at low wind speeds. For the thickness estimation, in terms of the IoU metric, our results significantly outperform state-of-the-art solutions by a factor of 2 under varying wind speeds between 2 and 8 m/s. Moreover, we implement the new models on a hardware compute platform to verify the feasibility of edge computing on platforms like drones for effective monitoring and tactical response. Implementation results show a maximum power consumption of 1 W that suits the limited power budget of a drone, and a short latency of less than 3 s to generate the DATE maps.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3472908","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(grant numbers:16KISK004 (Open6GHuB)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10704064","Edge computing;oil spill;radar backscattering;slick detection;thickness estimation;u-net model","Oils;Radar;Sea surface;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Backscatter;Monitoring;Estimation;Surface waves;Surface treatment","","","","65","CCBYNCND","2 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents a new approach in addressing this challenge by introducing a unique intrusion detection system. It utilizes a federal learning framework which employs Convolutional Neural Networks as well as Long-Term Short Memory. The goal of this hybrid methodology is to improve intrusion detection efficacy within the framework of federal learning for IoT while overcoming the drawbacks of current techniques. This approach is commonly employed for spatial extraction of features, permitted the model to detect patterns that may indicate possible attacks.

Existing security analyses of TLS 1.3 primarily focus on its handshake protocol which is indeed an authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol, and implicitly neglect the so-called subversion attacks (e.g., breaking TLS via Dual EC) in the real world. Reverse firewall (RF) is a prevalent approach to defend against subversion attack. To the best of our knowledge, the only two subversion-resilient AKE protocols with RFs are proposed by Dodis et al. (CRYPTO'16) and Bossuat et al. (ESORICS'20). The security of both protocols is proved under game-based model which is insufficient for the concurrent execution of multiple TLS instances in practice. In this paper, we propose $\mathsf {srTLS}$, a variant of the TLS 1.3 full one round-trip time (1-RTT) handshake protocol with RFs under the universally composable (UC) model. In particular, we first present the ideal functionality of unilateral AKE $\mathcal {F}_{\mathsf {uaKE}}$. Then, we use RFs with outer transparency to circumvent the difficulty in sanitizing the messages of handshake protocol, and prove that $\mathsf {srTLS}$ UC-realizes $\mathcal {F}_{\mathsf {uaKE}}$ in the presence of subversion attacks. Finally, we integrate $\mathsf {srTLS}$ and existing subversion-resilient AKE protocols into TLS 1.3.

This leads to a progressive deterioration in the voluntary mobility of the upper and lower extremities in ALS patients, which underscores the pressing need for an assistance system to facilitate communication and body movement without relying on neuromuscular function. In this paper, we developed a daily assistance system for ALS patients based on a wearable multimodal brain-computer interface (BCI) mouse. The system comprises two subsystems: a mouse system assisting the upper extremity and a wheelchair system based on the mouse system assisting the lower extremity. By wearing a BCI headband, ALS patients can control a computer cursor on the screen with slight head rotation and eye blinking, and further operate a computer and drive a wheelchair with specially designed graphical user interfaces (GUIs). We designed operating tasks that simulate daily needs and invited ALS patients to perform the tasks. In total, 15 patients with upper extremity limitations performed the mouse system task and 9 patients with lower extremity mobility issues performed the wheelchair system task. To our satisfaction, all the participants fully accomplished the tasks and average accuracies of 83.9% and 87.0% for the two tasks were achieved. Furthermore, workload evaluation using NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) revealed that the participants experienced a low workload when using the system.

The latter is a phenomenon that occurs in conjunction with seismic events of a magnitude generally higher than 5.5–6.0 and which affects loose sandy soils located below the water table level. The methodology consists of two steps: first the spatial distributions of soil liquefaction is estimated using a constant false alarm rate method applied to the SPAN metric, namely the total power associated with the measured polarimetric channels, which is ingested into a bitemporal approach to sort out dark areas not genuine. Second, the obtained masks are read in terms of the physical scattering mechanisms using a child parameter stemming from the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix—namely the degree of polarization. The latter is evaluated using the coseismic scenes and contrasted with the preseismic one to have rough information on the time-variability of the scattering mechanisms occurred in the area affected by soil liquefaction. Finally, the obtained maps are qualitatively contrasted against state-of-the-art optical and interferometric SAR methodologies.

Current methods leveraging OpenMP for algorithm-level parallelism struggle with the large swaths and data volumes of Sentinel-1, limiting efficiency for practical applications. To address these challenges, this study introduces a multisegment parallel coregistration method combining OpenMP and MPI. The geometric coregistration process uses OpenMP and MPI for algorithm-level and multitask parallelism, boosting efficiency. In the enhanced spectral diversity coregistration, slave images are segmented by temporal baseline, with the first image processed serially and others in parallel. Validation with 30 Sentinel-1 SAR images from Tianjin-Tangshan (plain) and Zhejiang (mountainous) regions demonstrates significant improvements. OpenMP achieves optimal efficiency with 10-12 parallel kernels, while the combined OpenMP-MPI method performs best with 16 tasks for geometric coregistration and 24 for enhanced spectral diversity coregistration. The proposed method improves processing speeds by 8.2 and 6.7 times in plain regions and achieves comparable gains in mountainous areas, surpassing OpenMP alone.

Firstly, adaptive MSB prediction is performed on the original image and cryptographic feedback secret sharing strategy encrypts the spliced pixels to spare embedding space. In the data hiding phase, each encrypted image is sent to a data hider to embed the secret information independently. When $r$ copies of the image carrying the secret text are collected, the original image can be recovered lossless and the secret information can be extracted. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed method in this paper has the diffusivity, reversibility, and separability. The last but the most important, it has higher embedding capacity. For $512 \times 515$ grayscale images, the average embedding rate reaches 4.7358 bits per pixel (bpp).

The need for cutting-edge protection schemes that can operate efficiently in such environments is paramount to maintaining system stability and avoiding potential damage. The main objective of this research is to design such protection and security schemes which detect, classify, and locate faults with high accuracy and rapidly with very low computational burden.

The UKF is employed for accurate state estimation of the current & voltage signal from faulty bus. While the PF is employed to calculate fault detection & classification indices named PF based residuals (PFBR) and PF-based Harmonic distortion (PFBHD) from UKF-estimated current signal. Then, the Fault section identification index named PF-computed reactive power (PFCRP) is generated from UKF estimated current & voltage signals.

The dwell scheduling algorithm is proposed to solve the above optimization problem, where several separation points are set on the timeline, so that each separator divides the scheduling interval into two sides. For the two sides, the dual-side time pointers are introduced, which move from the separator to both ends of the scheduling interval. The dwell tasks are analyzed in sequence at each analysis point based on their two-level synthetical priority. These tasks are then executed simultaneously by sharing the whole aperture under various constraints to accomplish multiple tasks concurrently.

As patterns in production network monitoring environments, which monitors and manages entire infrastructures of millions of device metrics over time, frequently exhibit more complex characteristics such as differences in temporal size or expected noise, these methods often remain insufficient for accurately tracking important behavioral patterns such as backup cycles or transcode sessions. This paper therefore proposes a feedback framework that allows a user to select additional motif ranges to be included or excluded from the model. The method uses a distance matrix of subsequences to extract common patterns from feedback samples and defines temporal rules on how these patterns are allowed to occur. The technique was tested on synthetic data as well as production network monitoring data and a publicly available human motion primitives dataset. The tests show that the recall score can be significantly improved with the proposed feedback system, increasing from 37% to 95% while also maintaining a perfect precision score. This is achieved by providing only one to three feedback samples as input.

We formulate a problem to maximize the overall network sum-rate by jointly optimizing transmit power, fronthaul capacity, beamforming vectors at RRHs, data compression, and STAR-RIS transmission-reflection coefficients. To address the nonconvexity of the resulting joint optimization problem, successive convexification along with alternating optimization technique are used to develop an iterative algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that our STAR-RIS-aided CRAN design surpasses conventional reflecting-only RIS aided CRAN by providing full-space coverage and thus offering more degrees-of-freedom compared to traditional RIS.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2024.3514217","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10787117","CRAN;energy splitting;massive MIMO;quantization;RIS;STAR-RIS","Wireless communication;Massive MIMO;Interference;Uplink;Throughput;Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces;Precoding;Optimization;Array signal processing;Reflection","","","","57","CCBY","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The EfficientNet architecture has gained attention for achieving high accuracy with moderate computational cost. This work introduces efficient balancing generative adversarial network (EffBaGAN), a generative network specifically designed for the classification of multispectral remote sensing images based on EfficientNet, addressing data scarcity and class imbalances while minimizing network complexity. EffBaGAN is built upon a balancing generative adversarial network (BAGAN) architecture, incorporating a custom EfficientNet-based discriminator and generator. In particular, for the discriminator we propose reduced EfficientNet discriminator, a reduced version of EfficientNet-B0 adapted to multispectral imagery. The generator, residual EfficientNet generator, includes a residual EfficientNet-based path, which enhances the quality of the generated synthetic samples. In addition, a superpixel-based sample extraction procedure is used to further reduce the computational cost of the method. Experiments were conducted on large, very high-resolution multispectral images of vegetation, demonstrating that EffBaGAN achieves higher accuracy than other advanced classification methods, including vision transformers and residual BAGAN, while maintaining a significantly lower computational cost. In fact, EffBaGAN is more than twice as fast as the residual BAGAN, making it an efficient solution for remote sensing image classification in data-scarce environments.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3510859","Agencia Estatal de Investigación, Government of Spain(grant numbers:PID2022–141623NB–I00,TED2021–130367B–I00,MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR; Consellería de Cultura, Educación, Formación Profesional e Universidades, Xunta de Galicia; Galician Research Center(grant numbers:ED431G-2023/04); Research Group(grant numbers:ED431C 2022/16); European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10777474","Balancing generative adversarial network (BAGAN);classification;data augmentation;EfficientNet;multispectral;residual generator;transformer;vegetation","Computer architecture;Computational efficiency;Generative adversarial networks;Convolution;Accuracy;Costs;Generators;Data augmentation;Feature extraction;Training","","","","63","CCBYNCND","4 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Satellite images have been extensively employed for S. alterniflora invasion monitoring; however, there are still several issues that need to be addressed. The spectral similarities between S. alterniflora and surrounding ground objects make it challenging for traditional classifiers to achieve satisfactory extraction accuracy. Since the phenological information and red-edge spectral differences have been considered as informative features for identifying S. alterniflora, current studies mainly used them separately as classification features and seldom considered the differences of red-edge information at different phenological periods. Therefore, we proposed a pixel-based phenological and red-edge feature composite method (PpRef-CM) for S. alterniflora extraction considering both phenological information and red-edge bands derived from Sentinel-2 time series based on the existing pixel-based phenological feature composite method (Ppf-CM). The proposed PpRef-CM and machine-learning algorithms were employed for S. alterniflora extraction in two typical mangrove forests along coastal China. Results indicated that red-edge information at different phenological periods is essential for detecting S. alterniflora. S. alterniflora extraction achieved the highest accuracy of 96.57% by using the eXtreme gradient boost algorithm when compared with other machine-learning algorithms. The PpRef-CM gave 2.72% and 2.61% more extraction accuracies of S. alterniflora than the Ppf-CM in two study sites, separately.

In 2021, China successfully launched the Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) polar orbit satellite. It carries the GNSS occultation sounder-II (GNOS-II) that can simultaneously receive reflected signals from the global positioning system, BeiDou, and Galileo constellations. Multiconstellation measurement significantly reduces the revisit time of the spaceborne GNSS-R data. This offers the possibility to study the sensitivity of the reflected signals from multi-GNSS constellations to surface parameters at global scale. The main objective of this article is to analyze the sensitivity of FY-3E GNOS-II surface reflectivity (SR) to soil moisture (SM), vegetation, and surface roughness for different GNSS constellations, and different incidence angles. FY-3E data from May 2023 to October 2023 were collected along with SM data from the soil moisture active passive (SMAP). The SMAP static auxiliary surface roughness parameter SMAP-h was also collected for subsequent comparisons. Furthermore, the effect of vegetation in the reflected signal was accounted for using the SM and ocean salinity INRA-CESBIO L-band vegetation optical depth. Afterward, for each GNSS constellation, the SR was binned as a function of SM, SMAP-h, and incidence angle. The results indicate that the sensitivity for the different GNSS constellations is consistent, showing similar behavior. Moreover, this study also reports for the first time the experimentally computed sensitivity of FY-3E SR to SM under different SMAP-h values. The sensitivity of GNOS-II SR to SM is in general agreement with the values in the previous studies, demonstrating the feasibility of using single-pass multi-GNSS constellation GNSS-R data to retrieve surface parameters, such as SM, with shorter revisit times. Furthermore, the results of this study re-emphasize the nonlinear sensitivity of SR to SM. As compared with higher SM, SR is more sensitive at lower SM. This highlights the shortcomings of using linear models to retrieve SM. Meanwhile, another important finding is that, for spaceborne GNSS-R data, SMAP-h may have underestimated the effective surface roughness.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3496313","China Scholarship Council; State Scholarship Fund(grant numbers:202306560073); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42074041); Shaanxi Province Science and Technology Innovation Team(grant numbers:2021TD-51); Innovation Team of Shaanxi Provincial Tri-Qin Scholars with Geoscience Big Data and Geohazard Prevention; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:CHD300102263715); Project “GENESIS: GNSS Environmental and Societal Missions – Subproject UPC,”(grant numbers:PID2021-126436OB-C21); Ministerio de Ciencia e Investigación; Una Manera de Hacer Europa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750334","Fengyun-3E (FY-3E);global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R);soil moisture (SM);surface reflectivity (SR);surface roughness;vegetation","Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Global Positioning System;Sea surface;Vegetation mapping;Global navigation satellite system;Soil moisture;Sensitivity;Land surface;Sea measurements","","","","68","CCBYNCND","11 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Edge servers can then combine received data blocks to reconstruct the file. While this method expedites the data distribution process, it presents potential drawbacks. It is sensitive to transmission delays and transmission failures caused by runtime exceptions like network fluctuations and server failures. This paper presents EdgeHydra, the first edge data distribution scheme that tackles this challenge through fault tolerance based on erasure coding. Under EdgeHydra, a file is encoded into data blocks and parity blocks for parallel transmission from the cloud to target edge servers. An edge server can reconstruct the file upon the receipt of a sufficient number of these blocks without having to wait for all the blocks in transmission. It also innovatively employs a leaderless block supplement mechanism to ensure the receipt of sufficient blocks for individual target edge servers.

While weather impact models for the distribution system have been widely developed during the past decade, transmission system impact models lagged behind because of the scarcity of data. This study demonstrates a weather impact model for predicting the probability of failure of transmission lines. It builds upon a recently developed model and focuses on reducing model bias, through multi-model integration, feature engineering, and the development of a storm index that leverages distribution system data to aid the prediction of transmission risk. We explored three methods for integrating machine learning with mechanistic models. They consist of: (a) creating a linear combination of the outputs of the two modeling approaches, (b) including fragility curves as additional inputs to machine learning models, and (c) developing a new machine learning model that uses the outputs of the weather-based machine learning model, fragility curve estimates, and wind data to make new predictions. Moreover, due to the limited number of historical failures in transmission networks, a storm index was developed leveraging a dataset of distribution outages to learn about storm behavior to improve model skills. In the current version of the model, we substantially reduced the overestimation in the sum of predicted values of transmission line probability of failure that was present in the previously published model by a factor of 10. This has led to a reduction of model bias from 3352% to 14.46–15.43%. The model with the integrated approach and storm index demonstrates substantial improvements in the estimation of the probability of failure of transmission lines and their ranking by risk level.

Due to its ability to effectively maintain the discriminability of extracted features, Trace Ratio Linear Discriminant Analysis (TR-LDA) has become the foundation for many feature selection algorithms. As is known, TR-LDA is a challenging problem to solve because of its trace-ratio form, and it also faces the scale invariance problem. These two drawbacks of TR-LDA significantly reduce the performance of feature selection algorithms based on it. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes the sparse LDA with constant between-class distance (SLDA-CBD) model to select relavant features. This model first transforms TR-LDA into a non-trace ratio problem with a constant between-class distance constraint, and then imposes row constraints on the projection matrix to implement feature selection. Since the SLDA-CBD model is rooted in TR-LDA, it ensures the discriminative performance of the selected features. The constant between-class distance constraint successfully avoids the scale invariance problem. Additionally, due to the non-trace ratio form of the SLDA-CBD model, it is easily solvable. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance compared to the baseline and six state-of-the-art relative methods, with improvements of over 1% on image datasets and over 2% on video datasets in most cases, while also demonstrating high stability, proving its effectiveness and advantage in practical applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3514612","Chinese Natural Science Foundation(CNSF)(grant numbers:61702165); National Social Science Funds of China (NSSFC)(grant numbers:23BKS169); Hebei Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(grant numbers:F2020111001); Scientific Research Project of Hengshui University(grant numbers:2023XJZX01); Special Project of Research Base for Intangible Cultural Heritage in Hebei Province(grant numbers:2023FYZX02); Open Foundation of Collaborative Innovation Center for Wetland Conservation and Green Department of Hebei Province(grant numbers:2023XTCX026); Project of Hebei Province Higher Educational Science and Technology Research(grant numbers:SQ2024144); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10788680","Feature selection;TR-LDA;sparse regression","Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Training;Filtering algorithms;Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Sparse matrices;Mathematical models;Vectors;Predictive models","","","","56","CCBYNCND","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, their extensive operational range, combined with thrust vectoring capabilities, presents complex control challenges due to nonaffine dynamics and the necessity to coordinate lift and thrust for controlling accelerations at varying airspeeds. Traditionally, these vehicles rely on switched logic controllers with two or more intermediate states to control transitions. In this study, we introduce an innovative, unified incremental nonlinear controller designed to seamlessly control an overactuated dual-axis tilting rotor quad-plane throughout its entire flight envelope. Our controller is based on an incremental nonlinear control allocation algorithm to simultaneously generate pitch and roll commands, along with physical actuator commands. The control allocation problem is solved using a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) iterative optimization algorithm making it well-suited for the nonlinear actuator effectiveness typical of thrust vectoring vehicles. The controller's design integrates desired roll and pitch angle inputs. These desired attitude angles are managed by the controller and then conveyed to the vehicle during slow airspeed phases, when the vehicle maintains its 6-degrees of freedom (6-DOF). As the airspeed increases, the controller seamlessly shifts its focus to generating attitude commands for lift production, consequently smoothly disregarding the desired roll and pitch angles. Furthermore, our controller integrates an angle of attack (AoA) protection logic to mitigate wing stalling risks during transitions. It also features a yaw rate reference model to enable coordinated turns and minimize side-slip. The effectiveness of our proposed control technique has been confirmed through comprehensive flight tests. These tests demonstrated the successful transition from hovering flight to forward flight, the attainment of vertical and lateral accelerations, and the ability to revert to hovering.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2024.3498372","European Regional Development Fund; Unmanned Valley Project(grant numbers:KvW-00168); South-Holland region; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10752979","Control allocation;fully actuated vehicles;hybrid UAV;incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI);nonlinear programming;quad-plane;quadratic programming;tilt rotor;uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV);vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL);weighted least squares","Rotors;Actuators;Resource management;Vectors;Attitude control;Vehicle dynamics;Heuristic algorithms;Autonomous aerial vehicles;6-DOF;Servomotors","","","","30","CCBY","14 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the DT systems simulate the operations of the physical systems in real-time based on the data collected from various sensors. To this end, a novel sensor data generation model based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) data is proposed to forecast the future operations of PV systems using DT systems. The proposed model utilizes a hybrid data-driven model structure combining supervised learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and unsupervised learning-based generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance both average and variance accuracy. Specifically, TransTimeGAN is proposed, which combines TimeGAN with Transformer to effectively capture 15-min variability. For practical applicability, the proposed model is trained and validated using data from a self-developed PV DT system. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the similarities between normalized real and generated data are compared using a range of error metrics and statistical metrics. For representative error metrics, the proposed model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 7.84e-3 and a dynamic time warping (DTW) score of 1.3769.

At present, reliable methods for inspecting crimped wire connectors are still primarily based on image recognition evaluations. To address this, we propose an Improved Lightweight Network based on YOLOv8 (ILN-YOLOv8) to achieve high-precision and high-efficiency detection of crimped wire connectors. Taking the original YOLOv8 model as a baseline, the new model enhances the ability to extract shallow features from small targets by increasing the P2 detection layer and improving the Feature Pyramid Network(FPN) and Path Aggregation Network(PAN) structures. Next, the improved Selective Boundary Aggregation(SBA) module replaces the Concat module in the Neck, enhancing the fusion of deep and shallow features. Additionally, the Efficient Local Attention(ELA) attention mechanism is introduced into the Cryptographic Service Provider(CSP) bottleneck with 2 convolutions(C2F) module in the Backbone, improving feature localization accuracy without increasing network complexity. The Minimum Point Distance based IoU(MPDIoU) loss function is used to calculate localization loss, improving detection accuracy while preventing gradient explosion. Finally, lightweighting of the ILN-YOLOv8 model is achieved using the slim-neck network, the backbone with Depthwise Separable Convolution (DWConv), and Lightweight Convolution (LightConv) modules. After pruning and knowledge distillation, the model’s complexity and computational load significantly decreased while accuracy improved, meeting the industry’s requirements for crimped wire connectors detection and achieves superior performance.

Our goal is to maximize the system sum rate (SSR) by mitigating inter-cluster and intra-cluster interference and to maximize system energy efficiency (SEE) by minimizing ABS power transmission while preserving the required minimum data rate. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex due to the joint optimization of ABS power transmission, ABS three-dimensional (3D) positions, IRS reflection angles (RAs), IRS reflection coefficients (RCs), and decoding order (DEO) among GUs. To tackle this problem, a meta-heuristic algorithm based on the modified gray wolf optimization (MGWO) and an alternation max/min technique based on the developed Block Coordinate Descent (DBCD) are proposed. In particular, the original optimization problem is divided into four sub-problems; the first three sub-problems (RS RAs, IRS RCs, and ABS 3D positions) are alternately addressed using the MGWO technique; and the fourth sub-problem (ABS power transmission) is addressed using the DBCD technique.

This work introduces an innovative method for dynamically estimating the states of tendon-actuated soft manipulators. Our technique merges the Geometric Variable-Strain (GVS) approach with a kinematic formula that links the length variation of tendons to the deformations of the manipulator and a nonlinear observer design based on state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE). In our methodology, the soft links are represented by Cosserat rods, and the robot's geometry is parameterized by the strain field along its length. Consequently, its infinite dimensions can be described by utilizing multiple degrees of freedom, depending on the required precision. This enables us to estimate the states (pose and velocity) of tendon-actuated soft manipulators solely based on tendon displacements and actuator forces. Through simulation, we demonstrate the convergence of our estimation method across various DoFs and actuator numbers, revealing a trade-off between the number of DoFs and required actuators for observing system states. Furthermore, we validate our approach with an experimental prototype of 25 cm in length, achieving an average tip position error during dynamic motion of 1.79 cm —less than 7${\%}$ of the overall body length.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2024.3511406","US Office of Naval Research Global(grant numbers:N62909-21-1-2033); Khalifa University(grant numbers:RIG-2023-048,RC1-2018-KUCARS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10777508","Dynamic estimation;soft robots;tendon-driven;actuation readings","Soft robotics;Shape;Strain;Mathematical models;Sensors;Robots;Tendons;Dynamics;Actuators;Manipulator dynamics","","","","33","CCBY","4 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

African languages belong mainly to the LRLs, and one of the major contributing factors to the performance gap is tokenization, which plays a crucial role in NLP performance in general. Many recent studies on African languages often rely on multilingual tokenizers or general-purpose tokenizers, which are not optimized for African languages. This may lead to suboptimal performance in downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we systematically analyze the performance of language-specific tokenizers for three African languages: Swahili, Hausa, and Yoruba. By experimental results on two classification tasks (i.e. sentiment classification and news classification), we found that the language-specific tokenizers for African languages consistently outperformed other monolingual tokenizers, with performance gaps of up to 5.43% in sentiment classification and 4.58% in news classification. We also found that multilingual tokenizers generally work well if they are trained in many African languages rather than global HRLs. For instance, African multilingual tokenizers outperformed global multilingual tokenizers by an average of 1.70% in sentiment classification and 1.41% in news classification. The largest observed improvement was 2.61% in news classification using Logistic Regression (LR). Based on the results, we suggest a method for choosing tokenizers when analyzing data or developing models for African languages.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3522285","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2022S1A5A2A03052880); Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:RS-2022-II220043); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10815724","Tokenizer;classification;African language;Swahili;Yoruba;Hausa","Tokenization;Multilingual;Natural language processing;Training;Vectors;Complexity theory;Vocabulary;Accuracy;Support vector machines;Standards","","","","38","CCBY","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our study proposes using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) combined with multiple machine learning models to assess the level of mental stress. Objective: The objective is to identify and quantify stress levels during 240 days confinement scenario. In this study, we utilize a diverse set of stress indicators including salivary alpha amylase (sAA) levels, reaction time (RT) to stimuli, accuracy of target detection, and power spectral density (PSD), in conjunction with functional connectivity networks (FCN). We estimate the PSD using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the FCN using partial directed coherence. Results: Our findings reveal several intriguing insights. The sAA levels increased from the first 30 days in confinement to the culmination of the lengthy 240-day mission, suggesting a cumulative impact of stress. Conversely, RT and the accuracy of target detection exhibit significant fluctuations over the course of the mission. The power spectral density shows a significant increase with time-in-mission across all participants in most of the frontal area. The FCN shows a significant decrease in most of the right frontal areas. Five different machine learning classifiers are employed to differentiate between two levels of stress resulting in impressive classification accuracy rates: 96.44% with-nearest neighbor (KNN), 95.52% with linear discriminant analysis (LDA), 88.71% with Naïve Bayes (NB), 87.41 with decision trees (DT) and 96.48% with Support Vector Machine (SVM).

To address the challenges posed by adversarial illumination conditions, the combination of thermal and visible images has demonstrated its advantages. However, existing fusion methods rely on the critical assumption that the RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) image pairs are fully overlapping. These assumptions often do not hold in real-world applications, where only partial overlap between images can occur due to sensors configuration. Moreover, sensor failure can cause loss of information in one modality. In this letter, we propose a novel module called the Hybrid Attention (HA) mechanism as our main contribution to mitigate performance degradation caused by partial overlap and sensor failure, i.e. when at least part of the scene is acquired by only one sensor. We propose an improved RGB-T fusion algorithm, robust against partial overlap and sensor failure encountered during inference in real-world applications. We also leverage a mobile-friendly backbone to cope with resource constraints in embedded systems. We conducted experiments by simulating various partial overlap and sensor failure scenarios to evaluate the performance of our proposed method.

Third, since accurate transition probabilities of the Markov chain and the hidden Markov process are difficult to obtain, nonideal transition probabilities are simultaneously considered in both mode transition and mode observation processes. By using the quadratic Lyapunov function techniques and linear matrix inequality methods, some sufficient criteria are developed such that the resultant closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with/without nonideal transition probabilities and satisfies a guaranteed cost performance under three different boundary conditions.

However, these incidents are often underrepresented in traffic safety research, which tends to focus primarily on actual crashes. This study introduces a novel AI-based framework designed to detect and analyze near-miss and crash events in crowdsourced dashcam footage. The framework consists of two key components: a deep learning model to segment video streams and identify potential near-miss or crash incidents and a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to further analyze and extract narrative information from the identified events. We evaluated three deep learning models—CNN, Vision Transformers (ViTs), and CNN+LSTM—on a dataset specifically curated for three-class classification (crashes, near-misses, and normal driving events). CNN achieved the highest accuracy (90%) and F1-score (89%) at the frame level. At the event level, ViTs delivered a strong performance with a test accuracy of 77.27% and an F1-score of 67.37%, while CNN+LSTM, although lower in overall performance, demonstrated significant potential with a test accuracy of 78.1% and an F1-score of 68.69%. For a deeper analysis, we applied GPT-4o to process critical safety events (near-misses and crashes), utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning for narrative generation and feature extraction. The zero-shot learning method performed better, achieving an accuracy of 81.2% and an F1-score of 81.9%. This study underscores the potential of combining deep learning with MLLMs to enhance traffic safety analysis by integrating near-miss data as a key predictive layer. Our approach highlights the importance of leveraging near-miss incidents to proactively enhance road safety, thereby reducing the likelihood of crashes through early intervention and better event understanding.","2644-1268","","10.1109/OJCS.2025.3525560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820995","Near-Miss Detection;Crowdsource;Proactive Approach;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Vision Transformer;LSTM;Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs);Traffic Safety","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These dynamics can be investigated noninvasively in humans through a standardized active stand (AS) test, which involves continuous monitoring of blood pressure using digital artery photoplethysmography and frontal brain oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). While NIRS output is commonly assessed in terms of the tissue saturation index (TSI), it can also be quantified by the absolute concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb). This study aimed to explore functional clustering of systolic blood pressure (sBP) and frontal brain oxygenation during the AS test within the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA), comparing the health correlates of TSI and O2Hb clustered with the K-shape algorithm. A total of 2793 participants from TILDA wave three were included, with a mean age of 64.5 years and 46.9% being male. Both clustering methodologies revealed statistically significant associations with participants’ characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), pulse wave velocity, cardiovascular medication usage, and usual gait speed. Notably, the TSI_sBP clustering approach uniquely captured variations in the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) cognitive score and history of cardiovascular disease, whereas the O2Hb_sBP clustering method specifically identified variations in poststand orthostatic intolerance (OI) symptoms and future mortality. It was revealed that, when coupled with sBP signal, O2Hb information was associated with a clinically important longitudinal outcome, whereas TSI was not.

This article proposed a novel transfer learning algorithm for accurate sugarcane planting mapping through space and temporary in the U.S. This algorithm only depended on one place's training data to mapping other places’ growing sugarcane. We distilled burning sugarcane fields as training labels from Sentinel-2 in Palm Beach County and neighboring area in 2021. The time-invariant phenology features were calculated from composite Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) series using linear cosine regression (LCR). They integrated as training samples to construct a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) classifier, generating Jun.–Nov. growing sugarcane maps in Plam Beach County and Lafourche County 2022. Meanwhile, a postprocess method was used to improve mapping quality. These sugarcane maps were validated using surveyed and observed field dataset and compared against the cropland data layer (CDL). As a result, the sugarcane maps achieved the best accuracy in its mature stage (Sep. 2022), which exhibited nearly complete phenological characteristics. The maps show low misclassification rates and higher accuracy compared to the CDL 2022.

In this work we investigate the effectiveness of the new auxiliary product developed by the European Space Agency, the extended timing annotation dataset (ETAD), to remove APS from both DInSAR interferograms and deformation time series generated at medium spatial resolution from Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR images. First, we show that the straightforward application of the ETAD correction layers to medium-resolution DInSAR interferograms entails the generation of artifacts, introduced by the ETAD tropospheric layers. Accordingly, we present a methodology aimed at properly recalculating such tropospheric corrections by exploiting the standard deviation and the mean of the ETAD digital elevation model layers of the considered SAR images sequence and by taking into account the locally quasi-linear dependence of the tropospheric signal with respect to the elevation. Second, we carry out a thorough experimental analysis to evaluate the performance of the ETAD APS corrections for both interferograms and deformation time series. Finally, the performance evaluation analysis is extended to the results obtained by applying the APS corrections generated through the ECMWF ERA-5 data. An extensive comparison of the results achieved through the ETAD and ERA-5-based approaches is also discussed.

This is often accomplished through technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular, and Bluetooth which, however, come with privacy concerns, high power consumption, and dependency on external infrastructure. To address these challenges, recent studies have preliminary exploited the ambient magnetic field, though comprehensive validation with real-life data is lacking. This article seeks to validate machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, and stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, for indoor-outdoor discrimination using exclusively magnetometer data from the daily activities of 20 participants in four cities across three countries. The study investigated the most effective magnetometer placement (feet, lower back, and nondominant wrist) and pre-processing techniques (e.g., features and window size). Reference data are obtained through a GPS-based algorithm coupled with a geographical database running on a smartphone. The extreme gradient boosting algorithm yielded the best results, with an accuracy of 0.91, an  $F1$ -score of 0.90, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.94. These findings confirm the feasibility of accurately estimating indoor/outdoor context information from a magnetometer at the same update frequency as a common GPS, but with important energy savings. The proposed model can be integrated into state-of-the-art gait analysis systems, being able to discriminate the location to avoid misinterpreting gait deviations in real-world settings, thus supporting continuous and ubiquitous gait monitoring. Datasets and algorithm implementations have been made publicly available.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2024.3490253","Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (JU)(grant numbers:820820); Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA); Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI2 JU) project IDEA-FAST(grant numbers:853981); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Newcastle Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) based at The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, Newcastle University and the Cumbria, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear (CNTW) NHS Foundation Trust.

The stability of these ground targets is critical for effective cross-calibration. Such stable ground targets, named pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS), have been extensively researched for optical sensors, but there has been comparatively less focus on SAR sensors. Furthermore, studies that synthesize multiple targets for comprehensive dynamic range calibration remain relatively unexplored. This paper proposes an optimized method for selecting PICS for SAR radiometric cross-calibration to address these issues. This method incorporates spatial variation coefficients, spatial autocorrelation indicators, and edge extraction techniques to identify homogeneous targets. Additionally, the backscattering coefficient's time-series root mean square error (RMSE) is leveraged to identify stable targets. Using time-series data from Sentinel-1, the study identifies 57 stable homogeneous targets as PICS, exhibiting a wide intensity distribution and a time-series RMSE less than 0.5 dB. Based on these PICS, the paper further develops a wide dynamic range cross-calibration method based on multiple PICS sites. It employs weighted least squares regression for the different data quality of each site. The cross-calibration experiments demonstrate an average improvement in the accuracy of 0.82 dB compared to the crosscalibration method utilizing a single PICS site.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3525461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820887","synthetic aperture radar (SAR);radiometric cross-calibration;incidence angle correction;weighted least squares regression","Calibration;Backscatter;Optical sensors;Radar;Microwave radiometry;Accuracy;Windows;Radar cross-sections;Remote sensing;Reliability","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Recently, the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has shown promising performance in image reconstructions by overcoming problems inherent in generative models, such as oversmoothing and mode collapse. However, the high-frequency details generated by DDPM often suffer from misalignment with HR images due to the model's tendency to overlook long-range semantic contexts. This challenge is partly due to the prevalent use of a U-Net decoder in the conditional noise predictor, which favors local details and can introduce noise with considerable variance during prediction. To tackle these limitations, an adaptive semantic-enhanced DDPM (ASDDPM) is proposed to enhance the detail-preserving capability of the DDPM by integrating low-frequency semantic insights through a transformer. Specifically, a novel adaptive diffusion transformer decoder is developed to bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder by regulating the noise prediction with the global contextual relationships and long-range dependencies in the diffusion process. In addition, a residual feature fusion strategy establishes information exchange between the two decoders at multiple levels. As a result, the predicted noise generated by our approach closely approximates that of the real noise distribution. Extensive experiments on two SR and two semantic segmentation datasets confirm the superior performance of the proposed ASDDPM in both SR and the subsequent downstream applications.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3504569","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3903502); Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2024AFA032); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42371374,41801323); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Future Networks of Intelligence(grant numbers:2022B1212010001); Hong Kong Research Grants Council; General Research Fund(grant numbers:17617024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10763472","Denoising diffusion probabilistic model;remote sensing images;single image super-resolution","Decoding;Noise;Remote sensing;Transformers;Semantics;Image reconstruction;Feature extraction;Adaptation models;Training;Brain modeling","","","","62","CCBY","22 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A conflict arises from the disparity between limited edge resources and the continuously expanding data requests for data storage, making the reduction of data storage costs a critical objective. Despite the extensive studies of edge data deduplication as a data reduction technique, existing deduplication methods encounter numerous challenges in MEC environments. These challenges stem from disparities between edge servers and cloud data center edge servers, as well as uncertainties such as user mobility, leading to insufficient robustness in deduplication decision-making. Consequently, this paper presents a robust optimization-based approach for the edge data deduplication problem. By accounting for uncertainties including the number of data requirements and edge server failures, we propose two distinct solving algorithms: uEDDE-C, a two-stage algorithm based on column-and-constraint generation, and uEDDE-A, an approximation algorithm to address the high computation overhead of uEDDE-C. Our method facilitates efficient data deduplication in volatile edge network environments and maintains robustness across various uncertain scenarios. We validate the performance and robustness of uEDDE-C and uEDDE-A through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces data storage cost and data retrieval latency while ensuring reliability in real-world MEC environments.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2024.3493959","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB4502400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10747105","Edge data deduplication;mobile edge computing;robust optimization;uncertainties","Servers;Uncertainty;Cloud computing;Data centers;Memory;Robustness;Resource management;Optimization methods;Hardware;Distributed databases","","","","36","CCBYNCND","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce dependence on specific sites for on-orbit radiometric calibration, this article introduces a cross-calibration method that uses spectral homogeneity factor (SpecHF) to select targets in open fields. Initially, utilizing hyperspectral images from the advanced hyperspectral imager on board the Gaofen-5B satellite, we developed the SpecHF and selected calibration targets in the Ulanbuh Desert, Inner Mongolia, China. Then, the cross-calibration of the Compact Continuous Tunable LVF-based Hyperspectral Imager on board the microsatellite QMX-1 and the well-calibrated orbita hyperspectral sensor carried by the Zhuhai-1 satellite was performed on 10 September 2022. The intrinsic offsets between two sensors caused by spectral response functions (SRFs) mismatches were compensated using the spectral band adjustment factor, which accounts for the target's spectral profile and the SRF of both sensors. The comparison of the cross-calibrated top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Q1C with datasets from the radiometric calibration network revealed high consistency, with a root-mean-square error of 0.032. Additionally, a ground simultaneous validation conducted in Wuxi, China, on 31 December 2022, demonstrated the high accuracy and effective performance of the cross-calibration results in real-world settings, achieving an average MAE of 0.009.

This work culminated in ITU-R Recommendation on “IMT-2030 Framework”. While the definition phase of technological requirements is currently ongoing, 3GPP standardization process on 6G networks is expected to start in 2025 and worldwide commercialization around 2029–2030. It is timely to present an up-to-date overview of the entire 6G research field. This article serves as a comprehensive guide to 6G by providing an overall vision, a contemporary survey of the main literature, and an informative tutorial-type presentation style. In our vision, 6G will be based on three fundamental elements: wireless, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Everything. Consequently, 6G can ultimately become the Intelligent Network of Everything while serving as an enabling platform for the next major disruption in mobile communication, called mobile intelligence. The potential of mobile intelligence is that anything can be made connected, intelligent, and aware of its environment. This will revolutionize the way how devices, systems, and applications are designed; how they operate and interact with humans and each other; and how they can be used for the benefit of people, society, and the world in general. After high-level visioning, the main details of 6G are discussed, including fundamental elements, disruptive applications, key use cases, main performance requirements, potential technologies, and defining features. A special focus is given to a comprehensive set of potential 6G technologies, each of which is introduced in a tutorial manner, with a discussion on the vision, introduction, past, present, opportunities, challenges, literature, and future research directions.

However, most methods highly depend on extensive annotated data, leading to performance deterioration in complex high-resolution remote sensing cross-domain scenes, where variations in image conditions and environments are prevalent. Domain adaptive semantic segmentation (DASS) has been proposed to mitigate the reliance on dense and costly annotations, typically using stagewise training. This article addresses three key challenges in existing DASS methods: 1) insufficient warmup training, limiting potential performance gains; 2) rigid pseudolabel threshold settings in self-training (ST) result in performance bottlenecks; 3) entropy-based prediction bias alone fails to effectively identify high-confidence noise early in ST. To address these issues, we propose a novel threshold-free pseudolabel learning framework, TPL-DA. During the warmup stage, we introduce a multiview bidirectional consistency learning mechanism within a teacher–student architecture. This mechanism employs a bias-free data augmentation strategy, fostering consistent bidirectional predictions in teacher–student networks, thereby enhancing domain generalization and feature robustness. Our multiscale context-enhanced prediction module further amplifies this. In the ST stage, we propose a dynamic threshold-free pseudolabel learning strategy that utilizes well-aligned feature prototypes in the feature space to guide pseudolabel generation in the probability space, eliminating the threshold constraints. In addition, we model uncertainty using relative entropy and incorporate it into the optimization objective to manage high-confidence noise. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Potsdam, and Vaihingen datasets demonstrate that TPL-DA consistently outperforms existing methods and popular benchmarks, significantly enhancing DASS performance across diverse cross-domain scenes.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3502075","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62063027); Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2023MS06001); Science and Technology Project of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2020GG0048); Program for Young Talents of Science and Technology in Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:NJYT22057); The Fundamental Research Funds for Inner Mongolia University of Science & Technology(grant numbers:2023RCTD028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10758236","Domain adaptive semantic segmentation (DASS);high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS);self-training (ST);threshold;uncertainty estimation","Prototypes;Data models;Training;Uncertainty;Noise;Adaptation models;Semantic segmentation;Remote sensing;Predictive models;Semantics","","","","74","CCBY","19 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When transforming a circuit into a graph network, circuit components are typically treated as nodes and wirings as edges. However, this conventional approach overlooks the connection for magnetic couplings, which do not involve physical wiring. Therefore, this study presents a novel solution by introducing equivalent circuits for single- and three-phase magnetic circuits. We use graph classification of graph neural networks (GNNs) for evaluation. Replacing magnetic circuits with the proposed equivalent circuits, which represent less than 4% of the total dataset, enhances the average inference accuracy to 98.02%, which is a 0.13% improvement from the previous best accuracy of 97.89%. Since GNN does not have a conservation law that corresponds to Kirchhoff's current conservation law, the accuracy of the asymmetric equivalent circuit deteriorates by 2.31%. Therefore, the aforementioned improvement in inference accuracy is conditional on the equivalent circuit having a symmetrical structure. Moreover, we show that a three-phase magnetic circuit can be solved theoretically by pairing three of the six simultaneous equations that represent an equivalent circuit without magnetic coupling in an asymmetric manner.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2024.3485021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10731705","Equivalent circuit;graph neural network (GNN);magnetic circuit;mutual transformation;three-phase","Magnetic circuits;Equivalent circuits;Estimation;Wiring;Feature extraction;Couplings;Magnetic resonance imaging;Graph neural networks;Accuracy;Power electronics","","","","46","CCBY","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although, pre-trained SAM was trained with millions of images (a billion masks), applying it to remote sensing data reveals limitations of inaccurate results and unlabeled classes, particularly for the more complex and noise data from Synthetic-aperture Radar Images.

Almost all models segmented highly accurate lake areas fitted well with ground-truth masks, nevertheless, the SAM (code link) presented the most well-performance model.

This paper proposes a basic framework for future load forecasting researches of sustainable energy systems under extreme weather events and provides new direction for membrane computing model in terms of load forecasting. Inspired by nonlinear spiking mechanisms in nonlinear spiking neural P systems, the gated spiking neural P (GSNP) model is a new recurrent-like network. In this study, we develop an innovative membrane computing model, termed FATCN-LF-FAGSNP model. Frequency enhanced channel attention mechanism (FECAM) is utilized to enhance the features extraction ability of temporal convolutional network (TCN) and improve prediction ability of GSNP systems. Frequency Attention-TCN (FATCN) fully extracts the temporal relationship of features, the features of each channel interact with each frequency component to learn more temporal information effectively and comprehensively in frequency domain. Moreover, adding FECAM to extract features from the data fully reveals the relationship between influencing factors and the load series, which improves the quality of data features and the forecasting accuracy of the FAGSNP model. Then inspired by the interaction mechanism of impulses between biological neuronal cells, FAGSNP is able to consider the load variability and effectively predict load trends. In addition, to address load prediction challenges posed by extreme weather and promote the sustainable development of power systems, the proposed model integrated many models to solve this problem. First, optimized variational mode decomposition (VMD) is used to decompose the load series and the sub-sequences are combined with relevant features, to form the different input sequences of the prediction model. Then, FATCN-LF-FAGSNP model is developed to accurately forecast each high frequency components. Subsequently inverted Transformer model and Informer model are utilized to predict low frequency components and residual component, respectively. Finally all predicted components are reconstructed to get the final predicted results.We conducted extensive comparative experiments with ten baseline models on three real-world datasets, compared with GSNP model and TCN-GSNP model, the R2 of the FATCN-LF-FAGSNP model increased and MAPE, MAE and RAE reduced, the LF accuracy (measured by R2) of the proposed hybrid model gets 0.997 in seasonal LF task. In addition, the proposed hybrid model gets the best in MAPE, MAE, R2 and RAE metrics in all cases, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in LF tasks under both extreme weather scenarios and seasonal prediction scenarios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525479","This work is supported by the Research Fund of Sichuan Science and Technology Project (no. 2023-JB00-00002-SN)(grant numbers:2023-JB00-00002-SN); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820532","Short-term load forecasting;extreme weather events;gated spiking neural P systems;frequency enhanced channel attention mechanism;temporal convolutional network;Informer;inverted Transformer;variational mode decomposition","Load modeling;Predictive models;Meteorology;Computational modeling;Accuracy;Load forecasting;Forecasting;Adaptation models;Feature extraction;Data models","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, unlike traditional remote sensing images, the inherent characteristics of rotating scan remote sensing images make fast object detection and localization a more challenging task because of: 1) the ultra-wide swath results in extremely high image resolution; 2) changes in the rotation angle cause variations in resolution; 3) the large variation in object size; and 4) side-looking imaging introduces greater geometric distortions. A common solution is to divide the large remote sensing image into smaller (uniform) patches and then apply object detection to each small patch. In this paper, we investigate image cropping strategies to address these challenges. Specifically, we propose an adaptive image cropping method (AICM) for rotating scan remote sensing images. Starting from the resolution changes caused by variations in the rotation angle, we establish a ground sampling distance model that varies with the rotation angle, achieving adaptive image cropping under different ground sampling distances. Verification on ultra-wide swath rotating scan remote sensing images shows that, compared with the traditional fixed stride cropping method, AICM improves the average inference speed by 7.39% and increases the mAP by 7.54%.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3525177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824709","Ultra-wide swath;Rotating scan;Remote sensing images;Object detection","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Taking the advantage of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in reducing search space, we implement a policy network based RL method for learning graph rules, denoted as GraphRulRL. In our research, we convert graph rules into sequences of edges, transforming the task of graph rule learning into a process of sequentially adding edges that can be solved by RL. Specifically, GraphRulRL follows a two-stage framework. In the first stage, we train a policy network for graph rule learning, which evaluates graph rules using support with anti-monotonicity as rewards during training. In the second stage, we integrate the well-trained policy network with beam search for iterative searching to generate graph rules.

To address these limitations, we introduce SpikeMOT, an innovative event-based MOT framework employing spiking neural networks (SNNs) within a Siamese architecture. SpikeMOT extracts and associates sparse spatiotemporal features from event streams, enabling high-frequency object motion inference while preserving object identities. Additionally, a simultaneous object detector provides updated spatial information of these objects at an equivalent frame rate. To evaluate the efficacy of SpikeMOT, we present DSEC-MOT, a meticulously constructed, real-world event-based MOT benchmark. This dataset features manually corrected annotations for objects experiencing severe occlusions, frequent intersections, and out-of-view scenarios commonly encountered in real-world applications.

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling decentralized devices to collaboratively train machine learning models while ensuring privacy and security in healthcare applications. Differential Privacy (DP) is used to enhance privacy in FL frameworks by injecting controlled noise into data or model updates, preventing attackers from extracting specific information. However, existing DP mechanisms, such as the Gaussian mechanism and Univariate Skellam struggle to balance privacy-utility trade-off for graph-based data like drug-drug interactions. These mechanisms treat data points independently, failing to account for the complex interconnections between nodes (drugs) and edges (interactions), leaves the network vulnerable to structural attacks that can reverse-engineer relationships, thus limiting the security of collaborative drug discovery. To address these limitations, this work proposes Graphvariate Skellam, a novel DP approach that leverages graph structure information in FL settings, referred to as EdgeSecureDP. By exploiting the structural information encoded in graph edges, this method offers enhanced privacy protection. Experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that Graphvariate Skellam effectively preserves privacy ( $15 \lt \epsilon \leq 20$ ) while achieving 78% accuracy in IoHT environments, making it a robust solution for privacy-preserving healthcare applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523749","Department of Computing, Atlantic Technological University, Donegal, Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817548","Differential privacy;federated learning;univariate Skellam;graph-based differential privacy","Privacy;Medical services;Accuracy;Protocols;Data models;Security;Internet of Medical Things;Protection;Gaussian noise;Gaussian distribution","","","","35","CCBY","27 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many major postquantum secure cryptosystems base their security on the hardness of the shortest vector problem (SVP) (Moody, 2023). Finding the best classical, quantum, or hybrid classical–quantum algorithms for the SVP is necessary to select cryptosystem parameters that offer a sufficient level of security. Grover's search quantum algorithm provides a generic quadratic speedup, given access to an oracle implementing some function, which describes when a solution is found. In this article, we provide concrete implementation of such an oracle for the SVP. We define the circuit and evaluate costs in terms of the number of qubits, the number of gates, depth, and T-quantum cost. We then analyze how to combine Grover's quantum search for small SVP instances with state-of-the-art classical solvers that use well-known algorithms, such as the block Korkine Zolotorev (Schnorr and Euchner, 1994), where the former is used as a subroutine. This could enable solving larger instances of SVP with higher probability than classical state-of-the-art records, but still very far from posing any threat to cryptosystems being considered for standardization. Depending on the technology available, there is a spectrum of tradeoffs in creating this combination.","2689-1808","","10.1109/TQE.2024.3501683","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/T001062/1,EP/X026167/1,EP/T026715/1); Science and Technology Facilities Council(grant numbers:ST/W006537/1); Edinburgh–Rice Strategic Collaboration; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Doctoral Training Partnership Studentship(grant numbers:EP/T517811/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10756628","Grover's search;postquantum cryptography (PQC);quantum algorithm;quantum circuit;shortest vector problem (SVP)","Vectors;Lattices;Costs;Qubit;Logic gates;Algorithms;Quantum algorithm;Sieving;Quantum annealing;Hardware","","","","42","CCBY","18 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The interest is often devoted to thin films because of: 1) the possibility to grow nearly perfect materials, essential for research; 2) ease of reproducibility for metrological standards; or 3) direct applications in the electronic industry. However, in finite-thickness films, the probing electromagnetic (e.m.) field leaks through the film to the underlying substrate. The substrate then gives a substantial contribution to the measured surface impedance and, thus, to the extracted resistivity. While the e.m. problem is well known, analyses in terms of the evaluation of the uncertainty involved are scarce. Moreover, simplified models for the measured surface impedance with different ranges of applicability are often used in order to simplify the analysis or to highlight the main physics. Also, in these cases, these approaches are seldom followed by careful evaluation of the additional uncertainty so introduced. In this article, we thoroughly study when simplified models, which neglect the substrate contribution, can be used, and we identify the situations in which the substrate properties yield negligible contributions to the extracted resistivity and its uncertainty. To do so, we discuss the various sources of uncertainty, also with the help of a brief description of typical measurement techniques. We show that the simplified models can greatly simplify the extraction of the material resistivity from the measured surface impedance, with reduced uncertainty and also reduced computational cost for its evaluation. We find that ranges in frequency and film thickness exist, where the simplified models can be used, with negligible approximation errors, once compared with the uncertainties related to the measurement technique. However, the identification of such combined ranges is not trivial, being particularly critical for superconducting films. Finally, we report experimental measurements of the surface impedance of different superconducting samples (bulks and the more critical situation of films over layered structures), providing case studies for both the determination of the uncertainties and the validation of the models.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2024.3509590","European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) Funding; Addendum FCC-GOV-CC-0218 (KE5084/ATS); Future Circular Collider (FCC) study; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10772314","Microwave measurements;superconducting materials;surface impedance;thin films;uncertainty","Surface impedance;Impedance;Substrates;Uncertainty;Impedance measurement;Conductors;Conductivity;Surface waves;Films;Surface resistance","","","","71","CCBY","2 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The underlying mechanism of diffusion models is to decompose the data generation process over the so-called “denoising” steps. Inspired by this, the key idea is to leverage the generative prior of diffusion models in learning a “noisy-to-clean” transformation of the information signal to help enhance data reconstruction. The proposed scheme could be beneficial for communication scenarios in which a prior knowledge of the information content is available, e.g., in multimedia transmission. Hence, instead of employing complicated channel codes that reduce the information rate, one can exploit diffusion priors for reliable data reconstruction, especially under extreme channel conditions due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or hardware-impaired communications. The proposed CDiff-assisted receiver is tailored for the scenario of wireless image transmission using MNIST dataset. Our numerical results highlight the reconstruction performance of our scheme compared to the conventional digital communication, as well as the deep neural network (DNN)-based benchmark. It is also shown that more than 10 dB improvement in the reconstruction could be achieved in low SNR regimes, without the need to reduce the information rate for error correction.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3522872","Research Council of Finland (former Academy of Finland) 6G Flagship Programme(grant numbers:346208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10816175","AI-native wireless;diffusion priors;generative AI;wireless AI;conditional denoising diffusion models;reliable communication","Diffusion models;Wireless communication;Noise reduction;Image reconstruction;Vectors;Diffusion processes;Signal to noise ratio;Gaussian distribution;Receivers;Data models","","","","31","CCBY","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An abnormal number or structure of chromosomes causes chromosomal disorders. Thus, chromosome screening is crucial for prenatal care; however, manual analysis of chromosomes is time consuming. With the increasing popularity of prenatal diagnosis, human labor resources are overstretched. Therefore, an automatic approach for chromosome detection and recognition is necessary. Methods: In the present study, we proposed a deep learning–based system for the automatic chromosome detection and recognition of metaphase cell images. We used a large database that included 5,000 metaphase cell images consisting of a total of 229,852 chromosomes. The proposed system was then developed and evaluated. The system, called ChromosomesNet, which combines the advantages of one-stage and two-stage models. The model uses original images as inputs without requiring preprocessing; it is thus applicable for clinical settings. To verify the clinical applicability of our system, we included 3,827 simple images and 1,173 difficult images, as identified by physicians, in our database. Results: We used COCOAPI's mAP50 evaluation method, which has average performance and a high accuracy of 99.60%. Moreover, the recall and F1 score of our proposed method were 99.9% and 99.49%, respectively. We also compared our method with five well-known object detection methods, including Faster-RCNN, YOLOv7, Retinanet, Swin transformer, and Centernet++. The results indicated that ChromosomesNet had the highest accuracy, recall, and F1 score. Unlike previous studies that have reported simple chromosome images as identification results, we obtained a 99.5% accuracy in the detection of difficult images.

Previous studies have predominantly relied on visible image recognition, which is vulnerable to variations in lighting conditions. Additionally, the performance of detection models is often hindered by the poor quality of images capturing UAV small targets. In contrast to visible light images, infrared images can capture the heat emitted by UAVs, rendering them less susceptible to fluctuations in lighting. To address the necessity for micro UAV detection in complex environments, this paper proposes an infrared image UAV detection method that employs super-resolution reconstruction through the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) and YOLOv8. Initially, a convolutional neural network is utilized to enhance the resolution and clarity of the infrared images. Subsequently, the YOLOv8 target detection model is applied to identify and detect UAVs.

Experimental measurements are used to quantify the effects of compressive and tensile stresses on the relative permeability and the core losses of different ferrite materials. Mechanical stress is found to significantly affect the core losses, depending on the relative orientation of the magnetic flux density and the applied mechanical stress. Specifically, the losses monotonically increase when the flux and compressive stress vectors are parallel, while perpendicular vectors lead to a more complex response depending on the level of mechanical stress. The measured loss characteristics are translated in an extension of the GSE (X-GSE), which is validated for different ferrite materials, and provides a useful tool for a first rough estimation of the core losses under mechanical stresses. Finally, FEM simulations demonstrate how thermally induced mechanical stresses in a ferrite core can redistribute the magnetic flux and therefore impact the resulting core losses, which underlines the importance of considering the stress dependence of core losses in ferrite, especially in the development of magnetic components to be encapsulated in incompressible materials.","2644-1314","","10.1109/OJPEL.2024.3515798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10792929","Core loss modeling;ferrite core losses;magnetic materials;mechanical stress;Steinmetz equation","Stress;Ferrites;Core loss;Magnetic cores;Vectors;Magnetic flux;Stress measurement;Magnetomechanical effects;Magnetic field measurement;Loss measurement","","","","16","CCBY","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These tasks range from skilled activities like screwing light bulbs, picking and sorting pills, and in-hand rotation, to more complex tasks such as opening plastic bags, cluttered bin picking, and counting cards. Despite its prevalence in human activities, replicating these fine motor skills in robotics remains a substantial challenge. This study tackles the challenge of fine in-hand manipulation by introducing the dexterous and compliant (DexCo) hand system. The DexCo hand mimics human dexterity, replicating the intricate interaction between the thumb, index, and middle fingers, with a contractable palm. The key to maneuverable fine in-hand manipulation lies in its innovative soft hydraulic actuation, which strikes a balance between control complexity, dexterity, compliance, and motion accuracy within a compact structure, enhancing the overall performance of the system. The model of soft hydraulic actuation, based on hydrostatic force analysis, reveals the compliance of hand joints, which is also further extended to a dedicated robot operating system (ROS) package for DexCo hand simulation, considering both motion and stiffness aspects. Dedicated velocity and position teleoperation controllers are designed for implementing real physical manipulation tasks. The benchmark results show that the fingertip achieves a maximum repeatable finger strength of 34.4 N, a grasp cycle time of less than 2.04 s, and a maximum repeatability accuracy of 0.03 mm.

To address this limitation, an improved simple spatial random forest model was employed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations using SDGSAT-1 Glimmer NTL data.

When GPs are used for regression, the goal is to estimate a target signal ${y}$ from an input vector $\mathbf {x}$ without assuming that they are linearly related, but with a probabilistic model $p({y}|\mathbf {x})$ that is Gaussian distributed. Therefore, GPs can be understood as a natural nonlinear extension to MMSE estimation. For real-valued GPs, this has been analyzed in the existing literature, and it is concluded that they are the natural nonlinear Bayesian extension to the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimation. In this letter, we show that, consequently, complex-valued GP regression (GPR) models are the natural nonlinear Bayesian extension of the widely linear minimum mean squared-error (WLMMSE) estimation.

This study uses optical motion capture equipment based on markers for rigid-body tracking and calculating the movement of a defined virtual avatar based on the transformation information of the precisely tracked rigid-body object. To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparative analysis of equipment and environment with existing research on animation fidelity in self-avatars is performed. In addition, two upper body-centered actions (simultaneous two-hand motion and separate two-hand motion) are presented to analyze latent factors of virtual avatar embodiment. A comparative survey experiment using the virtual embodiment questionnaire (VEQ) is conducted based on full-body tracking and the proposed rigid-body tracking-based method. Furthermore, to compare and analyze users’ realism in an environment where they coexist with virtual avatars in IVE, a survey experiment using a presence questionnaire is conducted.

However, the intermittent characteristics of green energy sources and wireless fading channels pose another challenge, as the quality of service in IoT networks revolves around the available energy and channel conditions. The traditional optimization strategies based on non-causal knowledge about these random quantities are deemed unsuitable for the realization of an autonomous IoT network operation.

While recent studies usually focus on assessing the emotional intensity of individual tweets or predicting their popularity, they frequently overlook how these tweets impact sentiment trends over time. The explosive and inflammatory nature of deliberate tweets is difficult to perceive by prediction or sentiment methods. To address this gap, we propose the multi-view Information Propagation State Awareness (IPSA) model, which aims to simultaneously assess and forecast both the popularity and sentiment strength throughout the information propagation process. Our approach begins by segmenting the information propagation into distinct time windows. Within each window, the IPSA model designs an encoder module to capture multi-view influence factors from structure, content, and time series data. Specifically, the encoder module includes a graph encoder layer based on graph attention networks to represent the backbone propagation structure formed by key nodes in the reply chain. Meanwhile, the sentiment encoder layer, utilizing an attention mechanism, extracts emotional factors present in the reply chain. Besides, we introduce a residual information prediction method that enhances the model's precision in perceiving both popularity and sentiment intensity for each time window. Our comparative experiments, conducted on two datasets and benchmarked against State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods, demonstrate that the IPSA model excels in predicting popularity and assessing future emotional trends in information propagation.","2097-406X","","10.26599/BDMA.2024.9020064","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62302150); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2024M750731); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807334","information propagating state;popularity prediction;sentiment intensity;online social networks","Attention mechanisms;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Market research;Data models;Sensors;Data mining;Forecasting","","","","43","","19 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Previously, convolutional neural network (CNN) achieves impressive progress in SISR due to its strong local feature extraction capability. However, the CNN is difficult to model long-range dependencies, which limits the performance of SISR. Transformer has a greater advantage over the CNN in long-range dependence modeling. Moreover, remote sensing elements typically exhibit multiscale characteristics and maintain strong coupling relationships with the surrounding environment. Paying attention to multiscale local and global information can help further improve the performance of SISR. Existing methods encounter challenges in leveraging diverse feature sets within single architecture networks. In this article, we propose a multiscale CNN-Transformer feature fusion (MSCT) network for remote sensing SISR. MSCT is a hybrid structural network, which consists of the adaptive residual dense block (ARDB), the multiscale Transformer block (MSTB), and the local–global information enhancement block (LGEB). Among them, ARDB can extract abundant multiscale local features via dense connected convolutional layers and adaptive residual learning. MSTB generates multiscale tokens with multiple convolutional layers to obtain multiscale global information. LGEB further enhance the extraction of local–global information in spatial and frequency domain. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that MSCT achieves competitive results on RGB remote sensing imagery compared with other representative SISR methods. In addition, SR experiments on Sentinel-2 images show that MSCT has a certain generalization ability on multispectral images. Extended experiments also demonstrate that MSCT can effectively improve the performance of object detection.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3504865","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271017); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10764782","Convolutional neural network (CNN);multiscale learning;remote sensing images;superresolution (SR);Transformer","Remote sensing;Transformers;Feature extraction;Frequency-domain analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Data mining;Airplanes;Superresolution;Spatial resolution;Object detection","","","","69","CCBYNCND","22 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of them frequently overlook the impact of object shape on sample quality, leading to an imbalanced distribution of positive samples and exacerbating the inconsistency between classification and regression tasks, thereby limiting detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel shape-dependent assignment (SDA) method that dynamically differentiates positive and negative samples based on object shape. It introduces a new metric for evaluating sample box quality by considering angular differences relative to ground truth (GT) boxes and adjusts the sample scoring threshold according to the aspect ratio of each GT box. In addition, we present a DIoU-adaptive weighting (DAW) module that enhances the interaction between classification and regression tasks by leveraging the distance-IoU metric. This approach not only balances the quantity of samples but also improves their quality, enabling more effective training schemes for samples of varying qualities.

However, few/no studies have assessed the techniques on coarse resolution image classification for extensive area land cover mapping. In this study, we evaluated the performance and feasibility of three CNN models (1-D CNN, 2-D CNN, and 3-D CNN), and U-net for coarse-resolution satellite image classification and compared them to a random forest (RF) classifier. We utilized time-series, coarse resolution (1 km) composite imageries acquired by FengYun-3C visible and infrared radiometer. Labeled datasets were collected as shapefiles and split into three independent datasets: training, validation, and test datasets, and preprocessed to meet each model's input format requirements. We conducted several experiments to optimize models and select the best models. Then, the best models were evaluated on an unseen dataset. Among the DL models, one-dimensional (1-D) CNN achieved the highest overall accuracy (OA) 0. 87 and kappa (k) 0.84, 2% higher than the best results attained by 2-D CNN, 3-D CNN, and U-net models. However, 1-D CNN is outperformed by RF which achieved 0.89 (OA) and 0.87 (k). Achieving the best and the second-best results using RF and 1-D CNN models, respectively, indicates the superiority of the pixel-based method and the insignificance of spatial information in coarse-resolution image classification. Furthermore, although the DL models can yield high accuracy, especially 1-D CNN, they are less feasible than RF classifiers for coarse-resolution satellite image classification in extensive area land cover mapping.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3469728","National Key R&D Program(grant numbers:2021YFE0117400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10696947","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);coarse resolution;deep learning;land cover;sematic segmentation;U-net","Convolutional neural networks;Land surface;Three-dimensional displays;Neurons;Deep learning;Spatial resolution;Solid modeling;Image classification;Accuracy;Semantic segmentation","","","","73","CCBYNCND","27 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is an innovative modulation technique designed to support reliable communication in rapid mobility environments for 5G and beyond applications, effectively addressing challenges posed by Doppler shifts and multipath propagation. Current OTFS receivers utilize threshold methods such as least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error estimators for CE. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the CE process, this paper proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) for learning channel parameters and performing CE in OTFS-based communication systems for high-speed UAVs (100-500 km/h). Firstly, a system model considering the Doppler effect has been modeled mathematically, and then the solution to the CE problem is presented for UAVs-assisted networks using GAN. The proposed GAN architectures comprise a U-Net-based generator and a PatchGAN discriminator for adversarial training of the model. The proposed model is compared with the baseline approaches in terms of bit error rate (BER), outage probability (OP), and normalized mean squared error (NMSE) for different velocities and modulation schemes. The proposed model has given an improvement of 70%, 55%, and 45% in BER performance and 40%, 30%, and 20% in OP compared to the conventional LS estimator, machine learning-based estimator, and deep learning-based estimator, respectively. The proposed model has also demonstrated robustness against the Doppler effect caused by the high mobility of UAVs, with only a minimal decrease in NMSE performance of 2-3 dB for every 50 km/h increase in speed. Additionally, the time complexity and processing time of the proposed model have been studied to test its suitability for UAV applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3522847","Deanship of Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, Jazan University, Saudi Arabia(grant numbers:GSSRD-24); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10815946","Unmanned aerial vehicles;channel estimation;orthogonal time-frequency space;generative adversarial network;U-Net;deep learning","Channel estimation;Generative adversarial networks;OFDM;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Communication systems;Mathematical models;Wireless communication;Time-frequency analysis;Robustness;Receivers","","","","50","CCBY","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transfer learning-based solution becomes popular due to its simple training with good accuracy, however, it is still challenging to enrich the feature diversity during the training process. And fine-grained features are also insufficient for novel class detection. To deal with the problems, this paper proposes a novel few-shot object detection method based on dual-domain feature fusion and patch-level attention. Upon original base domain, an elementary domain with more category-agnostic features is superposed to construct a two-stream backbone, which benefits to enrich the feature diversity. To better integrate various features, a dual-domain feature fusion is designed, where the feature pairs with the same size are complementarily fused to extract more discriminative features. Moreover, a patch-wise feature refinement termed as patch-level attention is presented to mine internal relations among the patches, which enhances the adaptability to novel classes. In addition, a weighted classification loss is given to assist the fine-tuning of the classifier by combining extra features from FPN of the base training model. In this way, the few-shot detection quality to novel class objects is improved.

These vulnerabilities expose mobile devices to cyber-attacks, primarily resulting from security gaps. Zero-permission apps in Android can exploit these channels to access sensitive information, including user identities, login credentials, and geolocation data. One such attack leverages “zero-permission” sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes, enabling attackers to gather information about the smartphone's user. This underscores the importance of fortifying mobile devices against potential future attacks. Our research focuses on a new recurrent neural network prediction model, which has proved highly effective for detecting side-channel attacks in mobile devices in 5G networks.

The effective management of anaemia is piled with obstructions, which may include the variability of diagnostic criteria, the resource limitations of healthcare, and the multifactorial nature of the disease including nutritional deficiencies, chronic disease, and genetic factors. Conventional anaemia prediction models, that predominantly rely on statistics and are trained on clinical risk scores, are frequently incapable of providing practical solutions and meaningful insights into anaemia diagnosis. There is a growing interest in focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) use for anaemia prediction, however, traditional AI models (black boxes) lack transparency, which causes doctors not to pick them up for practical usage. Actionable insights that are enabled by transparent AI models (white boxes) based on the explainable AI methodologies reveal the rationales of the prediction, clarify the features that are responsible for them, and help clinicians and healthcare providers. In this research work, a transparent anaemia prediction model (white box) empowered by explainable AI techniques is proposed to address the limitations of black boxes in terms of transparency. The proposed model utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, K-Neighbors Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, enhanced with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP and LIME. With the integration of explainable AI techniques like SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), the proposed model offers insights into the underlying factors influencing anaemia predictions. The proposed model, significantly, represents exceptional growth in the healthcare sector and helps in bridging the gap between predictive performance and clinical interpretability, thus improving patient care and disease management strategies. The model simulation results are showing promising results in terms of the accuracy (98.13%) and the miss-rate (1.87%) which are the superior performance compared to the previous published approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3522080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10813340","Anaemia prediction;explainable artificial intelligence;SHAP;LIME","Anemia;Predictive models;Artificial intelligence;Medical services;Accuracy;Explainable AI;Diseases;Closed box;Support vector machines;Glass box","","","","42","CCBY","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, by integrating a deep residual neural network and auto-encoder, we propose an advanced deep neural network (DNN) framework with unified feature-aware and label embedding to perform multi-label arrhythmias classification involving 30 types of arrhythmias. Firstly, a deep residual neural network is built to extract the complex pathological features from varying-dimensional electrocardiograms (ECGs). Secondly, the mean square error loss is adopted to learn a latent space associating the deep pathological features and the corresponding label data, and then to achieve unified feature-label embedding. Thirdly, the label-correlation aware loss is introduced to optimize the auto-encoder architecture, which enables our model to exploit label-correlation for improved multi-label prediction. Our proposed DNN model can allow end-to-end training and prediction, which can perform feature-aware, label embedding, and label-correlation aware prediction in a unified framework. Finally, our proposed model is evaluated on the currently largest public dataset worldwide, and achieves the challenge metric scores of 0.492, 0.495, and 0.490 on the 12-lead, 3-lead, and all-lead version ECGs, respectively.

Inspired by human ability to learn rapidly, few-shot semantic segmentation offers a promising solution by utilizing limited labeled data for efficient model training and generalization. However, the intrinsic complexities of aerial images, compounded by scarce samples, often result in inadequate feature representation and semantic ambiguity, detracting from the model's performance. In this article, we propose to tackle these challenging problems via dual semantic metric learning and multisemantic features fusion and introduce a novel few-shot segmentation Network (DSMF-Net). On the one hand, we consider the inherent semantic gap between the feature of graph and grid structures and metric learning of few-shot segmentation. To exploit multiscale global semantic context, we construct scale-aware graph prototypes from different stages of the feature layers based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), while also incorporating prior-guided metric learning to further enhance context at the high-level convolution features. On the other hand, we design a pyramid-based fusion and condensation mechanism to adaptively merge and couple the multisemantic information from support and query images. The indication and fusion of different semantic features can effectively emphasize the representation and coupling abilities of the network. We have conducted extensive experiments over the challenging iSAID-5$^{i}$ and DLRSD benchmarks.

The proposed IDC-ESL method was effective in predicting the surgical outcome in patients with focal epilepsy, which can be effectively used for epilepsy surgery. Seizure freedom was clearly associated with complete resection of combined EEG features of interictal spike, high-frequency oscillation (HFO), and seizure onset zone (SOZ), and it had the highest significance in localizing the epileptogenic zone. However, for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), IDC-ESL was not performed effectively because of a deeply seated lesion and multifocal abnormalities. It could only roughly estimate the affected area, mainly because of insular involvement.

Our goal is to ensure uninterrupted service availability to users in different hotspot areas regardless of their location. Consistent service availability can be achieved by guaranteeing that each RIS deployed in a hotspot area can support a certain number of users. This plays a critical role in smart city applications in the context of emergency communications and ubiquitous connectivity since the design ensures service availability to as many users as possible in all relevant locations. Taking into consideration the challenges in obtaining channel state information (CSI) given the passive nature of RIS and dynamic environments, we formulate a robust fairness problem to maximize the minimum expected number of served users in proximity to each RIS while considering the available transmit power and the worst-case quality of service (QoS) constraints within the bounded CSI error model framework. The resulting problem is a mixed integer non-convex program which is highly coupled and challenging to solve in polynomial time. Thus, we resort to binary variable relaxation, convex approximation techniques, and alternating optimization to tackle the problem. Additionally, we handle the semi-infinite uncertainty constraints by employing the S-procedure and general sign-definiteness. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design in obtaining consistent and reliable service in different hotspot areas compared to the relevant benchmark schemes.

Two-dimensional CNNs fail to effec-tively extract spatial and spectral information, and deploying three-dimensional CNNs on microprocessors is challenging as these net-works consume excessive resources. If graph convolutional networks (GCN) are adopted, most networks employ superpixel segmentation for HSI classification. However, this approach tends to overlook pixel-level features and thus fails to achieve fine classification.To efficiently extract spectral features while reducing resource consumption, we proposed the spectral shift module (SPCSM). This module extracts features by circularly shifting spectral information. It emphasizes the internal correlations within the spectral and offers the advantage of fewer parameters. Based on the SPCSM, we designed the spatial–spectral shift module (S2SM). It models and analyzes correlations between spatial and spectral data, facilitating the extraction of spatial and spectral features. Additionally, it addresses the issues of redundancy in shallow information. To enable deployment on microprocessors and effectively classify hyperspectral images, we optimized the MambaOut network by integrating the S2SM with a multihead MambaOut (LS2SM-MHMambaOut). Experiments demonstrated that our network struck a favorable balance between classification accuracy and model complexity.

It aims to alert relevant parties to any deviations from authorized flight plans. The easa mandates conformance monitoring and suggests integrating it into utm systems. Although traditional monitoring systems, such as wireless sensor networks, can serve this purpose, the associated expenses for installation and maintenance make them impractical for large-scale implementations. To tackle this challenge, we propose a monitoring system that capitalizes on uav rid technology and mobile crowd sensing. rid is becoming a global regulatory requirement. It enables ground observers to identify drones using standard mobile devices. Our solution collects rid data by gathering reports from these observers to assess uav operations in real-time. A significant component of this approach is determining the optimal number of reports that should be considered to allow reliable and quick evaluation. While processing more reports can enhance the evaluation accuracy, it increases the computational demands and may compromise the system’s real-time performance. Moreover, in a reward-based system, processing more reports incurs higher costs. Therefore, our system uses a mechanism that adjusts the number of received and processed reports based on airspace conditions and the crowd density in the area of interest. In addition, our approach incorporates signal quality metrics -path loss, shadowing, and rss -along with distance considerations in the activation process of ground observers for rid message forwarding. This comprehensive consideration of both signal integrity and spatial proximity significantly improves detection and monitoring precision of the uav. We validated the proposed model through Monte Carlo simulations.

However, wetland monitoring still faces significant challenges such as high manual costs and low image monitoring accuracy, primarily due to the complex composition of wetland terrain and diverse spectral characteristics, especially located in remote suburban areas. With their rich semantic and spectral features, studying wetlands as scenes in remote sensing images and segmenting them effectively can address these challenges. To address the issue of low segmentation accuracy on remote sensing image with GrabCut, this study proposes a remote sensing image segmentation extraction method, named SceneCut, based on feature extraction and multifeature joint graph cuts. The method consists of three parts: feature extraction, feature fusion, and multifeature joint graph cuts. In the first part, image features are calculated using a sliding window approach. In the second part, region covariance calculation and matrix eigenvalue decomposition are used to generate a multichannel feature image from the extracted feature vectors. Finally, in the third part, GrabCut is applied to the multichannel image to perform graph cuts, considering multiple features, and the segmentation result is mapped back to the original image to generate the segmented image. Experimental analysis and field exploration validation of wetland images conducted in this study demonstrate that compared to algorithms that only use RGB features for segmentation or those that do not consider the relationship between multiple features, SceneCut performs well in wetland scene extraction, especially in extracting boundaries with significant blending.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3506584","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41871296); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10771945","Graph cut model;lie group;remote sensing;scene segmentation;wetland","Wetlands;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Remote sensing;Monitoring;Semantics;Accuracy;Object oriented modeling;Lie groups;Deep learning","","","","65","CCBYNCND","29 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, deep learning-based WF has become a research focus in this field. Although these methods can achieve high accuracy, their performance tends to decline over time. This degradation results from the evolution of network protocol versions and the ongoing development of obfuscation techniques, a phenomenon known as concept drift. To address the problem of concept drift, this paper presents a multi-granularity features representation and dimensionality reduction network for Website Fingerprinting, referred to as LRCT. The LRCT network effectively leverages the temporal learning advantages of Local Recurrent Networks (Local RNN) and the spatial learning strengths of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by designing the local feature extraction block (denoted as LRC Block), which extracts fine-grained local features from 2000-dimensional original sequences and reduces the dimensionality to 125. The network then uses a Transformer Encoder to capture more robust global features from the low-dimensional data. Experimental results comparing LRCT with state-of-the-art WF methods demonstrate that the proposed LRCT achieves 99.34% accuracy in a closed-world scenario, outperforming other benchmark models. Compared to the benchmark WF-Transformer method, the LRCT network reduces the parameter count by half and decreases the average training time per epoch to approximately 20% of the benchmark. Even under concept drift conditions, LRCT maintains an accuracy of 89.9%. In open-world scenarios, LRCT also has better precision and recall.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3522892","Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province(grant numbers:24JRRA572); 2024 Gansu Provincial Higher Education Industry Support Program(grant numbers:CYZC-2024-24); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10816323","Website fingerprinting;local recurrent neural network;transformer encoder;traffic analysis","Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Accuracy;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Convolutional neural networks;Concept drift;Microprocessors;Transformers;Long short term memory","","","","44","CCBYNCND","26 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wavefront aberrations introduce speckles in the telescope science images, which are patterns of diffracted starlight that can mimic the appearance of planets, complicating the detection of faint exoplanet signals. Traditional post-processing methods, operating primarily in the image intensity domain, do not integrate wavefront sensing data. These data, measured mainly for adaptive optics corrections, have been overlooked as a potential resource for post-processing, partly due to the challenge of the evolving nature of wavefront aberrations. In this paper, we present a differentiable rendering approach that leverages these wavefront sensing data to improve exoplanet detection. Our differentiable renderer models wave-based light propagation through a coronagraphic telescope system, allowing gradient-based optimization to significantly improve starlight subtraction and increase sensitivity to faint exoplanets. Simulation experiments based on the James Webb Space Telescope configuration demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial improvements in contrast and planet detection limits.

Small cell networks (ScNs) integrated with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) have emerged as promising solutions to address this issue. However, ScNs have resource allocation limitations, and traditional RISs can only reflect signals in a limited propagation space of 1800 with fixed reflection properties. This paper proposes a novel approach to overcome these challenges by introducing actively simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (ASTAR)-RISs. Unlike conventional RIS, ASTAR-RISs actively amplify and transmit signals, effectively mitigating the limited propagation challenge and improving signal strength, especially in dense ScNs. This approach enhances the quality of service in complex channel environments by amplifying, on top of reflection, from the macro base station (mBS), improving the overall signal strength, and providing 3600 flexible propagation space. Furthermore, ASTAR-RIS enables dynamic beam management, significantly improving signal coverage and interference management, which are crucial in dense deployments. In this work, we propose a network architecture where distributed ASTAR-RIS units are deployed to assist small cell mBSs by optimizing signal coverage and enhancing communication performance. ASTAR-RISs dynamically control signal reflection and amplification, complementing the functionality of traditional small-cell BSs in dense network environments. Using the MIMO technique, we design phase shifts for ASTAR elements and develop optimal hybrid beamforming for users at the mBS. We dynamically control the ON/OFF status of the ASTAR-RIS based on active or idle status. We propose an efficient model that ensures fairness of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all users and minimizes overall power consumption while meeting user SNR and phase shift constraints. To this end, we integrate robust beamforming and power allocation strategies, ensuring the system maintains reliable performance even under imperfect channel state information (CSI). We formulate a max-min optimization problem that optimizes the SNR and power consumption, subject to the ON/OFF status, phase shift, and power budget of the ASTAR-RIS. Our proposed method uses an alternating optimization algorithm to optimize the phase shift matrix at the ASTAR-RIS and the hybrid beamforming at the mBS. The approach includes two transmission schemes, and the phase optimization problem is solved using a successive convex approximation method that offers a closed-form solution at each step. Additionally, we use the dual method to determine the optimal ON/OFF status of the ASTAR-RIS. Comprehensive simulations validate the robustness and scalability of our proposed solution, particularly under varying network densities and CSI uncertainties. provides significant performance improvements over 170% compared to traditional RIS schemes.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2024.3509736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10772072","Actively simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces;hybrid beamforming;multiple-input-multiple-output;small cell networks","Reflection;Array signal processing;Signal to noise ratio;Optimization;Energy consumption;6G mobile communication;Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicular and wireless technologies;Interference","","","","45","CCBY","2 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF) is a generalization of NMF that incorporates a third non-negative factorization matrix, and has shown impressive clustering performance by imposing simultaneous orthogonality constraints on both sample and feature spaces. However, the performance of NMTF dramatically degrades if the data are contaminated with noises and outliers. Furthermore, the high-order geometric information is rarely considered. In this paper, a Robust NMTF with Dual Hyper-graph regularization (namely RDHNMTF) is introduced. Firstly, to enhance the robustness of NMTF, an improvement is made by utilizing the $l_{2,1}$-norm to evaluate the reconstruction error. Secondly, a dual hyper-graph is established to uncover the higher-order inherent information within sample space and feature spaces for clustering. Furthermore, an alternating iteration algorithm is devised, and its convergence is thoroughly analyzed. Additionally, computational complexity is analyzed among comparison algorithms. The effectiveness of RDHNMTF is verified by benchmarking against ten cuttina-edae alaorithms across seven datasets corrupted with four types of noise.","2097-406X","","10.26599/BDMA.2024.9020055","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62003281); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807336","Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF);$l_{2,1}$-norm;dual hyper-graph regularization;co-clustering","Noise;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning;Big Data;Benchmark testing;Robustness;Data mining;Computational complexity;Convergence","","","","47","","19 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In contrast, embedding-based completion methods demonstrate strong scalability and efficiency, but also have limited utilisation of domain knowledge. In response to the aforementioned issues, we propose a method of pre-training and inference for knowledge graph completion based on integrated rules. The approach combines rule mining and reasoning to generate precise candidate facts. Subsequently, a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned and probabilistic structural loss is incorporated to embed the knowledge graph. This enables the language model to capture more deep semantic information while the loss function reconstructs the structure of the knowledge graph.

FUTURE is an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-like Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) with 10 rounds, whose round function consists of four components, i.e., SubCell, MixColumn, ShiftRow, and AddRoundKey. Unlike AES, it is a 64-bit-size block cipher with a 128-bit secret key, and the state can be arranged into 16 cells. Therefore, the operations of FUTURE including its S-box is defined over $\boldsymbol{F}_{2}^{4}$. The previous studies have shown that the integral properties of 4-bit S-boxes are usually weaker than larger-size S-boxes, thus the number of rounds of FUTURE, i.e., 10 rounds only, might be too aggressive to provide enough resistance against integral cryptanalysis. In this paper, we mount the integral cryptanalysis on FUTURE. With state-of-the-art detection techniques, we identify several integral distinguishers of 7 rounds of FUTURE. By extending this 7-round distinguisher by 3 forward rounds, we manage to recover all the 128 bits secret keys from the full FUTURE cipher without the full codebook for the first time.

For the CS-MLRSD scheme, an iterative thresholding algorithm is derived to separately reconstruct the low-rank and sparse components. A bivariate shrinkage function is employed to threshold the wavelet coefficients for sparse representation of the low-rank part, while soft thresholding is used to sparsely represent the dominant objects in the image space. The proposed CS-MLRSD scheme is applicable to arbitrary SAR geometries in which the SAR imaging and inverse SAR imaging functions are defined.

Thus, ternary logic based on various devices was proposed, but these circuits are still encountering issues of high-power consumption, low operating speed, and challenges in manufacturing compared to silicon-based circuits. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology for designing ternary logic based on Depletion-mode metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (DEPFET) and multi-threshold voltage complementary metal-oxide–semiconductor (MTCMOS).

This study employs a multitemporal evaluation of Landsat satellite imagery and GIS-based analysis to investigate the spatio-temporal trends in land-use and land-cover changes from 1994 to 2024. We detected substantial changes in urban growth, vegetation cover, and barren areas using supervised classification (random forest) methods and remote sensing indices such as normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, normalized difference built-up index, and normalized difference water index. The classification models demonstrated high accuracy, with combined values ranging from 96.7% to 98.4%. Our results indicate a significant increase in metropolitan regions, from 608.66 km2 (32.43%) in 1994 to 968.50 km2 (51.6%) in 2024. This urban expansion correlates with rising land surface temperatures, exacerbating UHI effects. The UTFVI analysis reveals a progressive rise in heat stress from 1994 to 2024. In 1994, most areas ranged from “Good” (<0.005) to “Normal” (0.005–0.010), but by 2024, large portions of the city showed “Worst” conditions (>0.020), indicating severe urban heat intensification, particularly in central and southern regions providing evidence of a significant increase in urban heat, especially in the center and southern areas of the city. These findings underscore the critical need for sustainable land management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of Lahore's rapid urbanization on the environment.

In this article, an enhanced SAR imaging framework that combines along-track multiple channels is proposed using a low-rank tensor-train (TT) decomposition method, which is applicable for a co-located multiple input multiple output (MIMO) array or a phased-transmitting-digital-receiving array. First, the multichannel images are stacked into a tensor form after SAR imaging on individual channels and spatial variant array phase correction for each pixel. Then, the low-rank property of tensor stack is exploited and the TT model is utilized to find the redundancy and leverage the intrinsic structure of image stack. In addition, ket augmentation is introduced to exhibit the local data structure more clearly than the original tensor under TT decomposition. Finally, tensor-train nuclear norm is used to relax the NP-hard problem with low-rank constraint and the minimization problem is solved in the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers for enhanced imaging. The proposed algorithm can effectively improve the working distance and image quality of mmWave SAR. Numerical experiments using simulated data of MIMO SAR and measured data collected by a ground-based phased-transmitting-digital-receiving array system are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3509477","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071113,62101407); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20211559); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242022k60008,2242022R40008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10776754","Low-rank;millimeter-wave (mmWave);synthetic aperture radar (SAR);tensor decomposition","Tensors;Millimeter wave communication;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar imaging;Phased arrays;Radar;Imaging;Matrix decomposition;Apertures;Arrays","","","","47","CCBY","3 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article addresses the privacy and security issues brought up by data sharing in the context of IoT fog computing. The suggested framework, called “BlocFogSec”, secures key management and data sharing through blockchain consensus and smart contracts. Unlike existing solutions, BlocFogSec utilizes two types of smart contracts for secure key exchange and data sharing, while employing a consensus protocol to validate transactions and maintain blockchain integrity. To process and store data effectively at the network edge, the framework makes use of fog computing, notably reducing latency and raising throughput. BlocFogSec successfully blocks unauthorized access and data breaches by restricting transactions to authorized nodes. In addition, the framework uses a consensus protocol to validate and add transactions to the blockchain, guaranteeing data accuracy and immutability. To compare BlocFogSec's performance to that of other models, a number of simulations are conducted. The simulation results indicate that BlocFogSec consistently outperforms existing models, such as Security Services for Fog Computing (SSFC) and Blockchain-based Key Management Scheme (BKMS), in terms of throughput (up to 5135 bytes per second), latency (as low as 7 ms), and resource utilization (70% to 92%). The evaluation also takes into account attack defending accuracy (up to 100%), precision (up to 100%), and recall (up to 99.6%), demonstrating BlocFogSec's effectiveness in identifying and preventing potential attacks.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2024.9010082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817699","BlocFogSec;Internet of Things (IoT);fog computing;blockchain","Technological innovation;Data privacy;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Throughput;Consensus protocol;Internet of Things;Resource management;Edge computing","","","","27","","30 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

These systems often require the processing of data with limited usefulness in time, so the edge becomes vital in the development of such reactive IoT applications with real-time requirements. Although different architectural designs will always have advantages and disadvantages, mobile gateways appear to be particularly relevant in enabling this integration with the edge, particularly in the context of wide area networks with occasional data generation. In these scenarios, mobility planning is necessary, as aspects of the technology need to be aligned with the temporal needs of an application. The nature of this planning problem makes cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques useful in solving pertinent issues, such as having to deal with multiple dimensions in the action space while aiming for optimum levels of system performance. This article presents a novel scalable DRL model that incorporates a pointer-network (Ptr-Net) and an actor-critic algorithm to handle complex action spaces.

It is challenging to achieve an optimal tradeoff between expensive and complex models of multimodal detectors, which are difficult to deploy directly on autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), and the limited detection accuracy of single-modal detectors. To overcome this limitation, we developed a cross-modal target detector called CMDistill. Specifically, we designed an effective distillation loss method based on three components. First, to reduce differences in feature knowledge across modal interlayers, we designed a Pearson correlation coefficient to constrain negative knowledge. Second, we modeled the relational cues between features by computing the affinity matrices of the deeper semantic features of the teacher–student model to convey relational knowledge more accurately. Finally, the target bounding boxes and classification information predicted by the output of the teacher were passed to the student. Experimental results on the aerial vehicle detection dataset revealed that CMDistill achieved an optimal performance with an average accuracy of 74% on the RGB-only target detection task using fewer computational resources to achieve a detection performance comparable with that of multimodal approaches.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3479717","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52101377,62201598); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10715640","Cross-modality;knowledge distillation (KD);object detection;autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)","Autonomous aerial vehicles;Object detection;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Detectors;Accuracy;Chronic kidney disease;Predictive models;Transformers;Sun","","","","58","CCBYNCND","14 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, when using a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector, these systems experience performance degradation primarily because of echo nonstationarity. To address this challenge, a deep learning (DL)-based scheme tailored for identifying ship targets in the time-frequency (TF) domain is presented. To ensure high-quality model training, we develop a semiautomatic annotation approach that uses automatic identification system (AIS) information as a reference and collect a TF dataset named HFSWR-TFD. In addition, inspired by the dynamic snake convolution and triplet attention mechanism, an improved YOLOv5s model named DS-YOLOv5s is designed to effectively capture target ridges. The inference results are filtered using a confidence threshold and then transformed into the range-Doppler domain for final target identification. Experimental results on the newly collected dataset show significant improvements are achieved by DS-YOLOv5s. Compared to its baseline, the DS-YOLOv5s can increase the F1 score by 15.3%, and AP75 by 6.3%. Then, this pretrained DL model is integrated into the entire scheme to make comparison with existing CFAR detectors. With the AIS records as ground truth, our scheme achieves a match rate that is 2.27$\sim$8.17% greater than its CFAR counterparts. Moreover, the quantitative results of the associate tracks further confirm the superiority of the proposed method. In conclusion, the proposed scheme provides an effective and efficient solution for HFSWR ship detection.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3518781","Innovation Fund of National Marine Defense Technology Innovation Center(grant numbers:JJ-2021-722-03); Research Foundation of Wuhan Shipboard Communication Institute(grant numbers:KCJ2020-7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10804208","Deep learning (DL);dynamic snake convolution (DSConv);high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR);ship detection;time-frequency analysis (TFA)","Marine vehicles;Detectors;YOLO;Feature extraction;Clutter;Remote sensing;Annotations;Time-frequency analysis;Surface waves;Sea surface","","","","69","CCBYNCND","16 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the existing studies mainly focus on linear relationships and ignore nonlinear contributions. To address the above issues, we propose a new method named multi-frequency decomposition entropy (MDE) learning for inferring nonlinear functional connectivity between brain regions. Firstly, the variational mode decomposition was used to divide fMRI data into five groups of frequency. Next, the copula entropy was used to calculate the nonlinear relationship between brain regions in each frequency group, and then the best important nonlinear relationships were screen out by using statistical t-test. Lastly, a gyrus importance index was proposed to reflect the distribution trend of gyri in different frequency groups. The results of applying MDE for the fMRI data analysis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder showed that the difference between the three groups of patient and healthy control is large at the hub nodes, and the nonlinear relationship between the patient groups is weak when they are at the same hub node. In addition, each disease exhibits unique characteristics compared with other diseases and healthy control. In a word, the nonlinear functional connectivity of different frequency groups reflect the differences and commonalities between diseases and reveal possible discriminating biomarkers among mental diseases.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3515168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10793239","Functional magnetic resonance imaging;nonlinear functional connectivity;multi-frequency;variational mode decomposition;copula entropy","Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Entropy;Diseases;Time series analysis;Frequency measurement;Resonant frequency;Nearest neighbor methods;Indexes;Estimation;Data analysis","","","","65","CCBY","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this framework, we address the challenging case of detecting changes between the hyperspectral and synthetic aperture radar images. This case has intrinsic difficulties, namely, the difference in the nature of the physical quantity measured, added to the great difference in dimensionality of the two imaging domains. To address these challenges, a novel method is proposed based on the integration of a manifold learning technique and deep learning networks trained to perform an image-to-image translation task. The method works in a fully unsupervised manner, further enforcing a fast implementation in real-world scenarios. From an application-oriented perspective, we focus on flooded-area mapping using the PRISMA and COSMO-SkyMed missions.

We compare the performance of five CNN models with different convolution operations and numbers of layers on four image datasets, each converted to nine color spaces. We find that color space selection can significantly affect classification accuracy, and that some classes are more sensitive to color space changes than others. Different color spaces may have different expression abilities for different image features, such as brightness, saturation, hue, etc. To leverage the complementary information from different color spaces, we propose a pseudo-Siamese network that fuses two color spaces without modifying the network architecture.

Accurate estimation of the actively exerted torque from the ankle joint complex (AJC) can increase the engagement of patients during rehabilitation training. Given the three degrees of freedom (DOFs) of AJC and its coupled motion, it becomes essential to accurately estimate the actively exerted torque under multi-DOF. This work introduces an estimation framework that includes the Hill-based sEMG-force model, the ankle musculoskeletal dynamic decoupling model, and the parameter identification-calibration strategy. The Hill-based sEMG-force model estimates the force generated by individual muscles involved in AJC; The parameter identification-calibration strategy combined with pre-experiment identifies unknown variables in the ankle musculoskeletal dynamic decoupling model; Finally, the musculoskeletal dynamic decoupling model relates the muscle forces to the AJC’s actively exerted torque. The musculoskeletal dynamic decoupling model combines anatomical and biomechanical features, enabling parameters derived from a single DOF pre-experiment through identification-calibration strategy to be applicable in multi-DOF dynamic motion. To evaluate the estimation performance of the framework, experiments were conducted in various directions involving both single and multiple DOFs. The results show that the proposed framework can estimate the actively exerted torque with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of  ${10}.{29}\% \pm {2}.{86}\%$  (mean ± SD) for torque estimation under a single DOF, and NRMSE of  ${11}.{35}\% \pm {4}.{51}\%$  under multiple DOFs, compared to the actual measured values.

However, during the generation of depth images, some important information may be lost in the form of pieces, which can seriously impact subsequent applications, such as computer vision. Existing methods attempt to apply traditional image restoration methods for filling the lost areas in depth images have proven ineffective in inpainting the structural information in the scene. In this paper, we propose a depth image inpainting method based on pixel-level non-local method. In order to effectively inpaint the depth images, we add 0.7 density salt-and-pepper noise to the original depth image in advance, we then implement image block-matching on the noise-added depth image to obtain some similar image block groups, and then scan each image block to form a column vector. We further stack all vectors to construct a two-dimensional matrix. Finally, we implement row-matching on the constructed matrix to obtain many similar pixel groups. The separable Haar transform is implemented on each similar pixel groups, hard-thresholding on transformed coefficients can effectively remove the added noise and bring the original neighbor pixels in the depth image into the information lost area, thus, the lost information can be effectively inpainted. Inverse Haar transform, row-aggregation and block-aggregation are successfully implemented to complete the depth image inpainting. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve higher PSNR values than existing methods on public datasets, and the subjective visual quality of the inpainted images is also satisfactory.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523504","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071320); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2020MF038); Shandong Province Science and Technology Small and Medium Enterprises Innovation Capacity Improvement Project(grant numbers:2022TSGC2195); Science and Technology Innovation Development Project of Taian City(grant numbers:2020GX028,2021GX045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817595","Pixel-level non-local;depth image;image inpainting","Noise;Transforms;Image edge detection;Vectors;Image denoising;Filtering;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Smoothing methods","","","","29","CCBY","30 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such fusion technique is crucial for numerous applications that require frequent monitoring at fine spatial and temporal scales spanning agriculture, environment, natural resources, and disaster management. However, existing fusion models have difficulty accommodating abrupt spatial changes in land cover among images and dealing with temporally distant image data. This article proposes a novel multistream spatiotemporal fusion generative adversarial network (STGAN) model for spatiotemporal satellite image fusion that can produce accurate fused images and accommodate substantial temporal differences between the input images. The STGAN employs a conditional generative adversarial network architecture with a multistream input design to better learn temporal features. The generator of STGAN comprises convolutional blocks, a spatial transformer module, a channel attention network, and a U-net module designed to better capture spatial and temporal features from the multiresolution input images. Comprehensive evaluations of the proposed STGAN model have been performed on the Coleambally Irrigation Area and Lower Gwydir Catchment datasets, using both visual inspection and spatial and spectral metrics, including root mean square error, relative dimensionless global error synthesis, spectral angle mapping, structural similarity index measure, and local binary pattern.

Seismic shot gathers typically exhibit weak spatial correlations between data and velocity models, further complicated by sparsity due to reflected events. This study proposes a cyclic learning rate velocity model building (CLR-VMB) framework, incorporating a U-shaped residual network (ResNet) enhanced with dual attention mechanisms (DA-ResNet) to address these challenges. Unlike conventional single-network approaches, CLR-VMB leverages multiple snapshots of the network obtained during a cyclic learning rate schedule. This enables the framework to ensemble complementary information from different snapshots without additional training costs. The DA-ResNet architecture utilizes attention mechanisms to extract cross-gather relationships and capture crucial spatial information from seismic shot gathers. An encoder–decoder structure is then used to estimate velocity from the processed recordings. Numerical experiments conducted on various layered models and SEG/EAGE salt models demonstrate that CLR-VMB effectively mitigates local minima, enhances noise suppression, and exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to a UNet-based method and a physics-guided hybrid approach. By intelligently interpreting inherent seismic data characteristics, this study's cyclic learning and attention-based framework paves the way for effective data-driven approaches to subsurface velocity building.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3501736","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFA0713404); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41974137); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10756675","Coordinate attention;cyclic learning rate velocity model building;efficient channel attention;full-waveform inversion;residual network;snapshot ensembling","Schedules;Data models;Training;Computational modeling;Recording;Mathematical models;Correlation;Convergence;Attention mechanisms;Estimation","","","","58","CCBY","18 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rigid targets in remote sensing scenes usually retain relatively stable scale information and apparent structure, providing an adequate basis for their discrimination. However, existing methods need to more reasonably utilize the scale information and apparent structure, which results in scale neglect and insufficient discriminative feature extraction (DFE). In response to the aforementioned challenges, we propose our SD-Net, a training framework for fine-grained recognition tasks of rigid objects in remote sensing scenes. It consists of a fused label learning process based on probability distribution function (PDF) and a DFE branch. The PDF counts the objects' scale information by category, builds a probability model based on the sample distribution, and finally converts it into a soft label form to guide model learning. DFE extracts discriminative features along the channel and spatial dimensions of the feature map based on feature deep mining and wide-ranging. Finally, we propose the FAIR1M-OR dataset, containing 37 fine-grained categories and about 600 000 instances, to verify the method's effectiveness. The experimental results show that introducing only a small number of parameters during training, SD-Net, improves the performance of the models based on the ResNet and ViT by about 4.6 points.

Strengthening Ulva prolifera disaster monitoring can reduce economic losses, support sustainable marine resource use, and maintain ecological balance. Deep learning-based Ulva prolifera disaster monitoring has gradually become a research hotspot. However, existing deep-learning semantic segmentation methods are insufficient in perceiving the spatial information of Ulva prolifera. On the one hand, downsampling will lose the spatial information of Ulva prolifera, and on the other hand, existing models are difficult to effectively capture the multiscale spatial characteristics of Ulva prolifera. In order to solve these problems, this article proposes an Ulva prolifera extraction network (UPE-Net) based on the U-Net model with three important modifications. First, we develop a novel multifeature downsampling module, MH-downsampling block, specifically designed to mitigate spatial information loss. Second, we propose a dual attention spatial pyramid pooling module that effectively suppresses noise interference while capturing multiscale spatial information on Ulva prolifera. Third, a detail-enhanced attention block is incorporated to enhance the learning of crucial spatial and detail features during the decoding process. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the Gaofen-1 wide field view Ulva prolifera dataset. Compared with existing methods, our UPE-Net has significantly enhanced the ability to perceive the spatial information of Ulva prolifera, improving the IoU by at least 8%, the segmentation results of our model are closest to the ground truth.

Phycocyanin (PC), a characteristic pigment of cyanobacteria, plays a crucial role in detecting cyanobacterial blooms and providing early warnings. However, accurately estimating PC in turbid waters using remote sensing is challenging due to the optical complexity of most inland waters and the relatively weak optical signal of PC. To address this issue, an enhanced three-band algorithm (ETBA) is proposed for retrieving PC concentration in inland waters. Since the PC absorption feature at 620 nm is prone to interference from non-phycocyanin pigments, the algorithm incorporates the quantification of the absorption coefficient of non-phycocyanin pigments at 620 nm (aph-pc (620)) to improve the accurate of estimating apc (620) . Using in-situ observation data from Erhai Lake as an example, the results show that ETBA significantly outperforms the original three-band algorithm (TBA) in mitigating interference from non-phycocyanin pigments. Among all PC algorithms considered in this study, the ETBA achieved the lowest mean relative error (12.76%) and root-mean-square error (0.37 μg L-1), with a goodness-of-fit of R2 = 0.73. Therefore, the introduction of the ETBA has a direct positive impact on monitoring harmful algal blooms caused by cyanobacteria in inland and coastal water.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3525132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820972","Enhanced three-band algorithm;OLCI;phycocyanin;quantitative retrieval","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, these systems often fail or are misclassified because of external factors, obstructions, and varying environmental conditions. Traditional models cannot effectively handle these variations, leading to inaccuracies. Moreover, the complexity and computational demands of advanced models can hinder their real-time application. In this study, the Hybrid Ensemble Distillation (HED) model addresses these issues by leveraging both knowledge distillation and an ensemble of pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) to enhance the precision and proficiency of categorization. The model combines the strengths of these architectures while utilizing data augmentation techniques such as GANs to enhance the training dataset. The proposed model demonstrated high efficiency and accuracy, with the teacher model achieving 98.42% accuracy and the student model reaching 96.78% validation accuracy, thereby highlighting the efficacy of knowledge distillation. It also showed progressive improvements in the validation accuracy and loss reduction over 350 epochs, emphasizing the robustness of the training process. This lightweight method helps identify suspects or individuals because the model was trained using 360-degree images in the dataset, ensuring comprehensive feature extraction from multiple angles. The reduced computational requirements and high accuracy make this approach suitable for real-time applications, thereby enhancing its practicality for various human identification tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10816325","Person identification;suspects/criminal identification;face recognition;knowledge distillation;ensemble method","Face recognition;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Data models;Computer architecture;Accuracy;Real-time systems;Convolutional neural networks;Residual neural networks;Lighting","","","","47","CCBYNCND","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MGs offer a flexible and efficient framework for accommodating dispersed energy resources. However, the intermittent nature of renewable sources, coupled with the rising demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) and fast charging stations (FCSs), poses significant challenges to the stability and efficiency of microgrid (MG) operations. These challenges stem from the uncertainties in both energy generation and fluctuating demand patterns, making efficient energy management in MG a complex task. This study introduces a novel model-free strategy for real-time energy management in MG aimed at addressing uncertainties without the need for traditional uncertainty modeling techniques. Unlike conventional methods, the proposed approach enhances MG performance by minimizing power losses and operational costs. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with well-defined objectives. To optimize decision-making, an actor-critic-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is developed, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt dynamically to changing system conditions. Comprehensive numerical simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The results show a total cost of 51.8770 €ct/kWh, representing a reduction of 3.19% compared to the Dueling Deep Q Network (Dueling DQN) and 4% compared to the Deep Q Network (DQN). This highlights the robustness and scalability of the proposed model-free approach for modern MG energy management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824795","DDPG;RESs;Energy Management;FCSs;Microgrid;EVs","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this study, a long time series of high spatial resolution (0.5 and 1 m) satellite remote sensing images from 2010 to 2020 were used to monitor the early invasion period of S. alterniflora. Using remote sensing technology, the early invasion behavior of S. alterniflora at patch scale was monitored and analyzed in the Yellow River Delta with the object-oriented image segmentation and support vector machine classification methods. The results indicate that the discrete patches were incorporated into bigger patches or gathering regions within a few years: 56.13% of the independent large patches lasted only for 1 year, and only 0.25% of which can last for 10 years. Second, we newly found out that the newborn S. alterniflora seedlings are uniformly distributed between discrete large patches and then quickly aggregate into a large gathering area within the next 2 years. Third, for the area that was undergoing invasion, the mean S. alterniflora coverage rate was stable at approximately 50%. Fourth, dominant factors that determined the invasion trend of S. alterniflora are the elevation of the intertidal zone, the tidal channel distribution and the topographic changes caused by S. alterniflora invasion.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3506985","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFC3105100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42076189,42106179); Open Project of National Engineering Laboratory for Integrated Aero-Space-Ground-Ocean Big Data Application Technology; China High-Resolution Earth Observation System Program(grant numbers:41-Y30F07-9001-20/22); Postdoctoral Applied Research Project of Intelligent Remote Sensing Monitoring of Spartina alterniflora based on Aero-Space field; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10771951","High-resolution remote sensing;invasion of alien species;  $Spartina\ alterniflora$  ;Yellow River delta","Remote sensing;Rivers;Monitoring;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Time series analysis;Sea measurements;Image segmentation;Wetlands;Sediments","","","","58","CCBY","29 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed device is used in the evaluation of the disturbance voltage in conductive emissions; its purpose is to stabilize the common-mode (CM) impedance (150 ± 20 Ω) in the 100 kHz ‒ 10 MHz frequency range, which corresponds to the operating frequencies of railroad signaling devices called “balises.” The balises are installed on railroad tracks and used for communication between trains and wayside systems, and electromagnetic compatibility between rolling stock and the balises are severe problem. In the design of the CMISD, we considered two factors: the ferrite core size of the CM inductor and the heat dissipation in the resistors. In the CM inductor, we assumed realistic conditions to reduce its core mass to ~3.4 kg. Regarding heat dissipation, considering that the negative terminal of a railroad vehicle with DC feeding voltage must be grounded, we assumed that square-wave peak voltage is applied directly to the CM circuit of the CMISD. The experimental results showed that the power dissipation in the CR series circuit in the CMISD was proportional to the carrier frequency, capacitance, and the square of the line voltage. Eventually, we fabricated a prototype CMISD, which can withstand the heat generated when applying a 750-V DC input voltage at a 3-kHz carrier frequency for five minutes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820542","Electromagnetic measurements;electromagnetic interference;impedance;inverters;rail transportation;railway engineering","Inverters;Impedance;Inductors;Voltage measurement;Electromagnetic interference;Standards;Magnetic cores;IEC Standards;Voltage;Electromagnetic compatibility","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

At the same time, malicious clients may submit forged and malicious gradients during model training. Such behavior not only compromises the integrity of the global model, but also diminishes the usability and reliability of trained models. To effectively address such privacy and security attack issues, this work proposes a Blockchain-based Privacy-preserving and Secure Federated Learning (BPS-FL) scheme, which employs the threshold homomorphic encryption to protect the local gradients of clients.

Following the PRISMA guideline, relevant literature was searched using the Scopus database, and retrieved from the corresponding publisher sites. The selected studies focused on predicting the unplanned capability loss factor or the availability of power plants within the electricity industry domain. A thematic analysis was performed to identify emerging patterns related to current knowledge. Results revealed that prediction studies focus more on predicting availability than failure in coal-fired plants. The prediction horizon is mainly short-term, mostly in renewable plant.

The provision of near-real-time monitoring of fractional snow cover (FSC) in China is essential to bolster disaster management initiatives. The medium-resolution spectral imager (MERSI-II), aboard the FengYun-3D satellite, presents significant capabilities for effective snow monitoring. The aim of this article was to enhance the multiple endmember spectral mixture algorithm based on automatic extraction of endmembers for estimating FY-3D/MERSI-II FSC in China. The accuracy of these estimations was corroborated using 30-m FSC maps derived from Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. This validation process resulted in RMSE and R2 values of 0.13 and 0.88, respectively, across 253 OLI-based FSC scenes. The article examined and analyzed the effects of diverse land cover types and complex terrain on the FSC estimates, focusing specifically on three major snow-covered areas in China. In comparison to areas with cultivated land and sparse vegetation, bare surfaces yielded the most accurate results, whereas forest regions showed the lowest accuracy. The comparative analysis revealed that the Tibetan Plateau and Northern Xinjiang achieved high accuracy in mapping snow cover. The maps of Northeast China were less precise, largely due to the prevalence of forests. Additionally, while the MERSI-II FSC is effective in monitoring snow cover on flat plains, its performance is less reliable in steep terrain. Moreover, the comparison between MERSI-II and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer FSC indicated that MERSI-II has a marked advantage in areas with substantial snow cover.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3517845","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFF0801302); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42171317); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10801227","Fractional snow cover (FSC) area;FY-3D;spectral mixture analysis (SMA);validation","Snow;Power capacitors;Earth;Artificial satellites;MODIS;Reflectivity;Monitoring;Spatial resolution;Normalized difference vegetation index;Accuracy","","","","55","CCBY","16 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the complex intractable regions in satellite images (textureless regions, repeated texture regions, occlusion regions) pose serious challenges for accurate disparity estimation. To enhance the matching accuracy within intractable regions, a dual branch multiscale stereo matching network for high-resolution satellite stereo images is proposed. First, a dual branch feature extraction module is designed, which can perform efficient downsampling. This module can enhance the scene awareness capability of the model, enabling it to extract multiscale feature maps and construct multiscale cost volumes. Then, the cost aggregation process is executed in a coarse-to-fine manner. The method employs a simple hourglass structure and leverages low-scale information to guide the aggregation of high-scale cost volumes. Next, a disparity-channel attention mechanism is proposed for the cost aggregation process to obtain more representative feature information. Finally, a simple disparity refinement module is designed by utilizing both intensity and gradient information of the left image to improve the local details of the disparity map. Experiments are performed separately on the GaoFen-7 and US3D datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is conducive to improving the matching accuracy within intractable regions of satellite images. The structure of the proposed network is simple, which can effectively reduce the network parameters and realize the lightweight of the model.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3502842","Fundamental Applied Research Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2022JH2/101300273); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10758818","Disparity-channel attention;dual branch feature extraction (DBFE);satellite remote sensing stereo images;stereo matching","Costs;Feature extraction;Satellites;Accuracy;Remote sensing;Three-dimensional displays;Satellite images;Deep learning;Convolution;Estimation","","","","38","CCBY","20 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inspired by an autoencoder with powerful unsupervised feature extraction, we propose a new deep learning (DL) model for BDS signal recognition that places a long short-term memory (LSTM) module in series with a convolutional sparse autoencoder to create a new autoencoder structure. First, we propose to capture the temporal correlations in long-duration BeiDou satellite time-series signals by using the LSTM module to mine the temporal change patterns in the time series.

However, this work considers a more realistic and challenging setting, Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL), where clients have a large amount of unlabeled data and only the server hosts a small number of labeled samples. How to reasonably utilize the server-side labeled data and the client-side unlabeled data is the core challenge in this setting. In this paper, we propose a new FSSL algorithm for image classification based on consistency regularization and ensemble knowledge distillation, called EKDFSSL. Our algorithm uses the global model as the teacher in consistency regularization methods to enhance both the accuracy and stability of client-side unsupervised learning on unlabeled data. Besides, we introduce an additional ensemble knowledge distillation loss to mitigate model overfitting during server-side retraining on labeled data.

In this article, a high-precision and automatic landing point visual localization method with high-resolution map generation is proposed, including initial localization of the first frame, hybrid fine matching, landing point propagation in descent sequence images, and absolute position estimation for landing point.

Thus, this study investigated the impact of underground conduits on network robustness during earthquakes. An actual conduit dataset was considered, including tens of thousands of conduits with their attributes (struc-ture, material, length, and age) and damage status from past earthquake inspections. We employed a conduit damage prediction technique, a machine learning method developed in infrastructure engineering, and evaluated the robustness of regional communication networks with and without conduit attributes. The evaluation results revealed that the estimated outage scales could differ by a maximum factor of seven, depending on the conduit attri-butes. Additionally, a what-if analysis for conduit upgrades was conducted, which involved recognizing conduit attributes. These findings support the significance of facility factors in network assessment during natural disasters, and open up a new inter-disciplinary research field between infrastructure engineering and telecommunication networks.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.001.2300741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10599125","","Earthquakes;Buildings;Robustness;Disasters;Reliability;Hazards;Telecommunication network reliability","","","","15","IEEE","15 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In contrast, distributed air-source heat pumps in residential areas have a substantial untapped potential to support fast frequency response services. This paper seeks to integrate them into the existing services through a controller upgrade. We analyze the influence of air-source heat pumps' inherent complex thermal dynamics on fast frequency response services, revealing control challenges posed by unpredictable operating condition changes. Such a challenge is tackled with a standard droop control structure which is tuned through ${{H}_\infty }$ method, guaranteeing practical and stable operations within the permitted operating condition range.

Aging raises questions about how declines in auditory and visual processing affect cross-modal attention switching. This study used a cued cross-modal attention-switching paradigm where visual and auditory stimuli were simultaneously presented on either spatially congruent or incongruent sides. A modality cue indicated the target modality, requiring a spatially left versus right key-press response. EEG recordings were collected during task performance. We investigated whether the mixing costs (decreased performance for repetition trials in a mixed task compared with a single task) and switch costs (decreased performance for a switch of target modality compared with a repetition) in cross-modal attention-switching paradigms would exhibit similarities in terms of behavioral performance and the ERP components to those observed in the traditional unimodal attention-switching paradigms. Specifically, we focused on the ERP components: cue-locked P3 (mixing/switch-related increased positivity), target-locked P3 (mixing/switch-related decreased positivity), and target-locked lateralized readiness potential (mixing/switch-related longer latency). In addition, we assessed how aging impacts cross-modal attention-switching performance. Results revealed that older adults exhibited more pronounced mixing and switch costs than younger adults, especially when visual and auditory stimuli were presented on incongruent sides. ERP findings showed increased cue-locked P3 amplitude, prolonged cue-locked P3 latency, decreased target-locked P3 amplitude, prolonged target-locked P3 latency in association with switch costs, and prolonged onset latency of the target-locked lateralized readiness potential in association with the mixing costs. Age-related effects were significant only for cue-locked P3 amplitude, cue-locked P3 latency (switch-related), and target-locked P3 latency (switch-related). These findings suggest that the larger mixing costs and switch costs in older adults were due to the inefficient use of modality cues to update a representation of the relevant task sets, requiring more processing time for evaluating and categorizing the target.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_02248","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:STE 2466/1-1); National Science and Technology Council(grant numbers:109-2923-H-006-002-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824758","","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

To ensure stability, dynamic compatibility constraints related to all the uncertain deviations are established and incorporated into the optimization problem. Additionally, the constraint restriction method is employed to satisfy physical constraints and optimize performance in the presence of external perturbations.

Furthermore, velocity simulations estimated the relative velocity of the brushes to the duct wall. Additionally, the results of the grease cleaning experiment conducted using the proposed machine were discussed. The aim was to clean accumulated grease within ducts using a single robot to prevent duct fires. It is difficult for conventional duct cleaning robots to clean grease because they do not consider the distinct properties inherent to grease, characterized by its elevated viscosity and tenacious adhesion. This study described the design and experiments of the cleaning machine, which enabled the machine to scrub the entire inner wall of a duct at a relative velocity of the brushes of 60 mm/s or higher, required to scrub off grease from the duct. The cleaning rate of the grease by the proposed machine was up to 80 % which is 2.3 times higher than in a previous study, and the proposed machine is expected to remove most of the grease accumulated in ducts.

Through comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple medical benchmarks (MedProb, MedNER, MedQuAD), we demonstrate that PRISM-Med achieves consistent performance improvements, with gains of up to 10.1% in medical QA tasks and 2.7% in medical knowledge evaluation compared to traditional fine-tuning baselines.

This approach improves resource sharing, mitigating resource idleness within the platform. In addition, we present experiments to support the technical feasibility of the proposed approach. The proposed solution offers an alternative to code generation methods, with the potential to optimize resource utilization while preserving the flexibility to adapt to changes in data models as business needs evolve.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525639","Coordena??o de Aperfei?oamento de Pessoal de N?vel Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824762","Model Driven Engineering;Low Code Development;Model Interpretation;Multi-tenancy Single Instance;Separation of Concerns","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To mitigate these problems, we propose a spatiotemporal fusion network for remote sensing based on a global context (GC) attention mechanism. This network comprises an extracting feature network and a difference network. In the difference network, we introduce a GC attention mechanism that focuses on crucial details across various features, assuming different roles in different modules. A GC attention-based U-block (GCAU) employs a U-structured design and integrates GC attention mechanisms into every layer of its architecture. This enables the module to effectively process regions with pronounced spatial heterogeneity and to adeptly capture spatial differential information. A GC layer (GCL) block comprises five interconnected GC attention blocks interspersed with local residuals. During the training process, these residuals assist in rectifying missing data and bolstering feature transfer, thereby enabling the module to more effectively capture temporally dynamic changes in rapidly evolving areas. This allows the module to better capture time-based changes in fast-changing areas. Supervision of both the final output and intermediate difference images is facilitated by a composite loss function, which improves the fusion quality in the temporal, spatial, and visual domains. The model's robustness and superiority are validated through experimental testing on three datasets, accompanied by subjective and objective evaluations, as well as ablation experiments.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3505874","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62331008,62027827,62221005,62276040); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing Municipality(grant numbers:2023NSCQ-LZX0045,CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX0436); Special Funding for Postdoctoral Research Projects of Chongqing(grant numbers:2022CQBSHTB3103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10766929","Global context (GC);global context attention-based U-block (GCAU);global context layer (GCL);remote sensing;spatiotemporal fusion","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Accuracy;Predictive models;MODIS;Landsat;Mathematical models","","","","41","CCBYNCND","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study introduces an enhanced method for automatic sleep staging that addresses the challenges of low training efficiency and reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Initially, high-dimensional time-frequency features of EEG signals are extracted using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT), transforming unidimensional signal data into multidimensional image datasets. Subsequently, the deep-seated temporal and spectral features of sleep stages are unearthed and learned through an improved ResNet-18 residual network, facilitating the automated classification of sleep stages. The proposed method demonstrated a classification accuracy of 85.71% on seven selected full-night recordings from the Sleep-EDF dataset, with a macro-average F1-score of 85.05%. Comparisons with other methods confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving sleep quality evaluation and diagnosis.

By analyzing cellular interactions, biomedical experts can gain a more accurate understanding of the intricate relationships between cancer and immune cells. Recent methods have focused on inferring interaction based on the proximity of cells in low-resolution 2D multi-channel imaging data. By contrast, we analyze cell interactions by quantifying the presence and levels of specific proteins within a tissue sample (protein expressions) extracted from high-resolution 3D multi-channel volume data. Such analyses have a strong exploratory nature and require a tight integration of domain experts in the analysis loop to leverage their deep knowledge. We propose two complementary semi-automated approaches to cope with the increasing size and complexity of the data interactively: On the one hand, we interpret cell-to-cell interactions as edges in a cell graph and analyze the image signal (protein expressions) along those edges, using spatial as well as abstract visualizations. Complementary, we propose a cell-centered approach, enabling scientists to visually analyze polarized distributions of proteins in three dimensions, which also captures neighboring cells with biochemical and cell biological consequences. We evaluate our application in three case studies, where biologists and medical experts use Cell2Cell to investigate tumor micro-environments to identify and quantify T-cell activation in human tissue data.

However, when multiple targets are present over the radar surveillance region, incorrect target associations to the measurements could create ghost targets. Computationally efficient and accurate de-ghosting and tracking multiple targets are critical tasks in real-time distributed radar systems. By exploiting the geometry of the measurement model in the association process, we propose a novel and efficient data association approach followed by a tracking algorithm in this work. It utilizes the time-of-arrival and bistatic Doppler frequency measurements of the targets with respect to different transmitter–receiver pairs to accurately determine and track the 3-D positions and velocities of the targets. The proposed approach is nonparametric as it does not need any assumption on the initial states or the number of targets and their motion models, but only uses the knowledge of the geometry of the terrestrial radar sensors. This nonparametric data association and tracking (NPDAT) algorithm is tested with multiple targets in two significant scenarios. First, all the targets are simultaneously present in the region, and then, targets arrive and depart the region based on a random arrival pattern. Our approach precisely tracks targets even during crossover and also tracks fast-maneuvering targets. This NPDAT algorithm is compared with popular existing methods and is shown to exhibit superior performance in estimation accuracy and maneuvering target tracking ability, even while enjoying a significantly lower time and implementation complexity.","2836-2071","","10.1109/JSAS.2024.3517513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10803016","Data association;deghosting;geometrical approach;localization;multitarget tracking;multistatic radar","Target tracking;Radar tracking;Receivers;Transmitters;Doppler effect;Multistatic radar;Poles and towers;Surveillance;Real-time systems;Computational modeling","","","","28","CCBY","16 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Effectively allocating resources and controlling the system to ensure task timeliness remains an open problem. The age of information (AoI) is a metric to measure the freshness of information that circulates in a system. While the AoI is primarily influenced by packet generation rate, transmission latency, and queuing delays, the processing time becomes notably significant when dealing with Internet-of-Things (IoT) computationally intensive tasks. Such IoT applications necessitate processing before embedded information can emerge and status can be acquired. This paper proposes a combined system control and resource assignment policy, in new-generation EC environments, where edge nodes have limited capacity and task flows are computationally intensive. The objective is to assign task flows to dedicated resource capacity, minimizing the worst AoI experienced by flows. For this purpose, three problem formulations for the flow-resource assignment are considered: i) the assignment with fixed arrival and service processes; ii) the service process control problem; iii) the arrival process control problem. For each problem formulated, a matching game with externalities is designed, and preference lists are built considering the mean AoI of an M/G/1 system, here exploited as reference model to represent each computation partition. The stability of matching games proposed is investigated, and experimental results are presented to highlight the validity of the matching approaches, providing critical discussion about the performance impact of the three problems addressed, also compared with a reservoir learning approach. The proposed matching algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art Deferred Acceptance method by achieving a lower maximum AoI, thereby meeting the optimization objective. It also demonstrates improved performance over the data-driven approach. While comparable maximum AoI values can be attained with sufficiently large training datasets, the proposed algorithm consistently yields superior results.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2025.3525997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824833","age of information;matching theory;resource allocation;edge computing","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To enhance computational efficiency, this paper proposes a general simplification and acceleration method for distribution system optimization problems. Firstly, the capacity boundary and voltage boundary model of distribution systems are established. The relative position between the two boundaries reflects the strength of capacity and voltage constraints, leading to the definition of two critical feeder lengths (CFLs) to quantify these strengths. Secondly, simplification criteria and an acceleration method are proposed. Given a distribution system, if the distance from the end load/DG node to the slack bus is less than the corresponding CFL, we can conclude that the capacity constraints are stricter than the voltage constraints. Then, the distribution system can be simplified by adopting DC power flow model or disregarding the voltage constraints. After that, the reference value tables of CFL are presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by exemplifying the method in network reconfiguration and reactive power optimization problems. By implementing the proposed acceleration method, a significant reduction in computation time is achieved while ensuring accuracy. This method applies to most urban distribution systems in optimization problems involving power flow equations or voltage constraints.","2367-0983","","10.23919/PCMP.2023.000210","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52177105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10811844","Distribution system;optimization problem;power flow equation;security region;simplification criteria;acceleration method;network reconfiguration;reactive power optimization","Economics;Reactive power;Computational modeling;Optimization models;Voltage;Relaxation methods;Protection;Optimization;Load flow;Load modeling","","","","35","","23 Dec 2024","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

Four calibration models (two-coefficient inverse, squared inverse, and logarithmic; and three-coefficient inverse), four fiducial points (wave onset, peak, maximum derivative, and tangents’ intersection), and three wavelengths (red, infrared (IR), and green) were compared to estimate BP on 5-min segments and single beats. Finger systolic and diastolic BP (DBP) served as reference. Estimation errors were higher for systolic than DBP. Acceptable (<5 mmHg) median absolute errors (MAEs) for 5-min average systolic BP (SBP) were achieved by combining red or IR wavelengths with inverse or squared-inverse calibrations. For single-beat estimates, MAEs were higher but remained <8 mmHg with red or IR wavelengths, maximum derivative or tangents’ intersection fiducial points, and two-coefficient calibrations. Short-term BP estimation from finger PAT is feasible by properly combining calibration models, wavelengths, and fiducial points. Identifying the optimal parameters for estimating BP from finger PAT by PPG, this study contributes to the development of noninvasive devices for accurate and continuous BP monitoring both in clinical settings and in the general population.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2024.3486565","Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente 2024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10746349","Arterial blood pressure (BP);cuffless device;hypertension detection;light-emitting diode (LED);photodiode (PD);pulse wave","Fingers;Calibration;Monitoring;Protocols;Light emitting diodes;Wavelength measurement;Electrocardiography;Blood;Biomedical monitoring;Time measurement","","","","28","CCBY","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the difficulty of mining increases, pools may develop competition strategies to reduce time and increase the rewards for mining blocks. This study investigates these strategies by examining whether mining pools in an alliance can perform selective broadcasting, hold mined blocks, and impose fork attacks. We developed algorithms to conduct simulation solutions based on the consensus mechanism of the Bitcoin operation, except for the hash function execution. The calculation results are replaced with two types of balls that represent hash values that satisfy the threshold of the mined block. The simulation algorithms were validated by comparing them with the expected average mining times. The results revealed a bias of less than 4%. Twelve simulation cases with various holding thresholds, holding periods, and forks for strategic alliance mining pools were simulated and evaluated. The results show that the mining rates of alliance mining pools increase, which means that the reward increases. The effects of these strategies on the winning rate reached 21.77% when the top three mining pools were constructed as alliances with withholding and imposing fork strategies. The effect of the average mining time is evaluated for mining pools with the same computing power distribution as practical mining pools for the Bitcoin system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3522962","National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), Taiwan(grant numbers:NSTC 112-2410-H-305-019-MY2); University System of Taipei Joint Research Program(grant numbers:USTP-NTUT-NTPU-111-02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10816399","Alliance;blockchain;fork;holding threshold;mining pool;mining difficulty;proof-of-work","Blockchains;Bitcoin;Consensus protocol;Broadcasting;Proof of Work;Games;Urban areas;Uncertainty;Timing;Throughput","","","","40","CCBY","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerous models have been proposed in recent years for building evacuation during fire emergencies. However, many of these models fail to adequately account for variations in individuals’ environmental knowledge and health status, both of which can critically affect the evacuation process. To address this gap, this study introduces an agent-based model for building evacuation that differentiates between individuals familiar with the building layout and those who are not, and considers the health status of occupants. The resulting model assigned specific evacuation strategies tailored to each group within the building. Simulations conducted in a hospital setting demonstrate that incorporating factors such as familiarity with a building’s configuration and the health status of evacuees results in more realistic and effective evacuation outcomes. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed model and highlight the significance of our contribution, we conducted multiple simulations in various high-risk settings and presented a benchmarking study comparing our model with several existing models from the literature.

However, it is significantly degrading due to human activities and natural disasters, making it essential to monitor both urban greenery and the overall urban environment. Recent advancements in remote sensing and deep learning technologies have led to the development of semantic change detection (SCD) techniques, which offer more detailed analysis than binary change detection. Detecting changes in natural greenery within urban environments using general SCD techniques is challenging due to the similar spectral characteristics of natural and artificial greenery. Therefore, this study proposes a direct SCD approach focusing on urban green spaces and nongreenery-related changes. This approach distinguishes between new and degraded greenery regions and categorizes them into distinct classes alongside nongreenery changes. Key innovations include the integration of atrous spatial pyramid pooling and an updated spatial attention module, enhancing the network's ability to capture objects of varying shapes and sizes within urban settings. The methodology was evaluated using two open-source datasets, SEmantic Change detectiON Dataset (SECOND) and Wuhan urban sematic understanding (WUSU), customized to emphasize urban greenery changes. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the existing SCD techniques in accurately detecting and categorizing new and degraded greenery regions alongside overall urban changes. The proposed method achieved superior performance in terms of separated kappa, reaching 17.72% on the SECOND dataset and 36.18% on the WUSU dataset.

WeBPM integrates advanced finger oscillographic BP measurement technology to provide reliable self-calibration functionality. Moreover, Pulsatile Cycle Volume Adjustment Method (PCVAM) we proposed for the closed-loop phase can continuously track changes in vasomotor tone under a controlled frequency based on pulsatile cycles, thereby enabling continuous BP measurement.

As our main contribution, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) model for determining whether there exists a globally stable matching in bipartite graphs, which has been proved to be NP-hard. Since the time consumed for solving ILPs might dramatically increase as the size of instances grows, we develop a preprocessing technique that helps to eliminate pairs that will never be a member of any globally stable matching and thus accelerates the computing process. We perform experiments on randomly generated preference lists and observe a significant speedup when we preprocess the instance before solving the ILPs. As there does not need to exist a perfect matching that is stable for all given criteria, we extend our ILP to the optimized version of the aforementioned problem, which asks to find a matching with maximum cardinality that is stable among all matched agents.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2023.9010135","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12371321,12071460); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10786943","stable matching;multi-modal;integer linear programming (ILP)","Integer linear programming;Approximation algorithms;Linear programming;Bipartite graph","","","","17","","9 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, objects with different functional attributes may exhibit similar physical characteristics, resulting in comparable spectral reflectance and visual features. This issue, known as the “different categories with the same spectra” problem, limits the ability to discriminate between objects, thereby increasing the difficulty of differentiation. Studies based on Euclidean space often struggle to distinguish between objects due to the limited information available. To improve differentiation, additional information—such as neighborhood relationships—needs to be incorporated. The geographical scenario, i.e., the environmental context of the object—which includes crucial neighborhood categories and their spatial relationships, provides spatial relationship information for objects. This information provides an important context for object differentiation and becomes the key to distinguishing these similar objects. Following this idea, geographical scenarios are represented as graphs in graph space, with categories as nodes and adjacency relationships as edges, and a geographical knowledge graph is created based on all the scenarios. We convert the remote sensing images into graphs to match with the geographical scenarios and propose a knowledge-based semantic segmentation network for remote sensing, graph structure attention network (GSAN). In GSAN, a graph structure attention (GSAT) is designed based on the graph kernel. This allows it to discern graph structures corresponding to different geographical scenarios. GSAT serves as a link between the fine-grained visual objects and the coarse-grained semantic knowledge. Experiment results indicate that GSAN outperforms other attention networks in semantic segmentation on our sea and land remote sensing (SLRS) dataset. This demonstrates its advantages in geographical scenario recognition and remote sensing semantic segmentation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3521238","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0810605); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10811991","Geographical scenario;graph kernel;graph structure attention (GSAT);knowledge graph;remote sensing","Kernel;Remote sensing;Knowledge graphs;Semantic segmentation;Semantics;Object recognition;Attention mechanisms;Sensors;Image edge detection;Topology","","","","56","CCBY","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the fused dataset, we examined the radiative properties of DCSs across different stages of their lifecycle and the influence of environmental factors and aerosols on them. Radiative heating rates showed distinct variations, with mature stages exhibiting the highest shortwave heating and longwave cooling rates due to denser and higher cloud tops. Our findings reveal the role of humidity in increasing cloud top heights and the influence of vertical wind shear on convection development.

We then train and validate this pipeline using a small dataset acquired from real-world PICU settings with a Microsoft Kinect camera, achieving an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric of 85%. Results: Both quantitative and qualitative analyses underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed framework yields an overall classification performance with 92.5% accuracy, 93.8% recall, 90.3% precision, and 92.0% F1-score. Consequently, the proposed method consistently improves the predictions across all metrics, with an average of 2.75% gain in performance compared to the baseline CNN-based framework. Conclusions: Our proposed hybrid approach significantly enhances the segmentation of occlusions in remote patient monitoring within PICU settings. This advancement contributes to improving the quality of care for pediatric patients, addressing a critical need in clinical practice by ensuring more accurate and reliable remote monitoring.","2644-1276","","10.1109/OJEMB.2024.3503499","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Institut de Valorisation des données de l'Université de Montréal; Fonds de la recherche en sante du Quebec; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10758753","Computer vision;data augmentation;deep learning;model fusion;occlusions;pediatrics intensive care;remote patient monitoring (RPM);segmentation","Image segmentation;Data models;Accuracy;Semantics;Pipelines;Training;Transformers;Semantic segmentation;Patient monitoring;Training data","","","","25","CCBY","20 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They have shown potential in a variety of tasks, including linear algebra, search problems, Gibbs, and ground state preparation. Nevertheless, the presence of noise in current day quantum hardware severely limits their performance. In this work, we introduce dissipative variational quantum algorithms (D-VQAs) by incorporating dissipative operations, such as qubit RESET and stochastic gates, as an intrinsic part of a variational quantum circuit. We argue that such dissipative variational algorithms possess some natural resilience to dissipative noise. We demonstrate how such algorithms can prepare Gibbs states over a wide range of quantum many-body Hamiltonians and temperatures, while significantly reducing errors due to both coherent and noncoherent noise. An additional advantage of our approach is that no ancilla qubits are need.

However, traditional TDOM generation methods rely on precise prior geometric information, and this reliance makes it difficult to adapt to such complex environments. In this work, we propose TDOM-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field (NeRF) based method for large-scale urban TDOM generation. Without relying on additional prior information, our method utilizes multiview unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images as input and implicitly expresses the scene using hash grid features and multilayer perceptrons. By performing orthogonal volume rendering on the reconstruction results of the scene, we effectively address the problem of uneven scales in the synthetic views when generating TDOM. In actual training, we adopt a scene-block training strategy to extend our method to TDOM generation of large-scale scenes while achieving high-fidelity scene reconstruction. In addition, we regularize the model during training to eliminate erroneous “floating objects” in scene reconstruction, making our method applicable to low-overlap UAV datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates TDOMs with comparable geometric accuracy and eliminates issues such as ghosting, misalignment, and distortion in challenging areas, compared to commercial photogrammetry software like Metashape and Pix4DMapper. Furthermore, our method exhibits superior novel view synthesis performance compared to advanced NeRF methods like Ortho-NeRF. Our pipeline offers a flexible configuration of scene blocking, enabling a balance between performance and efficiency, which makes it particularly suitable for large-scale scene reconstruction.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3491869","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41871296); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10742919","Large-scale urban scene;neural radiance field (NeRF);true digital orthophoto map (TDOM)","Neural radiance field;Training;Rendering (computer graphics);Image reconstruction;Accuracy;Three-dimensional displays;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Point cloud compression;Buildings;Urban areas","","","","63","CCBYNCND","5 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, the scanning context method is used to preprocess LIDAR point cloud data, generating a descriptor of the environment. This descriptor, along with data from the IMU and vision sensors, is then used for state estimation, yielding initial pose estimates and motion information. Then, the scan context module uses the descriptor for environment recognition and loop closure detection, providing more accurate feature description and context information for fast loop closure matching. It avoids ignoring the spatial relationship and order between features due to the local feature description of DBoW2, and improves the accuracy and robustness of loop closure detection. Finally, global optimization is performed to correct accumulated errors in the entire trajectory and map. In KAIST02 and Riverside01 sequences of MulRan dataset, the root mean square error of the absolute pose error of the proposed method is reduced by 85.17% and 91.30% compared with LVI-SAM, respectively.

Recently, transformer has become proficient in attending to global information due to their self-attention mechanisms, yet they may fall short in capturing multiscale features of HSI. To address these limitations, a global–local multigranularity transformer (GLMGT) network is proposed for HSI classification. The GLMGT combines CNN with the transformer to comprehensively capture multigranularity spectral and spatial features across global and local scales. Specifically, we introduce a multigranularity spatial feature extraction block to extensively extract spatial information at different granularities, including multiscale local spatial features and global spatial features. In addition, we introduce a multigranularity spectral feature extraction block to fully leverage spectral information across different granularities.

However, traditional methods have long posed challenges for researchers due to their excessive reliance on manual effort. With the advancement of deep learning, automatic modulation recognition has emerged as a promising solution. Nonetheless, most existing deep learning-based modulation recognition studies consider only single-domain feature information of the signal, such as time-domain or frequency-domain features. To further enhance recognition performance, this paper proposes a novel multi-feature input fusion network. By utilizing different representations and processing methods of the signal, the proposed approach designs distinct feature extraction networks tailored to specific processed signals, leveraging the characteristics of convolution kernels with varying sizes and receptive fields.

Experimental results on the publicly available RML2016.10a dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves highly efficient recognition above 2 dB, with accuracy approaching 100%. Testing with real-world signals collected under realistic channel conditions using USRP devices further confirms the model’s superior performance, achieving an effective recognition rate of 99.27% when the two USRP devices are in close proximity.

These networks serve as fundamental models for various networked systems, usually characterized by modular structures. Understanding these structures, also known as communities, and the mechanisms driving their evolution is vital, as changes in one module can impact the entire network. Traditional static network analysis falls short of capturing the full complexity of dynamic networks, prompting a shift toward understanding the underlying mechanisms driving their evolution. Graph Evolution Rules (GERs) have emerged as a promising approach, explaining how subgraphs transform into new configurations. In this paper, we comprehensively explore GERs in dynamic networks from diverse systems with a focus on the rules characterizing the formation and evolution of their modular structures, using EvoMine for GER extraction and the Leiden algorithm for community detection. We characterize network and module evolution through GER profiles, enabling cross-system comparisons. By combining GERs and network communities, we decompose network evolution into regions to uncover insights into global and mesoscopic network evolution patterns. From a mesoscopic standpoint, the evolution patterns characterizing communities emphasize a non-homogeneous nature, with each community, or groups of them, displaying specific evolution patterns, while other networks' communities follow more uniform evolution patterns. Additionally, closely interconnected sets of communities tend to evolve similarly. Our findings offer valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms governing the growth and development of dynamic networks and their communities, shedding light on the interplay between modular structures and evolving network dynamics.","2097-406X","","10.26599/BDMA.2024.9020050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807240","graph evolution mining;subgraph mining;social networks;evolution profile;Graph Evolution Rule (GER);financial networks","Heuristic algorithms;Pipelines;Ecosystems;Data visualization;Network analyzers;Transforms;Market research;Stress;Optimization;Lenses","","","","57","","19 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Integrating independent information from different EM datasets in a joint inversion results in a more precise and reliable resistivity model. To conduct an efficient joint inversion, it is crucial to understand the resolution characteristics of each EM technique and configuration. To enhance the interpretation using 1-D joint inversion of multiple EM datasets in a former mining area in eastern Thuringia (Germany), we developed a novel workflow for systematic resolution studies. Rather than focusing on limited resistivity models, our approach provides a broader perspective on the resolution characteristics of specific EM methods. The workflow is applied to helicopter-borne EM (HEM), semi-airborne EM (Semi-AEM), and long-offset transient EM datasets. Resolution studies reveal not only the advantages and limitations of each method but also demonstrate scenarios where joint inversion benefits. These insights are useful to optimally design multimethod applications. A synthetic 1-D joint inversion example successfully reconstructs the true model, while each individual method fails. This example demonstrates the added value of our presented resolution study workflow with respect to experimental design and acquiring optimal data in terms of resolution capabilities. We provide a toolkit for resolution analysis that serves as a roadmap for multimethod studies.

Fifteen participants (23.3 ± 1.8 years) trained with combined BFR and NMES on the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) muscle, with maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of wrist extension, along with force and EMG in the ECRL and extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), measured during a designate force-tracking before and after training. Factor analysis identified latent modes influencing motor unit coordination between the ECRB and ECRL. The results showed a significant decrease in MVC after training (p < 0.001). Post-test force fluctuations increased (p = 0.031), along with a decrease in the mean inter-spike interval (M_ISI) in the ECRL (p = 0.022). Factor analysis revealed an increase in the proportion of motor units (MUs) jointly regulated by the neural mode for both ECRB and ECRL, coupled with a decline in independently regulated MUs. Specifically, the proportion of MUs governed by the ECRL mode decreased, while those regulated by the ECRB mode increased. In conclusion, force generation capacity and force scaling are impaired after receiving combined NMES and BFR treatment. It involves redistribution of the common drive to MUs within two agonists, affecting the flexible coordination of muscle synergy and necessitating compensatory recruitment of MUs from the less fatigable agonist.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2025.3525517","the ministry of science and technology?

This paper tests the reliability and applicability of Explainable AI (XAI) methods using a deep learning method that predicts CP by analyzing skeletal data extracted from video recordings of infant movements. Specifically, we use XAI evaluation metrics — namely faithfulness and stability — to quantitatively assess the reliability of Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) in this specific medical application. We utilize a unique dataset of infant movements and apply skeleton data perturbations without distorting the original dynamics of the infant movements. Our CP prediction model utilizes an ensemble approach, so we evaluate the XAI metrics performances for both the overall ensemble and the individual models. Our findings indicate that both XAI methods effectively identify key body points influencing CP predictions and that the explanations are robust against minor data perturbations. Grad-CAM significantly outperforms CAM in the Relative Input Stability velocity (RISv) metric, which measures stability in terms of velocity. In contrast, CAM performs better in the Relative Input Stability bone (RISb) metric, which relates to bone stability, and the Relative Representation Stability (RRS) metric, which assesses internal representation robustness. Individual models within the ensemble show varied results, and neither CAM nor Grad-CAM consistently outperform the other, with the ensemble approach providing a representation of outcomes from its constituent models. Both CAM and Grad-CAM also perform significantly better than random attribution, supporting the robustness of these XAI methods. Ourwork demonstrates that XAI methods can offer reliable and stable explanations for CP prediction models. Future studies should further investigate how the explanations can enhance our understanding of specific movement patterns characterizing healthy and pathological development.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525571","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(grant numbers:101034240); Norges Forskningsr?d(grant numbers:327146); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820328","explainable AI;CAM;Grad-CAM;skeleton data;Cerebral Palsy","Predictive models;Measurement;Stability analysis;Robustness;Perturbation methods;Pediatrics;Mathematical models;Deep learning;Data models;Cerebral palsy","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Climate change influences forest ecosystem dynamics with the potential for deadwood to emit carbon more rapidly due to accelerated decay and increased wildfires and increased inputs via mass forest mortality and disturbance events. To objectively inform our understanding of wildfires and associated carbon emissions, this study estimates the carbon content of dead fine woody debris (FWD) using multimodal data, such as Landsat-8 multispectral imagery, Sentinel-1 (C-band) and PALSAR (L-band) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, and terrain features to estimate the FWD of less than 0.25 in (1 h), 0.25–1 in (10 h), and 1–3 in (100 h). This data fusion provides spectral information to assess vegetation health that correlates with deadwood, as well as penetrability from SAR, resulting in structural information and biomass sensitivity. An ensemble machine learning (ML) model was trained using measurements from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database. A feature importance analysis was also performed to investigate the importance of input features to the model’s performance.

In engineering practice, the unbiased highly accelerated stress test (UHAST) without bias voltage is commonly used to evaluate the moisture and heat resistance of PEMs, but it cannot fully excite the potential defects of PEMs. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the biased highly accelerated stress test (BHAST) with bias voltage applied. In this paper, the BHAST test method for PEM was studied, and four different bias voltage application methods were set up. Four consecutive HAST tests were conducted, and failure analysis was conducted on the samples. It can be confirmed that the BHAST test mainly stimulated the corrosion failure of the aluminum solder pads in the bonding area of the PEMs. Comparing the failure situation of the samples, it was found that under the condition of voltage application method 4, the samples failed the fastest and the number of corroded bonding areas appeared the most.

In this paper, the relationship between the activity of different synergies and the center of mass kinematic patterns has been investigated; in particular, a group of healthy subjects has been recruited to perform simple sit-to-stand tasks, and the electromyographic data has been recorded for the extraction of muscle synergies. An optimal model selection criterion has been adopted for dividing the participants by the number of synergies characterizing their own control schema. Synergistic activity has then been mapped onto the phase-space description of the center of mass kinematics, investigating whether a different number of synergies implies the exploration of different region of the phase-space itself.

Recognizing the importance of thoughtful implementation of weak and strong augmentations within FixMatch, we propose a method that incorporates saliency map information into cutout augmentation. This approach preserves essential regions crucial for wafer defect pattern classification and thus improving model performance.

This study introduces an interactive semantic segmentation model based on multisource UAV flood images, incorporating four types of prompts. By embedding expert knowledge into the prompt design, the model reduces annotation costs and enhances generalization capabilities. First, a prompt encoder is developed to map different types of prompt information into a three-channel space using convolutional techniques, thereby reducing sample labeling costs. Moreover, an image encoder that integrates Mamba and convolution is developed to effectively extract global spatial and channel features from flood images while minimizing computational load. Finally, a spatial and channel attention module with residual connections is introduced to enable multiscale fusion and filtering of prompt information and image features across both spatial and channel dimensions, improving the utilization of prompt information. To validate the model's performance, we conduct experiments using UAV flood imagery collected from diverse regions, backgrounds, and angles.

Therefore, an optimized design of the battery is critical. On one hand, the design of batteries based on a single battery cell leads in many cases to oversized batteries in terms of energy or power, due to the diversity of requirements of the different electric vehicles. On the other hand, the use of a custom cell for each vehicle, optimized for its particular requirements, is not economically viable. Instead, hybrid batteries, combining only two battery cell chemistries, with distinct particular strengths, such as high specific energy or high specific power, offer an opportunity to cover a wide range of vehicle battery specifications while avoiding oversizing and a dispersion in the cells to be employed. This work introduces a novel hybrid battery configuration, where the interfacing between the two sets of cells is accomplished through a bidirectional multilevel neutral-point-clamped dc-dc converter. The novel topology is presented and a suitable power converter modulation and control strategy is developed. The feasibility and benefits of such configuration are demonstrated and illustrated. Particularly, the proposed battery system allows the balancing of the state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery modules within both sets of battery banks, which is achieved without introducing additional power losses. The SoC balancing is simply accomplished through the regulation of the power to be extracted/delivered from/to each battery module by the power converter during regular battery discharging and charging operations. The converter features enough regulation margin to correct substantial SoC imbalances. Overall, the proposed approach enables a modular and scalable design of the energy storage system for a wide range of electric vehicles, from only two different standard battery modules and a standard power semiconductor device, while optimizing the battery size for any given battery power and energy specification.

However, controlling SRMs remains inherently complex due to their nonlinear characteristics and parameter variations at different operating points. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the implementation of a Linear-Quadratic-Integral Regulator (LQI) for precise speed control of SRMs. The LQI controller, renowned for its optimal control capabilities, offers several benefits, such as favorable dynamic response, and robustness against disturbances and changing parameters. Unlike traditional controllers, the absence of an inner current control loop results in reduced torque ripple at the phase commutation frequency, simplifying design and implementation. By using PWM for voltage command, torque ripple at the switching frequency is reduced, and noise due to magnetostriction is minimized. A comprehensive design procedure for the proposed LQI speed control scheme is outlined, followed by a comparative analysis with established SRM controllers based on Proportional-Integral (PI) and Hysteresis (HC) controllers. Experimental validation of the proposed controller is provided, illustrating its superior performance across various operating points.

Early screening with automated technology is crucial to assist ophthalmologists in making accurate diagnoses. One of the key technologies for automated diagnosis is the segmentation of the optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC). In this paper, RMHA-Net, which is a developed residual multiscale feature extractor with a hybrid attention mechanism is introduced for automated OD and OC segmentation. This network’s encoder is designed based on advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks that combine dilated convolution, which allows field-of-view expansion by capturing larger-scale features. In addition, the encoder also embeds residual connections to improve the model capacity in extracting low-level features. This design accurately separates the OD and OC from surrounding retinal tissues, handling complex environmental and anatomical changes. The proposed network is further improved by integrating two modules to enhance the segmentation performance: 1) a multiscale feature extractor module to provide various scales contextual information, and 2) dual attention mechanisms through channel-wise and spatial-wise mechanisms so that irrelevant information or noise can be excluded by assigning lesser weights to irrelevant features. To validate RMHA-Net’s effectiveness, extensive experiments were conducted using five public datasets: Drishti-GS, ORIGA, PAPILA, Chaksu, and REFUGE, and one private dataset, Ibn Al-Haitham. The model outperformed seven cutting-edge segmentation models for OD and OC segmentation. The results demonstrate that the network extracts detailed features, offering an efficient framework for future studies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525813","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(grant numbers:FRGS/1/2022/TK07/UKM/02/4); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824799","Attention mechanism;Glaucoma Screening;Multi-scale Features;Optic Cup Segmentation;Optic Disc Segmentation;Semantic Segmentation","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Second, in area-oriented design space exploration for standard-cell designs, collapsing a circuit into a LUT network, restructuring it, and later remapping to the original representation helps escape local minima. Thus, the development of algorithms for optimizing and restructuring LUT networks holds considerable promise for area-oriented optimization. Substitution (also called resubstitution) is a powerful logic minimization method that can identify non-local logic dependencies and exploit them for logic minimization. State-of-the-art substitution algorithms for LUT networks rely heavily on SAT solving, limiting the number of optimization attempts and the size of the substitution sub-networks to one node mishchenko2011scalable. Conversely, our method relies on circuit simulation to increase the number of substitution candidates and enables substitutions with more than one node.

However, these AMC models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Thus, we introduce the Deep Time-Frequency Denoising Transformation (DTFDT) defense method to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks. The DTFDT method is comprised of a deep denoising module and a transformation module. The denoising module maps signals into the time-frequency domain, amplifying the differences between benign and adversarial examples, aiding in the elimination of adversarial perturbations. Concurrently, the transformation module develops a learnable network, generating example-specific transformation matrices suited for signal data, which diminishes the effectiveness of attacks.

In 6G networks, where low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices are prevalent, security and energy efficiency are critical. While existing studies primarily focus on IRS-assisted methods to improve PLS by manipulating signal reflections, such approaches may not fully degrade the reception of eavesdroppers. We address this limitation by proposing an approach that combines IRS-assisted signal reflection with controlled jamming to further degrade the reception of eavesdroppers. Specifically, we jointly optimize the downlink/uplink time allocation, IRS phase shift matrices, and jamming interference to maximize the sum secrecy throughput. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm that decouples the problem into subproblems, ensuring efficient convergence to a locally optimal solution. Through detailed performance analysis, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in terms of secrecy throughput and energy efficiency. Numerical results reveal that, compared to traditional IRS-assisted or non-jamming schemes, our approach yields substantial performance gains.

This algorithm integrates the screening principle of the PROSAC algorithm with the smoothness constraint and multi-region generalization construction principle of the GMS algorithm, embedding a polar geometric constraint model that incorporates projection error fusion.

At the same time, matrices can effectively show clusters when a suitable row/column ordering is applied, but are less appealing to untrained users not providing an intuitive node-link metaphor. It is thus worth exploring layouts combining the strengths of the node-link metaphor and node ordering. In this work, we study the impact of node ordering on the visual saliency of clusters in orderable node-link diagrams, namely radial diagrams, arc diagrams and symmetric arc diagrams. Through a crowdsourced controlled experiment, we show that users can count clusters consistently more accurately, and to a large extent faster, with orderable node-link diagrams than with three state-of-the art force-directed layout algorithms, i.e., ‘Linlog’, ‘Backbone’ and ‘sfdp’. The measured advantage is greater in case of low cluster separability and/or low compactness.

Nevertheless, it is unclear how TUS regulates hippocampal neural activity, and whether and how epileptic discharges in the motor cortex are suppressed by modulating hippocampal neural activity. To explore the answers of above questions, ultrasound was utilized to investigate the responses to the aforementioned inquiries by stimulating the hippocampus of mice with penicillin-induced epilepsy, while simultaneously recording the local field potentials (LFPs) in the hippocampus and the motor cortex (M1) throughout the experiment. The results showed that TUS (1) reduced the amplitude and the strength of the θ frequency band in LFPs in the hippocampus and M1, (2) decreased the coupling strength of the δ-γ, θ-γ and α-γ frequency bands in the hippocampus and M1, (3) weakened the correlation of neural activity between the hippocampus and M1. The above results indicated that TUS effectively suppressed abnormal slow neural oscillations in the hippocampus, had a significant decoupling effect on slow-fast neural oscillations, and reduced the correlation of hippocampus-cortical neural activity.

While Software-Defined Radio (SDR) systems have shown promise in capturing subtle respiratory movements, the presence of multiple people introduces interference and complexity, making it difficult to distinguish individual breathing patterns, particularly when subjects are close together or have similar respiratory conditions. Results: This paper presents a contactless, non-invasive system for monitoring and classifying abnormal breathing patterns in both single and multi-person scenarios using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals and deep learning techniques. The system automatically detects various respiratory patterns, such as whooping cough, Acute Cough, eupnea, Bradypnea, tachypnea, Biot's, sighing, Cheyne-Stokes, Kussmaul, CSA, and OSA. Using SDR technology, the system leverages OFDM signals to detect subtle respiratory movements, allowing real-time classification in different environments. A hybrid deep learning model, VGG16-GRU, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs), was developed to capture both spatial and temporal features of continuous respiratory data. The model successfully classified 11 distinct breathing patterns with high accuracy, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.07%, precision of 99.08%, recall of 99.09%, and an F1-score of 99.07%. The dataset, collected in an office environment, includes complex scenarios with multiple subjects, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in distinguishing individual breathing patterns, even in multi-person settings. Conclusions: This research advances contactless respiratory monitoring by offering a reliable, scalable solution for real-time detection and classification of respiratory conditions. It has significant implications for the development of automated diagnostic tools for respiratory disorders, offering potential benefits for clinical and healthcare applications.

Here, we proposed a two-step reconstruction framework to generate seamless daily ET dataset based on outputs from a soil moisture coupled two-source energy balance (TSEB-SM) model. In these two steps, a deep neural network trained with the outputs of TSEB-SM was used to reconstruct the gaps in daily ET images, which mainly introduced by the missing inputs. Then the remained gaps were filled with reference ET (ETo) directly. The estimated daily ET agrees well with ground measurements across different landcover types with a RMSE of 1.0 mm day−1 and a bias of only 0.2 mm day−1. In terms of spatial distributions and temporal dynamics, the generated daily ET has better consistency with its impacting factors, including the landcover map, land surface temperature, downward solar radiation, etc. Our results suggest that this reconstruction framework can generate reliable seamless daily ET dataset, which has high potential for application in crop water consumption monitoring, crop yield prediction and efficient water management.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3492033","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42071298); Anhui Province's University Science Project for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2022AH030025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10744568","Daily evapotranspiration (ET);spatio-temporal continuous ET;reconstruction;thermal infrared;remote sensing","Land surface;Land surface temperature;Surface reconstruction;Biological system modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Remote sensing;Data models;Clouds;Temperature distribution;Satellites","","","","55","CCBYNCND","5 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The current contribution during faults is one of the main differences between SGs and power converters, which can affect protective systems.

Semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled samples to augment the available dataset by assigning synthetic labels obtained via machine learning (ML)-based predictions. However, treating the synthetic labels as true labels may yield worse-performing models as compared to models trained using only labeled data. Inspired by the recently developed prediction-powered inference (PPI) framework, this work investigates how to leverage the synthetic labels produced by an ML model, while accounting for the inherent bias concerning true labels. To this end, we first review PPI and its recent extensions, namely tuned PPI and cross-prediction-powered inference (CPPI). Then, we introduce two novel variants of PPI. The first, referred to as tuned CPPI, provides CPPI with an additional degree of freedom in adapting to the quality of the ML-based labels. The second, meta-CPPI (MCPPI), extends tuned CPPI via the joint optimization of the ML labeling models and of the parameters of interest. Finally, we showcase two applications of PPI-based techniques in wireless systems, namely beam alignment based on channel knowledge maps in millimeter-wave systems and received signal strength information-based indoor localization. Simulation results show the advantages of PPI-based techniques over conventional approaches that rely solely on labeled data or that apply standard pseudo-labeling strategies from semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, the proposed tuned CPPI method is observed to guarantee the best performance among all benchmark schemes, especially in the regime of limited labeled data.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3503543","European Union’s Horizon Europe Project CENTRIC(grant numbers:101096379); Open Fellowships of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/W024101/1); EPSRC Project(grant numbers:EP/X011852/1); U.K. Government funded project under the Future Open Networks Research Challenge (FONRC); Department of Science Innovation and Technology (DSIT) through the Project Realizing Enabling Architectures and Solutions for Open Networks (REASON); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10758826","Prediction-powered inference;semi-supervised learning;channel knowledge map;indoor localization","Wireless communication;Semisupervised learning;Predictive models;Data models;Location awareness;Rectifiers;Optimization;Machine learning;Vectors;Adaptation models","","","","63","CCBY","20 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, many real-world datasets are not identically and independently distributed (non-IID). That is, the data characteristics differ from one institute to another. Non-IID data poses challenges to the convergence of FL models, such as client drifting, where the model weights drift towards local optima instead of the global optimum. As a solution, leveraging synthetic data not only addresses data distribution issues but also helps overcome data scarcity. In this work, we propose a novel framework called “FedDrip (Federated Learning with Diffusion Reinforcement at Pseudo-site)” that utilizes diffusion-generated synthetic data to alleviate these challenges in non-IID environments. In addition to traditional federated learning, we introduce a pseudo-site concept, where an additional model—the pseudo-site student model—is trained using synthetic data to extract knowledge from real clients acting as teacher models. By leveraging this strategy, the pseudo-site improves model generalization across diverse datasets while preserving data privacy. Moreover, we demonstrate that this virtual-client strategy can be integrated into any federated learning framework, including foundational algorithms like FedAvg and advanced algorithms such as FedDyn and FedProx. Experiments conducted on NIH’s ChestX-ray14 dataset show that our method enhances the performance of both state-of-the-art and foundational methods by 2.15%, 0.95%, and 1.96% for FedAvg, FedDyn, and FedProx, respectively, using the AUC metric.We also performed empirical experiments investigating the effects of prompting style, prompt correctness, and data availability on the inference of diffusion models, using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric for generative models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824802","federated learning;deep learning;diffusion model;X-ray classification;prompt engineering;non-IID data","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Traditional methods are computationally intensive and often hindered by noise in seismic data. Deep learning offers a promising solution to analyze complex geographical structures, but its computational complexity can be a barrier for deployment. This study introduces a deep learning-based approach enhanced by knowledge distillation (KD) to predict subsurface layer thickness and seismic wave velocity. By leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers as teacher models, we transfer knowledge to smaller, more efficient student models through multiple knowledge distillation strategies, including cross-architecture, multi-teacher, and self-distillation. Implementing knowledge distillation from a Vision Transformer (ViT) teacher to CNN student models enhances the performance of student models in depth and velocity predictions compared to baseline CNN models without knowledge distillation. Aggregating knowledge from multiple teacher models improves model generalization and reduces overfitting, as evidenced by a decreased gap between training and validation losses. Self-distillation significantly enhanced the performance of simpler architectures like VGG19, achieving over 95% accuracy in several depth and velocity prediction tasks. Our approach was validated using simulated velocity model data, demonstrating that distilling knowledge from deeper, complex models into smaller ones maintains high prediction accuracy while reducing computational requirements. These findings emphasize the efficiency of knowledge distillation in deploying deep learning models in resource-constrained environments. Integrating deep learning with knowledge distillation techniques not only enhances the accuracy of seismic interpretation models but also makes them more feasible for practical applications, offering a powerful tool for seismic exploration and potentially transforming how seismic data is processed for subsurface characterization and accelerating decision-making in exploration and production.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3521895","Applied Research and Technology Partnership Grants (ARTPs)(grant numbers:CCB21-2021-00266); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:CCB21-2021-00266); BFI Energy Group Inc; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10812724","Deep learning;geoscience;knowledge distillation;seismic exploration","Predictive models;Seismic waves;Computational modeling;Deep learning;Data models;Accuracy;Mathematical models;Training;Knowledge engineering;Transformers","","","","36","CCBY","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To obtain a sufficient system-level throughput gain by employing NOMA in downlink mMIMO with analog BF, it is essential to select beams where each beam has many appropriate users that are to be non-orthogonally multiplexed while mitigating the interference among simultaneously selected beams. In addition, analog BF with NOMA suffers from limited channel state information since the feedback interval of the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) of candidate beams from users is longer than the scheduling interval. We propose a beam selection method based on an angle-domain beam grouping (ADG), which utilizes a beam group that contains multiple neighboring-angle beams. ADG selects beams that are appropriate for applying NOMA by considering the neighboring beams as well as the candidate beam itself during the beam selection process. ADG is also effective in reducing inter-beam interference by setting the neighboring beams to non-selectable beams. Furthermore, we propose a method that reuses the signal-to-interference and noise power ratio (SINR) measured for user-scheduling and transmission-rate control every beam-update interval into the beam selection. This SINR reuse method further improves the system throughput since the beam selection accuracy over time is improved. Computer simulations show that the proposed methods significantly improve user fairness while maintaining the system efficiency compared to the conventional methods, that they are especially effective when the beam update interval is long, and that the system throughput is significantly improved when using NOMA.","1745-1345","","10.23919/transcom.2024EBP3109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820155","Massive MIMO;Non-orthogonal multiple access;NOMA;Analog beamforming;Beam selection","NOMA;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Encoding;Throughput;Multiplexing;Downlink;Measurement;Vectors;Transmitting antennas","","","","","","2 Jan 2025","","","IEICE","IEICE Early Access Articles"

However, research on video generation from modalities other than text or speech remains limited. One major reason for this shortage is the lack of large-scale datasets, which leads to skewed data distributions and causes issues such as unresponsiveness to untrained patterns, image collapse, and scene skipping. To address these challenges, this study focuses on a driving simulation generation model, which produces driving scenarios from speed and steering angle information. We propose a synthetic dataset for speed + angular velocity to image (SAV2IMG) generation. Specifically, we create a half-synthetic dataset, in which only the query (control inputs) is synthetic and the response (images) is derived from real data, as well as a fully synthetic dataset, in which both the query and response are synthetic. By doing so, we construct a training environment that enables the model to handle diverse driving patterns and previously unseen control conditions. We conducted experiments comparing three training conditions for SAV2IMG: using real data only, using real plus half-synthetic data, and using real plus both half- and fully synthetic data. The results demonstrate improved image quality as measured by FID, enhanced controllability, and flexible adaptability to unknown control conditions. Moreover, employing fully synthetic data generated from 3D city models allowed for stable responses to unfamiliar scenarios. At the same time, we found that simple physical models failed to fully reproduce complex control patterns. These findings are not only valuable for improving SAV2IMG but also hold broader implications for vehicle-related generative tasks and cross-modal generation models in general. They provide a meaningful foundation for future model development and data augmentation strategies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525714","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP23K28476); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824770","Synthetic Dataset;Speed + Angular Velocity to Image Generation;Cross-Modal Generation;Scene Skip Problem","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, its effect on estimating biochemical and biophysical parameters is still unknown. This article examines how spatial and spectral resolution, solar zenith angle (SZA), and diffuse solar irradiance (SKYL) affect chlorophyll content (Cab) and leaf area index (LAI) estimation using narrow-band indices (NBIs) through three-dimensional radiative simulations. The results show that spatial resolution minimally affects Cab estimation but significantly impacts LAI, with finer resolutions improving correlation with NBIs. In contrast, spectral resolution has little effect on LAI but greatly influences Cab, with a 2-nm resolution providing stronger correlations, while resolutions coarser than 6 nm are less sensitive. The Cab estimation prefers oblique SZAs, while LAI favors nadir SZAs. SKYL has little effect on Cab and minor impact on LAI. Sunlit pixels outperform shaded ones for Cab estimation, even at 2-m resolution, while entire-crown pixels show the highest LAI correlation. Different NBI strategies significantly affect LAI estimation but not Cab. A consistent conclusion emerges from the analysis of correlations between UAV hyperspectral imagery, with varying spatial and spectral resolutions, and corresponding Cab field measurements. This suggests that the knowledge revealed by the radiative transfer model is applicable to real-world conditions and improves understanding of natural processes without direct measurements.This article enhances the understanding of the influence of observation configurations on Cab and LAI estimation, offering insights to optimize UAV-based hyperspectral imaging and guide future satellite sensor development for tree monitoring.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3498900","Hong Kong Polytechnic University Faculty of Construction and Environment Start-up Fund; FCE Young Researcher Collaborative Research; National Environment Agency - Singapore(grant numbers:CISR-2023-1R-19); Computerised Management of Urban Trees: Tree Inspection Using Satellite Data; National Parks Board - Singapore; SMART Center for Environmental Modeling and Sensing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10759629","Chlorophyll content (C  $_ab$  );hyperspectral remote sensing;leaf area index (LAI);uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Spatial resolution;Vegetation;Hyperspectral imaging;Estimation;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Indexes;Reflectivity;Monitoring;Lighting;Soil","","","","64","CCBY","20 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In response to this problem, spectral indices (SIs) were derived from UAV RGB images with four spatial resolutions, and eight gray-level co-occurrence matrix TFs were calculated using different calculation parameters (TF_CP) including six window sizes and four directions.

In this paper, a novel hybrid LLC and full-bridge (FB) converter is proposed for wide voltage gain applications. The converter consists of a half bridge (HB) LLC resonant converter and a switch-off current-clamp FB converter connected in parallel. The turn-off current of the LLC converter over the entire range is significantly reduced through the clamping operation of the FB converter. Consequently, all primary-side switches of LLC converter achieve zero-voltage switching-on (ZVS) and low-current switching-off (LCS), while secondary-side diodes achieve zero-current switching-off (ZCS), leading to a substantial reduction in switching losses. Furthermore, a smooth transition variable-frequency plus phase-shift control strategy is proposed to achieve wide-range of voltage regulation. The proposed control has three operation modes: variable-frequency with a shift angle  $\varphi $  is 0 mode, phase-shift mode, and variable-frequency with  $\varphi $  of  $\pi $ . These modes cover the low, medium, and high voltage gain ranges, respectively. A 7.5 kW-rated experimental prototype is designed to convert a 400 V input to a 150-750 V wide output.

However, the majority of these methods concentrate solely on extracting features and overlooking the importance of feature interaction. In fact, different source data of the same scene exhibit strong complementary information, which is useful for excavating potential information. To this end, we propose a mutual-guidance mechanism (MGM) in this article to explore the information interaction between multisource data. Specifically, we first embed the MGM into a two-stream network, called MGMNet, where the image features extracted from one source data are convolved with context-aware filters generated from another source data. Through such an interaction way, each source data provide the rich guidance information for another source data during the feature extraction process. Subsequently, the extracted multisource features are fused with an attentional feature fusion module, resulting in a highly discriminative integrated feature for the classification task. At last, a weighted decision-level fusion module is employed to enhance the precision of the classification. To validate the effectiveness of MGMNet, comprehensive experiments are carried out on three multisource datasets. The conclusive results from these experiments indicate that MGMNet surpasses some competitive approaches.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3502761","Major Key Project of PCL; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10758722","Classification;feature extraction;information interaction;multisource fusion;mutual guidance;remote sensing (RS)","Feature extraction;Transformers;Laser radar;Data mining;Soft sensors;Land surface;Accuracy;Convolution;Merging;Excavation","","","","46","CCBY","20 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is challenging for the existing methods to achieve a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. In this article, we novelly combine deep learning with a high-precision spatiotemporal adaptive tensor completion (ST-Tensor) method and propose an end-to-end NDVI time-series reconstruction network (NIT-Net). The ST-Tensor method is first used to generate high-quality seamless NDVI data as the label data to construct sample pairs, along with the original degraded observations. A handcrafted time-series processing network is further employed for effective and rapid reconstruction of the NDVI time series. Considering the temporal continuity and spatial correlation of NDVI time-series data, we combine long short-term memory with a convolution (LSTM-Conv) structure and utilize residual learning and dense connection strategies to mine the spatiotemporal features in depth.

As a result, identifying and suppressing these oscillatory modes is a critical challenge in modern power systems. Advances in wide area monitoring systems in modern power system facilitates the numerous data for the analysis of the system characteristics. Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) have enabled the collection of large amounts of data, aiding in system analysis. Phasor measurement units may experience noisy signals during measurement which may lead to poor identification of low frequency oscillatory modes or introduce extraneous modes during analysis using state of the art methods. This research examines the performance of the Robust Variable Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique for analyzing signals contaminated with noise. The study employs particle swarm optimization to determine the appropriate quantity of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Additionally, it applies Anderson-Darling (AD) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KD) statistical distance measures to identify the effective number of IMFs, enabling the differentiation between signal IMFs and noise IMFs. Wavelet de-noising technique is employed for the de-noising the sum of chosen IMF signals. To validate the selection of adequate IMFs a heuristic approach is used to monitor the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) for effectively seperating noisy contents from actual content of the signal. The proposed system incorporates the wavelet based filter in conventional VMD which not only helps in fetching the frequency but also helps in filtering the noise with appropriate selection of the mother wavelet, i.e. it utilizes the fusion of VMD and Wavelet Transform. The approach leverages the adaptability of VMD’s decomposition alongside the precise denoising capabilities of WT, resulting in high effectiveness for signals that contain noise. This paper introduces MMOESP, a modified Multivariable Output Error State Space method, for identifying low-frequency oscillations. Additionally, data-driven participation factors are discussed to identify the dominant generator and locate the damping controller. Case studies were performed on the IEEE 10-machine, 39-bus system. The results are found to be in consistent with the eigenvalue-based approach. The limitations of these approaches were analyzed for measured signals with noise. Modifications have been proposed to improve the identification accuracy in noisy environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3519113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10804795","Anderson Darlington;intrinsic mode functions;low frequency oscillations;variable mode decomposition","Oscillators;Power system stability;Signal processing algorithms;Noise measurement;Transforms;Noise;Wavelet transforms;Damping;Noise reduction;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","","","39","CCBY","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the existing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) soil moisture retrieval algorithms suffer from insufficient decoupling of surface scattering characteristics and poor RSSM time-series monitoring capabilities. Therefore, this article proposes an integrated time-series relative soil moisture monitoring method based on a SAR backscattering model (SBM). Initially, the SBM is introduced, categorizing land cover into built-up areas, water bodies, vegetation-covered areas, and soil. Addressing the inconsistency in spatiotemporal resolution between optical vegetation indices and SAR data, we establish a unique SAR water cloud model (SWCM) in conjunction with the dual-polarization SAR vegetation index. By employing the SWCM to eliminate vegetation's influence, a high-quality soil backscatter coefficient is obtained. Ultimately, the dry and wet reference values of soil backscatter are calculated to retrieve the relative RSSM time series. Based on Sentinel-1 data, we select three representative experimental areas, namely the Qarhan Salt Lake in dry regions, the Tibetan Plateau Naqu in high-cold regions, and Inner Mongolia Xilinhot in grassland regions, conducting RSSM spatiotemporal monitoring for three years. The experimental results demonstrate that the RSSM exhibits seasonal variations in these three regions. The correlation coefficient between the RSSM monitoring results and the in situ data exceed 0.64, with a maximum of 0.84. Consequently, the proposed method underscores the advantages of simplicity in parameters, high estimation precision, and robust adaptability, thereby augmenting the potential for large-scale global monitoring applications.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3413673","Open Research Fund of Laboratory of Target Microwave Properties(grant numbers:2022-KFJJ-001); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB2604001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42371460,U22A20565,42171355); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10556629","Landsat 8;relative surface soil moisture (RSSM);Sentinel-1A/B;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);time-series retrieval","Soil moisture;Vegetation mapping;Monitoring;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;Moisture;Scattering;Climate change;Sentinel-1;Landsat","","","","47","CCBYNCND","13 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These RESs predominantly connect to the AC collection network via inverters, with the electricity they produce either transmitted over long distances through high-voltage lines or utilized locally within the distribution system. The unique interfacing of RESs alters their fault response characteristics, typically resulting in limited fault currents, frequency deviations, and fluctuating sequence impedance angles. Therefore, existing protection principles based on fault signatures of synchronous generators will face significant challenges including distance relays, directional elements, differential relays, phase selectors, and overcurrent relays. To solve these issues, innovative protection technologies have been developed to bolster grid stability and security. Furthermore, the superior controllability of power converters presents an opportunity to devise effective control strategies that can adapt existing protection mechanisms to function correctly in this new energy landscape. Nevertheless, the complexity of fault behaviors exhibited by RESs necessitates further refinement of these schemes.

While the evoked neural markers as brain activations in response to different emotions have been reported, the temporal dynamics of emotion processing have received little attention. Furthermore, behavioral studies have found that the right side of the human face expresses emotions more accurately than the left side. Therefore, accounting for both the content of the emotion and the visual angle of the presentation from the viewer’s perspective, we have investigated temporal dynamics and variability in the processing of happy and sad emotions using magnetoencephalography (MEG), when the visual angle of presentation was either Positive (right side of the face) or Negative (left side of the face). Our results showed that decodable processing of happy emotions emerged earlier than that for sad emotions, irrespective of visual angle. However, the amplitude of the evoked response to sad emotions was higher than that to happy emotions, when faces were presented at Positive visual angles only. Source reconstructed Event Related Fields (ERFs) showed localized activities in ventral and dorsal streams including fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, putamen and pre and post central gyrus.

This paper investigates the use of RSMA in a large-scale, overloaded system, where the number of users exceeds the number of antennas at the base station. We propose a novel approximation of the RSMA sum rate under limited feedback conditions and develop an optimal power allocation strategy that dynamically switches between RSMA and SDMA to maximize energy efficiency and system performance. Additionally, a robust Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) based precoding method is introduced to mitigate the effects of imperfect CSIT in private streams of RSMA.

This non-isotropy can cause decimeter-level errors in SPD, yet specific models and influencing factors remain under-researched. This study aims to quantify SPD non-isotropy with the non-isotropic value (ΔN), which represents the deviation between SPD and average SPD at corresponding elevations. We analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of non-isotropic SPD by estimating ΔN at 77 grid points (2019–2021, 1-day interval) and 804 grid points at different altitudes (2019–2021, 90-day interval). Using the IGG-Ⅲ scheme, we developed a non-isotropic SPD model considering azimuth continuity. We validated this model by incorporating VMF1 with horizontal gradient correction and VMF1 with horizontal gradient correction combined with the non-isotropic model into static PPP, tested at 16 IGS stations. Results indicate ΔN depends on time, latitude, altitude, elevation, and azimuth. The model categorizes SPD into positive anisotropy, undetermined isotropy, or negative anisotropy. For the 16 IGS stations, the non-isotropic model reduced the STD by 7.5%, 5.8%, and 2.8% in the E, N, and U directions, respectively, and decreased convergence time by 12.8%, 25.4%, and 1.4%. This confirms the model's effectiveness, offering a valuable tool for accurate SPD estimation and improved navigation under real atmospheric conditions.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3525501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820978","GNSS tropospheric delay;Spatiotemporal properties;Non–isotropy;Horizontal gradients;Mapping function;Ray–tracing","Delays;Azimuth;Global navigation satellite system;Atmospheric modeling;Anisotropic;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Geodesy;Accuracy;Ray tracing;Geomagnetism","","","","","CCBYNCND","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This research introduces the Generative Pre-trained Transformer NAS (GPT-NAS), an innovative approach designed to overcome the limitations which are inherent in traditional NAS strategies. This approach improves search efficiency and obtains better architectures by integrating GPT model into the search process. Specifically, we design a reconstruction strategy that utilizes the trained GPT to reorganize the architectures obtained from the search. In addition, to equip the GPT model with the design capabilities of neural architecture, we propose the use of the GPT model for training on a neural architecture dataset. For each architecture, the structural information of its previous layers is utilized to predict the next layer of structure, iteratively traversing the entire architecture. In this way, the GPT model can efficiently learn the key features required for neural architectures. Extensive experimental validation shows that our GPT-NAS approach beats both manually constructed neural architectures and automatically generated architectures by NAS. In addition, we validate the superiority of introducing the GPT model in several ways, and find that the accuracy of the neural architecture on the image dataset obtained from the search after introducing the GPT model is improved by up to about 9%.","2097-406X","","10.26599/BDMA.2024.9020036","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:1082204112364); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10681256","Neural Architecture Search (NAS);Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model;evolutionary algorithm;image classification","Search problems;Computer architecture;Encoding;Training;Optimization;Data models;Neural networks","","","","48","","16 Sep 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Traditional “encoder-decoder” approaches face limitations due to their high training costs and heavy reliance on large-scale annotated datasets, hindering their practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight solution based on an enhanced CLIP-GPT framework. Our approach utilizes CLIP for zero-shot multimodal feature extraction of remote sensing images, followed by the design and optimization of a mapping network based on an improved Transformer with adaptive multi-head attention to align these features with the text space of GPT-2, facilitating the generation of high-quality descriptive text.

While there have been some high-speed eye-tracking datasets and methods based on event cameras, they are primarily tailored for near-eye camera scenarios. They lackthe advantages associated with remote camera scenarios, such as the absence of the need for direct contact, improved user comfort and head pose freedom. In this work, we present RGBE-Gaze, the first large-scale and multimodal dataset for remote gaze tracking in high-frequency through synchronizing RGB and event cameras. This dataset is collected from 66 participants with diverse genders and age groups. Our setup captures 3.6 million RGB images and 26.3 billion event samples.

Traditional approaches primarily utilize bottom-up discriminative methods, where network architectures learn image features to generate segmentation masks. However, the complexity of remote sensing images, characterized by diverse ground object types and intricate scenes, often results in information redundancy and confusion during feature extraction, impacting segmentation accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel segmentation framework, DiffRSS, based on the denoising model paradigm. This top-down generative approach learns the data distribution of sample labels and uses image features as guiding priors for generating segmentation masks. We conceptualize the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images as a conditional generation task and design a Multiscale Cyclic Denoising Module (MSCDM), which effectively leverages multiscale features of remote sensing images, leading to superior segmentation outcomes. Inspired by diffusion models, our denoising structure, MSCDM, can be reused multiple times during inference, enhancing the quality of segmentation masks. This method allows for more precise capture and utilization of image features, resulting in finer and more accurate segmentation masks.

"Chunk Duration Limits the Learning of Multiword Chunks: Behavioral and Electroencephalography Evidence from Statistical Learning","L. Henke; L.

This is required to recode information into sparser representations to mitigate memory limitations and counteract forgetting. It has been suggested that electrophysiological processing time windows constrain the formation of these units. Specifically, the period of rhythmic neural activity (i.e., low-frequency neural oscillations) may set an upper limit of 2–3 sec. Here, we assess whether learning of new multiword chunks is also affected by this neural limit. We applied an auditory statistical learning paradigm of an artificial language while manipulating the duration of to-be-learned chunks. Participants listened to isochronous sequences of disyllabic pseudowords from which they could learn hidden three-word chunks based on transitional probabilities. We presented chunks of 1.95, 2.55, and 3.15 sec that were created by varying the pause interval between pseudowords. In a first behavioral experiment, we tested learning using an implicit target detection task. We found better learning for chunks of 2.55 sec as compared to longer durations in line with an upper limit of the proposed time constraint. In a second experiment, we recorded participants' electroencephalogram during the exposure phase to use frequency tagging as a neural index of statistical learning. Extending the behavioral findings, results show a significant decline in neural tracking for chunks exceeding 3 sec as compared to both shorter durations. Overall, we suggest that language learning is constrained by endogenous time constraints, possibly reflecting electrophysiological processing windows.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_02257","Max-Planck-Gesellschaft(grant numbers:MPRG Language Cycles); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824733","","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

To address these issues, a proposed dual-branch structural feature extraction method fully leverages the global and local information, preserving key structures while removing unimportant textures. The key steps of our method are detailed below: First, an image fusion technique is performed on HSIs to obtain dimension-reduced HSIs. Second, a global multiscale feature extraction method is proposed by performing different parameter settings of pyramid texture filtering (PTF) on HSIs and global probability can be obtained. Third, a PTF-based local multiscale feature extraction method is proposed using multiscale superpixel segmentation on the finest layer of PTFs and local probability can be obtained. Fourth, a decision fusion rule is applied to integrate class probabilities from the two branches.

The performance analysis is carried out by varying power allocation factor to find its optimality. The derived outage probability and sum rate expressions are validated with Monte Carlo simulations.

However, this introduces challenges in network management, particularly in efficiently allocating resources to ensure that each network slice meets its specific Quality of Service (QoS) and availability requirements. Simultaneously, it must optimize overall network performance and network operator’s profit, which is linked to the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end-users. Existing works offer either an availability-based solution or a QoE-aware solution to this problem, but not both. This paper addresses the end-to-end network slice resource allocation problem by simultaneously considering QoS and availability requirements in slice placement, while employing a QoE-aware strategy for resource allocation. We propose a framework that optimizes the network operator profit i.e. the highest QoE with the least resource usage, and can be flexibly configured to model realistic scenarios. Arbitrary network slice requirements can be defined using slice-specific QoS/QoE mapping, resource requirements, end-to-end latency and availability. For solving the formulated problem a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) formulation and efficient heuristic methods are proposed. Our solution accounts for the non-linear QoS/QoE relationship, utilizes redundantly placed Service Function Chains (SFCs) to increase availability, and supports the sharing of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) among SFCs to optimize resource usage. Through extensive simulations on realistic network topologies and slice requests, we demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness in offering flexible and efficient network slice placement and resource allocation, utilizing a baseline heuristic from related studies. The results indicate that while the exact method delivers an optimal solution, heuristic approaches are suitable for time-sensitive tasks, such as dynamic slice configuration.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523900","Ericsson and the High Speed Networks Laboratory (HSNLab); National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary, financed under the PD_21 funding scheme(grant numbers:137698); ános Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences;(grant numbers:ÚNKP-23-5-BME-451); New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Culture and Innovation from the Source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund;; Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund, financed(grant numbers:KDP-2021,C1760781); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10818479","Availability;mixed integer nonlinear programming;E2E network slicing;placement;quality of experience (QoE);quality of service (QoS);resource allocation;service function chaining (SFC)","Quality of experience;Resource management;Quality of service;Substrates;Telecommunication network reliability;Network slicing;Virtual links;Measurement;Bandwidth;Telecommunications","","","","41","CCBY","30 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We analyzed data from 21,243 American banks spanning from 1969 to 2021, focusing on key financial ratios. By applying Differential Privacy (DP) to these models, we aimed to protect sensitive financial data while evaluating the trade-offs between privacy, accuracy, and explainability. Our main findings are as follows: 1) In the absence of privacy constraints, the models consistently identified Asset Turnover, Total Debt / Invested Capital, and ROE ratios as the most influential factors in predicting bank failure, in that order; 2) When the privacy budget  $\epsilon \leq 1$ , only EBM maintained significant performance; 3) The reduction in explainability due to privacy protection was more pronounced for variables with initially lower explanatory power, while Asset Turnover retained its explanatory power even at  $\epsilon = 0.01$ .

This approach overcomes limitations of other methods, such as the inability of Gaussian plume models to recover the integrity of regional concentration enhancements, excessive disruption caused by integrated mass enhancement and divergence integral masking operators, and the requirement for effective wind speed fitting. The extraction of plume regions only causes a perturbation of approximately ±5% in the results, and the R value of this method on real datasets exceeds 0.89.

Although high-resolution remote sensing imagery has been used to develop methods for the automatic extraction of aquatic vegetation, these methods are usually limited to specific areas (such as a lake or a river). Extracting aquatic vegetation on a large scale faces numerous challenges, including high environmental complexity, significant seasonal variations, and poor cross-regional adaptability. Currently, relying solely on either prior knowledge-based methods or classifier methods makes it difficult to comprehensively capture the complex characteristics and variations of aquatic vegetation. To address this issue, we propose an expert feature embedded deep semantic segmentation model. This model uses an attention mechanism to fuse expert features with deep features, dynamically adjusting and optimizing the weight allocation between them. This enables the model to better capture the subtle differences among various types of aquatic vegetation and environmental changes. Specifically, we propose a feature fusion module based on the squeeze-and-excitation coordinate attention mechanism. This module initially employs the squeeze and-excitation mechanism to compress spectral and index features, generating adjusted weights $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Subsequently, it dynamically adjusts the combined weights of these features through the coordinate attention mechanism. We selected eight regions in Anhui Province for evaluation. Compared to HRNet, our method improved Precision and IoU by 10.91% and 20.72%, respectively.

However, these methods not only fail to fully study the rich information in drug heterogeneous networks, but also can only predict pairwise drug combinations. To address these limitations, we present a novel Synergistic Multi-drug Combination prediction method of Western medicine based on Heterogeneous Network representation learning with Contrastive Learning, called SMC-HNCL. Specifically, two drug features are learnt from different perspectives using the drug heterogeneous network and anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) codes, and fused by attention mechanism. Furthermore, a group representation method based on multi-head self-attention is employed to learn representations of drug combinations, innovatively realizing the prediction of synergistic multi-drug combinations.

Methods: We customize a DenseNet-based model on our exclusive dual-view breast ultrasound dataset to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between malignant and benign masses. Various assembly strategies are designed to integrate the dual views into the model input, contrasting with the use of single views alone, with a goal to maximize performance. Subsequently, we compare the model against the radiologist and quantify the improvement in key performance metrics. We further assess how the radiologist's diagnostic accuracy is enhanced with the assistance of the model. Results: Our experiments consistently found that optimal outcomes were achieved by using a channel-wise stacking approach incorporating both views, with one duplicated as the third channel. This configuration resulted in remarkable model performance with an area underthe receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9754, specificity of 0.96, and sensitivity of 0.9263, outperforming the radiologist by 50% in specificity. With the model's guidance, the radiologist's performance improved across key metrics: accuracy by 17%, precision by 26%, and specificity by 29%. Conclusions: Our customized model, withan optimal configuration for dual-view image input, surpassed both radiologists and existing model results in the literature.

"Characterizing Extra Credit Accumulation by Undergraduate Students","T. Ojha; D. Hush","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA",IEEE Access,"","2025","PP","99","1","1","Most degree-seeking undergraduate students at US universities graduate with a higher number of credit hours than is required for graduation, thereby accumulating extra credits. Although existing literature is rich with studies on extra credit accumulation, most of them are limited to comparing overall credit numbers and thus do not consider the usability of individual credits towards the degree program requirements. This limitation can be attributed to the use of inflexible and/or opaque commercial degree audit tools, which curtails the possible scope of analytics on degree audit data. This work uses a custom-built audit tool that determines an optimal match between individual classes and requirements and then decomposes student credits in the following categories: unusable credits that do not match any degree requirement, excess credits that can satisfy at least one requirement but can be removed without changing overall requirement satisfaction, and applied credits that contribute to requirement satisfaction without excess. Thus, extra credits are decomposed into unusable and excess credits. This paper uses this decomposition to investigate (and quantify) numerous possible reasons for extra credit accumulation including transfer credit loss, program change, financial aid retention, hidden requirements, repeated classes, remedial classes, filler classes, and program requirement characteristics. These investigations compare Transfer and Non-Transfer students, compare extra credit accumulation by college, and explore the term-wise accumulation of extra credits. Surprisingly, this analysis suggests that transfer credit loss (i.e. transfer credits not being accepted or not applying to the chosen major) is not a major contributor to extra credits. It also shows that extra credit accumulation by Transfer and Non-Transfer students is very similar, suggesting that the transfer process may have little influence on extra credit accumulation. Finally, it suggests that extra credit accumulation is likely due to multiple factors without a single dominating factor.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824768","credit hour decomposition;excess credits;transfer credit loss;extra credit attribution;specialized degree audit tool","","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, signals reflected by the RIS need to traverse two paths—from the base station (BS) to the RIS and from the RIS to the user, which results in the multiplicative fading effect and limits the capacity gains achievable by the passive RIS. In this paper, we investigate the active RIS to overcome the limitation. We consider a multiple input single output system utilizing active RIS, and based on recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we integrate the joint design of the BS transmit beamforming matrix and the RIS phase shift matrix into a unified framework for sum rate maximization. We propose a DRL-based algorithm that obtains the joint design through trial-and-error interactions with the environment and is capable of identifying an appropriate power allocation scheme to balance the power consumption between the BS and the active RIS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed active RIS-assisted system outperforms traditional passive RIS-assisted systems, particularly when there are constraints on the number of reflective elements. Additionally, it is observed that proper parameter settings significantly enhance the performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the algorithm can allocate suitable power to the active RIS while maintaining a constant total power, thereby optimizing the system performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525562","Foundation of China under Grant(grant numbers:61650103); Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi under Grant(grant numbers:2018GXNSFAA281161); GUAT Special Research Project on the Strategic Development of Distinctive Interdisciplinary Fields under Grant(grant numbers:TS2024211); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820336","Reconfigurable intelligent surface;active;wireless communication;power allocation;sum rate;deep reinforcement learning","MISO;Optimization;Power demand;Noise;Array signal processing;Neural networks;Channel estimation;Streams;Resource management;Reflector antennas","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The proposed CFLC protocol leverages cross-layer and FL approaches to enhance network stability and connectivity by optimizing cluster head (CH) selection and cluster formation. The cross-layer design integrates physical layer information, such as mobility (speed and direction), position, channel capacity, and remaining energy, with network layer information (connectivity) to maximize the cost function value for cluster formation. We design the FL model to improve the clustering performance and satisfy future mobile network requirements. Specifically, during the CH selection step, FL can decide which nodes should be elected as CHs or cluster members (CMs) by using classification. In the cluster formation step, FL addresses a regression problem by optimizing the cost function weights for parameters such as mobility similarity, link quality, remaining energy, and channel capacity to decide which CH each node should follow. The simulation results show that the proposed CFLC protocol outperforms the benchmark protocols in terms of connectivity, scalability, and control overhead.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a lightweight defense mechanism against energy-draining DoS attacks using signaling theory and game theory to model the interaction between an attacker and a regular node. In this model, the regular node sends signals to mask true information, deceiving the attacker. By applying a perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium, we derive optimal strategies for both players, analyzing how deceptive signaling affects the attacker’s behavior and reduces their potential gain. This approach allows us to identify energy-efficient scenarios and improve network security by distorting the attacker’s perception of the target. Ultimately, a node with low energy capacity is able to protect its energy by emitting distorted signals.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525064","DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory(grant numbers:W911NF-21-1-0326); Schlumberger Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820340","DoS;Energy Attacks;Game theory;PBNE;Signaling game;Signaling theory","Wireless sensor networks;Games;Denial-of-service attack;Batteries;Routing protocols;Receivers;Jamming;Adaptation models;Wireless communication;Random access memory","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In tracking scenarios with dense clutter or multiple targets, weak target signals are often missed due to improper detection thresholds, leading to track fragmentations during target tracking. In order to improve target detection probability and enhance target tracking continuity, a joint detection and tracking (JDT) paradigm, which establishes a closed loop between the detector and tracker, is proposed. When a target of interest is tracked, the tracker sends its predicted range, Doppler velocity, and azimuth back to the detector, then the detector builds a detection gate centered at the predicted range and Doppler velocity on the range–Doppler map. Within the detection gate, an optimal detection threshold dependent on the detection background and tracking environment is determined using reinforcement learning. In this way, a potential target plot may be detected with a higher detection probability and the detected plot is provided for track update. The proposed paradigm employs tracking information to provide adaptive detection parameters for specific targets through reinforcement learning to enhance both target detection and tracking performance. Experimental results with field data demonstrate that compared with traditional detection before tracking scheme, the proposed JDT paradigm achieves a superior performance with the average tracking time on target being increased by 13.33 min and the average missed detection rate being reduced by 0.8$\%$.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3504813","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071493); Innovation Fund Project for Graduate Student of China University of Petroleum (East China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:24CX04007A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10764759","Adaptive detection threshold adjustment;compact high-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR);joint detection and tracking (JDT);reinforcement learning (RL);target tracking","Target tracking;Radar tracking;Object detection;Radar;Radar detection;Clutter;Detectors;Doppler effect;Signal to noise ratio;Remote sensing","","","","36","CCBY","22 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Drowsy driving has emerged from modern societal trends such as long working hours, heavy reliance on vehicles, and insufficient sleep. Despite considerable efforts by researchers to develop efficient driver drowsiness detection systems, none so far has been widely adopted due to their high cost, intrusive nature, and ineffectiveness in challenging real-life situations. This paper presents a novel, real-time, non-intrusive, and cost-effective driver drowsiness detection system leveraging vision transformers (ViT). Our approach detects the driver’s face from each video frame and classifies the driver’s state as either ‘drowsy’ or ‘alert’ based on the entire facial image, as opposed to previous systems that rely on analyzing specific facial features. We demonstrate that the proposed Vision Transformers-based Driver Drowsiness Detection (ViT-DDD) system surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios such as drivers wearing glasses or sunglasses, or in different lighting conditions. The model was trained and evaluated on two widely used public drowsiness detection datasets, achieving classification accuracies of 98.89% on the NTHU-DDD dataset and 99.4% on the UTA-RLDD dataset. Furthermore, the system was successfully deployed on a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, integrated with an infrared camera, a GSM/GPS module, and a buzzer to alert the driver and report the drowsiness condition to the vehicle owner. Testing the prototype yielded highly promising results, with the system’s strong performance attributed to the ViT-DDD system and advanced hardware. The promising test results suggest the potential of this system in significantly reducing accidents caused by drowsy driving, with future work aiming to expand its capabilities and integration into broader vehicular systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3522111","University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10815964","Vision transformers;driver drowsiness;deep learning;computer vision;vehicle safety","Vehicles;Transformers;Accuracy;Feature extraction;Facial features;Computer vision;Faces;Physiology;Hidden Markov models;Face recognition","","","","48","CCBYNCND","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The decomposition-reconstruction theory (DRT) has been previously introduced with the objective of reducing the computational complexity of scattering from rough surfaces. The central idea of DRT is to replace the scattering from rough surfaces with that from sinusoidal or other simpler, basic surfaces. The EM scattering from these simpler surfaces can be calculated more easily. The total scattering from the original rough surface is then reconstructed with the scattering from all the basic surfaces. This article introduces the decomposition reconstruction theory-based extended boundary condition method (DRT-EBCM), a novel method that combines the DRT and the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) to handle scattering from rough surfaces. The DRT-EBCM method decomposes the system integrals within the Dirichlet/Neumann matrices (system matrices) of the rough surface and represents them with the basic system integrals from complex sinusoidal surfaces (basic surfaces). This process leads to the derivation of new DRT-EBCM formulations. These new formulations not only establish a quantitative relationship between EM scattering from rough surfaces and basic surfaces, but they also significantly enhance computational efficiency due to the reduced complexity of the basic system integrals. Moreover, a new Fourier-Bessel (FB) function is introduced, which plays a crucial role in the scattering from basic surfaces. This function possesses a series of excellent properties that simplify the DRT-EBCM formulations and can potentially be applied in other scattering calculation methods. Simulation experiments were conducted to validate the proposed DRT-EBCM, confirming its correctness and validity. Furthermore, the application of DRT-EBCM in fast scattering calculation for rough surfaces was demonstrated. The results showed that DRT-EBCM significantly improves computational efficiency compared to the classical EBCM.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3516882","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41571333); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10801204","Decomposition-reconstruction theory (DRT);electromagnetic (EM) scattering;extended boundary condition method (EBCM);rough surfaces;T-matrix","Scattering;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Sea surface;Surface topography;Surface reconstruction;Electromagnetic scattering;Surface waves;Boundary conditions;Surface treatment","","","","60","CCBY","16 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here we developed an implantable wireless WNClip neural stimulator to test the efficacy of 5-week cPNS as a treatment for hypertension. Results: Daily cPNS 2 Hz monophasic stimulation at threshold for 8 minutes every day for five weeks, reduced SBP in WKY animals by −4 mm Hg, and in SHR animals by −21 mmHg in week 5 (p < 0.01). Ambulatory SBP measured daily recorded approximately twenty-four hours after the cPNS treatment, showed a significant reduction from the first (176.6 ± 24.1 mm Hg; n = 5) to the last week of treatment (165.7± 42.7 mm Hg; n = 4), a −9 mm Hg reduction (p < 0.01).

Firstly, a weighted K-means-based clustering algorithm establishes UAV-user associations at regular intervals. Then the efficacy of training a novel Shared Deep Q-Network (SDQN) with action masking is explored. Unlike training each UAV separately using DQN, the SDQN reduces training time by using the experiences of multiple UAVs instead of a single agent. We also show that SDQN can be used to train a multi-agent system with differing action spaces. Simulation results confirm that: 1) training a shared DQN outperforms a conventional DQN in terms of maximum system throughput (+20%) and training time (-10%); 2) it can converge for agents with different action spaces, yielding a 9% increase in throughput compared to Mutual DQN algorithm; and 3) combining NOMA with an SDQN architecture enables the network to achieve a better sum rate compared with existing baseline schemes.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3521876","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, U.K.; Communications Hub for Empowering Distributed ClouD Computing Applications and Research; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/Y037421/1,EP/X040518/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10812765","Aerial networks;non-orthogonal multiple access;multi-agent reinforcement learning;invalid action masking","Autonomous aerial vehicles;NOMA;Trajectory;Throughput;Three-dimensional displays;Resource management;Ad hoc networks;Training;Clustering algorithms;Base stations","","","","58","CCBY","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the limited resources of edge servers and the need to process delay-sensitive healthcare tasks pose significant challenges. Existing solutions often need help to balance the trade-off between system cost and quality of service, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cooperative task scheduling and resource management framework for digital healthcare applications in edge intelligence systems. Our approach leverages a two-step optimization strategy that combines the Multi-armed Combinatorial Selection Problem (MCSP) for task scheduling and the Sequential Markov Decision Process (SMDP) with alternative reward estimation for computation offloading. The MCSP-based scheduling algorithm efficiently explores the combinatorial task scheduling space to minimize healthcare task completion time and costs. The SMDP-based offloading strategy incorporates alternative reward estimation to improve robustness against dynamic variations in the system environment. Extensive simulations using real-world healthcare data demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements in cost, task success rate, and fairness.

To anticipate the impact, this study proposes a novel approach to integrate the typhoon track predictions generated by an ensemble k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) as the reference locations of the typhoon center. The global weather forecast data corrected using an ensemble k-NN-based typhoon track was transferred to the OpenFOAM model simulation to obtain the urban-scale wind with multiple obstacles. The Gwangan Bridge, which faces the East Sea and is one of the sites in Busan City used in this study, is used for evaluating the approach with three typhoon events, i.e. Nari in 2007, Chaba in 2016, and Cimaron in 2018. The simulation results are disseminated in a 3D web application framework using Node JS for the web framework, PostgreSQL and PostGIS for database management, and CesiumJS for the main JavaScript library of 3D visualization. The study results show that this approach can perform well evaluated to the observed wind station on the bridge, with correlation coefficient, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.902, 1.505, and 1.927, respectively. The adjustment of grid positions through an ensemble k-NN-based typhoon prediction model on the global weather forecast data for OpenFOAM input significantly contributed to the accuracy of urban-scale wind prediction. This study also produces a more sophisticated web-based virtual globe and 3D city model to demonstrate a current typhoon prediction and past typhoons, online simulation results of ensemble k-NN algorithm, a volumetric profile of typhoons, wind flow, streamlines, wind pressure around buildings and a bridge, warning status, and predicted wind time series for supporting the disaster early warning system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525361","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2016R1A6A1A03012812); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820554","3D web-based application;typhoon preparedness;wind flow;ensemble k-NN;OpenFOAM","Tropical cyclones;Wind forecasting;Wind;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Urban areas;Data visualization;Solid modeling;Meteorology;Predictive models","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Meanwhile, the current industrial chain structure has also become increasingly complex, forming new characteristics of multiplex networked industrial chains. Fluctuations in real-time electricity prices in demand response propagate through the coupling and cascading relationships within and among these network layers, resulting in negative impacts on the overall energy management cost. However, existing demand response methods based on reinforcement learning typically focus only on individual agents without considering the influence of dynamic factors on intra and inter-network relationships. This paper proposes a Layered Temporal Spatial Graph Attention (LTSGA) reinforcement learning algorithm suitable for demand response in multiplex networked industrial chains to address this issue. The algorithm first uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to learn the dynamic temporal characteristics of electricity prices for decision-making. Then, LTSGA incorporates a layered spatial graph attention model to evaluate the impact of dynamic factors on the complex multiplex networked industrial chain structure. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed LTSGA approach effectively characterizes the influence of dynamic factors on intra- and inter-network relationships within the multiplex industrial chain, enhancing convergence speed and algorithm performance compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2023.9010111","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3304400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62303111,62076060,61932007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10786953","demand response;multiplex networked industrial chains;multiagent;reinforcement learning","Multiplexing;Costs;Fluctuations;Heuristic algorithms;Electricity;Reinforcement learning;Demand response;Real-time systems;Energy management;Long short term memory","","","","22","","9 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The experimental results showed an increased spreading of the optical beam of the VCSEL with increasing ageing time. Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrated that the electrical degradation (increase in series resistance) is responsible for a larger current spreading which, in turn, increases the FWHM (full width half maximum) of the optical beam. We further evaluated the series resistance variation by aging four lasers with different oxide apertures. The results of this set of experiments showed that the electrical degradation is stronger as the oxide aperture is smaller, and mostly depends on the contribution of the top DBR resistance.

This paper presents a novel system for learning and predicting driver motions, along with an event-based (720 × 720) dataset, N-DriverMotion, newly collected to train a neuromorphic vision system. The system includes an event-based camera that generates a driver motion dataset representing spike inputs and efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs) that are effective in training and predicting the driver's gestures. The event dataset consists of 13 driver motion categories classified by direction (front, side), illumination (bright, moderate, dark), and participant. A novel optimized four-layer convolutional spiking neural network (CSNN) was trained directly without any time-consuming preprocessing.

However, for low-resource languages like Urdu, there is a scarcity of well-structured data for specific tasks such as event classification. Urdu, a language prominent in South Asia, has boasted a complex morphological structure with unique features but has lacked standard linguistic resources like datasets. Long-text classification has demanded more effort than short-text classification due to its expansive vocabulary, information redundancy, and noise. Text processing has been the latest trend in research, with many machine learning and deep learning techniques widely used for it. Multiclass classification has been utilized to classify different languages for various purposes. In this research, a multiclass classification for the Urdu language was performed using a text dataset taken from five different social media platforms including Geo News, Samaa News, Dawn News, Express News, and Urdu Blogs totaling 103,771 sentences. We used sentence-level classification to categorize sentences including terrorist attacks, national news, sports, entertainment, politics, safety, earthquakes, fraud and corruption, sexual assault, weather, accidents, forces, inflation, murder and death, education, and international news. Deep learning, transformer-based and machine learning classifiers are used for event classification. The SMFCNN classifier achieved the greatest accuracy of 88.29%. We incorporated transformer-based models, with the proposed XLM-R+ model demonstrating superior performance with an accuracy of 89.8%. Our results were compared to previously reported techniques that used traditional models, highlighting the significant improvements offered by our approaches. The novelty of this research lies in the inclusion of 16 event categories to broaden coverage and the implementation of the SMFCNN and transformer-based algorithms.

Comprehensive therapeutic approaches are crucial for cancer treatment. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) present a potentially effective therapeutic option. However, the extensive identification and synthesis of these peptides present a persistent difficulty that calls for the creation of effective prediction techniques. Existing techniques either suffer from low accuracy or employ high-dimensional feature sets, frequently producing sparse features and leading to ineffective model designs. This work presents a novel set of features and a long-short-term-memory (LSTM)-based classification strategy to create an efficient model. The suggested feature set includes three new and two modern feature extraction methods. The binary profile feature and k-mer sparse matrix of the reduced amino acid alphabet are part of the modern feature set. The combination of the composition of the K-spaced side chain pairs (CKSSCP), the composition of the K-spaced electrically charged side chain pairs (CKSECSCP), and the combination of [pk(CO2H)] + [pk(NH2)] + [pk(R)] + [isoelectric point] is used to derive the novel features. The suggested LSTM model is trained using the combined feature set. The trials are carried out with a k-fold cross-validation method on benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms alternative ACP classification techniques in terms of Mathew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) and accuracy. The ACP740 dataset with 5-folds yields an MCC score of 75%, which is 12%, 11%, 3%, and 8% greater than those of the ACP-DL, ACP-DA, ACP-MHCNN, and ACP-KSRC approaches, respectively. For the ACP344 dataset with 10-folds, the proposed method achieves an MCC score of 85.14%, which is 23% and 2% higher than the MCC scores of ACP-DL and SAP methods, respectively. Better classification performance offered by the proposed approach could help identify new ACPs and better understand their structural and chemical characteristics.

Despite that, the 5th Generation (5 G) of wireless communication networks has introduced various innovative services such as Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLCs), Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTCs), and Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB). These services only support isolated operations and the requisite reliable service delivery remains a challenge. The Beyond 5 G (B5G)/6th Generation (6 G) wireless networks aim at simultaneously providing multiple integrated services through intelligent network operations with ultra-high speed and reliability supporting integrated NTN and terrestrial networks. However, the prospect of such an extensively connected decentralized 3D wireless network also foresees security concerns, underscoring the necessity for seamless and infrastructure-free (decentralized) security solutions. The conventional security mechanisms are considered inadequate to ensure the security provisions of such extensive, decentralized, and heterogeneous networks. Physical Layer Security (PLS) is a promising technique to extend seamless and infrastructure-less security solutions, ensuring the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of legitimate transmissions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview with tutorials and presents the state-of-the-art of PLS, focusing mainly on NTN wireless communications. Furthermore, current research challenges, open issues, and future research directions are also thoroughly discussed in an amalgamation of various emerging 6 G technologies.

Normalizing reflectance from various directions to a common solar-viewing geometry can eliminate the effects of reflectance anisotropy, thereby enhancing the accuracy of surface parameter retrieval from reflectance data. In previous studies, the reflectance angular normalization typically relies on prior knowledge extracted from coarse-resolution BRDF products. In this study, we developed a universal BRDF archetype database and explored the applicability of each BRDF archetype across various solar and viewing angles. The results indicate that the following: 1) The 3 × 3 universal BRDF archetype database is sufficient to represent the surface anisotropy of different spectral bands. 2) The optimal BRDF archetype in the lookup table (LUT) undergoes notable variations under different solar and viewing geometries, and specific prior BRDF knowledge is applicable only to certain solar and viewing geometries. 3) Validations based on simulated MODerate resolution imaging spectroradiometer reflectance suggests that in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, when the observation zenith angle is 60°, the percentages of directions with the root mean square error (RMSE) values below 0.05 and 0.06 constitute 82.74% and 75.70% of the entire viewing hemisphere, respectively. And validations based on polarization and directionality of the Earth's reflectance observations indicate that after normalization with the BRDF archetype LUT, the RMSE decreases from 0.0291 to 0.0249. The BRDF archetype LUT is applicable to the vast majority of solar and viewing geometries, even for the large solar zenith angles. Additionally, the LUT demonstrates good noise resistance and high applicability in observations at different scales, particularly in the NIR band. This study provides a new approach for reflectance angular normalization, offering the potential to provide a more reliable data foundation for future scientific research and practical applications.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3507003","Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:22JCQNJC01420); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFE0117300); The Major Project of High Resolution Earth Observation System(grant numbers:30-Y60B01-9003-22/23); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971306); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10768911","Kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model;reflectance angular normalization;reflectance anisotropy;universal BRDF archetype","Reflectivity;Land surface;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;MODIS;Table lookup;Kernel;Anisotropic;Accuracy;Remote sensing;Databases","","","","45","CCBY","27 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This hybrid approach effectively combines the Residual Machine Learning Perceptron (ResMLP) with the POL mechanism to capture both local and global features of 3D point clouds. The ResMLP component hierarchically extracts high-frequency local features from point cloud patches, while the POL mechanism is specifically designed to capture low-frequency global features. This dual extraction process ensures minimal loss of both high and low-frequency features. The POL mechanism employs Lambda layers within a linear framework, significantly enhancing the classification speed and accuracy compared to traditional attention mechanisms that suffer from quadratic complexity and non-linear structures. By processing local and global features in parallel, the Hybrid ResPOL method combines these features and feeds them into the classification head, optimizing performance. Experimental results indicate that the Hybrid ResPOL method achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 94.3% and a mean accuracy (mAcc) of 91.3% on the ModelNet40 dataset. Additionally, it demonstrates robust performance on the challenging ScanObjectNN dataset, with accuracies of 92% OA and 91.2% mAcc.

The main challenges in designing LEO satellite ground stations include increasing the input signal strength to counteract severe path loss, and adaptively steering the direction of the output signal to accommodate the continuous movement of LEO satellites.

Tensor decomposition methods show potential but have limitations in these conditions. This paper proposes a dynamic motion saliency infrared tensor model that integrates temporal information to address these challenges. The method formulates target detection as a low-rank sparse tensor decomposition problem in the spatiotemporal domain. First, we construct the infrared sequence into a holistic spatiotemporal tensor model (STTM) to utilize both spatial and temporal information. Then, based on the sparse-enhanced Tucker decomposition framework, we design a multi-scale energy movement saliency map (MESM) from target motion characteristics. This map serves as a sparse prior, incorporated into the STTM, providing strong decomposition guidance even when the target contrast is weak or overlapped with strong edges. Additionally, we propose a reweighted scheme integrating motion saliency based on the minimum temporal projection of the target component after each iteration, suppressing background clutter and enhancing target separation. Next, for more precise background estimation, we use an accurate low-rank approximation and extend the overlapping group sparse total variation (OGSTV) regularization from 2D to 3D. Compared to traditional variational methods, 3D-OGSTV better distinguishes edges from flat regions, improving background suppression and detection accuracy. Finally, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used for efficient optimization.

Considering that point features have a limited ability to describe the common structural features between SAR and optical images, graph topology is introduced to extract edge features to derive modality-shared structural features for reliable registration. In this article, we propose a registration network for multifeature alignment and matching (MFAM-RegNet) between SAR and optical images, which includes a multifeature alignment module (MFAM) and a multifeature matching module (MFMM). First, we construct an MFAM to extract and align point and edge features to mine modality-shared structural features. In MFAM, point features are extracted by graph neural networks, and edge features are constructed by the feature similarity between two keypoints. Inspired by graph matching, we design linear and quadratic contrastive learning to mine the correspondence of point and edge features of intramodal and intermodal images. Second, speckle noise in SAR images inevitably leads to some noise labels, which decreases the accuracy and robustness of our supervised algorithm. Therefore, we design an MFMM to modify noise labels and use bidirectional matching for robust matching. According to the essential relationships of features mined by the momentum contrastive learning strategy, the labels are adaptively modified to reduce the influence of the incorrect labels on the model's performance and achieve more stable matching results. Experiments on three publicly available SAR and optical datasets indicate that our proposed MFAM-RegNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3492278","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172321); Civil Space Thirteen Five Years Pre-Research Project(grant numbers:D040114); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10746326","Linear contrastive learning (LCL) and quadratic contrastive learning (QCL);momentum contrastive learning (MCL);multifeature alignment;multifeature matching;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);optical image registration","Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Image edge detection;Optical sensors;Nonlinear optics;Adaptive optics;Noise;Optical fiber networks;Image registration;Contrastive learning","","","","70","CCBYNCND","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aim is to enhance the automation of water-ice cloud segmentation tasks and improve segmentation accuracy based on existing deep learning methods. Water ice clouds are a crucial component of Martian weather phenomena, and their precise description is important for understanding Martian climate changes. However, the Martian surface topography's complexity and the atmospheric environment's dynamic changes make accurate identification of water ice clouds difficult. To tackle this, we combine feature channels, Spatial-Channel Attention Bridge (SC), attention gating (AG), and a double convolution residual block (R2CBL) to enhance feature extraction and gradient stability. We introduce a new feature channel by calculating the ratio of the blue (B) and red (R) channels(B/R) to enhance the expression of cloud features. The SC, incorporating spatial attention blocks (SAB) and channel attention blocks (CAB), along with the AG, improves the model's ability to capture key features. The R2CBL, through double convolution operations and residual connections, addresses the gradient vanishing problem and enhances feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing deep learning methods, FERA-Net achieves significant improvements in the task of Martian water-ice cloud segmentation. Specifically, the F1-score increases from 75.16% to 89.73% (an improvement of 19.4%), and the Jaccard index improves from 78.93% to 90.01% (an increase of 14.1%).This research provides theoretical support for in-depth exploration of the Martian atmospheric environment and water cycle, and it can assist in planning and executing future Mars exploration missions.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3525466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820951","FERA-Net;Martian;water-ice clouds;attention mechanism;residual structure","Mars;Ice clouds;Clouds;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Water cycle;Surface topography;Stability criteria;Climate change;Atmospheric measurements","","","","","CCBY","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It is often the case that the resulting SAT instances are very hard and require the use of parallel computing to be solved in reasonable time. The particularly relevant problem in this context is how to best plan the use of the computing resources, because SAT solvers’ runtime is well known to be hard to predict. In the present paper we propose two methods that employ the knowledge about a circuit’s structure to partition a CircuitSAT instance into a specific number of simpler subproblems. A distinctive feature of the proposed partitioning methods is that they make it possible to estimate the hardness (e.g. the total runtime of a SAT solver on all subproblems) of a partitioning via the Monte Carlo method. In the experimental evaluation we apply these methods to hard CircuitSAT instances and compare their performance with the well known Cube and Conquer approach. The proposed partitioning methods not only often outperform Cube and Conquer, but also show remarkably small variance in the runtime of a SAT solver on subproblems from a partitioning, thus making it possible to construct accurate estimations of time required to process all subproblems, using random samples of small size. As a consequence, we have the efficient stochastic estimation procedure which provides an additional opportunity to employ hyperparameter tuning methods to further increase the SAT solver performance on (partitioned) hard SAT instances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed constructions by applying them to some problems associated with CircuitSAT, in particular, Logical Equivalence Checking benchmarks, Automated Test Pattern Generation benchmarks and the inversion problems of some cryptographic functions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525122","Huawei Technologies(grant numbers:CSTT grant TC20231108103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820338","SAT;CircuitSAT;partitioning;hardness estimation;Logical Equivalence Checking;Automated Test Pattern Generation;Monte Carlo method","Logic gates;Circuit faults;Reactive power;Monte Carlo methods;Estimation;Encoding;Design automation;Runtime;Random variables;Object recognition","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This integration significantly reduces the uncertainty and noise of images, facilitating a more comprehensive and accurate extraction of essential ground object features. However, most land cover classification models based on deep learning focus on interpreting single-temporal remote sensing images, and multitemporal remote sensing datasets are relatively scarce, leading to challenges in model training. To address these issues, this article proposes a cross-temporal self-supervised learning method with superpixel mask (CTS2L-sm) for multitemporal land cover classification. Specifically, we design a superpixel-based masking strategy to replace the fixed-size patch masking strategy used in masked image modeling (MIM), which prevents the complete occlusion of small-scale remote sensing scenes and more effectively preserves structural information. To further enhance the integration of multitemporal information, we introduce a cross-temporal attention module (CTAM) in both forward and backward to extract cross-temporal features. The resulting multitemporal denoised homogeneous features, when fused with each temporal feature, significantly improve classification accuracy. CTS2L-sm combines these denoised homogeneous features extracted by CTAM with single-temporal features and simultaneously reconstructs the original remote sensing images across all temporal, extending the MIM strategy from single-temporal to multitemporal self-supervised training. Experimental results on the WUSU and FUSU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CTS2L-sm compared to several state-of-the-art methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3513694","Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects(grant numbers:202101BE070001-008,202401AW070019,202301AV070003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201237); Major Science and Technology Projects in Yunnan Province(grant numbers:202302AG050009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10786383","Masked image modeling (MIM);multitemporal classification;self-supervised learning;superpixel mask","Remote sensing;Feature extraction;Land surface;Transformers;Training;Data mining;Semantics;Computational modeling;Image reconstruction;Convolution","","","","50","CCBY","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Obstetricians often lack the technology to determine whether a cesarean delivery is necessary based on antepartum circumstances. The objective of this study is to develop an automated system for an effective detection of mode of birth delivery using EHG and analyze the data points shape structures across different BMI groups. Topological features (Area, Perimeter, Circularity, Variance, Bending Energy) were extracted from the boundaries of convex and concave hulls which applied to the whole signal, including the quiescent periods in this study. Pregnant women who underwent cesarean sections and those who delivered spontaneously were categorized into four BMI groups: unhealthy obese, healthy obese, overweight, and normal weight. EHG signals from the 31st week of gestation were examined. Topological characteristics derived from the border shape of the concave hull with a tolerance of 1.7 exhibits a marked statistically significant difference (p<0.005) between cesarean and spontaneous EHG signals. All of the features reached an accuracy above 90% in the classification using a random forest classifier between cesarean and vaginal deliveries across all BMI groups. On the other hand, it was found that aside from variance, women who delivered spontaneously exhibited higher topological feature values compared to those who underwent cesarean sections. The obtained results assist obstetricians in selecting the optimal birth delivery mode, hence minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections, complications, and emergency medical interventions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820342","BMI;Concave hull;Electrohyterogram;obstetric outcome;Topological features","Pregnancy;Obstetrics;Feature extraction;Recording;Pediatrics;Monitoring;Shape;Obesity;Discrete Fourier transforms;Support vector machines","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Compared with traditional Re-ID tasks based on fixed optical cameras, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the advantage of being unaffected by lighting and weather conditions, and can provide additional information. However, there are significant geometric distortions and radiometric differences between optical images and SAR images, which limit the effectiveness of multimodal image matching. To address the above issues, we propose a novel centroid-aligned implicit learning (CAIL) network to achieve cross-modal Re-ID. Specifically, we employ a multilevel channel fusion (MTT) module to enhance the adaptability of multimodal encoding channels to dimensional changes, thereby extracting the implicit features from different modalities. Furthermore, by integrating the MTT module into the modality multiple implicit learning (MIL) module, we reduce the modal differences between multimodal images, thus achieving effective alignment between them. Additionally, to optimize CAIL, we propose a modality centroid alignment (MCA) loss to enhance the intraclass feature aggregation capability of multimodal data. MCA dynamically aggregates centroid features by taking modality differences into account, and adopts joint optimization to reduce anomalies in the metric learning process. Our proposed approach achieves significant and satisfactory performance on a cross-modal aerial images dataset, in terms of both mAP and rank-1 accuracy.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3512579","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071136); Heilongjiang Outstanding Youth Foundation(grant numbers:Y02022F002); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3072024XX0801,3072024XX0805); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10783041","Centroid alignment loss;implicit learning;multimodal aerial images;autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV);vehicle reidentification (Re-ID)","Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Radar polarimetry;Optical distortion;Adaptive optics;Synthetic aperture radar;Remote sensing;Optical sensors;Cameras;Autonomous aerial vehicles","","","","60","CCBY","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a dynamic multifeature data fusion neural network (DMFFNNet) classification method is proposed. First, K-band frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar is used to collect echo data from five types of rotor drones and bionic bird. After preprocessing the data, 2-D range–period graphic and 2-D time–frequency (TF) spectrograms are obtained. We investigate the construction of new data representations in the range–periodic domain, designing networks to extract dynamic time-varying features of the data. To be able to obtain accurate localized features, a local feature extraction module is proposed to extract local features from the range–period graph, while a global feature extraction module is used to extract global features from the TF spectrograms. To be able to extract dynamic information about the data, a 3-D network is used to capture dynamic change feature in the 3-D range–period data. Finally, a feature fusion module is designed to integrate the extracted features, and to be able to better extract the features of the target, an attention mechanism is added to the fusion network to extract the temporal and spatial features in the spectrogram and fuse them to further improve the overall performance of the model.

To ensure that semantic segmentation has practical application value in autonomous driving and robotics, it must achieve corresponding real-time inference speeds.

In this paper, we propose a new architecture based on a bilateral segmentation network, called DADNet. We have designed a new attention mechanism to optimize feature maps and a feature fusion module with an attention mechanism to efficiently merge different features, effectively expanding the receptive field. Our method demonstrates an excellent balance between segmentation accuracy and speed on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets.

First, to place a service in a Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) node, there should be sufficient resources in the served MEC node; otherwise, the service would be placed on the neighboring MEC node or even on the core node, resulting in higher delays. We start by modeling our problem with the aid of traffic theory to analytically obtain the necessary number of resources for achieving the desired delay. Second, to reduce the migration process delay, the migration should begin before the vehicle reaches the MEC node. Thus, an AI lane-based scheme is proposed to predict candidate nodes for migration based on precise positioning. Precise positioning data is acquired from a Real-Time Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (RTK- GNSS) measurement campaign. The obtained imbalanced raw data is treated and used in the prediction scheme, and the resulting prediction accuracy achieves 99.3%. Finally, we formulate a service placement and migration delay optimization problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. The algorithm shows a latency reduction of approximately 50% compared to the core placement and up to 29% compared to the benchmark prediction algorithm. Moreover, the simulation results for the proposed service placement and migration algorithm show that in case the MEC resource calculations are not used, the delay is 2.2 times greater than when they are used.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2024.3496583","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program; 5G-ROUTES Project(grant numbers:951867); Horizon Europe Research Program(grant numbers:101058505); Estonian Education and Youth Board OUF11 AIoT*5G-Artificial; European Union's HE Research and Innovation Program HORIZON-JUSNS 2023; 6G-Path Project(grant numbers:101139172); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750435","5G;beyond 5G;MEC;position prediction;RTK;service migration;service placement;vehicular communication","Delays;Prediction algorithms;Optimization;Convolutional neural networks;Accuracy;Quality of service;Genetic algorithms;Energy consumption;Approximation algorithms;5G mobile communication","","","","41","CCBYNCND","12 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a novel hierarchical Digital Twin (DT) and consensus empowered cooperative control framework for safe driving in harsh areas. Specifically, leveraging intra-platoon information exchange, one platoon-level DT is constructed on the leader and multiple vehicle-level DTs are distributed among platoon members. The leader first makes critical platoon-driving decisions based on the platoon-level DT. Then, considering the impact of unreliable links on the platoon-level DT accuracy and the consequent risk of unsafe decision-making, a distributed consensus scheme is proposed to negotiate critical decisions efficiently. Upon successful negotiation, vehicles proceed to execute critical decisions, relying on their vehicle-level DTs. Otherwise, a Space-Air-Ground-Integrated-Network (SAGIN) enabled information exchange is utilized to update the platoon-level DT for subsequent safe decision-making in scenarios with unreliable links, no roadside units, and obstructed platoons. Furthermore, based on this framework, an adaptive platooning scheme is designed to minimize total delay and ensure driving safety. Simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme improves driving safety by 21.1% and reduces total delay by 24.2% in harsh areas compared with existing approaches.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2024.9010076","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171104,62201122); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817716","platoon;autonomous driving;distributed consensus;digital twin;space-air-ground integrated network","Automation;Simulation;Roads;Decision making;Space-air-ground integrated networks;Safety;Delays;Digital twins;Autonomous vehicles;Information exchange","","","","32","","30 Dec 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Early diagnosis is vital for ASD’s subsequent treatment. However, existing eye-tracking-based methods suffer from long diagnostic times and low diagnostic accuracy due to the lack of awareness of gaze preference derived from individual differences. Moreover, there is only one publicly available eye-tracking dataset that employs a simple image free-viewing paradigm to collect the gaze patterns of ASD and typically developed (TD) subjects with an average age of 8 years, thus can not effectively support the early diagnosis for preschool children. To tackle the difficulties, in this paper, we first propose an Uncertainty-inspired ASD Screening Network (UASN) that dynamically estimates the contribution of each stimulus viewed by different subjects, and secondly, we design a contrastive image-viewing paradigm and further collect eye movement data from preschool children to reveal the visual behaviors of ASD children accordingly. Specifically, in UASN, we estimate the uncertainty of each stimulus and use it for more efficient model training and a more simplified personalized diagnosis procedure. Besides, by synthesizing two images with the opposite semantic representations and recruiting ASD and TD subjects aged 2-6, we construct a new CI4ASD dataset, which offers a novel contrastive image-viewing paradigm for better diagnosis of ASD in children.

O-RANs are available in closed-source and open-source implementations; O-RANs can be configured by the operator and are cheaper than the closed RANs. Understanding the packet-level performance characteristics of these different 5G RAN implementations is a prerequisite for informed network planning and deployment, particularly for Non-Public Networks (NPNs) for specific use cases. Existing measurement studies have mainly considered a single User Equipment (UE); however, practical networks typically operate with multiple UEs. We conduct packet-level measurements for concurrent over-the-air transmissions to (downstream) and from (upstream) multiple UEs for a wide range of packet transmission rates. We consider current representative implementations of three RAN architectural options: closed RAN (based on Nokia system), closed-source O-RAN (based on Airspan system), and open-source O-RAN (based on srsRAN Project system). We find that the one-way packet delays and the packet loss probabilities can vary sharply among the multiple concurrently operating UEs (which are identical in model and configuration) in the closed RAN and open-source O-RAN; whereas, the packet-level performance tends to be more consistent among the UEs in the closed-source O-RAN.

By incorporating this system into the development process, the aim is to provide continuous, 24/7 operational efficiency for strawberry harvesting in greenhouse environments. This study is grounded in a comprehensive literature review of simulated environments, such as ROS-Gazebo, deep learning detection models, and mobile robot platforms, with a focus on developing innovative robotic solutions for strawberry detection and grasping in a simulated digital twin greenhouse environment. The YOLOv9-GLEAN deep learning model, with super-resolution capabilities, is introduced to enhance strawberry detection accuracy by generating high-resolution image features. We developed a digital twin model of the SILAL strawberry greenhouse farm in Abu Dhabi, UAE, within the ROS-Gazebo environment, to validate our algorithm and test the MARTA (Mobile Autonomous Robot with Telescopic Arm) robot. The dataset used to improve model performance includes both real strawberry images from greenhouse farm and synthetic CAD-generated images. ROS-MoveIt was employed to implement visual servoing, allowing the robot to generate precise motion trajectories to approach and grasp identified strawberries, with visual feedback enhancing accuracy. Empirical results show that our proposed detection model outperforms other existing models, achieving a precision of 0.996 and a recall of 0.991. The model’s adaptability to varied datasets, including real and synthetic images, is notable, and it performs exceptionally well in the simulated digital twin model of the greenhouse farm. The model is uniquely trained on both real and synthetic strawberry images to ensure robust detection performance. It is compared to state-of-the-art models and deployed on a telescopic arm-based robotic platform, which is simpler to control than an articulated arm for strawberry harvesting and grasping tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3520233","Khalifa University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:RC1-2018-KUCARS-T4); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807213","Deep learning;differential drive robot;gazebo;greenhouse;ROS;telescopic arm","Robots;Green products;Solid modeling;Mobile robots;Robot sensing systems;Digital twins;Computational modeling;Mathematical models;Crops;Real-time systems","","","","77","CCBY","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, cloud cover and the sensor hardware limitations have constrained the access to such LST data. In this work, a two-step framework is proposed to generate hourly gapless LST, which is made up of two steps: first, a machine learning model is used to reconstruct moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily (four times from Terra and Aqua) LST; and second, the generated daily gapless LST is then fused with hourly community land model (CLM) simulated LST based on the spatial and temporal nonlocal fusion model. A 0.01°, hourly, gapless LST dataset was generated over the middle and upper sections of the Heihe River Basin in China from 2008 to 2011. Validation was conducted using clear-sky MODIS LST and four sets of all-sky ground-based LST measurements. The results reveal that the daily LST reconstruction model performs well, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.97–0.98 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.01–3.6 K in cloudy conditions. Validation using hourly in situ measurements also indicated a high accuracy, with the RMSE between 2.56 and 3.76 K under all-sky conditions. The daily mean LST obtained by averaging the hourly gapless LST resulted in an RMSE of 1.6–1.92 K. Spatial and temporal analysis further demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately characterize the spatial details and temporal dynamics of LST at both daily and hourly scales. Compared with other hourly and daily mean LST products, the generated LST data have better validation accuracy. The proposed method offers a practical and robust approach to produce hourly gapless LST at a moderate spatial scale, which is essential in a variety of regional-scale thermal applications.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3503578","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42130108); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10766053","Data fusion;gapless;hourly;land surface model (LSM);land surface temperature (LST);machine learning (ML)","Land surface temperature;Land surface;Spatial resolution;Data models;MODIS;Atmospheric modeling;Clouds;Accuracy;Surface reconstruction;Interpolation","","","","113","CCBY","22 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the large differences between RSIs and natural images (NIs), most of the existing object detectors for NIs cannot be directly used to process RSIs. Most existing models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require additional design of specific attentional modules to relate small targets in RSIs to global positional relationships. In contrast, transformer-based models had to add modules to obtain more detailed information. This imposes additional computational overheads for deployment on edge devices. To solve the above-mentioned problem, we propose a hybrid CNN and transformer model (DConvTrans-LKA) to enhance the model's ability to acquire features and design a fusion of local and global attention mechanisms to fuse local features and global location information. To better fuse the feature and location information extracted by the model, we introduce a feature residual pyramid network to enhance the model's ability to fuse multiscale feature maps. Finally, we conduct experiments in three representative optical RSI datasets (NWPU VHR-10, HRRSD, and DIOR) to verify the effectiveness of our proposed DConvTrans-LKA method.

While hospital systems focus on text and visuals in medical images, audio integration remains an overlooked area with untapped potential. This research addresses the security gap by exploring the embedding of audio data in medical images to enhance patient record protection and information integrity. The Proposed work introduced an innovative Steganography approach for medical image data by embedding Audio files aiming to addresses this research gap. This method integrate audio data into medical images, specifically DICOM-standard images without compromising their visual integrity. It also preserves the integrity of DICOM metadata, ensuring compliance with medical imaging standards. The Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) steganography techniques are used to embed audio file data into medical images. The study illustrates the effectiveness of LSB and DCT techniques on a computed tomography(CT) Images. The LSB method is renowned for its simplicity and its ability to extract data without introducing errors. Additionally, the method offers efficient insertion and extraction time during the watermark embedding and retrieval process, making it highly practical for real-time applications. An algorithm employs DCT technique for Audio integration within DICOM images are more robust and imperceptible. Both techniques have been proven to be highly precise and supported by empirical evidence such as PSNR, SSIM, and MSE analysis. Robustness analysis was conducted on various image quality variation scenarios that includes compression level, resolution and noise tolerance. The proposed DCT approach achieves a PSNR of 57.89 dB, SSIM of 0.9997, and MSE of 0.013, demonstrating minimal distortion and superior structural integrity. Robustness analysis shows that DCT outperforms the LSB method, consistently maintaining PSNR above 47 dB, MSE approximately zero, and SSIM at 0.99 across varying compression levels, image resolutions, and noise conditions. After conducting an experiment, the DCT technique is the most suitable approach for secure communication of medical data with capacity of 2.03 bits per pixel (bpp).

Under this scenario, the UAVBSs-Better Direction Control (UAVBSs-BDC) algorithm works iteratively based only on the UAV utility function with linear time to directly optimize the action selection based on the UAVBS’s utility.

In this article, we propose a joint detection method for moving targets in video SAR, which can combine the information of the video SAR image and the corresponding sparse image to suppress background interference sufficiently and improve detection accuracy. Specifically, the low-rank sparse decomposition technology is first applied for video SAR images to generate their corresponding sparse images in which the background is eliminated and shadows of moving targets are enhanced. Then, we improve faster RCNN and build a two-stream extraction feature network based on the Transformer structure that allows the video SAR image and the sparse image as input simultaneously as well as extracts and fuses the features from two types of the images, which can acquire more discriminative target features, thereby improving the final the detection performance. Furthermore, the improved faster RCNN only modifies the original feature extraction network. Thus, it can adopt the same training and test manner as faster RCNN, greatly facilitating its utilization. Finally, experiment results on Sandia National Laboratories data demonstrate that the proposed detection method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

The Adaptive Misbehavior Detection Framework addresses critical security challenges within localized vehicles by incorporating dynamically computed parameters and confidence intervals to assess message integrity. To determine the presence of misbehavior, a weighted average approach effectively reduces the possibility of false positives.

The estimation of ${{T}_{air}}$ by satellite land surface temperature (LST) is challenging due to the variable magnitude of the difference between ${{T}_{air}}$ and LST in both space and time, as well as the restriction of estimated ${{T}_{air}}$ to clear-sky conditions because of the penetration of infrared wavelengths. Moreover, the estimation suffers from low temporal resolution and primarily focuses on daily minimum, maximum, and two instantaneous ${{T}_{air}}$ per day. This study proposes a method for estimating all-sky gridded diurnal ${{T}_{air}}$ at regional scale from FY-4B/AGRI measurements. The multiscale geographically weighted regression model was investigated to establish the dynamic relationships between ground station observed ${{T}_{air}}$ and satellite LST under clear-sky conditions by employing different spatial values for each explanatory variable in localized regressions. A moving window loop based multiple linear regression was employed to establish the relationship between satellite-derived clear-sky ${{T}_{air}}$ and other variables to extrapolate ${{T}_{air}}$ in cloudy-sky pixels.

Personalised models of care need to replace the standardised ones to reflect the unique nature of internal issues that exist within every individual. A holistic care model that includes Physical, Mental, Emotional, Social, and Spiritual (PMESS) aspects of a person's wellbeing indicates an effective way forward. Such a multidimensional model enables a greater understanding of complex relationships between different factors and their effects on health and overall wellbeing. Empowered by intelligent technologies, such as data mining and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the PMESS model can systematically capture, analyse, and evaluate data across the multiple dimensions of the holistic model of care. It can help identify patterns within the data, generate useful insights, and support the development of effective prevention and personalized treatment strategies.

Significant progress has been made in interaction recognition research, but challenges remain. First, variations in camera positions and viewpoints can cause significant differences in skeletal data for actions of the same type. Second, capturing both spatial information from skeleton structures and temporal information from interaction sequences is crucial for discriminative interaction feature representation. Third, the different contributions of each participant especially in asymmetric interactions are often overlooked. To address the above issues, we propose an innovative method by designing the individual contribution based spatial-temporal attention graph convolutional network. In this work, we first propose a simple but feasible view transformation method to reduce data mismatch from multi-view cameras. Then we design individual contribution weights to measure the importance of each person for interaction feature representation. Next, a novel spatial-temporal attention module based on individual contribution weights is proposed to obtain attention based skeleton data, which are fed to multiple layers of graph convolution to extract spatial-temporal features. Additionally, we use a two-stream architecture with joint coordinates and joint motion data as inputs for each stream. A weighted fusion strategy is utilized to obtain the final classification score.

Forensic anthropologists use chest radiographs for comparative radiography due to their availability through health screening. In this paper, we leverage the power of deep neural networks and expert domain knowledge to create a radiographic identification system based on AM and PM chest radiographs. We compiled a dataset of 5,165 anonymized chest radiographs representing 760 individuals from the two datasets: NIH Chest X-Ray Database and case files from the Michigan State University Forensic Anthropology Laboratory. We first manually annotated 3 different regions of interest (ROIs) on the radiographs based on expert domain knowledge, viz., thoracic vertebrae from T1-T5; clavicles; and complete vertebral column. We then explored three families of deep neural networks, each selected for its unique strengths in addressing specific challenges in deep learning for processing these ROIs, as well as the entire radiograph. Our experiments reveal several compelling findings: (a) the thoracic vertebrae from T1-T5 results in better recognition performance compared to other regions; (b) Efficient Nets result in better recognition accuracy compared to ResNets and DenseNets; and (c) an ensemble of models based on different networks and different regions further improves recognition accuracy.

This paper evaluates the use of a BLDC motor for use as a direct drive haptic actuator, in comparison with the brushed direct-current (DC) motor and capstan mechanism commonly used in indirect drive actuation of haptic devices. The comparison metrics include data sheet parameters, peak torque determined using a thermal simulation, current and position step responses, uncoupled stability regions, and dynamic rendering areas. It is concluded that a direct drive BLDC motor can supply higher peak torque, while projecting lower inertia and friction and thus offering higher acceleration.

In this field of research, new forms of deployment are emerging, such as extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO), in which the antenna array at the base station (BS) is of extreme dimensions. As a result, spatial non-stationary features emerge as users view just a section of the antenna array, known as the visibility regions (VRs). The XL-MIMO systems can achieve higher spectral efficiency, improve cell coverage, and provide significantly higher data rates than standard MIMO systems. It is a promising technology for future sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, due to the large number of antennas, linear precoding algorithms such as Zero-Forcing (ZF) and regularized Zero-Forcing (RZF) methods suffer from unacceptable computational complexity, primarily due to the required matrix inversion. This work aims to develop low-complexity precoding techniques for the downlink XL-MIMO system. These low-complexity linear precoding methods are based on Gauss-Seidel (GS) and Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) techniques, which avoid calculating the complex matrix inversion and lead to stable linear precoding performance. To further enhance linear precoding performance, we incorporate the Chebyshev acceleration method with the SOR and GS methods, referred to as the Cheby-SOR and Cheby-GS methods. As these proposed methods require optimizing parameters, we create a deep unfolded network (DUN) to optimize the algorithm parameters. Our performance results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces computational complexity from to $\mathcal {O}(K^{2})$, where $K$ represents the number of users. Moreover, our approach outperforms the original algorithms, requiring only a few iterations to achieve the RZF bit error rate (BER) performance.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2024.3514749","Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT); Instituto de Telecomunicações; CELL-LESS6G; JST ASPIRE(grant numbers:JPMJAP2325); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10787224","Massive MIMO;XL-MIMO;non-stationary;linear precoding;Chebychev acceleration;low-complexity;iterative method;deep unfolding","Precoding;Massive MIMO;Downlink;Iterative methods;Computational complexity;Signal processing algorithms;Chebyshev approximation;Interference;Vehicular and wireless technologies;Artificial neural networks","","","","55","CCBY","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

GNN4HT further transforms the localization results into HT information graphs (HTIGs), representing the functional interaction graphs of HTs.

To address this issue better, in this paper we first analyze the mechanism of multi-scale feature extraction of object detection models, and then by constructing the object feature-wise attention module and the perturbation extraction module, a novel adversarial sample generation algorithm for attacking detection models is proposed. Specifically, in the first module, based on the multi-scale feature map, we reduce the range of perturbation and improve the stealthiness of adversarial samples by computing the noise distribution in the object region. Then in the second module, we feed the noise distribution into the generative adversarial networks to generate adversarial perturbation with strong attack transferability. By doing so, the proposed approach possesses the ability to better confuse the judgment of detection models.

With the help of edge computing, users can upload data to edge servers (ESs) adjacent to them for training, reducing the upload latency. However, shallow models like matrix factorization (MF) are still used, which cannot sufficiently extract context features, resulting in low prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a context-aware edge-cloud collaboration framework for QoS prediction, named CQEC.

The similar features and blurred edges between different crops make it difficult to extract crop boundaries accurately. Due to the high memory and computational costs, most of the deep learning-based models face efficiency limitations in real-scenario crop interpretation. To address the abovementioned issues, this article proposes a novel lightweight neural network, namely the CropNet, for crop interpretation. Aiming at the problem of feature similarity among different categories of crops, this article designs a global-local path aggregation (GLPA) mechanism, which uses shallow and deep neural networks to extract global detail information and local high-level information to enhance feature discrimination. An edge context feature enhancement module (ECFEM) is proposed to enhance edge and context feature extraction to address the problem of ambiguous crop edges. Finally, a feature fusion module based on an attention mechanism is used to automatically weigh different feature channels to enhance the crop semantics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the CropNet proposed in this article, we constructed several sets of comparison experiments comparing it with state-of-the-art deep learning models on a manually labeled vehicle-view crop image dataset.

Energy-industry transition pathways are developed for all countries of the Americas reaching 100% renewable energy (RE) by 2050 for all energy and industry sectors. To benchmark the transition to 100% RE, the results are compared to current energy policies across the Americas, representing business-as-usual (BAU) conditions. The results indicate the significant potential to expand RE, especially solar PV, to reach the 100% RE target and fully defossilize each region's economy. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) can be reduced from its current level of 71 €/MWh to 24 €/MWh in 2050, and the levelized cost of final energy (LCOFE) sees reductions from 49 to 40 €/MWh from 2020 to 2050. Conversely, under BAU conditions, the LCOE only sees moderate reductions to 43 €/MWh in 2050, and the LCOFE remains relatively stable at 39 €/MWh in 2050. Widespread electrification across energy-industry sectors requires significant expansion of solar PV, which accounts for 78% of all electricity supply, leading to 14.8 TW of installed capacity. Furthermore, e-hydrogen for e-fuels and e-chemicals leads to an electrolyser capacity of 4.3 TWel. The dominating role of solar PV thus indicates that the future Americas energy-industry system can be characterized as a Solar-to-X Economy.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2024.3476961","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:329313); LUT University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10726607","Energy management;energy storage;offshore installations;photovoltaic systems;renewable energy sources;wind power generation","Electricity;Industries;Fuels;Batteries;Energy consumption;Wind power generation;Fossil fuels;Photovoltaic systems;Electric potential;South America","","","","28","CCBY","21 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of the traditional deterministic pseudorandom numbers, physical random number generation (RNG) is currently being investigated by leveraging the chaotic dynamics of semiconductor lasers for improved security, speed, and compactness. However, those RNG approaches suffer from discrete and expensive components with limited scalability due to the enormous footprint imposed by the edge-emitting configuration, which increases the cost and impedes practical use in integrated devices. Herein, we demonstrated a parallel chip-scale RNG by first harnessing the self-chaotic dynamics of free-running broad-area vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (BA-VCSELs). The intense mode interaction within the broad-area cavity provides a robust foundation for ultrafast dynamics, allowing for high-security and high-speed RNG. Comparative analysis with a small-area quasi-single-mode VCSEL (QSM-VCSEL) confirms the efficacy of achieving high-speed RNG with hundreds of Gb/s from a single BA-VCSEL channel and 2 Tb/s from four channels as a proof-of-concept device. Given the easy fabrication and high scalability of VCSELs, this finding opens avenues for low-cost, massively parallel high-speed RNG chips with photodetector integration, unveiling opportunities for fields demanding unprecedented RNG rates and high levels of cybersecurity.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2024.3462489","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:RFS-OFP2023-5534,FCC/1/5939,ORFS-2022-CRG11-5079,ORA-2022-5313,BAS/1/1614-01-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10681270","Broad-area vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (BA-VCSELs);cybersecurity;random number generation (RNG);secure communications","Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Laser modes;Laser feedback;High-speed optical techniques;Optical device fabrication;Heuristic algorithms;Entropy","","","","62","CCBY","16 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While device-based, object-tagged, and camera-based approaches to HAR have many advantages, device-free HAR offers new contributions to the field. Unlike device-based or object-tagged methods, it does not require users to carry sensory devices, and unlike camera-based methods, it respects privacy. Despite the significant number of original research studies and surveys on device-free HAR published in recent years, many scientific questions remain open. In this study, a systematic literature review on device-free HAR was conducted by exploring ACM, IEEExplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and WebOfScience. This mixed-method study assesses the quality of the reviewed papers and analyzes suggested HAR methods in both a scientometric and technical manner. The scientometric analysis investigates the trends of scientific publications in this field from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2023 and reviews the types and distribution of publications among countries, universities, and media. The technical analysis categorizes methods based on device-free sensing modalities, the type, and granularity of recognized activities of proposed methods. It also discusses the common challenges and limitations of current device-free HAR approaches. Additionally, existing methods are compared based on their support for non-line-of-sight, multisubject, user-independent, and environment-independent recognition of human activities.

Due to the use of digital technology, smart grids often encounter malicious data that is deliberately injected to attack their grid operations. Such kind of perturbation could be targeted at any domain of a smart grid from household customers to bulk generation, leading to network failures and power disruption. To monitor the operational health of the smart grids, power system state estimation is a crucial task and becomes challenging when a false data injection occurs. In this work, three computation methods are proposed for estimating the state vector from contaminated measurement results that are typically available in the power transmission domain of a smart grid. This work is the first that proposes the correlation matching criterion to the power state estimation. As a non-convex function, the correlation matching loss is convexified using semidefinite relaxation. Furthermore, to preserve the rank-one condition inherent in the outer product of the power state vector, the best rank-one approximation based on the eigenvalue decomposition is employed. Numerical simulation is conducted to demonstrate the usability of the proposed algorithms and to illustrate their performance. Signal-plus-attack-to-noise ratio (SANR) and phase-to-attack ratio are examples of the situational quality that can exist in the power transmission systems. Both are chosen herein as the investigational aspects for comparing the performance of the proposed methods and corresponding low-rank approaches. Numerical results reveal that for a high region of the SANR, the new methods can provide significantly less root-mean-squared error and normalized bias norm than the previous approaches. Regarding the complexity, our proposed techniques consume more computational time than two former works due to iterative computation style, yet lower than a previous sophisticated work.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3519388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10804804","Power system state estimation;injection attacks;convex optimization;correlation matrix;semidefinite relaxation;eigenvalue decomposition","State estimation;Power systems;Correlation;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Vectors;Smart grids;Power system stability;Noise;Meters;Monitoring","","","","51","CCBY","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, real remote sensing images often contain multiple land cover classes with significant intraclass variability and interclass similarity, limiting the performance of change detection in complex scenarios. To address this, we leverage the capabilities of vision foundation models by applying the segment anything model (SAM) to remote sensing change detection, and we name this method dual encoder–decoder SAM (DED-SAM). Specifically, we construct a DED framework, utilizing a small-scale change detection model in both branches to generate mixed prompts including image features, mask prompts, and box prompts. The SAM 2 model is used for fine-grained recognition of dual-temporal images, generating accurate, and stable feature boundaries, which are then used as constraints to generate the final change mask. To validate the effectiveness of DED-SAM across various application scenarios, we conduct quantitative experiments on three public datasets: Levir-CD, SYSU-CD, and CDD, testing its detection capabilities under single change categories, multiple change categories, and seasonal pseudochange interference. The results show that the proposed DED-SAM achieved state-of-the-art F1 scores and IoUs on these three datasets: LEVIR-CD (92.00%, 85.11%), SYSU-CD (84.15%, 72.01%), and CDD (97.72%, 95.47%).","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3490754","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42471457); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3901305); Key Laboratory of Land Satellite Remote Sensing Application, Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China(grant numbers:KLSMNR-K202206); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Colleges and Universities in Jiansu Province(grant numbers:KYCX24_3034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10741350","Change detection;remote sensing;segment anything model;vision foundation model","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Decoding;Data models;Visualization;Transformers;Object oriented modeling;Accuracy;Semantics;Semantic segmentation","","","","61","CCBYNCND","1 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, conventional approaches rely on open-loop systems with static stimulation parameters, assuming that pre-determined EEG features universally indicate high or low excitability states. This one-size-fits-all approach overlooks individual neurophysiological differences and the dynamic nature of brain states, potentially compromising therapeutic efficacy. We present a supervised machine learning framework that predicts individual motor excitability states from pre-stimulus EEG features. Our approach combines established biomarkers with a comprehensive set of spectral and connectivity measures, implementing multi-scale feature selection within a nested cross-validation scheme. Validation across multiple classifiers, feature sets, and experimental protocols in 50 healthy participants demonstrated a mean prediction accuracy of  $71 \; \pm \; 7$ %. Hierarchical clustering of top predictive EEG features revealed two distinct participant subgroups. The first subgroup, comprising approximately 50% of participants, showed predictive features predominantly in alpha and low-beta bands in sensorimotor regions of the stimulated hemisphere, aligning with traditional associations of motor excitability and the sensorimotor  $\mu $ -rhythm. The second subgroup exhibited predictive features primarily in low and high gamma bands in parietal regions, suggesting that motor excitability is influenced by broader neural dynamics for these individuals. Our data-driven framework effectively identifies personalized motor excitability biomarkers, holding promise to optimize TMS interventions in clinical and research settings. Additionally, our approach provides a versatile platform for biomarker discovery and validation across diverse neuromodulation paradigms and brain signal classification tasks.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3516393","Else Kröner Medical Scientists Kolleg Clinbrain: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Clinical Brain Research; Machine Learning Cluster of Excellence (EXC)(grant numbers:2064/1-390727645); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF): Tubingen AI Center(grant numbers:FKZ: 01IS18039A); European Research Council (ERC Synergy) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program (ConnectToBrain)(grant numbers:810377); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10795227","Brain state classification;electroencephalography (EEG);machine learning;motor excitability;transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Motors;Protocols;Machine learning;Electromyography;Electrodes;Coils;Biomarkers;Training","","","","63","CCBY","12 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Quickly determining the cause of the fault through the transition resistance value and taking targeted measures to restore the power supply quickly is of great significance to improving the stability of the power system. Starting from the basic circuit principle, this paper analyzes the composition of the transition resistance for two typical grounding situations: the line-to-tower discharge and the line-to-ground discharge, and derives the equivalent impedance of the tower-wire grounding system. Based on analyzing the grounding wire parameters, the tower grounding resistance, and the span size, the 1-ohm impedance criterion was proposed, that is, the transition resistance during line-to-tower discharges should be less than 1 ohm. Then, the equation for calculating the transition resistance using the double-terminal fault recording was derived and simplified for engineering calculation. Finally, combined with 56 real fault cases of 220 kV~1000 kV transmission lines, each case’s transition resistance value and fault cause are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed 1-ohm criterion.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3523266","State Grid Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:5108-202218280A-2-349-XG); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10816416","High voltage transmission line;transition resistance;single-phase grounding fault;fault recorder;fault diagnosis","Circuit faults;Resistance;Grounding;Voltage measurement;Impedance;Phase measurement;Feature extraction;Electrical resistance measurement;Discharges (electric);Conductors","","","","29","CCBY","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Motivated by this problem, we propose a novel state estimator that integrates discrete transmitted measurements and implicit information between events provided by the proposed DETM. Our proposal guarantees a uniformly bounded mean-squared error in the stochastic context, regardless of transmission instants.

Tracking changing laser frequencies is especially demanding when the lasers themselves are noisy or if the frequencies rapidly change because they encode highly dynamic signals in, e.g., Doppler-ranging or dynamic cavity readout. Here, to address these and other possible applications, we report the development of a high signal bandwidth (>2 GHz) and high tracking bandwidth (2 MHz) multichannel phasemeter. The implementation utilizes an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) realized within the field programmable gate array (FPGA) part of a radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC), the programmable logic (PL). The benchmark level parameters of the phasemeter are obtained by operating the PL at its timing limits and introducing a novel multi-demodulation and phase accumulation scheme. We present performance measurements, discuss the role of the high tracking bandwidth for tracking highly dynamic signals, and demonstrate ultra-stable phase locking of a beat note between two widely tunable external cavity diode lasers. Within our implementation, we have included a direct measurement of the open-loop gain of the phase-locked loop (PLL) and an estimation of the residual phase error. These features are new in the field of FPGA-based phasemeter developments. We achieve a phase-noise floor in the sub-milli radian regime when comparing two signals, even for GHz frequencies, and demonstrate stable tracking of signals with a frequency change rate of 240 GHz/s.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2024.3509586","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy—EXC 2121 “Quantum Universe”(grant numbers:390833306); Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) with funding from the Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz(grant numbers:50OQ2001,50OQ2302); Open Access Publication Fund of Universität Hamburg; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10778598","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);frequency measurement;phase-locked loops (PLLs)","Bandwidth;Phase locked loops;Frequency measurement;Measurement by laser beam;Table lookup;Phase measurement;Laser stability;Laser noise;Instruments;Field programmable gate arrays","","","","27","CCBYNCND","5 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our model utilizes the ResNet architecture as the backbone network for fundamental gait features extraction. Subsequently, the features from different network layers are passed through the feature pyramid for feature fusion, so that multi-scale local information can be fused into global information, providing a more complete feature representation. The dual attention module enhances the fused features in multiple dimensions, enabling the model to capture information from different semantics and scale information.

While Transformers excel in long-horizon prediction, their tokenization mechanism and autoregressive nature lead to costly planning over long horizons, especially as the environment's dimensionality increases. To alleviate this issue, we use a TDM for short-term planning, and learn an autoregressive discrete Q-function using a separate Q-Transformer (QT) model to estimate a long-term return beyond the short-horizon planning. Our proposed method, QT-TDM, integrates the robust predictive capabilities of Transformers as dynamics models with the efficacy of a model-free Q-Transformer to mitigate the computational burden associated with real-time planning.

However, minor perturbations or ineffectual byte insertions can easily ‘fool’ these trained ML classifiers, making them ineffective against these crafted and smart malicious software. This survey aims to provide an encyclopedic overview of adversarial evasion attacks specifically targeting malware detection and classification systems, standing apart from previous surveys by focusing exclusively and comprehensively on this unique application domain. While significant strides have been made in adversarial research in other fields, the specific challenges of adversarial malware remain under-explored due to the intricate nature and constraints of the malware domain. Our survey addresses this gap by analyzing literature on adversarial evasion attacks published between 2013 and 2024, making it one of the first to systematically focus on malware-specific adversarial attacks in a detailed, self-contained manner. The paper will begin by introducing various machine-learning techniques used to generate adversarial malware samples, including the structural nuances of target files, which influence adversarial vulnerabilities. The work presents an in-depth threat model specific to adversarial malware evasion attacks, describing the unique attack surfaces of malware detectors and outlining adversarial goals tailored to the malware domain. We systematically analyze adversarial generation algorithms from broader domains adapted to malware evasion attacks, proposing a taxonomy of adversarial evasion attacks within malware detection based on target domains(Windows, Android and PDF). The survey highlights real-world adversarial evasion attacks on machine learning-based anti-malware engines under each taxonomical heading, demonstrating the evolution and refinement of these attack strategies over time. Our survey outlines current limitations and practical challenges in executing adversarial attacks against malware detectors in real-world environments. We identify open problems and propose future research directions for developing more practical, robust, efficient, and generalized adversarial attacks on ML-based malware classifiers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3519524","NSF Grant through Tennessee Tech University(grant numbers:2416990,2230609); North Carolina A&T State University(grant numbers:2416992,2230610); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10806701","Adversarial evasion attack;adversary modeling;security for AI;windows PE malware;Android malware;PDF malware","Malware;Surveys;Security;Perturbation methods;Glass box;Classification algorithms;Engines;Detectors;Complexity theory;Training data","","","","180","CCBY","18 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The accuracy of FS measurements relies on sensor traceability to an international standard, operator performance, and the choice of measurement setup. To ensure reliable comparisons of datasets, it is important to quantify the various aspects of uncertainty of FS measurements, which have not yet been thoroughly examined. In this study, we conducted two experiments to assess uncertainties in FS measurements and contribute to a more comprehensive uncertainty budget for in situ measurements. The first experiment examined the impact of varying distances of the fiber optic tip on the reference panel and derived a correction model. The latter was further applied to a case study, showing the impact of different distances to the panel on reflectance factors of vegetation. The second experiment investigated the influence of an operator's presence on the measurements. Results indicate uncertainties of up to 3.4% depending on wavelength and distance, and up to 2% due to the operator's presence. These uncertainties have some influence on the vegetation reflectance factors, and our findings show that without a proper examination of uncertainty, we may misinterpret a variability in the data rather than in the measurement setup. Our results emphasize the importance of estimating the uncertainty driven by operator and setup characteristics in FS. They highlight the need to calculate uncertainty budgets for FS measurements, as they are used to validate other sensors and ultimately influence further derived conclusions.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3479771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10715658","CAL/VAL;field spectroscopy (FS);Ground Truth;radiance;reflectance factor;uncertainty estimation","Uncertainty;Measurement uncertainty;Spectroscopy;Reflectivity;Optical variables measurement;Wavelength measurement;Sensors;Reliability;Standards;Remote sensing","","","","58","CCBY","14 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Extreme precipitation brought by ARs can cause a short-term surge in regional ice and snow mass, resulting in “transient” signal in the coordinate time series of Greenland GNSS stations. However, previous studies have mainly focused on ARs detection and corresponding climate impact factors, lacking research on the contribution of extreme AR precipitation to crustal deformation. This article utilizes MERRA-2 reanalysis data and the vIVT algorithm to statistically analyze the frequency, duration, and spatiotemporal distribution of ARs landings in Greenland from 2010 to 2019. We quantitatively analyze the extreme precipitation events caused by ARs and their spatiotemporal evolution characteristics across Greenland and its basins. Then, using coordinates time series from 46 GNSS stations in Greenland, we extract the transient crustal deformation signals caused by AR-induced precipitation based on the multichannel singular spectrum analysis method. The results show that from 2010 to 2019, ARs landed in Greenland a total of 186 times, with a duration of 3174 h, and they showed an overall increasing trend. AR-induced precipitation in Greenland accounted for approximately 13.42% of annual precipitation, with the western region contributing more than 16%. Overall, the contribution rate of AR-induced rainfall was lower than that of AR-induced snowfall. Transient crustal deformation signals caused by AR-induced precipitation were found in some GNSS stations, with vertical deformation reaching up to 1 mm. Coastal areas showed greater deformation than inland areas, and low-latitude areas showed greater deformation than high-latitude areas.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3517142","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42474042); Guangxi Science and Technology Major Program(grant numbers:AA23073017); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42074006); Key Laboratory of Polar Environment Monitoring and Public Governance; Ministry of Education(grant numbers:202304); State Key Laboratory of Geo-Information Engineering(grant numbers:SKLGIE2023); The National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFC2809103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10798465","Atmospheric rivers (ARs);GNSS;precipitation;transient signals","Precipitation;Global navigation satellite system;Deformation;Air pollution;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Spatial resolution;Rivers;Ice sheets;Ice;Green products","","","","66","CCBY","13 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The wavelength tunability of the filter was achieved based on the piezo actuation mechanism. Four in-plane identical piezo actuators were employed to simultaneously achieve both wavelength tunability and cavity air-gap parallelism in the filter. Two pairs of piezo actuators positioned at crossed locations enabled independent control of cavity air-gap dimensions along orthogonal directions in the cavity plane. Optical transmission measurements were performed at different spatial positions on the cavity region to estimate the cavity air-gap dimensions. The initial maximum spectral separation among different spatial positions owing to the initial non-parallelism of the cavity air gap was estimated to be ∼28 nm. After achieving cavity air-gap parallelism via piezo actuation, the final maximum spectral separation was reduced to ∼3 nm. The proposed device configuration significantly improved the cavity air-gap parallelism by minimizing the maximum variation of the cavity air-gap dimension from an initial value of 535 nm to a final value of 18 nm, resulting in an improvement by a factor of ∼30.

The multispectral PlanetScope image, with visible to near-infrared bands at 3-m resolution, has been continuously used for mapping SWBs recently, but accurately delineating SWB boundaries remains challenging. The Google Earth image allows for mapping surface water at a finer resolution than PlanetScope, but it lacks the near-infrared band in which water and nonwater are usually distinctive. This article proposes a novel domain-knowledge-guided multisource fusion network (DKFNet), which fuses PlanetScope with Google Earth images to map SWBs at 1-m resolution while integrating the complementary information from each data. DKFNet utilizes the normalized difference water index (NDWI) image from PlanetScope image as domain knowledge for water mapping. DKFNet contains a domain-knowledge-based coordinate attention module, which has an advantage in detecting small objects, to incorporate the position and distribution information of SWBs from the NDWI image. DKFNet incorporates a domain-knowledge-based atrous spatial pyramid pooling module that extracts the multiscale features of water bodies from the NDWI image. Finally, DKFNet employs a novel reweighting loss to adjust the sample weights, enabling the network to focus on SWBs and water–nonwater boundaries, which are difficult to map accurately from traditional deep-learning networks. Results demonstrate that DKFNet predicted better water boundaries and reduced many false positives predicted by deep-learning networks using PlanetScope-only image and Google Earth-only image. DKFNet also can better map SWBs than several state-of-the-art networks using both PlanetScope and Google Earth images.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3509712","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071457,42271400); International Science and Technology Cooperation Project(grant numbers:2022EHB018); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:ZDBS-LY-DQC034); Young Top-Notch Talent Cultivation Program of Hubei Province; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2022CFA045); Water Conservancy Preliminary Research and Consultation Project for Hubei Water Resources Research Institute(grant numbers:420000-2023-218-006-001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10772057","Deep learning;domain knowledge;image fusion;sample reweighting;small water body (SWB)","Deep learning;Spatial resolution;Sensors;Indexes;Image segmentation;Water resources;Land surface;Image sensors;Feature extraction;Accuracy","","","","98","CCBY","2 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Global navigation satellite system-reflectometry represents an emerging concept to retrieve geophysical parameters, including soil moisture, with an improved spatiotemporal resolution compared to traditional sensors. This article outlines a large-scale near-surface soil moisture product derived from Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) observations, provided daily at both 9 and 36 km. The proposed algorithm assumes that soil moisture variations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission are linearly correlated with changes in surface reflectivity. Surface reflectivity is computed from a subset of the delay-Doppler maps and subsequently normalized for reflection geometry using linear regression, which correlates reflectivity with incidence angle; this approach accounts for the varying effects of coherent and incoherent scattering. We thoroughly assessed our product using over three years of data. Compared to SMAP, we found a median unbiased root-mean-square error of 0.039 cm3cm−3, with varying accuracy depending on the land cover type, and of 0.027 cm3cm−3 compared to CYGNSS calibration/validation sites. In addition, we performed a triple collocation analysis using 257 in-situ sites and observed similar behavior in our product and SMAP, with an overall larger random noise component associated with CYGNSS. Available upon request, the University of Luxembourg product provides soil moisture information for applications demanding quicker revisit times than traditional products.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3498069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10753033","Bistatic radar;cyclone global navigation satellite system (CYGNSS);global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R);large-scale near-surface soil moisture;surface roughness","Soil moisture;Spatial resolution;Sea surface;Land surface;Surface roughness;Satellite broadcasting;Rough surfaces;Reflection;Radiometers;Global navigation satellite system","","","","79","CCBY","14 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multiple-user interference is one of the major issues faced by the satellites serving the multiple users operating at the common time-frequency resource block in the downlink channel. To mitigate this issue, the optimal linear precoders are implemented at the gateways (GWs). The precoding computation is performed by utilizing the channel state information obtained at user terminals (UTs). The optimal linear precoders are derived considering beamformer update and power control with an iterative per-antenna power optimization algorithm with a limited required number of iterations. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated using the In-Lab experiment for 16 × 16 precoding with multi-beam satellite for transmitting and receiving the precoded data with digital video broadcasting satellite-second generation extension (DVB-S2X) standard for the GW and the UTs. The software defined radio platforms are employed for emulating the GWs, UTs, and satellite links. The validation is supported by comparing the proposed optimal linear precoder with full frequency reuse (FFR), and minimum mean square error (MMSE) schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that with the optimal linear precoders it is possible to successfully cancel the inter-user interference in the simulated satellite FFR link. Thus, optimal linear precoding brings gains in terms of enhanced signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio, and increased system throughput and spectral efficiency.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2024.3509646","European Space Agency(grant numbers:4000122451/18/NL/NR); Luxembourg National Research Fund; CORE Project; Ground-based distributed beamforming harmonization for the integration of satellite and Terrestrial networks(grant numbers:FNR16352790); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10772061","FFR;MU-MIMO;precoding;power control;satellite communications","Precoding;Satellite broadcasting;5G mobile communication;Logic gates;Satellite communications;Optimization;Satellites;Symbols;Standards;Software","","","","33","CCBY","2 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Passive microwave remote sensing is commonly used to observe the freeze-thaw state. However, existing algorithms face challenges in accurately monitoring near-surface soil freeze/thaw in alpine zones. This article proposes a framework for enhancing freeze/thaw detection capability in alpine zones, focusing on band combination selection and parameterization. The proposed framework was tested in the three river source region (TRSR) of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Results indicate that the framework effectively monitors the freeze/thaw state, identifying horizontal polarization brightness temperature at 18.7 GHz (TB18.7H) and 23.8 GHz (TB23.8H) as the optimal band combinations for freeze/thaw discrimination in the TRSR. The framework enhances the accuracy of the freeze/thaw discrimination for both 0 and 5-cm soil depths. In particular, the monitoring accuracy for 0-cm soil shows a more significant improvement, with an overall discrimination accuracy of 90.02%, and discrimination accuracies of 93.52% for frozen soil and 84.68% for thawed soil, respectively. Furthermore, the framework outperformed traditional methods in monitoring the freeze-thaw cycle, reducing root mean square errors for the number of freezing days, initial freezing date, and thawing date by 16.75, 6.35, and 12.56 days, respectively. The estimated frozen days correlate well with both the permafrost distribution map and the annual mean ground temperature distribution map. This study offers a practical solution for monitoring the freeze/thaw cycle in alpine zones, providing crucial technical support for studies on regional climate change and land surface processes.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3494267","Open Project of Middle Yarlung Zangbo River Natural Resources Observation and Research Station(grant numbers:2024YJZKF002); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202308510286); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program(grant numbers:2019QZKK0307); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41801099); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10747392","Advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR-2);alpine zone;passive microwave remote sensing;soil surface freeze/thaw","Soil measurements;Surface topography;Microwave sensors;Remote sensing;Radiometers;Climate change;Scanning thermal microscopy;Energy capture;Ice accretion;Water monitoring","","","","67","CCBYNCND","8 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The unintentionally formed MoSe2 layer has been reported to establish a quasi-ohmic contact at the Mo/CIGS interface. In this research, we construct a device model for the CIGS solar cells with the MoSe2 intermediate layer using the solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D) considering the experimentally measured physical properties. By assuming Mo vacancies as the source of p-type conductivity of MoSe2, we demonstrate the reproducibility of the experimental series resistance. At the Mo/MoSe2 interface, a Schottky barrier of around 0.9 eV for holes is formed due to the difference in their work functions. It is revealed that the quasi-ohmic contact is formed by recombination between holes and electrons through the defect in the MoSe2, despite the Schottky barrier. Since the recombination at the MoSe2 layer follows the SRH model, the density of Mo vacancy significantly reduces the series resistance. Meanwhile, the decrease in the series resistance by the increase in the Mo vacancy saturates at around 0.83 Ω·cm2. To further reduce series resistance, Nb doping into the MoSe2 is proposed in SCAPS-1D, enhancing p-type conductivity. It is disclosed that the Nb doping induces a transition in dominant hole transport from recombination toward tunneling, resulting in a decrease in the series resistance. If the doping density of the Nb exceeds 5 × 1019 cm−3, the series resistance becomes comparable to the flat band condition of the back contact.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2024.3496479","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10777511","Back contact;MoSe  $_2$  ;quasi-ohmic contact;thin-film Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)  $_2$   solar cell","Photovoltaic cells;Resistance;Charge carrier processes;Radiation effects;Current density;Spectroscopy;Schottky barriers;Photovoltaic systems;Electrons;Doping","","","","39","CCBYNCND","4 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, acquiring such images is challenging due to current technical limitations and cost constraints. Spatiotemporal fusion offers an effective and economical solution to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously. This article introduces a new generative adversarial network (GAN) spatiotemporal fusion model based on multiscale convolution and attention mechanism for remote sensing images (MSCAM-GAN), to generate high-resolution fused images. The generator in MSCAM-GAN comprises three key components: feature extraction, feature fusion, and image reconstruction. Employing an encoder–decoder architecture, the generator effectively extracts multilevel features, accommodating significant resolution differences between high-resolution and low-resolution images. In the feature extraction stage, multiscale convolutional attention network (MSCAN) captures detailed features across multiple scales, dealing with spatial dependencies and long-distance relationships within the images. During the feature fusion stage, a dual parallel attention feature fusion mechanism is designed to fully integrate the extracted multiscale features. Different attention weights are assigned based on their contributions to the final output, resulting in more accurate predicted images. MSCAM-GAN was tested on the Coleambally irrigated area and lower Gwydir catchment datasets and compared with classic spatiotemporal fusion algorithms. Ablation experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the various submodules in MSCAM-GAN. Experimental results and ablation analysis demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to other approaches.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3507815","Key Laboratory of Natural Resources Monitoring and Supervision; Ministry of Natural Resources(grant numbers:NRMSSHR2023Y11); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10770561","Attention mechanism;generative adversarial network (GAN);multiscale;spatiotemporal fusion","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Convolution;Accuracy;Generative adversarial networks;Image reconstruction;Generators;Bayes methods","","","","44","CCBY","28 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of the traditional methods of target sensing using spectral information treat hyperspectral image as 2-D matrix regardless of the structure information of hyperspectral image, resulting in insufficient separation of target and background and limited detection accuracy. In order to better utilize the hyperspectral intrinsic structural information, this article proposes a hyperspectral target sensing approach based on tensor adaptive reconstruction cascaded with global and local feature fusion (TRGLF). First, the Tucker decomposition and reconstruction method is utilized to alleviate the influence of noise and other elements in the complex background hyperspectral, which can maintain the intrinsic structural features of the data and improve the background and target separation. The principal components of the factor matrix are determined by a logarithmic singular value summation strategy, and then the energy difference between the spectra to be measured and the previous spectra is calculated to fine-tune the principal components and obtain more appropriate principal component values. Second, on the basis of reconstructed data, a global and local spatial spectral fusion method is adopted to obtain the target of interest. This includes using globally constrained energy minimization to obtain the target of interest and using local differential sensing to further obtain the target boundary.

However, many latest deep learning models have predominantly focused on increasing depth and size to enhance detection accuracy, often ignoring the balance between accuracy and detection speed, as well as the practical deployment of these models on hardware platforms. Therefore, a lightweight algorithm for SAR ship detection is designed in this article. First, we propose a preliminary lightweight scheme, including a multiscale feature learning augmented backbone, a lightweight feature fusion neck, and a parameter-sharing lightweight detection head. Second, unimportant branches of the network are pruned to further compress the model. Finally, the detection accuracy of the model is enhanced by knowledge distillation without augmenting the model volume, which compensates for the accuracy loss caused by model compression. Experimental validation is conducted on three SAR image ship detection datasets (SSDD, high-resolution SAR images dataset, large-scale SAR ship detection dataset-v1.0) to thoroughly assess the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight algorithm. Experimental results on the three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a model volume reduction to one-third of the baseline while maintaining a minimal decrease in detection accuracy. In SSDD, the proposed method achieved 98.7 accuracy, 0.92M parameters, 3.1G FLOPS and 2.1 MB size of 1.5X pruning rate.

Governments are now enforcing the inclusion of smart charging capabilities in EV charging stations to facilitate this transition. While much of the current research focuses on managing voltage profiles, there is a growing need to examine harmonic emissions in greater detail. This study presents comprehensive data on harmonic distortion during the smart charging of eight popular EV models. We conducted an experimental analysis, measuring harmonic levels with charging current increments of 1A, ranging from the minimum to the maximum for each vehicle. The analysis compared harmonic emissions from both single and multiple EV charging scenarios against the thresholds for total harmonic distortion (THD) and individual harmonic limits outlined in power quality standards (e.g. IEC). Monte Carlo simulations were employed to further understand the behavior in multi-vehicle scenarios. The results reveal that harmonic distortion increases as the charging current decreases across both single and multiple vehicle charging instances. In case studies where several vehicles charge simultaneously, the findings show that as more EVs charge together, harmonic cancellation effects become more pronounced, leading to a gradual reduction in overall harmonic distortion. However, under worst-case conditions, the aggregate current THD can rise as high as 25%, with half of the tested vehicles surpassing the individual harmonic limits.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2024.3505778","EU H2020 Research Infrastructure Erigrid Project 2.0(grant numbers:870620); Republic of Türkiye Ministry of National Education; AHEAD PROJECT Horizon Europe(grant numbers:101160665); EV4EU PROJECT Horizon Europe(grant numbers:101056765); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10766666","Electric vehicles;harmonic distortion;smart charging;power grid impacts;power quality","Harmonic analysis;Smart charging;Power system harmonics;Standards;Power grids;Power quality;Industries;Transformers;Stress;Power transformer insulation","","","","79","CCBY","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, long-term accurate mapping and changes of wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau remain knowledge gaps. Here, we qualify wetlands' spatial and temporal changes between 1990 and 2020 using Landsat imagery with an optimized random forest model. We find that the total area of marsh, floodplain, and swamp wetlands was approximately 8.25 × 104 (2.68% of the plateau area), 6.99 × 104 (2.27%), and 8.47 × 104 km2 (2.75%) in 1990, 2000, and 2020, respectively. The total area of wetlands decreased by about 1.29 × 104 km2 (−15.7%) between 1990 and 2000 but increased by about 1.52 × 104 km2 (21.7%) between 2000 and 2020. Marsh and floodplain wetlands show a decrease followed by an increase, while swamps continue to increase. The high-density wetlands are mainly distributed in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins, especially with marsh and floodplain wetlands >40%, and Brahmaputra high-density swamps ∼40%. Conversion of wetland types occurred in a relatively high proportion of all periods, but there was a gradual downward trend. The proportion of conversions from wetlands to nonwetlands decreased and the proportion of conversions within wetlands increased. This study elucidates the distribution characteristics, area change, and type conversion of wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau, which provides scientific support for the development and use of alpine wetlands and governmental risk decision making.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3495709","Basic Science Center for Tibetan Plateau Earth System (BSCTPES, NSFC)(grant numbers:41988101-03); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program(grant numbers:2019QZKK0201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750156","Area change;marsh–floodplain–swamp;Tibetan plateau (TP);type conversion;wetland","Wetlands;Vegetation mapping;Remote sensing;Rivers;Lakes;Sea measurements;Landsat;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Accuracy;Climate change","","","","62","CCBYNCND","11 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of its main NTL-based applications is to assess disaster impacts; nevertheless, the full potential of NTL-based disaster impact assessment has been largely constrained due to the uncertainties in estimating business-as-usual (BAU) NTL intensity (i.e., the counterfactual condition with no disaster occurrence) and hurdles in isolating the disaster impact from other cocontributing factors of NTL changes. To address these issues, we adopted the synthetic control (SC) modeling framework to construct a robust estimation of BAU NTL with daily NTL images from NASA’s Black Marble VIIRS product. We further improved the traditional SC model by optimizing donor selection with the dynamic time warping algorithm (DTW) and incorporating random forest regression to better capture target-donor relationships. Applying our model to 20 severe disasters across geographies, types, magnitudes, and socioeconomic contexts, our model significantly outperformed existing approaches, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.94 against reference and a 0.47% difference of covariates. Besides, our model showed a robust performance in detecting disaster impacts with a low impact intensity and short-term impact duration, which were largely under-detected by existing approaches. The resulting disaster impact assessment metrics, including impact duration, impact intensity, and impact severity, provided further insights into the substantial heterogeneity in disaster coping capability and socioeconomic resilience across regions. Our proposed model holds a broad significance in supporting not only strategic and effective disaster relief but also achieving ambitious climate resilience and sustainability goals.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3512549","The Chinese University of Hong Kong(grant numbers:4937239); General Research Fund of the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CUHK 15204824); Hong Kong Polytechnic University(grant numbers:P0044791); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781441","Black marble product;disasters;nighttime light (NTL);synthetic control (SC);time series analysis","Disasters;Time series analysis;Socioeconomics;Economic indicators;Data models;Noise;Urban areas;Uncertainty;Hurricanes;Sustainable development","","","","66","CCBY","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This not only affects spike generation rates but also causes read voltage drops in post-synaptic arrays, ultimately degrading the system’s accuracy. Previous solutions to the fan-out problem, including the incorporation of delay-capacitors, inverter chains, or operational amplifiers, require substantial area and consume considerable static power, thereby impeding low-power computing for event-driven operations in SNN. To address this issue, we propose the integration of spike-based voltage buffers (S-VBs) and pull-down pulse width modulation (PD-PWM) circuits. The proposed circuits operate in a fully event-driven manner, resulting in a very low static power consumption. Remarkably, the PD-PWM circuit consumes less than 1 % of the energy required by the conventional delay-capacitor method for spike-width modulation. When simulated with a 512 × 512 scale post-synaptic resistive random-access memory array, the neuron circuit with proposed fan-out circuits demonstrated an energy consumption of 447 pJ/spike, including the power to drive the synaptic arrays. In addition, the proposed fan-out circuit enables low-power operation, even at low firing rates, owing to its ultra-low static power consumption. Furthermore, system-level simulations indicate that the proposed circuit maintains high accuracy, with a drop in accuracy of less than 0.1 %p, even with a 10-%p fluctuation in the driving voltage.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3525583","Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2022M3I7A1078544,RS-2024-00402495); Seoul National University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820313","fan-out;neuron circuits;static power;spiking neural networks","Circuits;Neurons;Virtual machine monitors;Integrated circuit modeling;Delays;Accuracy;Transistors;Immune system;Inverters;Array signal processing","","","","","CCBY","2 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For the arterial models, we used animal specific imaging data and realistic geometries were reconstructed which were used as input to the drug-delivery model. More specifically, optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging data from two coney iliac arterial segments were 3D reconstructed, and the preprocessed 3D stent was deployed in-silico. The deformed geometries of the in-silico deployed stents and the dilated arterial segments were used as input to the drug elution model. The same reconstructed arteries were used in three different cases: (i) Case A. The coatings contain retinoic acid at an initial concentration 49.2% w/w. (ii) Case B. The coatings contain retinoic acid at an initial concentration 1% w/w. (iii) Case C. The coatings contain sirolimus at an initial concentration 0.85% w/w. In each case, two different coatings were examined: (a) polylactic acid and (b) polylactic-co-glycolic acid. The results proved that retinoic acid is a very promising drug candidate for DES due to its binding time to the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall that exceeds the corresponding time of sirolimus, while being non-toxic to the smooth muscle cells.","2644-1276","","10.1109/OJEMB.2024.3402057","Greek “Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation”(grant numbers:Τ1ΕDΚ-03965); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10531649","Drug eluting stents;computational modeling;controlled release. retinoic acid;sirolimus","Drugs;Arteries;Coatings;Polymers;Image reconstruction;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling","","","","43","CCBYNCND","16 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current domain adaptation algorithms focus on finding domain-invariant subspaces to reduce domain shift, but there is still room to improve sample discriminability. Moreover, inappropriate projection between source and target domains can also affect the transfer effect. To tackle these issues, this article proposes a spectral-spatial ensemble low-rank domain adaptation (S2ELRDA) method. In S2ELRDA, low-rank constraints are imposed to align samples with the same labels in the two domains, enhancing sample discriminability while reducing domain shift. Furthermore, ensemble learning is utilized to select samples based on confidence as supervised information for the target domain, further improving subspace robustness. Additionally, the inherent characteristics of HSIs are considered, and spectral-spatial features are extracted for alignment to enhance sample discriminability in the subspace. Experimental results on three HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed S2ELRDA shows better performance than existing algorithms.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3502253","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42122008,U24A20588); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10757432","Domain adaptation;ensemble learning;hyperspectral image (HSI) classification;low-rank constraints","Hyperspectral imaging;Land surface;Graphical models;Distribution functions;Kernel;Feature extraction;Robustness;Manifolds;Ensemble learning;Image classification","","","","52","CCBY","19 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, prevalent DAG-based protocols grapple with substantial latency issues, suffering from a latency gap compared to non-DAG protocols. For instance, leading-edge DAG-based protocols named GradedDAG and BullShark exhibit a good-case latency of $4$4 and $6$6 communication rounds, respectively. In contrast, the non-DAG protocol, exemplified by PBFT, attains a latency of $3$3 rounds in favorable conditions. To bridge this latency gap, we propose Remora, a novel DAG-based BFT protocol. Remora achieves a reduced latency of $3$3 rounds by incorporating optimistic paths. At its core, Remora endeavors to commit blocks through the optimistic path initially, facilitating low latency in favorable situations. Conversely, in unfavorable scenarios, Remora seamlessly transitions to a pessimistic path to ensure liveness.

Most existing methods use traditional convolutional operations to achieve fine-grained image classification. However, traditional convolution cannot extract multi-scale features of an image and existing methods are susceptible to interference from image background information. Therefore, to address the above problems, this paper proposes an FGIC model (Attention-PCNN) based on hybrid attention mechanism and pyramidal convolution. The model feeds the multi-scale features extracted by the pyramidal convolutional neural network into two branches capturing global and local information respectively.

Comparing multiple embedding visualizations drives decision-making in many domains, but traditional comparison methods are limited by a reliance on direct point correspondences. This requirement precludes comparisons without point correspondences, such as two different datasets of annotated images, and fails to capture meaningful higher-level relationships among point groups. To address these shortcomings, we propose a general framework for comparing embedding visualizations based on shared class labels rather than individual points. Our approach partitions points into regions corresponding to three key class concepts-confusion, neighborhood, and relative size-to characterize intra- and inter-class relationships. Informed by a preliminary user study, we implemented our framework using perceptual neighborhood graphs to define these regions and introduced metrics to quantify each concept. We demonstrate the generality of our framework with usage scenarios from machine learning and single-cell biology, highlighting our metrics' ability to draw insightful comparisons across label hierarchies. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an evaluation study with five machine learning researchers and six single-cell biologists using an interactive and scalable prototype built with Python, JavaScript, and Rust.

The key to this enhancement is a newly developed adaptive chaotic map based on sine map and the dynamic interplay of two key parameters (rn,kn). Of course, the efficiency of the proposed chaotic map is demonstrated by the time evolution, the Bifurcation diagram, Permutation Entropy (PE), Fuzzy Correlation Dimension (FCD), and Lyapunov Exponent (LE) analyses and comparison with the existing reported maps. Thereafter, by applying chaos theory to address the limitations of default cipher parameters, and operating modes and to control S-boxes, permutation functions, key schedules, data masking, we introduce nonlinearity and diffusion, making the block ciphers more resistant to attacks.

At the same time, deep learning has seen a wave of popularity across many different research areas and data modalities. Satellite imagery has become available in unprecedented quantities, driving much research from the wider remote sensing community. The data hungry nature of deep learning models and this huge data volume seem like a perfect match. But has deep learning been adopted for agricultural tasks using satellite images? This systematic review of 193 studies analyzes the tasks that have reaped benefits from deep learning algorithms, and those that have not. It was found that while land use/land cover research has embraced deep learning algorithms, research on other agricultural tasks has not. This poor adoption appears to be due to a critical lack of labeled datasets for these other tasks. Thus, we give suggestions for collecting larger datasets. In addition, satellite images differ from ground-based images in a number of ways, resulting in a proliferation of interesting data interpretations unique to satellite images. So, this review also introduces a taxonomy of data input shapes and how they are interpreted in order to facilitate easier communication of algorithm types and enable quantitative analysis.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3501216","SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10772350","Agriculture;computer vision;deep learning;satellite imagery;systematic review","Satellite images;Deep learning;Agriculture;Satellites;Crops;Remote sensing;Image color analysis;Reflectivity;Predictive models;Computer vision","","","","148","CCBY","2 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, cysts on pathological sections often present with irregular and complex morphology, as well as extremely similar to surrounding tissue, which poses a great challenge in achieving their accurate segmentation. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a U-shaped image segmentation network based on residual bottleneck and multiscale dilated convolution, called RBMDC-Net. In our approach, the standard convolutional module in the U-Net encoding path is replaced with residual bottleneck module (RBM) that enables the network to extract features at various scales using multiple kernel sizes and residual connection. Next, we process each feature extracted from the encoder by passing it through a series of multiscale dilated convolution modules (MDCM), which capture more diverse and reliable features by increasing the acceptance field. In addition, we introduce the multi-level feature guidance module (MFGM) to address the issue of semantic dilution that often occurs during the progressive up-sampling. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of RBMDC-Net, we developed two image datasets: the first is the original images of jaw cyst collected by Quzhou People’s Hospital, and the second is its augmented dataset. These datasets encompass a wide range of jaw cyst characteristics, including size, shape, and location, as well as varying environmental conditions such as lighting and imaging quality. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RBMDC-Net significantly outperforms other comparable methods in the task of image segmentation. Specifically, when applied to the original jaw cyst dataset, RBMDC-Net achieved F1 of 93.13%, Mcc of 93.08% and Jaccard of 87.17%. These results represent improvements of 5.75%, 5.36%, and 9.31% over the performance of the widely used U-Net architecture. Furthermore, when tested on the augmented jaw cyst dataset, the RBMDC-Net continued to show superior performance with F1 of 91.92%, Mcc of 91.85% and Jaccard of 85.14%. These metrics were 3.03%, 2.84%, and 4.88% higher than the corresponding values obtained using U-Net.

A wide range of evaluation metrics such as the relative bias (RB), Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), mean error (ME), normalized mean error (NME), mean absolute error (MAE), normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are considered in the study. The verification skills of SPPs at different precipitation intensity thresholds is analyzed through the probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), frequency bias index (FBI) and Heidke skill score (HSS). It is universally observed that both products are prone to underestimate precipitation over Taiwan, especially over high-elevation locations.

This study contributes to this domain by enhancing traffic prediction models. Traditional traffic models often fall short in accurately predicting traffic flow, particularly in dynamic urban settings. This limitation necessitates the development of more adaptive and accurate predictive models to manage traffic congestion effectively. In urban environments, traffic estimation at multi-intersection nodes and connecting roadis approached using statistical filters (Kalman or particle filters). The challenge lies in accurately predicting the vehicular traffic state at intersections, considering the dynamic nature of urban traffic and potential communication failures. This study introduces a novel approach in traffic modeling using statistical filters. The method involves the use of dynamically interchangeable state transition matrices, aligned with specific traffic signal control actions. This allows for more precise predictions under varying traffic conditions and control scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed models is validated across multiple intersections in urban settings. The evaluation focuses on the models’ scalability, adaptability to complex traffic networks, and robustness in communication failure scenarios. Our proposed Kalman filter showcased superior performance in traffic prediction with an average RMSE of 12.15975, demonstrating a significant improvement over the average measurement RMSE of 13.996875 and over traditional smooth Kalman filter and traditional particle filter.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10820531","Road traffic;Deep reinforcement learning;Kalman filters;Intelligent transportation systems;Prediction methods","","","","","","CCBYNCND","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Built upon existing segmentation techniques, our approach enhances the dual threshold segmentation process, optimizing the isolation of nucleus and cytoplasm components. This is achieved by adapting threshold values based on image characteristics, resulting in superior segmentation outcomes compared to previous methods. To address challenges, such as noise and incomplete white blood cells, we employ mathematical morphology and median filtering techniques. These methods effectively denoise the images and remove incomplete cells, leading to cleaner and more precise segmentation. Additionally, we propose a unique feature extraction method using a hybrid discrete wavelet transform, capturing both spatial and frequency information. This allows for the extraction of highly discriminative features from segmented images, enhancing the reliability of classification. For classification purposes, we utilize an improved Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) that leverages the extracted features. Our enhanced classification algorithm surpasses traditional methods, ensuring accurate identification of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Our innovation lies in the comprehensive integration of segmentation techniques, advanced denoising methods, novel feature extraction, and improved classification. Through extensive evaluation on bone marrow samples from the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image DataBase (ALL-IDB) for Image Processing database using MATLAB 10.0, our method demonstrates outstanding classification accuracy.

Furthermore, reliable lead and floe discrimination is essential for the calculation of sea ice freeboard and thickness from satellite altimetry. Despite its value for shipping, the Northwest Passage is commonly excluded from Arctic-wide satellite altimetry sea ice observations owing to the challenges of obtaining accurate retrievals in the region. Here, we map the distribution of leads and floes in the Northwest Passage using Landsat 8 satellite optical imagery, and we use these to evaluate the efficacy of near-coincident classifications from CryoSat-2 satellite radar altimetry. We test different pulse peakiness and stack standard deviation thresholds for discriminating returns from CryoSat-2 into leads and floes and assess the agreement with near-coincident Landsat 8 estimates. CryoSat-2 lead and floe densities are, on average, 14% higher and 45% lower than Landsat 8, respectively. We attribute the difference to a range of factors including the coarser spatial sampling of CryoSat-2 which results in mixed surface types within the radar footprint, off-nadir ranging of leads, and the misidentification of sea ice floes as ambiguous surface type. In particular, we find the poorest agreement in October, when the ice pack is fragile after the summer melt season. We use our findings to develop a bias adjustment to bring CryoSat-2 lead and floe density estimates in line with Landsat 8, reducing the root mean square difference between them from 20% to 5% and 47% to 6%, respectively.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3503286","Natural Environment Research Council; Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling and the DEFIANT project(grant numbers:NE/W004747/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10758740","Cryosat-2 (CS2);Landsat 8 (LS8);radar altimetry;remote sensing;sea ice","Sea ice;Lead;Ice;Satellites;Sensors;Ocean temperature;Altimetry;Radar;Spaceborne radar;Landsat","","","","65","CCBY","20 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of FSL, reviewing prominent deep learning based approaches of FSL. We define FSL through literature review in machine learning and specify the “$N$-way $K$-shot” paradigm to distinguish it from related learning challenges. Next, we classify FSL methods by analyzing the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of neural networks. It underscores the necessity for models with abundant labeled examples and finite hypothesis space to generalize well to new and unseen instances. We categorize FSL methods into three types based on strategies to increase labeled samples or reduce hypothesis space: data augmentation, model-based methods, and algorithm-optimized approaches. Using this taxonomy, we review various methods and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. We also present a comparison of these techniques as summarized in this paper, using benchmark datasets.

This strategy avoids both the bus renumbering procedure for branch ordering used in different BFSMs (due to their branch-oriented characteristic) and the matrix inversion procedure, also used in different BFSMs. The proposed strategy is innovative, since PF problems have been solved in the literature by methods based on static programming. Tests with 14-bus, 33-bus, 84-bus, 136-bus, and 417-bus systems were carried to evaluate both the performance of the construction procedure of the dynamic tree in comparison to the classical branch ordering procedure and the performance of the PF calculation procedure using the proposed dynamic tree in contrast to traditional BFSMs. Promising results were obtained in both evaluated aspects.

Deep learning-based algorithms have achieved superior accuracy in this field compared to traditional algorithms; however, these methods are often not designed with domain knowledge integration. In this article, we propose a multidirectional information-guided contextual network (MDIGCNet) for ISTD. The primary structure of this network adopts the U-Net architecture. To address the issue of lacking texture and structural information in the target images, we employ an integrated differential convolution (IDConv) module to extract richer image features during both the encoding and decoding stages. Skip connections in the network utilize a multidirectional gradient information extraction block (MGIEB) to obtain gradient features of infrared small targets. Our domain-inspired multidirectional Gaussian differential convolution (MGDC) module is employed to extract features of Gaussian-distributed small targets, enhancing the distinction between targets and backgrounds. Additionally, we designed a local-global feature fusion (LGFF) module incorporating an attention mechanism to merge shallow and deep features, thereby improving the efficiency of feature utilization within the model. Furthermore, since both IDConv and MGDC are parallel multiconvolutional kernel structures, reparameterization techniques are used to avoid excessive parameters and computational load.

However, many operations in the nuclear environment require teleoperating robots, resulting in a significant cognitive load on operators as well as physical strain over extended periods of time. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing the teleoperation system with an assistive model capable of predicting operator intentions and dynamically adapting to their needs. The machine learning model processes robotic arm force data, analyzing spatiotemporal patterns to accurately detect the ongoing task before its completion. To support this approach, we collected a diverse dataset from teleoperation experiments involving glovebox tasks in nuclear applications. This dataset encompasses heterogeneous spatiotemporal data captured from the teleoperation system. We employ a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to learn and forecast operator intentions based on the spatiotemporal data. By accurately predicting these intentions, the robot can execute tasks more efficiently and effectively, requiring minimal input from the operator. Our experiments validated the model using the dataset, focusing on tasks such as radiation surveys and object grasping. The proposed approach demonstrated an F1-score of 89% for task classification and an F1-score of 86% classification forecasted operator intentions over a 5-second window.

The VSI faults, the most prevalent type, can be addressed by bypassing damaged H-Bridges. However, operating the VSI in this condition without an appropriate postfault strategy can increase the torque ripple and losses, and reduce the maximum motor speed. While conventional postfault strategies for three-phase CHB VSIs can be extended to more phases, they often result in a suboptimal performance because the extra degrees of freedom available in multiphase motors are ignored. Recently, these degrees of freedom have been exploited for the postfault operation of $n$-phase CHB VSIs to maximize the drive speed range without field weakening or torque ripple. However, excessive low-order $xy$ harmonics arose in the stator current, producing a significant increase in its copper losses, which were limited by the use of a bulky filter. This article proposes a novel postfault operation strategy for $n$-phase CHB VSIs that dramatically reduces the stator copper losses by minimizing the injection of low-order $xy$ harmonics in the stator voltage, effectively eliminating the filter requirement, while maintaining a wide speed range without field weakening or torque ripple.

Annotation errors are unavoidable due to the complexity of satellite images. However, the distribution of real-world human-annotated label noises on satellite images and their impact on ConvNets have not been investigated. To fill this research gap, this article, for the first time, collected real-world labels from 32 participants and explored how their annotated label noise affects three representative ConvNets (VGG16, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50) for remote sensing image scene classification. We found that 1) human-annotated label noise exhibits significant class and instance dependence; 2) an additional 1% of human-annotated label noise in training data leads to a 0.5% reduction in the overall accuracy of ConvNets classification; and 3) the error pattern of ConvNet predictions was strongly correlated with that of participant's labels. To uncover the mechanism underlying the impact of human labeling errors on ConvNets, we compared it with three types of simulated label noise: uniform noise, class-dependent noise, and instance-dependent noise. Our results show that the impact of human-annotated label noise on ConvNets significantly differs from all three types of simulated label noise, while both class dependence and instance dependence contribute to the impact of human-annotated label noise on ConvNets. Additionally, the label noise estimation algorithm (confident learning) cannot fully identify label noise. These observations necessitate a reevaluation of the handling of noisy labels, and we anticipate that our real-world label noise dataset would facilitate the future development and assessment of label-noise learning algorithms.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3502461","Shenzhen Higher Institution Stability Support Plan(grant numbers:20200812154629001); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:000517); Otto Poon Charitable Foundation Smart Cities Research Institute at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Public Policy Research Funding Scheme(grant numbers:2022.A6.191.22A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10757363","Convolutional neural network (ConvNet);human-annotated label noise;label noise;remote sensing;scene classification","Noise;Remote sensing;Noise measurement;Classification algorithms;Accuracy;Estimation;Scene classification;Training data;Training;Satellite images","","","","70","CCBY","19 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study aims to generate synthetic SCG heartbeats which can augment existing datasets to enable more research avenues. Methods: We trained a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (GAN) with gradient penalty on authentic SCG heartbeats. It was conditioned with embedded subject-specific identifiers to create individualized heartbeats. We employed linear permutations in the latent and conditional spaces to control signal features, and a convolutional network to classify lung volume states from real and synthetic data separately. Results: The model effectively replicated SCG signal morphology, while maintaining a level of variance which matches the variability of cardiac activity. Comparisons with real SCG waveforms yielded Pearson's r-squared correlation of 0.62 for average heartbeats. Linear manipulations were successful in controlling simple features although they were limited in more complex characteristics. Additionally, the model demonstrated strong performance in practical applications, with the synthetic data achieving an accuracy of 88% in lung volume classification as compared to 89% achieved with real data. Augmenting real data with additional synthetic data improved performance by 3%. Conclusions: GANs for artificial SCG heartbeat generation produce realistic and diverse results that have the potential to overcome data limitations, thereby enhancing SCG-based research.","2644-1276","","10.1109/OJEMB.2024.3485535","National Sciences and Engineering Research Council; McGill University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10731564","Cardiovascular monitoring;generative adversarial networks;seismocardiography;synthetic generation;wearable monitoring","Heart rate variability;Heart beat;Generative adversarial networks;Vectors;Generators;Lung;Training;Convolution;Mathematical models;Electrocardiography","","","","42","CCBYNCND","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, seven highly established state-of-the-art AC (OC-SMART, ACOLITE, Polymer, Sen2Cor, iCOR, C2RCC, and L2gen from SeaDAS) approaches were employed on Sentinel-2 MSI high-resolution imageries. The performance of the AC algorithms was validated by comparing the satellite-derived remote sensing reflectance ($R_{rs}(\lambda)$) at four visible wavelengths (443, 460, 590, and 665 nm) with the co-located in-situ hyperspectral measurements acquired within a temporal window of $\pm $3 hours across various water zones located in the Atlantic Ocean. 75 optimal match-up pairs were obtained from six sites between December 2018 and August 2020. An unsupervised learning technique was used to classify the in-situ hyperspectral $R_{rs}(\lambda)$ measurements into three optical water types encompassing nearly clear to moderately turbid coastal and deep water zones. Upon general analysis, OC-SMART produced the most precise $R_{rs}(\lambda)$ with and $S_{tot}$ score and $\bar{\chi }^{2}$ value of 20.54/24, and 0.11, respectively. L2gen AC produced $R_{rs}(\lambda)$ that show the highest resemblance with the spectral shape in terms of Spectral Angle and Quality Assurance score with the in-situ $R_{rs}(\lambda)$ that are 10.4 and 0.84, respectively. The performance of ACs varies across the water types and wavelengths. Using existing bio-optical algorithms, the validation is further extended by obtaining downstream water-quality parameters, such as $Chl_{a}$, TSS, and $a_{cdom}(440)$, from the in-situ measured and atmospherically corrected $R_{rs}(\lambda)$.

However, SOH estimation is still challenging due to the electrochemical complexity of LIBs. This work proposes a novel, computationally-inexpensive, and chemically agnostic Machine Learning (ML) procedure for onboard real-time SOH estimation. The proposed methodology requires a narrow time window of voltage, current, and State-of-Charge battery data, collected while driving the vehicle. We defined a Simulink-based EV simulator, modeling a specific real-world EV, and we utilized it to generate a synthetic dataset by simulating multiple driving sessions of the EV to compensate for the lack of large-scale publicly available EV monitoring data. Then, we examined three feature extraction methods and three ML regression models, estimating the battery pack’s SOH. We conducted a thorough comparison of the proposed feature extraction methods and ML models, training the ML model with processed synthetic data and inferring over real driving session monitoring data from the corresponding real-world EV model. The best synthetic-trained ML model achieves an MAE of 0.27% and 5.08%, and an RMSE of 0.37% and 5.92% over synthetic and real test data, respectively. Finally, we implemented transfer learning over the ML models, employing a portion of the available real data, reaching the lowest MAE of 1.97%, and an RMSE of 2.56% over the remaining real test set.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3516215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10795164","Electric vehicle;battery pack;regression;machine learning;state-of-health","Batteries;Feature extraction;Mathematical models;Data models;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Training;Time series analysis;Computational modeling;Maximum likelihood estimation","","","","48","CCBY","12 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this gap, we aimed to evaluate the applicability of SDGSAT-1 glimmer imagery in road detection across five cities with well-developed road networks in China, namely Chengdu, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan. Watershed segmentation and optimal thresholding algorithms were applied to extract the road network data of these five cities. We observed that the large connecting roads, including highways (Motorway), urban expressways (Trunk), urban main roads (Primary), urban secondary roads (Secondary), and urban tertiary roads (Tertiary), were visible in the SDGSAT-1 glimmer data. Watershed segmentation and optimal thresholding algorithms demonstrated a remarkable precision of approximately 80% for road extraction across all cities.

In this article, we explore spectral and spatial remote sensing image features as improved MAE-reconstruction targets. We first conduct a study on reconstructing various image features, all performing comparably well or better than raw pixels. Based on such observations, we propose feature guided MAE (FG-MAE): reconstructing a combination of histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and normalized difference indices (NDI) for multispectral images, and reconstructing HOG for SAR images. Experimental results on three downstream tasks illustrate the effectiveness of FG-MAE with a particular boost for SAR imagery (e.g., up to 5% better than MAE on EuroSAT-SAR). Furthermore, we demonstrate the well-inherited scalability of FG-MAE and release a first series of pretrained vision transformers for medium-resolution SAR and multispectral images.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3493237","Helmholtz Association; Framework of Helmholtz AI(grant numbers:ZT-I-PF-5-01); Helmholtz Association's Initiative and Networking; HAICORE@FZJ partition for computation; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; AI4EO – Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation: Reasoning, Uncertainties, Ethics and Beyond(grant numbers:01DD20001); Munich Center for Machine Learning; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10766851","Earth observation;geospatial foundation models;masked autoencoder (MAE);remote sensing (RS);self-supervised learning","Image reconstruction;Remote sensing;Radar polarimetry;Image edge detection;Synthetic aperture radar;Histograms;Feature extraction;Noise;Indexes;Earth","","","","55","CCBY","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, instead of the commonly used gender-neutral SMPL model, we propose a simple yet effective method to generate more realistic age- and gender-specific human mesh models by interpolating among male, female, and infant SMPL models using two learned age and gender weights. The age weight controls the proportion of importance between male/female and infant models, which is learned in a data-driven scheme by considering the paired relation between ground-truth ages and age weights. The gender weight controls the proportion of importance between male and female models, which indicates the gender probability. Then, we explore the use of generated realistic mesh models for age and gender estimation. Finally, the human mesh reconstruction and age and gender estimation modules are integrated into a unified end-to-end framework for training and testing.

The primary challenge in deploying a QCI is the cost of using optical fibers and trusted repeater nodes (TRNs). Practical systems combine quantum and classical channels on the same fiber to reduce the cost of fibers dedicated to QKD. In such a system with quantum-classical coexistence, the optimal distribution of QKD requests with minimal deployment cost and power usage on the multiplexed links is challenging due to the diverse key rate demands of the requests, number of classical and quantum channels, guard band spacing between classical and quantum channels, and secret key rate of the quantum channels that decreases with distance. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Steiner tree-based approach for constructing a QCI that connects all quantum nodes with minimum TRNs. In addition, we propose a genetic algorithm-based solution to optimally distribute the end-to-end QKD requests over the QCI. We also determine feasible optical bypass routes to reduce the overall energy consumption in the network further. The proposed approach reduces the QCI deployment cost by 19.42% compared to the benchmark MST-Baseline.

While persistent pain has been linked to changes in brain activity, studies have focused mainly on acute and chronic phases, leaving neural changes during the subacute phase—especially during movement—under-researched. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate changes in brain activity and the impact of pain intensity in individuals with sLBP during rest and reaching movements. Using a 28-electrode EEG, we measured motor-related brain waves, including theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations. Transitioning from rest to movement phases resulted in significant reductions (>80%) in mean power across all frequency bands, indicating dynamic brain activation in response to movement. Furthermore, pain intensity was significantly correlated with brain wave activity. During rest, pain intensity was positively correlated with alpha oscillation activity in the central brain area (r = 0.40, p <0.05). In contrast, during movement, pain intensity was negatively correlated with changes in brain activity (r = −0.36 to −0.40, p <0.05). These findings suggest that pain influences brain activity differently during rest and movement, underscoring the impact of pain levels on neural networks related to the sensorimotor system in sLBP and highlighting the importance of understanding neural changes during this critical transitional phase.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3521286","Cheng Hsin General Hospital(grant numbers:CY11211); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10811937","Electroencephalography (EEG);low back pain;reaching task","Pain;Brain;Electroencephalography;Motors;Back;Oscillators;History;Hospitals;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Electrodes","","","","58","CCBYNCND","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

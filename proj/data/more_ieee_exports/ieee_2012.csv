Perhaps one of the main reasons for this is the lack of demanding benchmarks that mimic such scenarios. In this paper, we take advantage of our autonomous driving platform to develop novel challenging benchmarks for the tasks of stereo, optical flow, visual odometry/SLAM and 3D object detection. Our recording platform is equipped with four high resolution video cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and a state-of-the-art localization system. Our benchmarks comprise 389 stereo and optical flow image pairs, stereo visual odometry sequences of 39.2 km length, and more than 200k 3D object annotations captured in cluttered scenarios (up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image). Results from state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that methods ranking high on established datasets such as Middlebury perform below average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world. Our goal is to reduce this bias by providing challenging benchmarks with novel difficulties to the computer vision community.

In an effort to understand the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, we empirically compare five state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms for their ability to adhere to image boundaries, speed, memory efficiency, and their impact on segmentation performance. We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient, improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward to extend to supervoxel generation.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205760","Superpixels;segmentation;clustering;k-means","Clustering algorithms;Image segmentation;Complexity theory;Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Measurement uncertainty;Approximation algorithms","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","7069","110","30","IEEE","29 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The conventional LS-SVM and PSVM cannot be used in regression and multiclass classification applications directly, although variants of LS-SVM and PSVM have been proposed to handle such cases. This paper shows that both LS-SVM and PSVM can be simplified further and a unified learning framework of LS-SVM, PSVM, and other regularization algorithms referred to extreme learning machine (ELM) can be built. ELM works for the “generalized” single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), but the hidden layer (or called feature mapping) in ELM need not be tuned. Such SLFNs include but are not limited to SVM, polynomial network, and the conventional feedforward neural networks. This paper shows the following: 1) ELM provides a unified learning platform with a widespread type of feature mappings and can be applied in regression and multiclass classification applications directly; 2) from the optimization method point of view, ELM has milder optimization constraints compared to LS-SVM and PSVM; 3) in theory, compared to ELM, LS-SVM and PSVM achieve suboptimal solutions and require higher computational complexity; and 4) in theory, ELM can approximate any target continuous function and classify any disjoint regions. As verified by the simulation results, ELM tends to have better scalability and achieve similar (for regression and binary class cases) or much better (for multiclass cases) generalization performance at much faster learning speed (up to thousands times) than traditional SVM and LS-SVM.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2168604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035797","Extreme learning machine (ELM);feature mapping;kernel;least square support vector machine (LS-SVM);proximal support vector machine (PSVM);regularization network","Support vector machines;Optimization;Kernel;Training;Feedforward neural networks;Machine learning;Approximation methods","","4600","4","56","IEEE","6 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new model, dubbed blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) does not compute distortion-specific features, such as ringing, blur, or blocking, but instead uses scene statistics of locally normalized luminance coefficients to quantify possible losses of “naturalness” in the image due to the presence of distortions, thereby leading to a holistic measure of quality. The underlying features used derive from the empirical distribution of locally normalized luminances and products of locally normalized luminances under a spatial natural scene statistic model. No transformation to another coordinate frame (DCT, wavelet, etc.) is required, distinguishing it from prior NR IQA approaches. Despite its simplicity, we are able to show that BRISQUE is statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index, and is highly competitive with respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms. BRISQUE has very low computational complexity, making it well suited for real time applications. BRISQUE features may be used for distortion-identification as well. To illustrate a new practical application of BRISQUE, we describe how a nonblind image denoising algorithm can be augmented with BRISQUE in order to perform blind image denoising. Results show that BRISQUE augmentation leads to performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

The detector localizes all appearances that have been observed so far and corrects the tracker if necessary. The learning estimates the detector's errors and updates it to avoid these errors in the future. We study how to identify the detector's errors and learn from them. We develop a novel learning method (P-N learning) which estimates the errors by a pair of “experts”: (1) P-expert estimates missed detections, and (2) N-expert estimates false alarms. The learning process is modeled as a discrete dynamical system and the conditions under which the learning guarantees improvement are found.

To address these shortcomings, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework. We make three primary contributions: 1) We put together a large, well-annotated, and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art detectors across six data sets. Our study allows us to assess the state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts.

The main advantage of the method is the reduction of the steady- state oscillation (to practically zero) once the maximum power point (MPP) is located. Furthermore, the proposed method has the ability to track the MPP for the extreme environmental condition, e.g., large fluctuations of insolation and partial shading condition. The algorithm is simple and can be computed very rapidly; thus, its implementation using a low-cost microcontroller is possible. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, MATLAB simulations are carried out under very challenging conditions, namely step changes in irradiance, step changes in load, and partial shading of the PV array. Its performance is compared with the conventional Hill Climbing (HC) method. Finally, an experimental rig that comprises of a buck-boost converter fed by a custom-designed solar array simulator is set up to emulate the simulation. The soft- ware development is carried out in the Dspace 1104 environment using a TMS320F240 digital signal processor.

Imaging spectrometers are therefore often referred to as hyperspectral cameras (HSCs). Higher spectral resolution enables material identification via spectroscopic analysis, which facilitates countless applications that require identifying materials in scenarios unsuitable for classical spectroscopic analysis. Due to low spatial resolution of HSCs, microscopic material mixing, and multiple scattering, spectra measured by HSCs are mixtures of spectra of materials in a scene. Thus, accurate estimation requires unmixing. Pixels are assumed to be mixtures of a few materials, called endmembers. Unmixing involves estimating all or some of: the number of endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their abundances at each pixel. Unmixing is a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem because of model inaccuracies, observation noise, environmental conditions, endmember variability, and data set size. Researchers have devised and investigated many models searching for robust, stable, tractable, and accurate unmixing algorithms. This paper presents an overview of unmixing methods from the time of Keshava and Mustard's unmixing tutorial to the present. Mixing models are first discussed. Signal-subspace, geometrical, statistical, sparsity-based, and spatial-contextual unmixing algorithms are described. Mathematical problems and potential solutions are described.

This issue occurs when the number of examples that represent one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. In machine learning, the ensemble of classifiers are known to increase the accuracy of single classifiers by combining several of them, but neither of these learning techniques alone solve the class imbalance problem, to deal with this issue the ensemble learning algorithms have to be designed specifically. In this paper, our aim is to review the state of the art on ensemble techniques in the framework of imbalanced data-sets, with focus on two-class problems. We propose a taxonomy for ensemble-based methods to address the class imbalance where each proposal can be categorized depending on the inner ensemble methodology in which it is based. In addition, we develop a thorough empirical comparison by the consideration of the most significant published approaches, within the families of the taxonomy proposed, to show whether any of them makes a difference. This comparison has shown the good behavior of the simplest approaches which combine random undersampling techniques with bagging or boosting ensembles. In addition, the positive synergy between sampling techniques and bagging has stood out. Furthermore, our results show empirically that ensemble-based algorithms are worthwhile since they outperform the mere use of preprocessing techniques before learning the classifier, therefore justifying the increase of complexity by means of a significant enhancement of the results.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2161285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978225","Bagging;boosting;class distribution;classification;ensembles;imbalanced data-sets;multiple classifier systems","Learning systems;Accuracy;Training;Proposals;Noise;Algorithm design and analysis;Bagging","","1978","5","112","IEEE","8 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The desired property is often one that is not normally found naturally (negative refractive index, near-zero index, etc.). Over the past ten years, metamaterials have moved from being simply a theoretical concept to a field with developed and marketed applications. Three-dimensional metamaterials can be extended by arranging electrically small scatterers or holes into a two-dimensional pattern at a surface or interface. This surface version of a metamaterial has been given the name metasurface (the term metafilm has also been employed for certain structures). For many applications, metasurfaces can be used in place of metamaterials. Metasurfaces have the advantage of taking up less physical space than do full three-dimensional metamaterial structures; consequently, metasurfaces offer the possibility of less-lossy structures. In this overview paper, we discuss the theoretical basis by which metasurfaces should be characterized, and discuss their various applications. We will see how metasurfaces are distinguished from conventional frequency-selective surfaces. Metasurfaces have a wide range of potential applications in electromagnetics (ranging from low microwave to optical frequencies), including: (1) controllable “smart” surfaces, (2) miniaturized cavity resonators, (3) novel wave-guiding structures, (4) angular-independent surfaces, (5) absorbers, (6) biomedical devices, (7) terahertz switches, and (8) fluid-tunable frequency-agile materials, to name only a few. In this review, we will see that the development in recent years of such materials and/or surfaces is bringing us closer to realizing the exciting speculations made over one hundred years ago by the work of Lamb, Schuster, and Pocklington, and later by Mandel'shtam and Veselago.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2012.6230714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6230714","Agile materials;effective media;engineered materials;generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTC);metafilm;metamaterial;metasurface;polarizability densities;surface susceptibility;tunable materials","Metamaterials;Magnetic materials;Optical surface waves;Material properties;Periodic structures;Polarization;Agile manufacturing","","1801","4","130","IEEE","3 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we employ a time-average age metric for the performance evaluation of status update systems. We derive general methods for calculating the age metric that can be applied to a broad class of service systems. We apply these methods to queue-theoretic system abstractions consisting of a source, a service facility and monitors, with the model of the service facility (physical constraints) a given. The queue discipline of first-come-first-served (FCFS) is explored. We show the existence of an optimal rate at which a source must generate its information to keep its status as timely as possible at all its monitors. This rate differs from those that maximize utilization (throughput) or minimize status packet delivery delay.

The process starts with assembling a rich model of the noise component as a union of many diverse submodels formed by joint distributions of neighboring samples from quantized image noise residuals obtained using linear and nonlinear high-pass filters. In contrast to previous approaches, we make the model assembly a part of the training process driven by samples drawn from the corresponding cover- and stego-sources. Ensemble classifiers are used to assemble the model as well as the final steganalyzer due to their low computational complexity and ability to efficiently work with high-dimensional feature spaces and large training sets. We demonstrate the proposed framework on three steganographic algorithms designed to hide messages in images represented in the spatial domain: HUGO, edge-adaptive algorithm by Luo   , and optimally coded ternary $\pm {\hbox{1}}$ embedding. For each algorithm, we apply a simple submodel-selection technique to increase the detection accuracy per model dimensionality and show how the detection saturates with increasing complexity of the rich model. By observing the differences between how different submodels engage in detection, an interesting interplay between the embedding and detection is revealed. Steganalysis built around rich image models combined with ensemble classifiers is a promising direction towards automatizing steganalysis for a wide spectrum of steganographic schemes.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2190402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6197267","Ensemble classification;high-dimensional features;noise residuals;rich models;steganalysis","Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Noise;Quantization;Indexes;Vectors;Digital images","","1405","16","38","IEEE","8 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, classical sampled-data control is based on performing sensing and actuation periodically rather than when the system needs attention. This paper provides an introduction to event- and self-triggered control systems where sensing and actuation is performed when needed. Event-triggered control is reactive and generates sensor sampling and control actuation when, for instance, the plant state deviates more than a certain threshold from a desired value. Self-triggered control, on the other hand, is proactive and computes the next sampling or actuation instance ahead of time. The basics of these control strategies are introduced together with a discussion on the differences between state feedback and output feedback for event-triggered control. It is also shown how event- and self-triggered control can be implemented using existing wireless communication technology.

The estimated parameters of the model are utilized to form features that are indicative of perceptual quality. These features are used in a simple Bayesian inference approach to predict quality scores. The resulting algorithm, which we name BLIINDS-II, requires minimal training and adopts a simple probabilistic model for score prediction. Given the extracted features from a test image, the quality score that maximizes the probability of the empirically determined inference model is chosen as the predicted quality score of that image.

Yet, existing approaches exhibit considerable variation in methodology, and it is often difficult to attribute improvements in result quality to specific algorithm properties. In this paper we reconsider some of the design choices of previous methods and propose a conceptually clear and intuitive algorithm for contrast-based saliency estimation. Our algorithm consists of four basic steps. First, our method decomposes a given image into compact, perceptually homogeneous elements that abstract unnecessary detail. Based on this abstraction we compute two measures of contrast that rate the uniqueness and the spatial distribution of these elements. From the element contrast we then derive a saliency measure that produces a pixel-accurate saliency map which uniformly covers the objects of interest and consistently separates fore- and background.

In light of their rapid growth, there is a pressing need to develop effective solutions. However, our defense capability is largely constrained by the limited understanding of these emerging mobile malware and the lack of timely access to related samples. In this paper, we focus on the Android platform and aim to systematize or characterize existing Android malware. Particularly, with more than one year effort, we have managed to collect more than 1,200 malware samples that cover the majority of existing Android malware families, ranging from their debut in August 2010 to recent ones in October 2011. In addition, we systematically characterize them from various aspects, including their installation methods, activation mechanisms as well as the nature of carried malicious payloads. The characterization and a subsequent evolution-based study of representative families reveal that they are evolving rapidly to circumvent the detection from existing mobile anti-virus software. Based on the evaluation with four representative mobile security software, our experiments show that the best case detects 79.6% of them while the worst case detects only 20.2% in our dataset. These results clearly call for the need to better develop next-generation anti-mobile-malware solutions.","2375-1207","978-0-7695-4681-0","10.1109/SP.2012.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6234407","Android malware;smartphone security","Malware;Smart phones;Payloads;Mobile communication;Security;Operating systems","","1310","34","58","IEEE","9 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we develop a tractable, flexible, and accurate model for a downlink heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) consisting of K tiers of randomly located BSs, where each tier may differ in terms of average transmit power, supported data rate and BS density. Assuming a mobile user connects to the strongest candidate BS, the resulting Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) is greater than 1 when in coverage, Rayleigh fading, we derive an expression for the probability of coverage (equivalently outage) over the entire network under both open and closed access, which assumes a strikingly simple closed-form in the high SINR regime and is accurate down to -4 dB even under weaker assumptions. For external validation, we compare against an actual LTE network (for tier 1) with the other K-1 tiers being modeled as independent Poisson Point Processes. In this case as well, our model is accurate to within 1-2 dB. We also derive the average rate achieved by a randomly located mobile and the average load on each tier of BSs. One interesting observation for interference-limited open access networks is that at a given \sinr, adding more tiers and/or BSs neither increases nor decreases the probability of coverage or outage when all the tiers have the same target-SINR.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2012.120405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6171996","Femtocells;heterogeneous cellular networks;stochastic geometry;point process theory;coverage probability","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Mobile communication;Analytical models;Fading;Femtocells;Load modeling","","1304","3","41","IEEE","22 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To close the gap in the literature about smart cities and in response to the increasing use of the concept, this paper proposes a framework to understand the concept of smart cities. Based on the exploration of a wide and extensive array of literature from various disciplinary areas we identify eight critical factors of smart city initiatives: management and organization, technology, governance, policy context, people and communities, economy, built infrastructure, and natural environment. These factors form the basis of an integrative framework that can be used to examine how local governments are envisioning smart city initiatives. The framework suggests directions and agendas for smart city research and outlines practical implications for government professionals.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4525-7","10.1109/HICSS.2012.615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6149291","","Cities and towns;Context;Communities;Educational institutions;Electronic government","","1292","12","60","IEEE","9 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our characterization of the average cancellation as a function of the self-interference power allows us to show that for a constant signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver antenna (before any active cancellation is applied), the rate of a full-duplex link increases as the self-interference power increases. Second, we show that applying digital cancellation after analog cancellation can sometimes increase the self-interference, and thus digital cancellation is more effective when applied selectively based on measured suppression values.

We show here that for systems with “typical”/“random” Φ, a good approximation to the sparsest solution is obtained by applying a fixed number of standard operations from linear algebra. Our proposal, Stagewise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP), successively transforms the signal into a negligible residual. Starting with initial residual r0 = y, at the s -th stage it forms the “matched filter” ΦTrs-1, identifies all coordinates with amplitudes exceeding a specially chosen threshold, solves a least-squares problem using the selected coordinates, and subtracts the least-squares fit, producing a new residual. After a fixed number of stages (e.g., 10), it stops. In contrast to Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), many coefficients can enter the model at each stage in StOMP while only one enters per stage in OMP; and StOMP takes a fixed number of stages (e.g., 10), while OMP can take many (e.g., n). We give both theoretical and empirical support for the large-system effectiveness of StOMP. We give numerical examples showing that StOMP rapidly and reliably finds sparse solutions in compressed sensing, decoding of error-correcting codes, and overcomplete representation.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2173241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6145475","Compressed sensing;decoding error-correcting codes;false alarm rate;false discovery rate;iterative thresholding;$\ell _{1}$  minimization;mutual access interference;phase transition;sparse overcomplete representation;stepwise regression","Matching pursuit algorithms;Vectors;Approximation methods;Minimization;Sparse matrices;Gaussian noise;Equations","","1134","9","61","IEEE","6 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These days, the deployment of vision algorithms on smart phones and embedded devices with low memory and computation complexity has even upped the ante: the goal is to make descriptors faster to compute, more compact while remaining robust to scale, rotation and noise. To best address the current requirements, we propose a novel keypoint descriptor inspired by the human visual system and more precisely the retina, coined Fast Retina Keypoint (FREAK). A cascade of binary strings is computed by efficiently comparing image intensities over a retinal sampling pattern. Our experiments show that FREAKs are in general faster to compute with lower memory load and also more robust than SIFT, SURF or BRISK.

Often rather tedious optimization procedures are applied that become computationally intractable on a large scale. Further, if one considers the constantly growing amount of data it is often infeasible to specify fully supervised labels for all data points. Instead, it is easier to specify labels in form of equivalence constraints. We introduce a simple though effective strategy to learn a distance metric from equivalence constraints, based on a statistical inference perspective. In contrast to existing methods we do not rely on complex optimization problems requiring computationally expensive iterations. Hence, our method is orders of magnitudes faster than comparable methods. Results on a variety of challenging benchmarks with rather diverse nature demonstrate the power of our method. These include faces in unconstrained environments, matching before unseen object instances and person re-identification across spatially disjoint cameras.

This results in increased sustainability of the smart grid, as well as reduced overall operational cost and carbon emission levels. Most of the existing demand side management strategies used in traditional energy management systems employ system specific techniques and algorithms. In addition, the existing strategies handle only a limited number of controllable loads of limited types. This paper presents a demand side management strategy based on load shifting technique for demand side management of future smart grids with a large number of devices of several types. The day-ahead load shifting technique proposed in this paper is mathematically formulated as a minimization problem. A heuristic-based Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) that easily adapts heuristics in the problem was developed for solving this minimization problem. Simulations were carried out on a smart grid which contains a variety of loads in three service areas, one with residential customers, another with commercial customers, and the third one with industrial customers. The simulation results show that the proposed demand side management strategy achieves substantial savings, while reducing the peak load demand of the smart grid.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2195686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6213581","Demand side management;distributed energy resource;evolutionary algorithm;generation scheduling;load shifting;smart grid","Smart grids;Evolutionary computation;Heuristic algorithms;Shape;Electricity;Delay;Algorithm design and analysis","","970","","23","IEEE","7 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The temporal evolutions of those visual words are modeled by discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs).

Or will femtocells prove more trouble than they are worth, undermining decades of careful base station deployment with unpredictable interference while delivering only limited gains?

In this paper, we propose a semidefinite programming (SDP) optimization, which is the dual of an equivalent form of the OPF problem. A global optimum solution to the OPF problem can be retrieved from a solution of this convex dual problem whenever the duality gap is zero. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided in this paper to guarantee the existence of no duality gap for the OPF problem. This condition is satisfied by the standard IEEE benchmark systems with 14, 30, 57, 118, and 300 buses as well as several randomly generated systems. Since this condition is hard to study, a sufficient zero-duality-gap condition is also derived. This sufficient condition holds for IEEE systems after small resistance (10-5 per unit) is added to every transformer that originally assumes zero resistance. We investigate this sufficient condition and justify that it holds widely in practice. The main underlying reason for the successful convexification of the OPF problem can be traced back to the modeling of transformers and transmission lines as well as the non-negativity of physical quantities such as resistance and inductance.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2160974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971792","Convex optimization;linear matrix inequality;optimal power flow;polynomial-time algorithm;power system","Optimization;Linear matrix inequalities;Power systems;Polynomials;Symmetric matrices;Programming;Integrated circuit modeling","","931","7","35","IEEE","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The concept behind cognitive radio is to exploit these underutilized spectral resources by reusing unused spectrum in an opportunistic manner [3], [4].

We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. These include an innovative cue to measure the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure, and the combined objectness measure to perform better than any cue alone. We also compare to interest point operators, a HOG detector, and three recent works aiming at automatic object segmentation. Finally, we present two applications of objectness. In the first, we sample a small numberof windows according to their objectness probability and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. As we show experimentally, this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by the expensive class-specific model. In the second application, we use objectness as a complementary score in addition to the class-specific model, which leads to fewer false positives. As shown in several recent papers, objectness can act as a valuable focus of attention mechanism in many other applications operating on image windows, including weakly supervised learning of object categories, unsupervised pixelwise segmentation, and object tracking in video. Computing objectness is very efficient and takes only about 4 sec. per image.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133291","Objectness measure;object detection;object recognition","Detectors;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Kernel;Image color analysis;Training;Area measurement","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","923","3","53","IEEE","17 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The HCN is modeled as a multi-tier cellular network where each tier's base stations (BSs) are randomly located and have a particular transmit power, path loss exponent, spatial density, and bias towards admitting mobile users. For example, as compared to macrocells, picocells would usually have lower transmit power, higher path loss exponent (lower antennas), higher spatial density (many picocells per macrocell), and a positive bias so that macrocell users are actively encouraged to use the more lightly loaded picocells. In the present paper we implicitly assume all base stations have full queues; future work should relax this. For this model, we derive the outage probability of a typical user in the whole network or a certain tier, which is equivalently the downlink SINR cumulative distribution function. The results are accurate for all SINRs, and their expressions admit quite simple closed-forms in some plausible special cases. We also derive the average ergodic rate of the typical user, and the minimum average user throughput - the smallest value among the average user throughputs supported by one cell in each tier. We observe that neither the number of BSs or tiers changes the outage probability or average ergodic rate in an interference-limited full-loaded HCN with unbiased cell association (no biasing), and observe how biasing alters the various metrics.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.081612.111361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6287527","Heterogeneous cellular network;cell association;SINR;stochastic geometry","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Downlink;Fading;Macrocell networks;Base stations;Throughput","","916","2","32","IEEE","27 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ThinkAir exploits the concept of smartphone virtualization in the cloud and provides method-level computation offloading. Advancing on previous work, it focuses on the elasticity and scalability of the cloud and enhances the power of mobile cloud computing by parallelizing method execution using multiple virtual machine (VM) images. We implement ThinkAir and evaluate it with a range of benchmarks starting from simple micro-benchmarks to more complex applications. First, we show that the execution time and energy consumption decrease two orders of magnitude for a N-queens puzzle application and one order of magnitude for a face detection and a virus scan application. We then show that a parallelizable application can invoke multiple VMs to execute in the cloud in a seamless and on-demand manner such as to achieve greater reduction on execution time and energy consumption. We finally use a memory-hungry image combiner tool to demonstrate that applications can dynamically request VMs with more computational power in order to meet their computational requirements.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0775-8","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195845","","Smart phones;Servers;Mobile communication;Energy consumption;Hardware;Cloning;Software","","848","18","19","IEEE","10 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recently developed commodity depth sensors open up new possibilities of dealing with this problem but also present some unique challenges. The depth maps captured by the depth cameras are very noisy and the 3D positions of the tracked joints may be completely wrong if serious occlusions occur, which increases the intra-class variations in the actions. In this paper, an actionlet ensemble model is learnt to represent each action and to capture the intra-class variance. In addition, novel features that are suitable for depth data are proposed. They are robust to noise, invariant to translational and temporal misalignments, and capable of characterizing both the human motion and the human-object interactions. The proposed approach is evaluated on two challenging action recognition datasets captured by commodity depth cameras, and another dataset captured by a MoCap system. The experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance to the state of the art algorithms.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247813","","Joints;Humans;Hidden Markov models;Cameras;Robustness;Noise;Feature extraction","","846","7","24","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ensemble classifiers scale much more favorably w.r.t. the number of training examples and the feature dimensionality with performance comparable to the much more complex SVMs. The significantly lower training complexity opens up the possibility for the steganalyst to work with rich (high-dimensional) cover models and train on larger training sets—two key elements that appear necessary to reliably detect modern steganographic algorithms. Ensemble classification is portrayed here as a powerful developer tool that allows fast construction of steganography detectors with markedly improved detection accuracy across a wide range of embedding methods. The power of the proposed framework is demonstrated on three steganographic methods that hide messages in JPEG images.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2011.2175919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081929","Ensemble classification;Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD);high-dimensional features;random subspaces;scalable machine learning;steganalysis","Training;Testing;Feature extraction;Complexity theory;Machine learning;Accuracy;Vectors","","825","20","51","IEEE","15 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The battery will only provide power directly when the ultracapacitor voltage drops below the battery voltage. Therefore, a relatively constant load profile is created for the battery. In addition, the battery is not used to directly harvest energy from the regenerative braking; thus, the battery is isolated from frequent charges, which will increase the life of the battery.

At open circuit, efficient external luminescence is an indicator of low internal optical losses. Thus, efficient external luminescence is, counterintuitively, a necessity for approaching the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) efficiency limit. A great solar cell also needs to be a great light-emitting diode. Owing to the narrow escape cone for light, efficient external emission requires repeated attempts and demands an internal luminescence efficiency 90%.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2012.2198434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6213058","External luminescence;GaAs;Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit;solar cells","Photovoltaic cells;Photonics;Luminescence;Gallium arsenide;Mirrors;Absorption","","821","12","28","USGov","6 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

GaN HEMT devices, exhibiting high power densities coupled with high breakdown voltages, have opened up the possibilities for highly efficient power amplifiers (PAs) exploiting the principles of waveform engineered designs. This paper summarizes the unique advantages of GaN HEMTs compared to other power transistor technologies, with examples of where such features have been exploited. Since RF power densities of GaN HEMTs are many times higher than other technologies, much attention has also been given to thermal management-examples of both commercial “off-the-shelf” packaging as well as custom heat-sinks are described. The very desirable feature of having accurate large-signal models for both discrete transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuit foundry are emphasized with a number of circuit design examples. GaN HEMT technology has been a major enabler for both very broadband high-PAs and very high-efficiency designs.

It is a joint program between ESA Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial. SMOS carries a single payload, an L-Band 2-D interferometric radiometer in the 1400-1427 MHz protected band. This wavelength penetrates well through the atmosphere, and hence the instrument probes the earth surface emissivity. Surface emissivity can then be related to the moisture content in the first few centimeters of soil, and, after some surface roughness and temperature corrections, to the sea surface salinity over ocean. The goal of the level 2 algorithm is thus to deliver global soil moisture (SM) maps with a desired accuracy of 0.04 m3/m3. To reach this goal, a retrieval algorithm was developed and implemented in the ground segment which processes level 1 to level 2 data. Level 1 consists mainly of angular brightness temperatures (TB), while level 2 consists of geophysical products in swath mode, i.e., as acquired by the sensor during a half orbit from pole to pole. In this context, a group of institutes prepared the SMOS algorithm theoretical basis documents to be used to produce the operational algorithm. The principle of the SM retrieval algorithm is based on an iterative approach which aims at minimizing a cost function. The main component of the cost function is given by the sum of the squared weighted differences between measured and modeled TB data, for a variety of incidence angles. The algorithm finds the best set of the parameters, e.g., SM and vegetation characteristics, which drive the direct TB model and minimizes the cost function. The end user Level 2 SM product contains SM, vegetation opacity, and estimated dielectric constant of any surface, TB computed at 42.5°, flags and quality indices, and other parameters of interest. This paper gives an overview of the algorithm, discusses the caveats, and provides a glimpse of the Cal Val exercises.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2184548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6161633","Cal/Val;model;SMOS;soil moisture;retrievals;vegetation opacity","Surface topography;Vegetation mapping;Sea surface;Ocean temperature;Land surface;L-band;Surface roughness","","810","","90","IEEE","29 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our analysis allows us to clearly separate the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself and the effects of communication dependent on the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network, and confirm this prediction's sharpness both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks.

In this paper, we propose a robust optimization approach to accommodate wind output uncertainty, with the objective of providing a robust unit commitment schedule for the thermal generators in the day-ahead market that minimizes the total cost under the worst wind power output scenario. Robust optimization models the randomness using an uncertainty set which includes the worst-case scenario, and protects this scenario under the minimal increment of costs. In our approach, the power system will be more reliable because the worst-case scenario has been considered. In addition, we introduce a variable to control the conservatism of our model, by which we can avoid over-protection.

Light scattering is caused by light incident on objects reflected and deflected multiple times by particles present in the water before reaching the camera. This in turn lowers the visibility and contrast of the image captured. Color change corresponds to the varying degrees of attenuation encountered by light traveling in the water with different wavelengths, rendering ambient underwater environments dominated by a bluish tone. No existing underwater processing techniques can handle light scattering and color change distortions suffered by underwater images, and the possible presence of artificial lighting simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel systematic approach to enhance underwater images by a dehazing algorithm, to compensate the attenuation discrepancy along the propagation path, and to take the influence of the possible presence of an artifical light source into consideration. Once the depth map, i.e., distances between the objects and the camera, is estimated, the foreground and background within a scene are segmented. The light intensities of foreground and background are compared to determine whether an artificial light source is employed during the image capturing process. After compensating the effect of artifical light, the haze phenomenon and discrepancy in wavelength attenuation along the underwater propagation path to camera are corrected. Next, the water depth in the image scene is estimated according to the residual energy ratios of different color channels existing in the background light. Based on the amount of attenuation corresponding to each light wavelength, color change compensation is conducted to restore color balance. The performance of the proposed algorithm for wavelength compensation and image dehazing (WCID) is evaluated both objectively and subjectively by utilizing ground-truth color patches and video downloaded from the Youtube website.

As in many control applications full state measurements are not available for feedback, it is the objective of this paper to propose event-triggered dynamical output-based controllers. The fact that the controller is based on output feedback instead of state feedback does not allow for straightforward extensions of existing event-triggering mechanisms if a minimum time between two subsequent events has to be guaranteed. Furthermore, since sensor and actuator nodes can be physically distributed, centralized event-triggering mechanisms are often prohibitive and, therefore, we will propose a decentralized event-triggering mechanism. This event-triggering mechanism invokes transmission of the outputs in a node when the difference between the current values of the outputs in the node and their previously transmitted values becomes “large” compared to the current values and an additional threshold. For such event-triggering mechanisms, we will study closed-loop stability and L∞-performance and provide bounds on the minimum time between two subsequent events generated by each node, the so-called inter-event time of a node. This enables us to make tradeoffs between closed-loop performance on the one hand and communication load on the other hand, or even between the communication load of individual nodes. In addition, we will model the event-triggered control system using an impulsive model, which truly describes the behavior of the event-triggered control system. As a result, we will be able to guarantee stability and performance for event-triggered controllers with larger minimum inter-event times than the existing results in the literature. We illustrate the developed theory using three numerical examples.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2174696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6069816","Decentralized control;dynamic output-based control;event-triggered control systems;hybrid systems;impulsive systems","Stability analysis;Asymptotic stability;Actuators;Wireless communication;Numerical stability;Symmetric matrices","","751","","30","IEEE","4 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aircraft applications demand high reliability, high availability, and high power density while aiming to reduce weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. New electric driven systems can meet these requirements and also provide significant technical and economic improvements over conventional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems. Fault-tolerant motor drives can be achieved by partitioning and redundancy through the use of multichannel three-phase systems or multiple single-phase modules. Analytical methods are adopted to compare caged induction, reluctance, and PM motor technologies and their relative merits. The analysis suggests that the dual (or triple) three-phase PMAC motor drive may be a favored choice for general aerospace applications, striking a balance between necessary redundancy and undue complexity, while maintaining a balanced operation following a failure. The modular single-phase approach offers a good compromise between size and complexity but suffers from high total harmonic distortion of the supply and high torque ripple when faulted. For each specific aircraft application, a parametrical optimization of the suitable motor configuration is needed through a coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis, and should be verified by finite-element analysis.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2011.2165453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5991952","Actuators;aerospace industry;brushless PM motors;fault tolerance;more electric aircraft;multiphase machines;reliability;safety-critical drives;variable speed drives","Induction motors;Reluctance motors;Aircraft;Permanent magnet motors;Brushless motors;Torque","","746","2","65","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Adaptive control [1], [2] and optimal control [3] represent different philosophies for designing feedback controllers. Optimal controllers are normally designed of ine by solving Hamilton JacobiBellman (HJB) equations, for example, the Riccati equation, using complete knowledge of the system dynamics. Determining optimal control policies for nonlinear systems requires the offline solution of nonlinear HJB equations, which are often difficult or impossible to solve. By contrast, adaptive controllers learn online to control unknown systems using data measured in real time along the system trajectories. Adaptive controllers are not usually designed to be optimal in the sense of minimizing user-prescribed performance functions. Indirect adaptive controllers use system identification techniques to first identify the system parameters and then use the obtained model to solve optimal design equations [1]. Adaptive controllers may satisfy certain inverse optimality conditions [4].","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2012.2214134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6315769","","Learning systems;Decision making;Reinforcement learning;Feedback control;Optimal control;Adaptive control;Design methodology","","736","","60","IEEE","15 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We make a number of contributions: first, we introduce a model to classify a pet breed automatically from an image. The model combines shape, captured by a deformable part model detecting the pet face, and appearance, captured by a bag-of-words model that describes the pet fur. Fitting the model involves automatically segmenting the animal in the image. Second, we compare two classification approaches: a hierarchical one, in which a pet is first assigned to the cat or dog family and then to a breed, and a flat one, in which the breed is obtained directly. We also investigate a number of animal and image orientated spatial layouts. These models are very good: they beat all previously published results on the challenging ASIRRA test (cat vs dog discrimination). When applied to the task of discriminating the 37 different breeds of pets, the models obtain an average accuracy of about 59%, a very encouraging result considering the difficulty of the problem.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6248092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6248092","","Positron emission tomography;Image segmentation;Cats;Dogs;Layout;Deformable models;Head","","706","2","44","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel kernel-based supervised hashing model which requires a limited amount of supervised information, i.e., similar and dissimilar data pairs, and a feasible training cost in achieving high quality hashing. The idea is to map the data to compact binary codes whose Hamming distances are minimized on similar pairs and simultaneously maximized on dissimilar pairs. Our approach is distinct from prior works by utilizing the equivalence between optimizing the code inner products and the Hamming distances. This enables us to sequentially and efficiently train the hash functions one bit at a time, yielding very short yet discriminative codes.

In this paper, through developing a threshoding representation theory for L1/2 regularization, we propose an iterative half thresholding algorithm for fast solution of L1/2 regularization, corresponding to the well-known iterative soft thresholding algorithm for L1 regularization, and the iterative hard thresholding algorithm for L0 regularization. We prove the existence of the resolvent of gradient of ||x||1/21/2, calculate its analytic expression, and establish an alternative feature theorem on solutions of L1/2 regularization, based on which a thresholding representation of solutions of L1/2 regularization is derived and an optimal regularization parameter setting rule is formulated. The developed theory provides a successful practice of extension of the well- known Moreau's proximity forward-backward splitting theory to the L1/2 regularization case. We verify the convergence of the iterative half thresholding algorithm and provide a series of experiments to assess performance of the algorithm. The experiments show that the half algorithm is effective, efficient, and can be accepted as a fast solver for L1/2 regularization.

The development of VSC-based dc networks is constrained by the lack of operational experience, the immaturity of appropriate protective devices, and the lack of appropriate fault analysis techniques. VSCs are vulnerable to dc-cable short-circuit and ground faults due to the high discharge current from the dc-link capacitance. However, faults occurring along the interconnecting dc cables are most likely to threaten system operation. In this paper, cable faults in VSC-based dc networks are analyzed in detail with the identification and definition of the most serious stages of the fault that need to be avoided. A fault location method is proposed because this is a prerequisite for an effective design of a fault protection scheme. It is demonstrated that it is relatively easy to evaluate the distance to a short-circuit fault using voltage reference comparison. For the more difficult challenge of locating ground faults, a method of estimating both the ground resistance and the distance to the fault is proposed by analyzing the initial stage of the fault transient. Analysis of the proposed method is provided and is based on simulation results, with a range of fault resistances, distances, and operational conditions considered.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2011.2162712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959977","Fault analysis;fault location;multiterminal dc network;voltage-source converter (VSC)","Circuit faults;Power conversion;Capacitors;Fault location;Power cables;Discharges","","673","","32","IEEE","21 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is well documented that, as the order of a nonlinear system increases, analytic calculation of these derivatives becomes prohibitive. Therefore, in practice, either alternative control approaches are used or the derivatives are neglected in the implementation. Neglecting the derivatives results in the loss of all guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods for the adaptive backstepping approach and may result in instability. This paper presents a new implementation approach for adaptive backstepping control. The main objectives are to facilitate the derivation and implementation of the adaptive backstepping approach, with performance guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods, for applications that were prohibitively difficult using the standard analytic implementation approach. The new approach uses filtering methods to produce certain command signals and their derivatives which eliminates the requirement of analytic differentiation. The approach also introduces filters to generate certain compensating signals necessary to compute compensated tracking errors suitable for adaptive parameter estimation. We present a set of Lemmas and Theorems to analyze the performance both during the initialization and the operating phases. We show that the initialization phase is of finite duration that can be controlled by selection of a design parameter. We also show that all signals within the system are bounded during this short initialization phase. During the operating phase, we show that the command filtered implementation approach has theoretical properties identical to those of the conventional approach. The general approach is presented and analyzed for systems in generalized parameter strict feedback form. Extensions of the approach are presented to demonstrate the application of the method to a land vehicle trajectory following application. Application and effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by simulation results.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2011.2121907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5739561","Adaptive backstepping;adaptive control;backstepping;nonlinear control;trajectory following","Backstepping;Trajectory;Lyapunov methods;Stability analysis;Approximation methods;Adaptation model;Adaptive filters","","663","","31","IEEE","28 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present ViNEYard-a collection of VN embedding algorithms that leverage better coordination between the two phases. We formulate the VN embedding problem as a mixed integer program through substrate network augmentation. We then relax the integer constraints to obtain a linear program and devise two online VN embedding algorithms D-ViNE and R-ViNE using deterministic and randomized rounding techniques, respectively.

Then, an optimal control law is obtained by minimizing a quadratic performance index. However, it is noted that the standard PFC method does not achieve a satisfying effect in the presence of strong disturbances. To this end, an improved PFC method, called the PFC+ESO method, is developed. It introduces extended state observer (ESO) to estimate the lumped disturbances and adds a feedforward compensation item based on the estimated disturbances to the PFC speed controller.

In this paper, we present a new approach to visual navigation under changing conditions dubbed SeqSLAM. Instead of calculating the single location most likely given a current image, our approach calculates the best candidate matching location within every local navigation sequence. Localization is then achieved by recognizing coherent sequences of these “local best matches”. This approach removes the need for global matching performance by the vision front-end - instead it must only pick the best match within any short sequence of images. The approach is applicable over environment changes that render traditional feature-based techniques ineffective. Using two car-mounted camera datasets we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and compare it to one of the most successful feature-based SLAM algorithms, FAB-MAP. The perceptual change in the datasets is extreme; repeated traverses through environments during the day and then in the middle of the night, at times separated by months or years and in opposite seasons, and in clear weather and extremely heavy rain.

In addition, smart pricing can be used to seek social benefits and to implement social objectives. To achieve social objectives, the utility company may need to collect various information about users and their energy consumption behavior, which can be challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing method to tackle this problem. We assume that each user is equipped with an energy consumption controller (ECC) as part of its smart meter. All smart meters are connected to not only the power grid but also a communication infrastructure. This allows two-way communication among smart meters and the utility company. We analytically model each user's preferences and energy consumption patterns in form of a utility function. Based on this model, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism which aims to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the aggregate utility functions of all users minus the total energy cost. Our design requires that each user provides some information about its energy demand. In return, the energy provider will determine each user's electricity bill payment. Finally, we verify some important properties of our proposed VCG mechanism for demand side management such as efficiency, user truthfulness, and nonnegative transfer. Simulation results confirm that the proposed pricing method can benefit both users and utility companies.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2203341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6266724","Demand side management;energy consumption control;smart grid;VCG mechanism design","Pricing;Power demand;Energy consumption;Electricity;Vectors;Smart grids;Nash equilibrium","","654","3","39","IEEE","13 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is important to perform intelligent scheduling for charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs). However, there are two major challenges in the scheduling problem. First, it is challenging to find the globally optimal scheduling solution which can minimize the total cost. Second, it is difficult to find a distributed scheduling scheme which can handle a large population and the random arrivals of the EVs. In this paper, we propose a globally optimal scheduling scheme and a locally optimal scheduling scheme for EV charging and discharging. We first formulate a global scheduling optimization problem, in which the charging powers are optimized to minimize the total cost of all EVs which perform charging and discharging during the day. The globally optimal solution provides the globally minimal total cost. However, the globally optimal scheduling scheme is impractical since it requires the information on the future base loads and the arrival times and the charging periods of the EVs that will arrive in the future time of the day. To develop a practical scheduling scheme, we then formulate a local scheduling optimization problem, which aims to minimize the total cost of the EVs in the current ongoing EV set in the local group. The locally optimal scheduling scheme is not only scalable to a large EV population but also resilient to the dynamic EV arrivals. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the locally optimal scheduling scheme can achieve a close performance compared to the globally optimal scheduling scheme.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2173507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6244822","Charging and discharging;convex optimization;distributed solution;electric vehicle;optimal scheduling;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Optimal scheduling;Batteries;Electricity;Dynamic scheduling;Electric vehicles","","642","1","25","IEEE","19 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the S-DC module, we introduce an effective method to compute the confidence value that assigns more weights to the foreground than the background. In the SGM module, we propose a novel histogram-based method that takes the spatial information of each patch into consideration with an occlusion handing scheme. Furthermore, the update scheme considers both the latest observations and the original template, thereby enabling the tracker to deal with appearance change effectively and alleviate the drift problem. Numerous experiments on various challenging videos demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs favorably against several state-of-the-art algorithms.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247882","","Target tracking;Histograms;Vectors;Robustness;Image reconstruction;Adaptation models;Collaboration","","637","3","31","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the displacement of conventional generation with wind and solar plants, which usually do not provide inertial response, further weakens these power systems. Fast-acting storage, by injecting power within instants after the loss of a generating unit, can back up conventional generation assets during the activation of their primary reserve. This paper relies on dynamic simulations to study the provision of such a dynamic frequency control support by energy storage systems in the French island of Guadeloupe with large shares of wind or solar generation. The results show that fast-acting storage, by acting as a synthetic inertia, can mitigate the impact of these sources on the dynamic performance of the studied island grid in the case of a major generation outage. The other concerns raised by renewables (e.g., variability, forecast accuracy, low voltage ride-through, etc.) have not been addressed within this project.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2012.2205025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6268312","Frequency control;isolated power systems;power system dynamic stability;power system security;solar power generation;supercapacitors;wind power generation","Frequency control;Power system dynamics;Power system stability;Solar power generation;Energy storage;Wind power generation;Supercapacitors","","629","","27","IEEE","14 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The popular hashing methods, e.g., Locality Sensitive Hashing and Spectral Hashing, construct hash functions based on random or principal projections. The resulting hashes are either not very accurate or are inefficient. Moreover, these methods are designed for a given metric similarity. On the contrary, semantic similarity is usually given in terms of pairwise labels of samples. There exist supervised hashing methods that can handle such semantic similarity, but they are prone to overfitting when labeled data are small or noisy. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised hashing (SSH) framework that minimizes empirical error over the labeled set and an information theoretic regularizer over both labeled and unlabeled sets. Based on this framework, we present three different semi-supervised hashing methods, including orthogonal hashing, nonorthogonal hashing, and sequential hashing. Particularly, the sequential hashing method generates robust codes in which each hash function is designed to correct the errors made by the previous ones. We further show that the sequential learning paradigm can be extended to unsupervised domains where no labeled pairs are available. Extensive experiments on four large datasets (up to 80 million samples) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed SSH methods over state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hashing techniques.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148236","Hashing;nearest neighbor search;binary codes;semi-supervised hashing;pairwise labels;sequential hashing","Artificial neural networks;Semantics;Encoding;Extraterrestrial measurements;Binary codes;Semisupervised learning;Sequential analysis","","628","4","40","IEEE","7 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, the problem of rain removal from a single image was rarely studied in the literature, where no temporal information among successive images can be exploited, making the problem very challenging. In this paper, we propose a single-image-based rain removal framework via properly formulating rain removal as an image decomposition problem based on morphological component analysis. Instead of directly applying a conventional image decomposition technique, the proposed method first decomposes an image into the low- and high-frequency (HF) parts using a bilateral filter. The HF part is then decomposed into a “rain component” and a “nonrain component” by performing dictionary learning and sparse coding. As a result, the rain component can be successfully removed from the image while preserving most original image details. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2179057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6099619","Dictionary learning;image decomposition;morphological component analysis (MCA);rain removal;sparse representation","Rain;Dictionaries;Image decomposition;Image coding;Training;Noise;Discrete cosine transforms","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Rain;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","628","4","45","IEEE","9 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, learning the dictionary amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image classification, but tuning the dictionary in a supervised way for these tasks has proven to be more difficult.

Specifically, grid-tied solar power generation is a distributed resource whose output can change extremely rapidly, resulting in many issues for the distribution system operator with a large quantity of installed photovoltaic devices. Battery energy storage systems are increasingly being used to help integrate solar power into the grid. These systems are capable of absorbing and delivering both real and reactive power with sub-second response times. With these capabilities, battery energy storage systems can mitigate such issues with solar power generation as ramp rate, frequency, and voltage issues. Beyond these applications focusing on system stability, energy storage control systems can also be integrated with energy markets to make the solar resource more economical. Providing a high-level introduction to this application area, this paper presents an overview of the challenges of integrating solar power to the electricity distribution system, a technical overview of battery energy storage systems, and illustrates a variety of modes of operation for battery energy storage systems in grid-tied solar applications.

Equally important to their counterpart in the design of energy harvesting radios are the design principles that this new networking paradigm calls for. In particular, unlike wireless networks considered to date, the energy replenishment process and the storage constraints of the rechargeable batteries need to be taken into account in designing efficient transmission strategies. In this work, such transmission policies for rechargeable nodes are considered, and optimum solutions for two related problems are identified. Specifically, the transmission policy that maximizes the short term throughput, i.e., the amount of data transmitted in a finite time horizon is found. In addition, the relation of this optimization problem to another, namely, the minimization of the transmission completion time for a given amount of data is demonstrated, which leads to the solution of the latter as well. The optimum transmission policies are identified under the constraints on energy causality, i.e., energy replenishment process, as well as the energy storage, i.e., battery capacity. For battery replenishment, a model with discrete packets of energy arrivals is considered. The necessary conditions that the throughput-optimal allocation satisfies are derived, and then the algorithm that finds the optimal transmission policy with respect to the short-term throughput and the minimum transmission completion time is given. Numerical results are presented to confirm the analytical findings.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.012412.110805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144764","Energy harvesting;optimal scheduling;wireless networks;battery limited nodes","Batteries;Resource management;Energy harvesting;Throughput;Transmitters;Power transmission;Optimization","","596","","21","IEEE","1 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We say that the ith coordinate of C has locality r , if the value at this coordinate can be recovered from accessing some other r coordinates of C. Data storage applications require codes with small redundancy, low locality for information coordinates, large distance, and low locality for parity coordinates. In this paper, we carry out an in-depth study of the relations between these parameters. We establish a tight bound for the redundancy n-k in terms of the message length, the distance, and the locality of information coordinates. We refer to codes attaining the bound as optimal. We prove some structure theorems about optimal codes, which are particularly strong for small distances. This gives a fairly complete picture of the tradeoffs between codewords length, worst case distance, and locality of information symbols. We then consider the locality of parity check symbols and erasure correction beyond worst case distance for optimal codes. Using our structure theorem, we obtain a tight bound for the locality of parity symbols possible in such codes for a broad class of parameter settings. We prove that there is a tradeoff between having good locality and the ability to correct erasures beyond the minimum distance.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2012.2208937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6259860","Block codes;linear codes","Vectors;Systematics;Redundancy;Parity check codes;Linear code;Silicon","","595","8","18","IEEE","3 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Operation tasks of residential appliances are categorized into deferrable/non-deferrable and interruptible/non-interruptible ones based on appliances' DR preferences as well as their distinct spatial and temporal operation characteristics. The stochastic optimization adopts the scenario-based approach via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for minimizing the expected electricity payment for the entire day, while controlling the financial risks associated with real-time electricity price uncertainties via the expected downside risks formulation. Price uncertainty intervals are considered in the robust optimization for minimizing the worst-case electricity payment while flexibly adjusting the solution robustness. Both approaches are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems and solved by state-of-the-art MILP solvers.

As a result, BRIEF is very fast both to build and to match.

Assuming such a CVIC environment, this paper proposed a CVIC algorithm that does not require a traffic signal. The CVIC algorithm was designed to manipulate individual vehicles' maneuvers so that vehicles can safely cross the intersection without colliding with other vehicles. By eliminating the potential overlaps of vehicular trajectories coming from all conflicting approaches at the intersection, the CVIC algorithm seeks a safe maneuver for every vehicle approaching the intersection and manipulates each of them. An additional algorithm was designed to deal with the system failure cases resulting from inevitable trajectory overlaps at the intersection and infeasible solutions. A simulation-based case study implemented on a hypothetical four-way single-lane approach intersection under varying congestion conditions showed that the CVIC algorithm significantly improved intersection performance compared with conventional actuated intersection control: 99% and 33% of stop delay and total travel time reductions, respectively, were achieved. In addition, the CVIC algorithm significantly improved air quality and energy savings: 44% reductions of CO2 and 44% savings of fuel consumption.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2011.2178836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121907","Connected Vehicles (CV);cooperative vehicle intersection control (CVIC) system;intelligent transportation system (ITS);traffic control;traffic simulation","Vehicles;Trajectory;Acceleration;Optimization;Safety;Algorithm design and analysis","","590","3","29","IEEE","2 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reconfigurable antennas are a solution to this problem. This paper discusses the different reconfigurable components that can be used in an antenna to modify its structure and function. These reconfiguration techniques are either based on the integration of radio-frequency microelectromechanical systems (RF-MEMS), PIN diodes, varactors, photoconductive elements, or on the physical alteration of the antenna radiating structure, or on the use of smart materials such as ferrites and liquid crystals. Various activation mechanisms that can be used in each different reconfigurable implementation to achieve optimum performance are presented and discussed.

However most sparse representation based trackers only consider the holistic representation and do not make full use of the sparse coefficients to discriminate between the target and the background, and hence may fail with more possibility when there is similar object or occlusion in the scene. In this paper we develop a simple yet robust tracking method based on the structural local sparse appearance model. This representation exploits both partial information and spatial information of the target based on a novel alignment-pooling method. The similarity obtained by pooling across the local patches helps not only locate the target more accurately but also handle occlusion. In addition, we employ a template update strategy which combines incremental subspace learning and sparse representation. This strategy adapts the template to the appearance change of the target with less possibility of drifting and reduces the influence of the occluded target template as well. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging benchmark image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247880","","Target tracking;Vectors;Adaptation models;Dictionaries;Mathematical model;Visualization;Robustness","","575","3","22","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Neural adaptive control technique is adopted to solve the cooperative tracking problems of networked nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances. Results for both first-order and high-order nonlinear systems are given. Two examples, i.e., cooperative tracking control of coupled Lagrangian systems and modified FitzHugh–Nagumo models, justify the feasibility of the proposed neural adaptive control technique. For cooperative tracking control of the general linear systems, which include integrator dynamics as special cases, it is shown that the control gain design can be decoupled from the topology of the graphs, by using the LQR-based optimal control technique. Moreover, the synchronization region is unbounded, which is a desired property of the controller. The proposed optimal control method is applied to cooperative tracking control of two-mass–spring systems, which are well-known models for vibration in many mechanical systems.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2011.2160140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898403","Consensus;cooperative control;Laplacian potential;multiagent system;neural adaptive control;optimal control","Laplace equations;Multiagent systems;Regulators;Synchronization;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Lyapunov methods","","567","","45","IEEE","20 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CCPSO2 adopts a new PSO position update rule that relies on Cauchy and Gaussian distributions to sample new points in the search space, and a scheme to dynamically determine the coevolving subcomponent sizes of the variables. On high-dimensional problems (ranging from 100 to 2000 variables), the performance of CCPSO2 compared favorably against a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm sep-CMA-ES, two existing PSO algorithms, and a cooperative coevolving differential evolution algorithm. In particular, CCPSO2 performed significantly better than sep-CMA-ES and two existing PSO algorithms on more complex multimodal problems (which more closely resemble real-world problems), though not as well as the existing algorithms on unimodal functions.

The main idea is to use spatial covariance matrices as EEG signal descriptors and to rely on Riemannian geometry to directly classify these matrices using the topology of the manifold of symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrices. This framework allows to extract the spatial information contained in EEG signals without using spatial filtering. Two methods are proposed and compared with a reference method [multiclass Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)] on the multiclass dataset IIa from the BCI Competition IV. The first method, named minimum distance to Riemannian mean (MDRM), is an implementation of the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classification algorithm using Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean. This simple method shows comparable results with the reference method. The second method, named tangent space LDA (TSLDA), maps the covariance matrices onto the Riemannian tangent space where matrices can be vectorized and treated as Euclidean objects. Then, a variable selection procedure is applied in order to decrease dimensionality and a classification by LDA is performed.

In the first classification stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using novel features calculated with O(1) complexity per region tested. Only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification is improved using more computationally expensive features. A highly efficient exhaustive search with feedback loops is then applied to group ERs into words and to select the most probable character segmentation. Finally, text is recognized in an OCR stage trained using synthetic fonts. The method was evaluated on two public datasets.

As such, the classifiers often perform poorly on the target domain. Domain adaptation techniques aim to correct the mismatch. Existing approaches have concentrated on learning feature representations that are invariant across domains, and they often do not directly exploit low-dimensional structures that are intrinsic to many vision datasets. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based method that takes advantage of such structures. Our geodesic flow kernel models domain shift by integrating an infinite number of subspaces that characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties from the source to the target domain. Our approach is computationally advantageous, automatically inferring important algorithmic parameters without requiring extensive cross-validation or labeled data from either domain. We also introduce a metric that reliably measures the adaptability between a pair of source and target domains. For a given target domain and several source domains, the metric can be used to automatically select the optimal source domain to adapt and avoid less desirable ones.

Most of the growth occurred in the first two decades with growth slowing to ten times in the last decade. Over the same three decades, network traffic has increased by a much smaller factor of 100, but with most of the growth occurring in the last few years, when data started dominating network traffic. At the current growth rate, the next factor of 100 in network traffic growth will occur within a decade. The large difference in growth rates between the delivered fiber capacity and the traffic demand is expected to create a capacity shortage within a decade. The first part of the paper recounts the history of traffic and capacity growth and extrapolations for the future.

The standard local binary pattern (LBP) and local ternary pattern (LTP) encode the relationship between the referenced pixel and its surrounding neighbors by computing gray-level difference. The proposed method encodes the relationship between the referenced pixel and its neighbors, based on the directions that are calculated using the first-order derivatives in vertical and horizontal directions. In addition, we propose a generic strategy to compute nth-order LTrP using (n - 1)th-order horizontal and vertical derivatives for efficient CBIR and analyze the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm by combining it with the Gabor transform. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the LBP, the local derivative patterns, and the LTP based on the results obtained using benchmark image databases viz., Corel 1000 database (DB1), Brodatz texture database (DB2), and MIT VisTex database (DB3). Performance analysis shows that the proposed method improves the retrieval result from 70.34%/44.9% to 75.9%/48.7% in terms of average precision/average recall on database DB1, and from 79.97% to 85.30% and 82.23% to 90.02% in terms of average retrieval rate on databases DB2 and DB3, respectively, as compared with the standard LBP.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2188809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6175124","Content-based image retrieval (CBIR);Gabor transform (GT);local binary pattern (LBP);local tetra patterns (LTrPs);texture","Image retrieval;Feature extraction;Data mining;Face recognition;Shape;Heating","Algorithms;Documentation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","540","1","39","IEEE","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The computational burden introduced by detailed modeling of MMC-HVDC systems in electromagnetic-transients (EMT)-type programs complicates the study of transients especially when these systems are integrated into a large network.

With an encrypted image containing additional data, if a receiver has the data-hiding key, he can extract the additional data though he does not know the image content. If the receiver has the encryption key, he can decrypt the received data to obtain an image similar to the original one, but cannot extract the additional data.

We envision femtocell-like base stations, which we call helpers, with weak backhaul links but large storage capacity. These helpers form a wireless distributed caching network that assists the macro base station by handling requests of popular files that have been cached. Due to the short distances between helpers and requesting devices, the transmission of cached files can be done very efficiently. A key question for such a system is the wireless distributed caching problem, i.e., which files should be cached by which helpers. If every mobile device has only access to a exactly one helper, then clearly each helper should cache the same files, namely the most popular ones. However, for the case that each mobile device can access multiple caches, the assignment of files to helpers becomes nontrivial. The theoretical contribution of our paper lies in (i) formalizing the distributed caching problem, (ii) showing that this problem is NP-hard, and (iii) presenting approximation algorithms that lie within a constant factor of the theoretical optimum. On the practical side, we present a detailed simulation of a university campus scenario covered by a single 3GPP LTE R8 cell and several helpers using a simplified 802.11n protocol. We use a real campus trace of video requests and show how distributed caching can increase the number served users by as much as 400 - 500%.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0775-8","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195469","","Delay;Wireless communication;Base stations;Optimization;Vectors;Greedy algorithms;Approximation methods","","536","229","19","IEEE","10 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We derive deterministic approximations of the empirical signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the receivers, which are tight as M, K → ∞. In the course of this derivation, the per-user channel correlation model requires the development of a novel deterministic equivalent of the empirical Stieltjes transform of large dimensional random matrices with generalized variance profile. The deterministic SINR approximations enable us to solve various practical optimization problems. Under sum rate maximization, we derive 1) for RZF the optimal regularization parameter; 2) for ZF the optimal number of users; 3) for ZF and RZF the optimal power allocation scheme; and 4) the optimal amount of feedback in large FDD/TDD multiuser systems.

Gradients convey important visual information and are crucial to scene understanding. Using such information, structural and contrast changes can be effectively captured. Therefore, we use the gradient similarity to measure the change in contrast and structure in images. Apart from the structural/contrast changes, image quality is also affected by luminance changes, which must be also accounted for complete and more robust IQA. Hence, the proposed scheme considers both luminance and contrast-structural changes to effectively assess image quality. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is designed to follow the masking effect and visibility threshold more closely, i.e., the case when both masked and masking signals are small is more effectively tackled by the proposed scheme. Finally, the effects of the changes in luminance and contrast-structure are integrated via an adaptive method to obtain the overall image quality score.

Based on this foundation we provide definitions, propose a methodological framework, and provide practical guidance for conducting design studies. We define a design study as a project in which visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts, design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design, and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines. We characterize two axes - a task clarity axis from fuzzy to crisp and an information location axis from the domain expert's head to the computer - and use these axes to reason about design study contributions, their suitability, and uniqueness from other approaches. The proposed methodological framework consists of 9 stages: learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write. For each stage we provide practical guidance and outline potential pitfalls.

We use an existing database consisting of 263 samples from 43 subjects, and demonstrate that these new dysphonia measures can outperform state-of-the-art results, reaching almost 99% overall classification accuracy using only ten dysphonia features.

However, the nearest neighbor classifier suffers from several drawbacks such as high storage requirements, low efficiency in classification response, and low noise tolerance. These weaknesses have been the subject of study for many researchers and many solutions have been proposed. Among them, one of the most promising solutions consists of reducing the data used for establishing a classification rule (training data) by means of selecting relevant prototypes. Many prototype selection methods exist in the literature and the research in this area is still advancing. Different properties could be observed in the definition of them, but no formal categorization has been established yet. This paper provides a survey of the prototype selection methods proposed in the literature from a theoretical and empirical point of view. Considering a theoretical point of view, we propose a taxonomy based on the main characteristics presented in prototype selection and we analyze their advantages and drawbacks. Empirically, we conduct an experimental study involving different sizes of data sets for measuring their performance in terms of accuracy, reduction capabilities, and runtime.

We analyze an intuitive Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal in- formation gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions.

In particular, we construct multiple hypergraphs for a set of 3-D objects based on their 2-D views. In these hypergraphs, each vertex is an object, and each edge is a cluster of views. Therefore, an edge connects multiple vertices. We define the weight of each edge based on the similarities between any two views within the cluster. Retrieval and recognition are performed based on the hypergraphs. Therefore, our method can explore the higher order relationship among objects and does not use the distance between objects.

In this paper, we propose a new mutation strategy, a fitness- induced parent selection scheme for the binomial crossover of DE, and a simple but effective scheme of adapting two of its most important control parameters with an objective of achieving improved performance. The new mutation operator, which we call DE/current-to-gr_best/1, js a variant of the classical DE/current-to-best/1 scheme. It uses the best of a group (whose size is q% of the population size) of randomly selected solutions from current generation to perturb the parent (target) vector, unlike DE/current-to-best/1 that always picks the best vector of the entire population to perturb the target vector. In our modified framework of recombination, a biased parent selection scheme has been incorporated by letting each mutant undergo the usual binomial crossover with one of the p top-ranked individuals from the current population and not with the target vector with the same index as used in all variants of DE. A DE variant obtained by integrating the proposed mutation, crossover, and parameter adaptation strategies with the classical DE framework (developed in 1995) is compared with two classical and four state-of-the-art adaptive DE variants over 25 standard numerical benchmarks taken from the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2005 competition and special session on real parameter optimization. Our comparative study indicates that the proposed schemes improve the performance of DE by a large magnitude such that it becomes capable of enjoying statistical superiority over the state-of-the-art DE variants for a wide variety of test problems.

To face this network load, large data centers are required with thousands of servers interconnected with high bandwidth switches. Current data center networks, based on electronic packet switches, consume excessive power to handle the increased communication bandwidth of emerging applications. Optical interconnects have gained attention recently as a promising solution offering high throughput, low latency and reduced energy consumption compared to current networks based on commodity switches. This paper presents a thorough survey on optical interconnects for next generation data center networks. Furthermore, the paper provides a qualitative categorization and comparison of the proposed schemes based on their main features such as connectivity and scalability. Finally, the paper discusses the cost and the power consumption of these schemes that are of primary importance in the future data center networks.","1553-877X","","10.1109/SURV.2011.122111.00069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6129370","Optical interconnects;data center networks","Optical switches;Optical packet switching;Optical fiber networks;Optical interconnections;Servers;Power demand;Data centers","","513","39","64","IEEE","11 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scope of proposals we survey is also extensive, including password management software, federated login protocols, graphical password schemes, cognitive authentication schemes, one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided schemes and biometrics. Our comprehensive approach leads to key insights about the difficulty of replacing passwords. Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits: none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes offering minor security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world constraints. Beyond our analysis of current schemes, our framework provides an evaluation methodology and benchmark for future web authentication proposals.","2375-1207","978-0-7695-4681-0","10.1109/SP.2012.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6234436","authentication;computer security;human computer interaction;security and usability;deployability;economics;software engineering","Authentication;Usability;Privacy;Proposals;Educational institutions","","511","23","67","IEEE","9 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The original work partitions an encrypted image into blocks, and each block carries one bit by flipping three LSBs of a set of pre-defined pixels. The data extraction and image recovery can be achieved by examining the block smoothness. Zhang's work did not fully exploit the pixels in calculating the smoothness of each block and did not consider the pixel correlations in the border of neighboring blocks. These two issues could reduce the correctness of data extraction. This letter adopts a better scheme for measuring the smoothness of blocks, and uses the side-match scheme to further decrease the error rate of extracted-bits. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method offers better performance over Zhang's work. For example, when the block size is set to 8 8, the error rate of the Lena image of the proposed method is 0. 34%, which is significantly lower than 1.21% of Zhang's work.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2012.2187334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151038","Encrypted image;reversible data hiding;side-match","Data mining;Encryption;Histograms;Estimation;Materials;Correlation","","510","1","11","IEEE","10 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Owing to the selection of multiple “correct” indices, the gOMP algorithm is finished with much smaller number of iterations when compared to the OMP. We show that the gOMP can perfectly reconstruct any $K$ -sparse signals $(K>1)$ , provided that the sensing matrix satisfies the RIP with $\delta_{NK}<{{\sqrt{N}}\over{\sqrt{K}+3\sqrt{N}}}$ .

The objective is to provide a global understanding of the sequence anomaly detection problem and how existing techniques relate to each other. The key contribution of this survey is the classification of the existing research into three distinct categories, based on the problem formulation that they are trying to solve. These problem formulations are: 1) identifying anomalous sequences with respect to a database of normal sequences; 2) identifying an anomalous subsequence within a long sequence; and 3) identifying a pattern in a sequence whose frequency of occurrence is anomalous. We show how each of these problem formulations is characteristically distinct from each other and discuss their relevance in various application domains. We review techniques from many disparate and disconnected application domains that address each of these formulations. Within each problem formulation, we group techniques into categories based on the nature of the underlying algorithm. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and show how the existing techniques are variants of the basic technique. This approach shows how different techniques within a category are related or different from each other. Our categorization reveals new variants and combinations that have not been investigated before for anomaly detection. We also provide a discussion of relative strengths and weaknesses of different techniques. We show how techniques developed for one problem formulation can be adapted to solve a different formulation, thereby providing several novel adaptations to solve the different problem formulations. We also highlight the applicability of the techniques that handle discrete sequences to other related areas such as online anomaly detection and time series anomaly detection.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645624","Discrete sequences;anomaly detection.","Training;Computers;Probabilistic logic;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Postal services;Operating systems","","504","5","95","IEEE","29 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Diffusion adaptation allows the nodes to cooperate and diffuse information in real-time; it also helps alleviate the effects of stochastic gradient noise and measurement noise through a continuous learning process. We analyze the mean-square-error performance of the algorithm in some detail, including its transient and steady-state behavior. We also apply the diffusion algorithm to two problems: distributed estimation with sparse parameters and distributed localization. Compared to well-studied incremental methods, diffusion methods do not require the use of a cyclic path over the nodes and are robust to node and link failure. Diffusion methods also endow networks with adaptation abilities that enable the individual nodes to continue learning even when the cost function changes with time.

The linear SVMs are in general much faster to learn and evaluate (test) than the original nonlinear SVMs. This work introduces explicit feature maps for the additive class of kernels, such as the intersection, Hellinger's, and χ2 kernels, commonly used in computer vision, and enables their use in large scale problems. In particular, we: 1) provide explicit feature maps for all additive homogeneous kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; 2) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on a spectral analysis; and 3) quantify the error of the approximation, showing that the error is independent of the data dimension and decays exponentially fast with the approximation order for selected kernels such as χ2. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernels yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVMs. We also compare with two other approximation methods: Nystrom's approximation of Perronnin et al. [1], which is data dependent, and the explicit map of Maji and Berg [2] for the intersection kernel, which, as in the case of our approximations, is data independent. The approximations are evaluated on a number of standard data sets, including Caltech-101 [3], Daimler-Chrysler pedestrians [4], and INRIA pedestrians [5].","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6136519","Kernel methods;feature map;large scale learning;object recognition;object detection.","Kernel;Approximation methods;Additives;Histograms;Support vector machines;Training;Measurement","","501","16","45","IEEE","23 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These types of problems are challenging and have never been studied together before, even though the algorithms for the two-stage stochastic program and the chance-constrained stochastic program have been recently developed separately. In this paper, a combined sample average approximation (SAA) algorithm is developed to solve the model effectively. The convergence property and the solution validation process of our proposed combined SAA algorithm is discussed and presented in the paper. Finally, computational results indicate that increasing the utilization of wind power output might increase the total power generation cost, and our experiments also verify that the proposed algorithm can solve large-scale power grid optimization problems.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2159522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5967923","Chance-constrained optimization;sample average approximation;unit commitment;wind power","Wind power generation;Stochastic processes;Generators;Approximation algorithms;Uncertainty;Upper bound;Optimization","","500","1","23","IEEE","1 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sparse nature of location finding makes the theory of Compressive Sensing (CS) desirable for accurate indoor positioning using Received Signal Strength (RSS) from Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Access Points (APs). We propose an accurate RSS-based indoor positioning system using the theory of compressive sensing, which is a method to recover sparse signals from a small number of noisy measurements by solving an \ell_1-minimization problem. Our location estimator consists of a coarse localizer, where the RSS is compared to a number of clusters to detect in which cluster the node is located, followed by a fine localization step, using the theory of compressive sensing, to further refine the location estimation. We have investigated different coarse localization schemes and AP selection approaches to increase the accuracy. We also show that the CS theory can be used to reconstruct the RSS radio map from measurements at only a small number of fingerprints, reducing the number of measurements significantly. We have implemented the proposed system on a WiFi-integrated mobile device and have evaluated the performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system leads to substantial improvement on localization accuracy and complexity over the widely used traditional fingerprinting methods.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2011.216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042868","Indoor positioning;fingerprinting;compressive sensing;clustering;radio map;WLANs","Mobile handsets;Mobile radio mobility management;Compressed sensing;Wireless LAN;Mobile communication","","499","8","38","IEEE","13 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Constant delays exist in the conventional dedicated communication channels, while the future usage of open communication networks will introduce time-varying delays. Those delays would degrade the dynamic performance of LFC and in the worst case, cause instability. The maximal delay time which allows an LFC scheme embedded with controllers to retain stable is defined as the delay margin. This paper investigates the delay-dependent stability of the LFC scheme by using Lyaponuv-theory based delay-dependent criterion and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) techniques. Case studies are carried out based on one-area and multi-area LFC schemes installed with proportional-integral (PI) controllers, respectively. Relationship between the gains of PI controller and the delay margin of the LFC scheme are investigated and results obtained can be used to tune the PI controllers to achieve a compromise between the dynamic performance and the delay margin. Both constant and time-varying delays are considered. The effectiveness of the criterion used is verified by simulation studies.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2172821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080746","Constant time delay;delay margin;delay-dependent stability;load frequency control;time-varying delay","Delay;Delay effects;Power system stability;Stability criteria;Load modeling;Frequency control","","498","1","28","Crown","14 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose to use local filtering and max-pooling in frequency domain to normalize speaker variance to achieve higher multi-speaker speech recognition performance. In our method, a pair of local filtering layer and max-pooling layer is added at the lowest end of neural network (NN) to normalize spectral variations of speech signals. In our experiments, the proposed CNN architecture is evaluated in a speaker independent speech recognition task using the standard TIMIT data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN method can achieve over 10% relative error reduction in the core TIMIT test sets when comparing with a regular NN using the same number of hidden layers and weights. Our results also show that the best result of the proposed CNN model is better than previously published results on the same TIMIT test sets that use a pre-trained deep NN model.","2379-190X","978-1-4673-0046-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6288864","acoustic modeling;neural networks;speech recognition;local filtering;max-pooling","Hidden Markov models;Convolution;Speech;Artificial neural networks;Speech recognition;Acoustics;Training","","497","14","11","IEEE","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the viewpoint of communication theory and engineering, molecular communication is proposed as a new paradigm for engineered biological nanomachines to communicate with the natural biological nanomachines which form a biological system. Distinct from the current telecommunication paradigm, molecular communication uses molecules as the carriers of information; sender biological nanomachines encode information on molecules and release the molecules in the environment, the molecules then propagate in the environment to receiver biological nanomachines, and the receiver biological nanomachines biochemically react with the molecules to decode information. Current molecular communication research is limited to small-scale networks of several biological nanomachines. Key challenges to bridge the gap between current research and practical applications include developing robust and scalable techniques to create a functional network from a large number of biological nanomachines. Developing networking mechanisms and communication protocols is anticipated to introduce new avenues into integrating engineered and natural biological nanomachines into a single networked system. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art in the area of molecular communication by discussing its architecture, features, applications, design, engineering, and physical modeling.

This is mostly due to the difficulty of simultaneously handling variations in illumination, image misalignment, and occlusion in the test image. We consider a scenario where the training images are well controlled and test images are only loosely controlled. We propose a conceptually simple face recognition system that achieves a high degree of robustness and stability to illumination variation, image misalignment, and partial occlusion. The system uses tools from sparse representation to align a test face image to a set of frontal training images. The region of attraction of our alignment algorithm is computed empirically for public face data sets such as Multi-PIE. We demonstrate how to capture a set of training images with enough illumination variation that they span test images taken under uncontrolled illumination. In order to evaluate how our algorithms work under practical testing conditions, we have implemented a complete face recognition system, including a projector-based training acquisition system. Our system can efficiently and effectively recognize faces under a variety of realistic conditions, using only frontal images under the proposed illuminations as training.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5871642","Face recognition;face alignment;illumination variation;occlusion and corruption;sparse representation;error correction;validation and outlier rejection.","Lighting;Face recognition;Image recognition;Databases","Algorithms;Biometric Identification;Databases, Factual;Face;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Lighting;Reproducibility of Results","496","17","45","IEEE","9 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In hyperspectral images, because the noise intensity in different bands is different, to better suppress the noise in the high-noise-intensity bands and preserve the detailed information in the low-noise-intensity bands, the denoising strength should be adaptively adjusted with the noise intensity in the different bands. Meanwhile, in the same band, there exist different spatial property regions, such as homogeneous regions and edge or texture regions; to better reduce the noise in the homogeneous regions and preserve the edge and texture information, the denoising strength applied to pixels in different spatial property regions should also be different. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hyperspectral image denoising algorithm employing a spectral-spatial adaptive total variation (TV) model, in which the spectral noise differences and spatial information differences are both considered in the process of noise reduction. To reduce the computational load in the denoising process, the split Bregman iteration algorithm is employed to optimize the spectral-spatial hyperspectral TV model and accelerate the speed of hyperspectral image denoising. A number of experiments illustrate that the proposed approach can satisfactorily realize the spectral-spatial adaptive mechanism in the denoising process, and superior denoising results are produced.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2185054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165657","Hyperspectral image denoising;spatial adaptive;spectral adaptive;split Bregman iteration","Hyperspectral imaging;Noise reduction;TV;Adaptation models;Noise;Image denoising","","495","1","49","IEEE","7 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ground truth was defined based on the median arousal and valence scores given to clips in a preliminary study using an online questionnaire. Based on the participants' responses, three classes for each dimension were defined. The arousal classes were calm, medium aroused, and activated and the valence classes were unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant. One of the three affective labels of either valence or arousal was determined by classification of bodily responses. A one-participant-out cross validation was employed to investigate the classification performance in a user-independent approach. The best classification accuracies of 68.5 percent for three labels of valence and 76.4 percent for three labels of arousal were obtained using a modality fusion strategy and a support vector machine.

In this paper, we extend SRC to applications where there are very few, or even a single, training images per subject. Assuming that the intraclass variations of one subject can be approximated by a sparse linear combination of those of other subjects, Extended Sparse Representation-Based Classifier (ESRC) applies an auxiliary intraclass variant dictionary to represent the possible variation between the training and testing images. The dictionary atoms typically represent intraclass sample differences computed from either the gallery faces themselves or the generic faces that are outside the gallery. Experimental results on the AR and FERET databases show that ESRC has better generalization ability than SRC for undersampled face recognition under variable expressions, illuminations, disguises, and ages. The superior results of ESRC suggest that if the dictionary is properly constructed, SRC algorithms can generalize well to the large-scale face recognition problem, even with a single training image per class.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133293","Face recognition;sparse representation;undersampled problem;feature extraction.","Training;Dictionaries;Face recognition;Lighting;Face;Error analysis","Algorithms;Biometric Identification;Databases, Factual;Face;Facial Expression;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Lighting;Male","485","","20","IEEE","17 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The considered problem is modeled as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), and different quality of service (QoS) requirements including a minimum required data rate and a maximum tolerable channel outage probability. The power allocation, data rate adaptation, antenna allocation, and subcarrier allocation policies are optimized for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bit/Joule delivered to the users). By exploiting the properties of fractional programming, the resulting non-convex optimization problem in fractional form is transformed into an equivalent optimization problem in subtractive form, which leads to an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, the objective function is lower bounded by a concave function which can be maximized by using dual decomposition. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithm converges in a small number of iterations and demonstrate the trade-off between energy efficiency and the number of transmit antennas.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.072512.111850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6251827","Energy efficiency;green communication;multiuser MIMO;large numbers of antennas;resource allocation","Resource management;Optimization;Transmitting antennas;Fading;Mobile communication;Vectors","","483","3","31","IEEE","27 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A diffusion process with a nonlinear drift coefficient with a constant threshold was transformed to a linear model with a variable threshold to characterize the dynamics and nonlinearity of the degradation process. This new diffusion process contrasts sharply with existing models that use a linear drift, and also with models that use a linear drift based on transformed data that were originally nonlinear. Both existing models are based on a constant threshold. To estimate the remaining useful life, an analytical approximation to the distribution of the first hitting time of the diffusion process crossing a threshold level is obtained in a closed form by a time-space transformation under a mild assumption. The unknown parameters in the established model are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation approach, and goodness of fit measures are applied. The usefulness of the proposed model is demonstrated by several real-world examples.

This issue is becoming more significant today due to the increasing number of microgrids (MGs). The MGs mostly use renewable energies in electrical power production that are varying naturally. These changes and usual uncertainties in power systems cause the classic controllers to be unable to provide a proper performance over a wide range of operating conditions. In response to this challenge, the present paper addresses a new online intelligent approach by using a combination of the fuzzy logic and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques for optimal tuning of the most popular existing proportional-integral (PI) based frequency controllers in the ac MG systems. The control design methodology is examined on an ac MG case study.

GMA exploits the fact that most popular supervised and unsupervised feature extraction techniques are the solution of a special form of a quadratic constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which can be solved efficiently as a generalized eigenvalue problem. GMA solves a joint, relaxed QCQP over different feature spaces to obtain a single (non)linear subspace. Intuitively, GMA is a supervised extension of Canonical Correlational Analysis (CCA), which is useful for cross-view classification and retrieval. The proposed approach is general and has the potential to replace CCA whenever classification or retrieval is the purpose and label information is available.

Based on the above considerations, we utilize the non-local means filter to learn a non-local prior and the steering kernel regression to learn a local prior. By assembling the two complementary regularization terms, we propose a maximum a posteriori probability framework for SR recovery.

The use of a convex model in terms of the continuous variables is particularly important because it ensures that an optimal solution obtained by a branch-and-cut algorithm for mixed-integer conic programming is global. In addition, good quality solutions with a relaxed optimality gap can be very efficiently obtained.

Even when optimal or optimization-based control synthesis tools are applied, the economic cost associated with plant operation is often only optimized according to static criteria that pick, among all feasible steady states, those with minimal cost. In mathematical terms, an economic cost functional differs from stage costs commonly adopted in model predictive control (MPC) as it need not be minimal at its best equilibrium. This note collects and illustrates some recent advances in receding horizon optimization of nonlinear systems that allow the control designer to simultaneously and dynamically optimize transient and steady-state economic performance. In particular, we show that average performance of economic MPC is never worse than the optimal steady-state operation. We introduce a dissipation inequality and supply function that extend previous sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of economic MPC. Dissipativity is also shown to be a sufficient condition for concluding that steady-state operation is optimal. We show how to modify an economic cost function so that steady-state operation is asymptotically stable when that feature is deemed desirable. Finally, for the case when steady-state operation is not optimal, we develop two modified MPC controllers that asymptotically guarantee 1) improved performance compared to optimal periodic control and 2) satisfaction of constraints on average values of states and inputs.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2179349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6099558","Nonlinear systems;optimal control;predictive control;process control","Economics;Steady-state;Optimization;Stability analysis;Asymptotic stability;Transient analysis;Zinc","","474","","18","IEEE","9 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These have highlighted the increased variability that a system may experience in the future. As system generation planning techniques evolve with the challenge of integrating variable generation, the flexibility of a system to manage periods of high variability needs to be assessed. The insufficient ramping resource expectation (IRRE) metric is proposed to measure power system flexibility for use in long-term planning, and is derived from traditional generation adequacy metrics. Compared to existing generation adequacy metrics, flexibility assessment is more data intensive. A flexibility metric can identify the time intervals over which a system is most likely to face a shortage of flexible resources, and can measure the relative impact of changing operational policies and the addition of flexible resources. The flexibility of a test system with increasing penetrations of variable generation is assessed.

In general, cost of utilizing computing resources provisioned by reservation plan is cheaper than that provisioned by on-demand plan, since cloud consumer has to pay to provider in advance. With the reservation plan, the consumer can reduce the total resource provisioning cost. However, the best advance reservation of resources is difficult to be achieved due to uncertainty of consumer's future demand and providers' resource prices. To address this problem, an optimal cloud resource provisioning (OCRP) algorithm is proposed by formulating a stochastic programming model. The OCRP algorithm can provision computing resources for being used in multiple provisioning stages as well as a long-term plan, e.g., four stages in a quarter plan and twelve stages in a yearly plan. The demand and price uncertainty is considered in OCRP. In this paper, different approaches to obtain the solution of the OCRP algorithm are considered including deterministic equivalent formulation, sample-average approximation, and Benders decomposition. Numerical studies are extensively performed in which the results clearly show that with the OCRP algorithm, cloud consumer can successfully minimize total cost of resource provisioning in cloud computing environments.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2011.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710870","Cloud computing;resource provisioning;virtualization;virtual machine placement;stochastic programming.","Cloud computing;Uncertainty;Stochastic processes;Programming;Computational modeling;Virtual machining;Algorithm design and analysis","","472","30","28","IEEE","10 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One important focus has been on the analysis of brain connectivity using the concept of networks instead of regions. Approximately ten years ago, two important research areas grew out of this concept. First, a network proposed to be “a default mode of brain function” since dubbed the default mode network was proposed by Raichle. Secondly, multisubject or group independent component analysis (ICA) provided a data-driven approach to study properties of brain networks, including the default mode network. In this paper, we provide a focused review of how ICA has contributed to the study of intrinsic networks.

In contrast to previous works, this correspondence attempts to reconstruct the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix instead of searching for the optimal diagonal loading factor for the sample covariance matrix. The estimator is based on the Capon spectral estimator integrated over a region separated from the desired signal direction. This is shown to be more robust than using the sample covariance matrix. Subsequently, the mismatch in the steering vector of the desired signal is estimated by maximizing the beamformer output power under a constraint that prevents the corrected steering vector from getting close to the interference steering vectors. The proposed adaptive beamforming algorithm does not impose a norm constraint. Therefore, it can be used even in applications where gain perturbations affect the steering vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed adaptive beamformer is almost always close to the optimal value across a wide range of signal to noise and signal to interference ratios.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2194289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6180020","Covariance matrix reconstruction;robust adaptive beamforming;steering vector estimation","Covariance matrix;Vectors;Interference;Array signal processing;Noise;Robustness;Arrays","","468","4","20","IEEE","9 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a ripple power port to manage energy storage and decouple capacitor ripple from power ripple. A ripple power port allows the designer to make a choice of capacitor voltage independent of other system voltages. A combination of an ac link converter and a ripple power port leads to a dramatic increase in reliability: it is shown that converters with nominal ratings up to 200 W can be designed with expected mean-time-between-failure ratings on the order of 1.4 × 106 h-sufficient for hundred-year operation in long-life applications such as photovoltaic converters and LED lamps.

In addition, error propagation, applications, and links to publicly available code are included. VO is a well understood and established part of robotics. VO has reached a maturity that has allowed us to successfully use it for certain classes of applications: space, ground, aerial, and underwater. In the presence of loop closures, VO can be used as a building block for a complete SLAM algorithm to reduce motion drift. Challenges that still remain are to develop and demonstrate large-scale and long-term implementations, such as driving autonomous cars for hundreds of miles. Such systems have recently been demonstrated using Lidar and Radar sensors [86]. However, for VO to be used in such systems, technical issues regarding robustness and, especially, long-term stability have to be resolved. Eventually, VO has the potential to replace Lidar-based systems for egomotion estimation, which are currently leading the state of the art in accuracy, robustness, and reliability. VO offers a cheaper and mechanically easier-to-manufacture solution for egomotion estimation, while, additionally, being fully passive. Furthermore, the ongoing miniaturization of digital cameras offers the possibility to develop smaller and smaller robotic systems capable of ego-motion estimation.","1558-223X","","10.1109/MRA.2012.2182810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6153423","","Tutorials;Robust control;Optimization;VIsualization;Odemtry;Feature extraction;Cameras;Computer vision;Estimation","","459","9","91","IEEE","16 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Second, it uses ontologies for explicit context and activity modeling and representation. Third and finally, it exploits semantic reasoning and classification for activity inferencing, thus enabling both coarse-grained and fine-grained activity recognition. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of smart homes and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) upon which we built both context and ADL ontologies. We present a generic system architecture for the proposed knowledge-driven approach and describe the underlying ontology-based recognition process. Special emphasis is placed on semantic subsumption reasoning algorithms for activity recognition. The proposed approach has been implemented in a function-rich software system, which was deployed in a smart home research laboratory. We evaluated the proposed approach and the developed system through extensive experiments involving a number of various ADL use scenarios.

In a subsequent step, we learn to rank the corresponding segments by training a continuous model to predict how likely they are to exhibit real-world regularities (expressed as putative overlap with ground truth) based on their mid-level region properties, then diversify the estimated overlap score using maximum marginal relevance measures. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC 2009 and 2010 data sets.

With an LCL filter added at its output, the proposed SAPF offers superior switching harmonic suppression using much reduced passive filtering elements. Its output currents thus have high slew rate for tracking the targeted reference closely. Smaller inductance of the LCL filter also means smaller harmonic voltage drop across the passive output filter, which in turn minimizes the possibility of overmodulation, particularly for cases where high modulation index is desired. These advantages, together with overall system stability, are guaranteed only through proper consideration of critical design and control issues, like the selection of LCL parameters, interactions between resonance damping and harmonic compensation, bandwidth design of the closed-loop system, and active damping implementation with fewer current sensors. These described design concerns, together with their generalized design procedure, are applied to an analytical example, and eventually verified by both simulation and experimental results.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2011.2167117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009185","Active power filter;current control;LCL filter;resonance damping","Damping;Power harmonic filters;Resonant frequency;Harmonic analysis;Capacitors;Power system stability","","455","1","28","IEEE","5 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The image fusion technique is introduced to generate a difference image by using complementary information from a mean-ratio image and a log-ratio image. In order to restrain the background information and enhance the information of changed regions in the fused difference image, wavelet fusion rules based on an average operator and minimum local area energy are chosen to fuse the wavelet coefficients for a low-frequency band and a high-frequency band, respectively. A reformulated fuzzy local-information C-means clustering algorithm is proposed for classifying changed and unchanged regions in the fused difference image. It incorporates the information about spatial context in a novel fuzzy way for the purpose of enhancing the changed information and of reducing the effect of speckle noise. Experiments on real SAR images show that the image fusion strategy integrates the advantages of the log-ratio operator and the mean-ratio operator and gains a better performance.

The improved transformerless inverter can sustain the same low input voltage as the full-bridge inverter and guarantee to completely meet the condition of eliminating common-mode leakage current. Both the unipolar sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation (SPWM) as well as the double-frequency SPWM control strategy can be applied to implement the three-level output in the presented inverter. The high efficiency and convenient thermal design are achieved thanks to the decoupling of two additional switches connected to the dc side. Moreover, the higher frequency and lower current ripples are obtained by adopting the double-frequency SPWM, and thus the total harmonic distortion of the grid-connected current are reduced greatly. Furthermore, the influence of the phase shift between the output voltage and current, and the influence of the junction capacitances of the power switches are analyzed in detail. Finally, a 1-kW prototype has been simulated and tested to verify the theoretical analysis of this paper.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2011.2160359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928426","Common-mode leakage current;junction capacitance;phase shift;photovoltaic (PV) system;sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation (SPWM) strategy;transformerless inverter","Inverters;Leakage current;Topology;Arrays;Inductors;Junctions;Capacitance","","444","2","26","IEEE","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the context of coordinated tracking, we focus on both consensus tracking and swarm tracking algorithms. In the case of first-order kinematics, we propose a distributed consensus tracking algorithm without velocity measurements under both fixed and switching network topologies. In particular, we show that distributed consensus tracking can be achieved in finite time. The algorithm is then extended to achieve distributed swarm tracking without velocity measurements. In the case of second-order dynamics, we first propose two distributed consensus tracking algorithms without acceleration measurements when the velocity of the virtual leader is varying under, respectively, a fixed and switching network topology. In particular, we show that the proposed algorithms guarantee at least global exponential tracking. We then propose a distributed consensus tracking algorithm and a distributed swarm tracking algorithm when the velocity of the virtual leader is constant. When the velocity of the virtual leader is varying, distributed swarm tracking is solved by using a distributed estimator. For distributed consensus tracking, a mild connectivity requirement is proposed by adopting an adaptive connectivity maintenance mechanism in which the adjacency matrix is defined in a proper way. Similarly, a mild connectivity requirement is proposed for distributed swarm tracking by adopting a connectivity maintenance mechanism in which the potential function is defined in a proper way.

However, these risk models do not help reason about the causal dependencies between network states. Further, the optimization formulations ignore the issue of resource availability while analyzing a risk model. In this paper, we propose a risk management framework using Bayesian networks that enable a system administrator to quantify the chances of network compromise at various levels. We show how to use this information to develop a security mitigation and management plan. In contrast to other similar models, this risk model lends itself to dynamic analysis during the deployed phase of the network.

The popularity and open structure of Twitter have attracted a large number of automated programs, known as bots, which appear to be a double-edged sword to Twitter. Legitimate bots generate a large amount of benign tweets delivering news and updating feeds, while malicious bots spread spam or malicious contents. More interestingly, in the middle between human and bot, there has emerged cyborg referred to either bot-assisted human or human-assisted bot. To assist human users in identifying who they are interacting with, this paper focuses on the classification of human, bot, and cyborg accounts on Twitter. We first conduct a set of large-scale measurements with a collection of over 500,000 accounts. We observe the difference among human, bot, and cyborg in terms of tweeting behavior, tweet content, and account properties. Based on the measurement results, we propose a classification system that includes the following four parts: 1) an entropy-based component, 2) a spam detection component, 3) an account properties component, and 4) a decision maker. It uses the combination of features extracted from an unknown user to determine the likelihood of being a human, bot, or cyborg.

In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an L1 regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional L1 regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated. Simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of SAs and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed CP formulation.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2218835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377247","Convex programming;demand response;energy consumption scheduling;energy management; $L_{1}$ regularization;smart home","Home appliances;Optimization;Electricity;Schedules;Energy management;Smart homes;Energy consumption","","433","","20","IEEE","10 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper demonstrates how controlling the rate at which electric vehicles charge can lead to better utilization of existing networks. A technique based on linear programming is employed, which determines the optimal charging rate for each electric vehicle in order to maximize the total power that can be delivered to the vehicles while operating within network limits.

This paper focuses on fault injection attacks that have been shown to require inexpensive equipment and a short amount of time. The paper provides a comprehensive description of these attacks on cryptographic devices and the countermeasures that have been developed against them. After a brief review of the widely used cryptographic algorithms, we classify the currently known fault injection attacks into low-cost ones (which a single attacker with a modest budget can mount) and high-cost ones (requiring highly skilled attackers with a large budget). We then list the attacks that have been developed for the important and commonly used ciphers and indicate which ones have been successfully used in practice. The known countermeasures against the previously described fault injection attacks are then presented, including intrusion detection and fault detection. We conclude the survey with a discussion on the interaction between fault injection attacks (and the corresponding countermeasures) and power analysis attacks.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2012.2188769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6178001","Countermeasures;cryptographic devices;fault injection;power analysis;side-channel attacks","Circuit faults;Encryption;Public key;Algorithm design and analysis;Cryptography;Fault diagnosis;Power systems","","429","2","85","IEEE","5 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, real transformations that an image can undergo can only be approximately modeled in this way, and thus most descriptors are only approximately invariant in practice. Second, descriptors are usually high dimensional (e.g., SIFT is represented as a 128--dimensional vector). In large-scale retrieval and matching problems, this can pose challenges in storing and retrieving descriptor data. We map the descriptor vectors into the Hamming space in which the Hamming metric is used to compare the resulting representations.

In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based MPPT algorithm for PGS operating under PSC is proposed. The standard version of PSO is modified to meet the practical consideration of PGS operating under PSC. The problem formulation, design procedure, and parameter setting method which takes the hardware limitation into account are described and explained in detail. The proposed method boasts the advantages such as easy to implement, system-independent, and high tracking efficiency. To validate the correctness of the proposed method, simulation, and experimental results of a 500-W PGS will also be provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2012.2219533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6317161","Maximum power point tracking (MPPT);partially shaded condition (PSC);particle swarm optimization (PSO);photovoltaic (PV) generation system (PGS)","Algorithm design and analysis;Particle swarm optimization;Maximum power point tracking;Photovoltaic systems","","428","","37","IEEE","1 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper addresses the modeling of resistive switching in bipolar metal-oxide RRAMs. Reset and set processes are described in terms of voltage-driven ion migration within a conductive filament generated by electroforming. Ion migration is modeled by drift–diffusion equations with Arrhenius-activated diffusivity and mobility. The local temperature and field are derived from the self-consistent solution of carrier and heat conduction equations in a 3-D axis-symmetric geometry.

There are unsolved issues in multiclass imbalance problems, which exist in real-world applications. This paper studies the challenges posed by the multiclass imbalance problems and investigates the generalization ability of some ensemble solutions, including our recently proposed algorithm AdaBoost.NC, with the aim of handling multiclass and imbalance effectively and directly. We first study the impact of multiminority and multimajority on the performance of two basic resampling techniques. They both present strong negative effects. “Multimajority” tends to be more harmful to the generalization performance. Motivated by the results, we then apply AdaBoost.NC to several real-world multiclass imbalance tasks and compare it to other popular ensemble methods. AdaBoost.NC is shown to be better at recognizing minority class examples and balancing the performance among classes in terms of G-mean without using any class decomposition.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2187280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170916","Boosting;diversity;ensemble learning;multiclass imbalance problems;negative correlation learning","Training;Correlation;Training data;Pattern analysis;Genetic algorithms;IEEE Potentials;Cybernetics","","413","","45","IEEE","16 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Kalman filters solve uncertainties in robot localization, navigation, following, tracking, motion control, estimation and prediction, visual servoing and manipulation, and structure reconstruction from a sequence of images. In the 50th anniversary, we have noticed that more than 20 kinds of Kalman filters have been developed so far. These include extended Kalman filters and unscented Kalman filters. In the last 30 years, about 800 publications have reported the capability of these filters in solving robot vision problems. Such problems encompass a rather wide application area, such as object modeling, robot control, target tracking, surveillance, search, recognition, and assembly, as well as robotic manipulation, localization, mapping, navigation, and exploration. These reports are summarized in this review to enable easy referral to suitable methods for practical solutions. Representative contributions and future research trends are also addressed in an abstract level.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2011.2162714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985520","Computer vision;estimation;Kalman filter;localization;particle filter;prediction;robot vision","Kalman filters;Tracking;Robot kinematics;Robot vision;Computer vision;Visualization","","410","","148","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the bias compensation is unnecessary when we replace the VAD by a soft speech presence probability (SPP) with fixed priors. Choosing fixed priors also has the benefit of decoupling the noise power estimator from subsequent steps in a speech enhancement framework, such as the estimation of the speech power and the estimation of the clean speech. We show that the proposed speech presence probability (SPP) approach maintains the quick noise tracking performance of the bias compensated minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-based approach while exhibiting less overestimation of the spectral noise power and an even lower computational complexity.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2011.2180896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6111268","Noise power estimation;speech enhancement","Speech;Signal to noise ratio;Estimation;Speech enhancement;Delay;Noise measurement","","409","9","30","IEEE","21 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is seen that three modes (a leaky mode, a proper waveguide mode, and a surface-wave-like mode) can all propagate on this structure. The wavenumbers of the modes are calculated theoretically and are numerically evaluated by HFSS simulation. The leakage loss, dielectric loss, and conductor loss are also analyzed.

Electric vehicles have not only large introduction potential but also much available time for control because they are almost plugged in the home outlets as distributed battery energy storages. Therefore, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is expected to be one of the key technologies in smart grid strategies. This paper proposes an autonomous distributed V2G control scheme. A grid-connected electric vehicle supplies a distributed spinning reserve according to the frequency deviation at the plug-in terminal, which is a signal of supply and demand imbalance in the power grid. As a style of EV utilization, it is assumed that vehicle use set next plug-out timing in advance. In such assumption, user convenience is satisfied by performing a scheduled charging for the plug-out, and plug-in idle time is available for the V2G control. Therefore a smart charging control is considered in the proposed scheme. Satisfaction of vehicle user convenience and effect to the load frequency control is evaluated through a simulation by using a typical two area interconnected power grid model and an automotive lithium-ion battery model.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2167993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062663","Electric vehicle;load frequency control;smart charging;smart grid;state-of-charge;vehicle-to-grid","Batteries;System-on-a-chip;Frequency control;Power grids;Vehicles;Power generation","","408","2","20","IEEE","28 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our system is easy to setup and recovers intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters as well as the transformation between cameras and range sensors within one minute. In contrast to existing calibration approaches, which often require user intervention, the proposed method is robust to varying imaging conditions, fully automatic, and easy to use since a single image and range scan proves sufficient for most calibration scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed checkerboard corner detector significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the proposed camera-to-range registration method is able to discover multiple solutions in the case of ambiguities.

Chunk-based resource allocation is an effective approach to reduce the complexity of resource allocation in OFDMA systems. In this paper, a chunk-based resource allocation scheme, i.e. joint chunk, power and bit allocation, is proposed and analyzed by maximizing the throughput under a total transmit power constraint. A scaling factor is introduced to achieve optimal allocation. Considering the digital nature of bits per symbol per subcarrier (bits/symbol/subcarrier), a digitization process is proposed to digitize the theoretically allocated bits/symbol/subcarrier to integer. System parameters, such as the power constraint, number of users, coherence bandwidth, number of subcarriers and number of chunks, are introduced and their impacts on the average throughput are studied. The performance of the dynamic power allocation scheme is compared with the fixed power allocation scheme. The numerical results show that the theoretical throughput of the fixed power allocation scheme is quite close to that of the dynamic power allocation scheme. However, when the digital nature of bits/symbol/subcarrier is considered, the average throughput of the dynamic power allocation outperforms the fixed power allocation scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2011.112811.110036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6094142","Resource allocation;orthogonal frequency division multiple Access (OFDMA);dynamic power allocation;digital nature of bits;multiuser diversity","Resource management;Bit error rate;Modulation;OFDM;Throughput;Bit rate;Downlink","","407","","13","IEEE","2 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Possible reasons for this might be that it is a natural extension of the well-known and intuitive distance between points and/or the fact that dH defines in certain cases a metric in the mathematical sense. In evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) the task is typically to compute the entire solution set-the so-called Pareto set-respectively its image, the Pareto front. Hence, dH should, at least at first sight, be a natural choice to measure the performance of the outcome set in particular since it is related to the terms spread and convergence as used in EMO literature. However, so far, dH does not find the general approval in the EMO community. The main reason for this is that dH penalizes single outliers of the candidate set which does not comply with the use of stochastic search algorithms such as evolutionary strategies. In this paper, we define a new performance indicator, Δp, which can be viewed as an “averaged Hausdorff distance” between the outcome set and the Pareto front and which is composed of (slight modifications of) the well-known indicators generational distance (GD) and inverted generational distance (IGD). We will discuss theoretical properties of Δp (as well as for GD and IGD) such as the metric properties and the compliance with state-of-theart multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), and will further on demonstrate by empirical results the potential of Δp as a new performance indicator for the evaluation of MOEAs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2011.2161872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151115","Averaged Hausdorff distance;generational distance;inverted generational distance;multiobjective optimization;performance indicator","Approximation methods;Measurement;Optimization;Convergence;Approximation algorithms;Delta modulation;Benchmark testing","","406","1","54","IEEE","10 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A solution to this problem is relevant for several tasks in multi-agent systems including motion coordination, clock synchronization, and cooperative estimation. In a linear consensus network, we allow for the presence of misbehaving agents, whose behavior deviate from the nominal consensus evolution. We model misbehaviors as unknown and unmeasurable inputs affecting the network, and we cast the misbehavior detection and identification problem into an unknown-input system theoretic framework. We consider two extreme cases of misbehaving agents, namely faulty (non-colluding) and malicious (Byzantine) agents. First, we characterize the set of inputs that allow misbehaving agents to affect the consensus network while remaining undetected and/or unidentified from certain observing agents. Second, we provide worst-case bounds for the number of concurrent faulty or malicious agents that can be detected and identified. Precisely, the consensus network needs to be 2k+1 (resp. k+1) connected for k malicious (resp. faulty) agents to be generically detectable and identifiable by every well behaving agent. Third, we quantify the effect of undetectable inputs on the final consensus value. Fourth, we design three algorithms to detect and identify misbehaving agents. The first and the second algorithm apply fault detection techniques, and affords complete detection and identification if global knowledge of the network is available to each agent, at a high computational cost. The third algorithm is designed to exploit the presence in the network of weakly interconnected subparts, and provides local detection and identification of misbehaving agents whose behavior deviates more than a threshold, which is quantified in terms of the interconnection structure.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2158130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5779706","Autonomous agents;consensus algorithms;distributed control;fault detection;intrusion detection;multi-agent systems;network topology;network theory (graphs);sensor networks","Resilience;Algorithm design and analysis;Fault detection;Trajectory;Knowledge engineering;Linear systems;Approximation algorithms","","405","","31","IEEE","31 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When applied on a single database, this process is known as deduplication. Increasingly, matched data are becoming important in many application areas, because they can contain information that is not available otherwise, or that is too costly to acquire. Removing duplicate records in a single database is a crucial step in the data cleaning process, because duplicates can severely influence the outcomes of any subsequent data processing or data mining. With the increasing size of today's databases, the complexity of the matching process becomes one of the major challenges for record linkage and deduplication. In recent years, various indexing techniques have been developed for record linkage and deduplication. They are aimed at reducing the number of record pairs to be compared in the matching process by removing obvious nonmatching pairs, while at the same time maintaining high matching quality. This paper presents a survey of 12 variations of 6 indexing techniques. Their complexity is analyzed, and their performance and scalability is evaluated within an experimental framework using both synthetic and real data sets.

How to reduce radiation dose while maintaining the diagnostic performance is a major challenge in the computed tomography (CT) field. Inspired by the compressive sensing theory, the sparse constraint in terms of total variation (TV) minimization has already led to promising results for low-dose CT reconstruction. Compared to the discrete gradient transform used in the TV method, dictionary learning is proven to be an effective way for sparse representation. On the other hand, it is important to consider the statistical property of projection data in the low-dose CT case. Recently, we have developed a dictionary learning based approach for low-dose X-ray CT. In this paper, we present this method in detail and evaluate it in experiments. In our method, the sparse constraint in terms of a redundant dictionary is incorporated into an objective function in a statistical iterative reconstruction framework. The dictionary can be either predetermined before an image reconstruction task or adaptively defined during the reconstruction process. An alternating minimization scheme is developed to minimize the objective function. Our approach is evaluated with low-dose X-ray projections collected in animal and human CT studies, and the improvement associated with dictionary learning is quantified relative to filtered backprojection and TV-based reconstructions. The results show that the proposed approach might produce better images with lower noise and more detailed structural features in our selected cases.

Popular dimensionality-reduction techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and their variants typically assume a Gaussian distribution. The quadratic maximum-likelihood classifier commonly employed for hyperspectral analysis also assumes single-Gaussian class-conditional distributions. Departing from this single-Gaussian assumption, a classification paradigm designed to exploit the rich statistical structure of the data is proposed. The proposed framework employs local Fisher's discriminant analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its multimodal structure, while a subsequent Gaussian mixture model or support vector machine provides effective classification of the reduced-dimension multimodal data. Experimental results on several different multiple-class hyperspectral-classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several traditional alternatives.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2165957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032745","Dimensionality reduction;Gaussian-mixture-model (GMM);hyperspectral data;local discriminant analysis;support vector machine","Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Hyperspectral imaging;Kernel;Covariance matrix;Maximum likelihood estimation","","401","1","34","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assuming that the macrocell base station (MBS) protects itself by pricing the interference from femtocell users, a Stackelberg game is formulated to study the joint utility maximization of the macrocell and femtocells subject to a maximum tolerable interference power constraint at the MBS. Two practical femtocell network models are investigated: sparsely deployed scenario for rural areas and densely deployed scenario for urban areas. For each scenario, two pricing schemes: uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing, are proposed. The Stackelberg equilibriums for the proposed games are characterized, and an effective distributed interference price bargaining algorithm with guaranteed convergence is proposed for the uniform-pricing case.

Mostly, optical wireless can provide much higher data rates. In this paper, we demonstrate a VLC system based on a white LED for indoor broadband wireless access. After investigating the nonlinear effects of the LED and the power amplifier, a data rate of 1 Gb/s has been achieved at the standard illuminance level, by using an optimized discrete multitone modulation technique and adaptive bit- and power-loading algorithms.

This large data set motivates a thorough statistical treatment of estimating guessing difficulty by sampling from a secret distribution. In place of previously used metrics such as Shannon entropy and guessing entropy, which cannot be estimated with any realistically sized sample, we develop partial guessing metrics including a new variant of guesswork parameterized by an attacker's desired success rate. Our new metric is comparatively easy to approximate and directly relevant for security engineering. By comparing password distributions with a uniform distribution which would provide equivalent security against different forms of guessing attack, we estimate that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security against an optimal offline dictionary attack. We find surprisingly little variation in guessing difficulty; every identifiable group of users generated a comparably weak password distribution. Security motivations such as the registration of a payment card have no greater impact than demographic factors such as age and nationality. Even proactive efforts to nudge users towards better password choices with graphical feedback make little difference. More surprisingly, even seemingly distant language communities choose the same weak passwords and an attacker never gains more than a factor of 2 efficiency gain by switching from the globally optimal dictionary to a population-specific lists.","2375-1207","978-0-7695-4681-0","10.1109/SP.2012.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6234435","computer security;authentication;statistics;information theory;data mining","Measurement;Dictionaries;Entropy;Privacy;Semantics;Cryptography","","394","4","50","IEEE","9 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a case study, we investigate the target-set selection problem for information delivery. In particular, we study how to select the target set with only k users, such that we can minimize the mobile data traffic over cellular networks. We propose three algorithms, called Greedy, Heuristic, and Random, for this problem and evaluate their performance through an extensive trace-driven simulation study. Our simulation results verify the efficiency of these algorithms for both synthetic and real-world mobility traces. For example, the Heuristic algorithm can offload mobile data traffic by up to 73.66 percent for a real-world mobility trace. Moreover, to investigate the feasibility of opportunistic communications for mobile phones, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype, called Opp-off, on Nokia N900 smartphones, which utilizes their Bluetooth interface for device/service discovery and content transfer.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2011.101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5765984","Mobile data offloading;target-set selection;opportunistic communications;mobile social networks;implementation;trace-driven simulation.","Mobile communication;Mobile computing;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Femtocells;Social network services;Mobile handsets;Computer science","","393","4","49","IEEE","12 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The highly creative and graceful use of languages like English and Tamil, by masters like Shakespeare and Avvaiyar, can certainly delight and inspire. But in practice, given cognitive constraints and the exigencies of daily life, most human utterances are far simpler and much more repetitive and predictable. In fact, these utterances can be very usefully modeled using modern statistical methods. This fact has led to the phenomenal success of statistical approaches to speech recognition, natural language translation, question-answering, and text mining and comprehension. We begin with the conjecture that most software is also natural, in the sense that it is created by humans at work, with all the attendant constraints and limitations - and thus, like natural language, it is also likely to be repetitive and predictable. We then proceed to ask whether a) code can be usefully modeled by statistical language models and b) such models can be leveraged to support software engineers. Using the widely adopted n-gram model, we provide empirical evidence supportive of a positive answer to both these questions. We show that code is also very repetitive, and in fact even more so than natural languages. As an example use of the model, we have developed a simple code completion engine for Java that, despite its simplicity, already improves Eclipse's built-in completion capability.

In this paper, we theoretically calculate the parameters A and B of Kane's direct and indirect BTBT models at different tunneling directions ([100], [110], and [111]) for Si, Ge and unstrained Si1-xGex. We highlight how the direct BTBT component becomes more important as the Ge mole fraction increases. The calculation of the band-to-band generation rate in the uniform electric field limit reveals that direct tunneling always dominates over indirect tunneling in Ge. The impact of the direct transition in Ge on the performance of two realistic tunnel field-effect transistor configurations is illustrated with TCAD simulations.

However, the depth data captured by Kinect over a certain distance is of extreme low quality. In this paper, we present a novel scanning system for capturing 3D full human body models by using multiple Kinects. To avoid the interference phenomena, we use two Kinects to capture the upper part and lower part of a human body respectively without overlapping region. A third Kinect is used to capture the middle part of the human body from the opposite direction. We propose a practical approach for registering the various body parts of different views under non–rigid deformation. First, a rough mesh template is constructed and used to deform successive frames pairwisely. Second, global alignment is performed to distribute errors in the deformation space, which can solve the loop closure problem efficiently. Misalignment caused by complex occlusion can also be handled reasonably by our global alignment algorithm. The experimental results have shown the efficiency and applicability of our system. Our system obtains impressive results in a few minutes with low price devices, thus is practically useful for generating personalized avatars for everyday users.

Momentous discoveries were made over the course of many decades of research [1], but the quest to attain full understanding of cellular mechanisms and how to manipulate them to improve health continues to the present day, with bigger budgets, more minds, and more sophisticated tools than ever before. One of the tools to which a great deal of the progress in cell biology can be attributed is light microscopy [2]. The field has come a long way since Antoni van Leeuwenhoeks first steps in the 1670s toward improving and exploiting microscopic imaging for studying life at the cellular level. Not only do biologists today have a plethora of different, complementary microscopic imaging techniques at their disposal that enable them to visualize phenomena even way below the classical diffraction limit of light, advanced microscope systems also allow them to easily acquire very large numbers of images within just a matter of hours. The abundance, heterogeneity, dimensionality, and complexity of the data generated in modern imaging experiments rule out manual image management, processing, and analysis. Consequently, computerized techniques for performing these tasks have become of key importance for further progress in cell biology [3][6]. A central problem in many studies, and often regarded as the cornerstone of image analysis, is image segmentation. Specifically, since cellular morphology is an important phenotypic feature that is indicative of the physiological state of a cell, and since the cell contour is often required for subsequent analysis of intracellular processes (zooming in to nanoscale), or of cell sociology (zooming out to millimeter scale), the problem of cell segmentation has received increasing attention in past years [7]. Here we reflect on how the field has evolved over the years and how past developments can be expected to extrapolate into the future.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2012.2204190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6279591","Intracellular processes","Biological cells;Microscopy;Data visualization;Diffraction;Medical image processing;Nanomedicine;Biomedical  image processing;Cellular biophysics","","387","6","16","IEEE","22 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The first part of the paper describes a technique for computing lumped parameters of the most common frequency-selective-surface elements. The L and C parameters representing a given frequency-selective-surface element are derived only one time, at normal incidence, and stored, so as to form a database. The second part of the paper deals with the derivation of simple relations allowing the generalization of the stored LC couples in the case where the frequency-selective surface is printed or embedded in arbitrarily thick dielectric slabs, when the incident angle is varied from normal incidence, or if a different periodicity with respect to the reference periodicity is adopted. The generalized lumped parameters are included in an equivalent transmission line for computing the response of generic frequency-selective-surface configurations with no additional computational effort.

To perform this task using ICPT systems, current solutions require an almost perfect alignment between coils in order to have optimal power transfer. This condition makes necessary a precise positioning maneuver from the driver or an electromechanic alignment system for the secondary winding, causing the process to be slow. This paper shows that it is possible to transfer rated power even with high misalignment if a suitable compensation topology is selected. The performance of the four basic compensation topologies is analyzed, and a series–parallel–series (SPS) topology is proposed, showing a suitable behavior for both the load and the power source.

In this paper, this technological gap is filled by the development of “electric springs.” The scientific principle, the operating modes, the limitations, and the practical realization of the electric springs are reported. It is discovered that such novel concept has huge potential in stabilizing future power systems with substantial penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources. This concept has been successfully demonstrated in a practical power system setup fed by an ac power source with a fluctuating wind energy source. The electric spring is found to be effective in regulating the mains voltage despite the fluctuation caused by the intermittent nature of wind power. Electric appliances with the electric springs embedded can be turned into a new generation of smart loads, which have their power demand following the power generation profile. It is envisaged that electric springs, when distributed over the power grid, will offer a new form of power system stability solution that is independent of information and communication technology.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2200701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6220904","Distributed power systems;smart loads;stability","Springs;Voltage control;Vectors;Power system stability;Capacitors;Boosting;Wind power generation","","382","2","29","IEEE","19 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Composed largely of a bilayer (double layer) of lipids just two molecules thick (about 5 nm), and behaving partly as a liquid and partly as a gel, the cell plasma membrane nonetheless separates and protects the cell from its surrounding environment very reliably and stably. Embedded within the lipid bilayer, also quite stably, are a number of different proteins, some of which act as channels and pumps, providing a pathway for transporting specific molecules across the membrane. Without these proteins, the membrane would be a largely impenetrable barrier. Electrically, the cell plasma membrane can be viewed as a thin insulating sheet surrounded on both sides by aqueous electrolyte solutions. When exposed to a sufficiently strong electric field, the membrane will undergo electrical breakdown, which renders it permeable to molecules that are otherwise unable to cross it. The process of rendering the membrane permeable is called membrane electroporation. Unlike solid insulators, in which an electrical breakdown generally causes permanent structural change, the membrane, with its lipids behaving as a two-dimensional liquid, can spontaneously return to its prebreakdown state. If the exposure is sufficiently short and the membrane recovery sufficiently rapid for the cell to remain viable, electroporation is termed reversible; otherwise, it is termed irreversible. Since its discovery [1]–[3], electroporation has steadily gained ground as a useful tool in various areas of medicine and biotechnology. Today, reversible electroporation is an established method for introducing chemotherapeutic drugs into tumor cells (electrochemotherapy) [4]. It also offers great promise as a technique for gene therapy without the risks caused by viral vectors (DNA electrotransfer) [5]. In clinical medicine, irreversible electroporation is being investigated as a method for tissue ablation (nonthermal electroablation) [6], whereas in biotechnology, it is useful for extraction of biomolecules [7] and for microbial deactivation, particularly in food preservation [8]. This article, the first in a series of three focusing on electroporation, describes the phenomenon at the molecular level of the lipid bilayer, and then proceeds to the cellular level, explaining how exposure of a cell as a whole to an external electric field results in an inducement of voltage on its plasma membrane, its electroporation, and transport thorough the electroporated membrane. The second article will review the most important and promising applications of electroporation, and the third article will focus on the hardware for electroporation (pulse generators and electrodes) and on the need for standards, safety, and certification.","1558-4402","","10.1109/MEI.2012.6268438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6268438","lipid bilayer;hydrophilic pores;cell plasma membrane;transmembrane voltage;membrane electroporation;transmembrane transport;membrane resealing","Biomembranes;Lipidomics;Electric fields;Voltage measurement;Mathematical model;Electric breakdown;Plasmas","","382","","68","IEEE","16 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Clustering is one of the primary tasks used in the pattern recognition and data mining communities to search VL databases (including VL images) in various applications, and so, clustering algorithms that scale well to VL data are important and useful. This paper compares the efficacy of three different implementations of techniques aimed to extend fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to VL data. Specifically, we compare methods that are based on 1) sampling followed by noniterative extension; 2) incremental techniques that make one sequential pass through subsets of the data; and 3) kernelized versions of FCM that provide approximations based on sampling, including three proposed algorithms. We use both loadable and VL datasets to conduct the numerical experiments that facilitate comparisons based on time and space complexity, speed, quality of approximations to batch FCM (for loadable data), and assessment of matches between partitions and ground truth. Empirical results show that random sampling plus extension FCM, bit-reduced FCM, and approximate kernel FCM are good choices to approximate FCM for VL data. We conclude by demonstrating the VL algorithms on a dataset with 5 billion objects and presenting a set of recommendations regarding the use of different VL FCM clustering schemes.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2201485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205366","Big data;fuzzy $c$-means (FCM);kernel methods;scalable clustering;very large (VL) data","Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Vectors;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation methods","","381","","53","IEEE","25 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been widely applied to signal processing, computer vision, and data mining. Traditional NMF solvers include the multiplicative update rule (MUR), the projected gradient method (PG), the projected nonnegative least squares (PNLS), and the active set method (AS). However, they suffer from one or some of the following three problems: slow convergence rate, numerical instability and nonconvergence. In this paper, we present a new efficient NeNMF solver to simultaneously overcome the aforementioned problems. It applies Nesterov's optimal gradient method to alternatively optimize one factor with another fixed. In particular, at each iteration round, the matrix factor is updated by using the PG method performed on a smartly chosen search point, where the step size is determined by the Lipschitz constant. Since NeNMF does not use the time consuming line search and converges optimally at rate in optimizing each matrix factor, it is superior to MUR and PG in terms of efficiency as well as approximation accuracy. Compared to PNLS and AS that suffer from numerical instability problem in the worst case, NeNMF overcomes this deficiency. In addition, NeNMF can be used to solve -norm, -norm and manifold regularized NMF with the optimal convergence rate. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the efficiency of NeNMF for NMF and its variants comparing to representative NMF solvers. Extensive experiments on document clustering suggest the effectiveness of NeNMF.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2190406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6166359"," $L_{1}$-norm;$L_{2}$-norm;manifold regularization;nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF);optimal gradient method","Gradient methods;Convergence;Matrix decomposition;Sparse matrices;Least squares approximation;Educational institutions","","381","","34","IEEE","8 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a technique called ε-dragging is introduced to force the regression targets of different classes moving along opposite directions such that the distances between classes can be enlarged. Then, the ε-draggings are integrated into the LSR model for multiclass classification. Our learning framework, referred to as discriminative LSR, has a compact model form, where there is no need to train two-class machines that are independent of each other. With its compact form, this model can be naturally extended for feature selection. This goal is achieved in terms of L2,1 norm of matrix, generating a sparse learning model for feature selection. The model for multiclass classification and its extension for feature selection are finally solved elegantly and efficiently.

BugLocator ranks all files based on the textual similarity between the initial bug report and the source code using a revised Vector Space Model (rVSM), taking into consideration information about similar bugs that have been fixed before. We perform large-scale experiments on four open source projects to localize more than 3,000 bugs. The results show that BugLocator can effectively locate the files where the bugs should be fixed.

However, to protect data privacy, sensitive cloud data have to be encrypted before outsourced to the commercial public cloud, which makes effective data utilization service a very challenging task. Although traditional searchable encryption techniques allow users to securely search over encrypted data through keywords, they support only Boolean search and are not yet sufficient to meet the effective data utilization need that is inherently demanded by large number of users and huge amount of data files in cloud. In this paper, we define and solve the problem of secure ranked keyword search over encrypted cloud data. Ranked search greatly enhances system usability by enabling search result relevance ranking instead of sending undifferentiated results, and further ensures the file retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we explore the statistical measure approach, i.e., relevance score, from information retrieval to build a secure searchable index, and develop a one-to-many order-preserving mapping technique to properly protect those sensitive score information. The resulting design is able to facilitate efficient server-side ranking without losing keyword privacy. Thorough analysis shows that our proposed solution enjoys “as-strong-as-possible” security guarantee compared to previous searchable encryption schemes, while correctly realizing the goal of ranked keyword search. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095524","Ranked search;searchable encryption;order-preserving mapping;confidential data;cloud computing.","Encryption;Servers;Indexes;Keyword search;Cloud computing","","374","2","34","IEEE","6 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This distinction from one-time coverage does not allow a straightforward application of most exploration techniques to the problem, though ideas from these methods can still be used. The aerial vehicle dynamic and endurance constraints add additional complexity to the autonomous control problem, whereas stochastic environments and vehicle failures introduce uncertainty. In this work, we investigate techniques for high-level control, that are scalable, reliable, efficient, and robust to problem dynamics. Next, we suggest a modification to the control policy to account for aircraft dynamic constraints. We also devise a health monitoring policy and a control policy modification to improve performance under endurance constraints.

In this study, we propose a static feature-based mechanism to provide a static analyst paradigm for detecting the Android malware. The mechanism considers the static information including permissions, deployment of components, Intent messages passing and API calls for characterizing the Android applications behavior. In order to recognize different intentions of Android malware, different kinds of clustering algorithms can be applied to enhance the malware modeling capability. Besides, we leverage the proposed mechanism and develop a system, called Droid Mat. First, the Droid Mat extracts the information (e.g., requested permissions, Intent messages passing, etc) from each application's manifest file, and regards components (Activity, Service, Receiver) as entry points drilling down for tracing API Calls related to permissions. Next, it applies K-means algorithm that enhances the malware modeling capability. The number of clusters are decided by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method on the low rank approximation. Finally, it uses kNN algorithm to classify the application as benign or malicious. The experiment result shows that the recall rate of our approach is better than one of well-known tool, Androguard, published in Black hat 2011, which focuses on Android malware analysis. In addition, Droid Mat is efficient since it takes only half of time than Androguard to predict 1738 apps as benign apps or Android malware.","","978-0-7695-4776-3","10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2012.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298136","Smartphone security;Android malware;static analysis;feature-based;anomaly detection","Malware;Androids;Humanoid robots;Smart phones;Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms","","372","3","37","IEEE","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since this new computing technology requires users to entrust their valuable data to cloud providers, there have been increasing security and privacy concerns on outsourced data. Several schemes employing attribute-based encryption (ABE) have been proposed for access control of outsourced data in cloud computing; however, most of them suffer from inflexibility in implementing complex access control policies. In order to realize scalable, flexible, and fine-grained access control of outsourced data in cloud computing, in this paper, we propose hierarchical attribute-set-based encryption (HASBE) by extending ciphertext-policy attribute-set-based encryption (ASBE) with a hierarchical structure of users. The proposed scheme not only achieves scalability due to its hierarchical structure, but also inherits flexibility and fine-grained access control in supporting compound attributes of ASBE. In addition, HASBE employs multiple value assignments for access expiration time to deal with user revocation more efficiently than existing schemes. We formally prove the security of HASBE based on security of the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme by Bethencourt  and analyze its performance and computational complexity. We implement our scheme and show that it is both efficient and flexible in dealing with access control for outsourced data in cloud computing with comprehensive experiments.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2011.2172209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6046132","Access control;cloud computing;data security","Access control;Cloud computing;Encryption;Educational institutions;Scalability","","372","6","21","IEEE","14 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to their large quantity and complex charging behavior, the impact of substantial PHEVs charging on the power grid needs to be investigated. Since the charging behavior of PHEVs in a certain regional transmission network or a local distribution network is determined by different uncertain factors, their overall charging demand tends to be uncertain and in this situation probabilistic power flow (PPF) can be applied to analyze the impact of PHEVs charging on the power grid. However, currently there is no suitable model of the overall charging demand of PHEVs available for PPF calculations. In this paper, a methodology of modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs is proposed. The proposed methodology establishes a single PHEV charging demand model, and then employs queuing theory to describe the behavior of multiple PHEVs. Moreover, two applications are given, i.e., modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs at an EV charging station and in a local residential community, respectively. Comparison between PPF calculations and Monte Carlo simulation are made on a modified IEEE 30-bus system integrated with the two demand models proposed.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2172643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6145673","Charging demand model;Cornish-Fisher expansion;cumulant method;plug-in hybrid electric vehicle;point estimate method;probabilistic power flow","Batteries;Communities;Queueing analysis;Probabilistic logic;Power grids;Energy consumption;Load modeling","","371","","37","IEEE","3 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A foot-mounted inertial measuring units (IMUs)-based position estimation method, is aided by the received signal strengths (RSSs) obtained from several active RFID tags placed at known locations in a building. In contrast to other authors that integrate IMUs and RSS with a loose Kalman filter (KF)-based coupling (by using the residuals of inertial- and RSS-calculated positions), we present a tight KF-based INS/RFID integration, using the residuals between the INS-predicted reader-to-tag ranges and the ranges derived from a generic RSS path-loss model. Our approach also includes other drift reduction methods such as zero velocity updates (ZUPTs) at foot stance detections, zero angular-rate updates (ZARUs) when the user is motionless, and heading corrections using magnetometers. A complementary extended Kalman filter (EKF), throughout its 15-element error state vector, compensates the position, velocity and attitude errors of the INS solution, as well as IMU biases. This methodology is valid for any kind of motion (forward, lateral or backward walk, at different speeds), and does not require an offline calibration for the user gait. The integrated INS $+$RFID methodology eliminates the typical drift of IMU-alone solutions (approximately 1% of the total traveled distance), resulting in typical positioning errors along the walking path (no matter its length) of approximately 1.5 m.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2011.2159317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5953513","Dead reckoning;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;position measurement;RFID tags","Estimation;Foot;Buildings;Position measurement;RFID tags","","371","4","33","IEEE","14 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To cope with the issue, in this paper, we present an effective pseudonym changing at social spots (PCS) strategy to achieve the provable location privacy. In particular, we first introduce the social spots where several vehicles may gather, e.g., a road intersection when the traffic light turns red or a free parking lot near a shopping mall. By taking the anonymity set size as the location privacy metric, we then develop two anonymity set analytic models to quantitatively investigate the location privacy that is achieved by the PCS strategy. In addition, we use game-theoretic techniques to prove the feasibility of the PCS strategy in practice. Extensive performance evaluations are conducted to demonstrate that better location privacy can be achieved when a vehicle changes its pseudonyms at some highly social spots and that the proposed PCS strategy can assist vehicles to intelligently change their pseudonyms at the right moment and place.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2011.2162864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5960806","Location privacy;security;social spots;vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)","Vehicles;Privacy;Roads;Safety;Authentication;Monitoring;Analytical models","","369","","31","IEEE","25 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reactive power is controlled through the inverter on the PV cells. The control signals are determined based on local instantaneous measurements of the real and reactive power at each node.

A common technique to smooth the objective function is to blur the image. However, blurring the image destroys image information, which can cause the target to be lost. To address this problem we introduce a method for building an image descriptor using distribution fields (DFs), a representation that allows smoothing the objective function without destroying information about pixel values. We present experimental evidence on the superiority of the width of the basin of attraction around the global optimum of DFs over other descriptors. DFs also allow the representation of uncertainty about the tracked object. This helps in disregarding outliers during tracking (like occlusions or small misalignments) without modeling them explicitly. Finally, this provides a convenient way to aggregate the observations of the object through time and maintain an updated model.

In this paper, we try to assess the degree to which current work in TEL recommender systems has achieved this, as well as outline areas in which further work is needed. First, we present a context framework that identifies relevant context dimensions for TEL applications. Then, we present an analysis of existing TEL recommender systems along these dimensions. Finally, based on our survey results, we outline topics on which further research is needed.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2012.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189308","Context awareness;Recommender systems;Electronic mail;Electronic learning;Collaboration;Predictive models;Artificial intelligence;system applications and experience;Adaptive and intelligent educational systems;personalized e-learning","Context awareness;Recommender systems;Electronic mail;Electronic learning;Collaboration;Predictive models;Artificial intelligence","","368","2","129","IEEE","24 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous approaches for this problem typically rely on hand-crafted features which are carefully designed based on prior knowledge. In contrast, we use raw-image-patches extracted from a set of unlabeled images to learn a dictionary in an unsupervised manner. We use soft-assignment coding with max pooling to obtain effective image representations for quality estimation. The proposed algorithm is very computationally appealing, using raw image patches as local descriptors and using soft-assignment for encoding. Furthermore, unlike previous methods, our unsupervised feature learning strategy enables our method to adapt to different domains.

The nodes interact with each other on a local level and diffuse information across the network to solve estimation and inference tasks in a distributed manner. In this work, we compare the mean-square performance of two main strategies for distributed estimation over networks: consensus strategies and diffusion strategies. The analysis in the paper confirms that under constant step-sizes, diffusion strategies allow information to diffuse more thoroughly through the network and this property has a favorable effect on the evolution of the network: diffusion networks are shown to converge faster and reach lower mean-square deviation than consensus networks, and their mean-square stability is insensitive to the choice of the combination weights. In contrast, and surprisingly, it is shown that consensus networks can become unstable even if all the individual nodes are stable and able to solve the estimation task on their own. When this occurs, cooperation over the network leads to a catastrophic failure of the estimation task. This phenomenon does not occur for diffusion networks: we show that stability of the individual nodes always ensures stability of the diffusion network irrespective of the combination topology.

However, this elasticity is only meaningful to the cloud users when the acquired Virtual Machines (VMs) can be provisioned in time and be ready to use within the user expectation. The long unexpected VM startup time could result in resource under-provisioning, which will inevitably hurt the application performance. A better understanding of the VM startup time is therefore needed to help cloud users to plan ahead and make in-time resource provisioning decisions. In this paper, we study the startup time of cloud VMs across three real-world cloud providers -- Amazon EC2, Windows Azure and Rackspace. We analyze the relationship between the VM startup time and different factors, such as time of the day, OS image size, instance type, data center location and the number of instances acquired at the same time. We also study the VM startup time of spot instances in EC2, which show a longer waiting time and greater variance compared to on-demand instances.","2159-6190","978-1-4673-2892-0","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253534","cloud computing;VM startup/acquisition/spinup time;performance study;spot instances","Linux;Availability;Time measurement;Servers;Asia;Cloud computing;Elasticity","","366","2","22","IEEE","2 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most previous studies have assumed a fixed charging location and fixed charging time during the off-peak hours for anticipating electric vehicle charging demand. Some other studies have based on limited charging scenarios at typical locations instead of a mathematical model. Therefore, from a distribution system perspective, electric vehicle charging demand is still unidentified quantity which may vary by space and time. In this context, this study proposes a mathematical model of electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station. The mathematical model is based on the fluid dynamic traffic model and the M/M/s queueing theory. Firstly, the arrival rate of discharged vehicles at a charging station is predicted by the fluid dynamic model. Then, charging demand is forecasted by the M/M/s queueing theory with the arrival rate of discharged vehicles. This mathematical model of charging demand may allow grid's distribution planners to anticipate a charging demand profile at a charging station. A numerical example shows that the proposed model is able to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of charging demand in a highway charging station.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2159278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959242","Charging demand;charging station;electric vehicle;energy management;modeling;planning;Poisson processes;power demand;power distribution planning;spatial and temporal model","Road transportation;Vehicles;Mathematical model;Queueing analysis;Numerical models;Batteries;Equations","","364","","37","IEEE","21 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such CSIT is usually obtained by feedback from the receivers, but the feedback is subject to delays. The usual approach is to use the fed back information to predict the current channel state and then apply a scheme designed assuming perfect CSIT. When the feedback delay is large compared to the channel coherence time, such a prediction approach completely fails to achieve any multiplexing gain. In this paper, we show that even in this case, the completely stale CSI is still very useful. More concretely, we show that in an MIMO broadcast channel with $K$ transmit antennas and $K$ receivers each with 1 receive antenna, ${{K}\over{1+{{1}\over{2}}+\ldots+{{1}\over{K}}}}(>1)$  degrees of freedom is achievable even when the fed back channel state is completely independent of the current channel state. Moreover, we establish that if all receivers have independent and identically distributed channels, then this is the optimal number of degrees of freedom achievable. In the optimal scheme, the transmitter uses the fed back CSI to learn the side information that the receivers receive from previous transmissions rather than to predict the current channel state. Our result can be viewed as the first example of feedback providing a degree-of-freedom gain in memoryless channels.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2012.2193116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177666","Feedback delay;interference alignment;multiple-antenna channels;network coding, output feedback;side information;vector Gaussian broadcast channels","Equations;Receiving antennas;Delay;Signal to noise ratio;Transmitting antennas","","360","3","24","IEEE","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed GCC scheme has a single-loop control of inverter output (voltage or current) and two parallel virtual impedance terms using additional measurements. The virtual impedance can be the equivalent internal impedance or external impedance (or both), depending on their control term and feedback variable selection. The internal impedance term is mainly responsible for providing desired damping to the filter circuit, and the external virtual impedance term can effectively adjust the converter system closed-loop output impedance. As each term in the GCC scheme can be controlled independently, the proposed GCC scheme has great flexibility and can easily realize and explain the performances of the traditional single- and multiloop control schemes and their different variations. Moreover, the GCC scheme provides a distinct physical meaning of each control term, which makes the control parameter tuning more straightforward and robust. Additionally, as shown in this paper, the proposed GCC scheme can tackle some traditionally challenging control objectives by avoiding the harmonics filtering or derivative terms. Experimental results from laboratory VSC prototypes are obtained to validate the proposed GCC scheme.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2011.2168427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021379","Active damping;generalized closed-loop control (GCC);LC filter;LCL filter;multiloop control;single-loop control;virtual impedance;voltage source converter (VSC)","Impedance;Active filters;Power harmonic filters;Power filters;Power conversion;Capacitors","","359","","34","IEEE","19 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These measures are then adjusted to account for visual perception, and then, the adjusted measures are combined via a weighted geometric mean. The resulting measure, i.e., S3 (spectral and spatial sharpness), yields a perceived sharpness map in which greater values denote perceptually sharper regions. This map can be collapsed into a single index, which quantifies the overall perceived sharpness of the whole image. We demonstrate the utility of the S3 measure for within-image and across-image sharpness prediction, no-reference image quality assessment of blurred images, and monotonic estimation of the standard deviation of the impulse response used in Gaussian blurring. We further evaluate the accuracy of S3 in local sharpness estimation by comparing S3 maps to sharpness maps generated by human subjects.

The IM is penalized by the cage loss, but it is less expensive and inherently safe in case of inverter unwilled turnoff due to natural de-excitation. The SPM motor has a simple construction and shorter end connections, but it is penalized by eddy-current loss at high speed, has a very limited transient overload power, and has a high uncontrolled generator voltage.

Many operating decisions are based on load forecasts, such as dispatch scheduling of generating capacity, reliability analysis, and maintenance planning for the generators. Overestimation of electricity demand will cause a conservative operation, which leads to the start-up of too many units or excessive energy purchase, thereby supplying an unnecessary level of reserve. On the other hand, underestimation may result in a risky operation, with insufficient preparation of spinning reserve, causing the system to operate in a vulnerable region to the disturbance. In this paper, semi-parametric additive models are proposed to estimate the relationships between demand and the driver variables. Specifically, the inputs for these models are calendar variables, lagged actual demand observations, and historical and forecast temperature traces for one or more sites in the target power system. In addition to point forecasts, prediction intervals are also estimated using a modified bootstrap method suitable for the complex seasonality seen in electricity demand data. The proposed methodology has been used to forecast the half-hourly electricity demand for up to seven days ahead for power systems in the Australian National Electricity Market. The performance of the methodology is validated via out-of-sample experiments with real data from the power system, as well as through on-site implementation by the system operator.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2162082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985500","Additive model;forecast distribution;short-term load forecasting;time series","Predictive models;Load modeling;Forecasting;Load forecasting;Electricity;Computational modeling;Input variables","","358","1","29","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes the block partitioning structure of the draft HEVC standard and presents the results of an analysis of coding efficiency and complexity. Of the many new technical aspects of HEVC, the block partitioning structure has been identified as representing one of the most significant changes relative to previous video coding standards. In contrast to the fixed size 16 × 16 macroblock structure of H.264/AVC, HEVC defines three different units according to their functionalities. The coding unit defines a region sharing the same prediction mode, e.g., intra and inter, and it is represented by the leaf node of a quadtree structure. The prediction unit defines a region sharing the same prediction information. The transform unit, specified by another quadtree, defines a region sharing the same transformation. This paper introduces technical details of the block partitioning structure of HEVC with an emphasis on the method of designing a consistent framework by combining the three different units together.

In particular, a quantized kernel least mean square (QKLMS) algorithm is developed, which is based on a simple online vector quantization method. The analytical study of the mean square convergence has been carried out. The energy conservation relation for QKLMS is established, and on this basis we arrive at a sufficient condition for mean square convergence, and a lower and upper bound on the theoretical value of the steady-state excess mean square error.

We present distributed receding horizon control algorithms and derive sufficient conditions that guarantee asymptotic stability, leader-follower string stability, and predecessor-follower string stability, following a step speed change in the platoon. Vehicles compute their own control in parallel, and receive communicated position and velocity error trajectories from their immediate predecessor. Leader-follower string stability requires additional communication from the lead car at each update, in the form of a position error trajectory. Predecessor-follower string stability, as we define it, implies leader-follower string stability. Predecessor-follower string stability requires stricter constraints in the local optimal control problems than the leader-follower formulation, but communication from the lead car is required only once at initialization. Provided an initially feasible solution can be found, subsequent feasibility of the algorithms are guaranteed at every update. The theory is generalized for nonlinear decoupled dynamics, and is thus applicable to fleets of planes, robots, or boats, in addition to cars. A simple seven-car simulation examines parametric tradeoffs that affect stability and string stability. Analysis on platoon formation, heterogeneity and size (length) is also considered, resulting in intuitive tradeoffs between lead car and following car control flexibility.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2159651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876300","Distributed control;intelligent vehicles;path planning","Trajectory;Vehicles;Asymptotic stability;Lead;Stability analysis;Optimal control;Vehicle dynamics","","356","1","24","IEEE","16 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By inclusion of the zero-sequence voltage, the sinusoidal-modulation reference is modified to 1) carry out the voltage-balancing task of the dc-link capacitors, with no additional control effort, 2) reduce the switching losses, and 3) reduce the low-frequency voltage oscillations of the neutral point. The proposed strategy is an alternative approach to the nearest three-vector (NTV) space-vector modulation (SVM) strategy and is obtained by the analysis of the NTV-SVM strategy and establishing a correlation between the NTV-SVM and the CB-PWM strategies. The salient features of the proposed scheme, as compared with the NTV-SVM strategy, are: 1) its reduced computational processing time which is attractive for digital implementation and 2) its reduced switching losses. Compared with the existing CB-PWM strategies, the proposed strategy offers 1) capability to balance the capacitor voltages and reduce the NP voltage oscillations and 2) reduced switching losses.

Therefore, in this paper, using parasitic elements to reduce mutual coupling is studied. By adding parasitic elements a double-coupling path is introduced and it can create a reverse coupling to reduce mutual coupling. As an example, a dual-slot-element antenna with parasitic monopoles for mobile terminals is described. The discussion on channel capacity shows that the antenna can be considered as a good candidate for MIMO systems. Furthermore, based on the study of current distributions, it is concluded that the technique is sensitive to relative positions between parasitic elements, and relative positions between active element and parasitic element.

Theoretical analysis is then presented to suggest a general design guideline for choosing values of grid- and converter-side inductors, so that optimum damping can be naturally achieved by solely using converter current control, doing away with active damping, passive damping, or complex state observer. In cases where the design criterion is not fulfilled, the damping information contained in the converter current is extracted by a second-order notch filter, and then processed by a compensation gain to tune the system damping factor. The proposed compensation strategy requires no additional hardware and it will not cause an overmodulation problem due to its free of fundamental component.

This paper focuses on the distribution system harmonic control through the DG–grid interfacing converters. Two alternative DG systems, namely, current-controlled DG and voltage-controlled DG, are considered. While most of the previous works on harmonic compensation are based on the current-controlled method, a novel harmonic control scheme using a voltage-controlled method is developed in this paper. The voltage-controlled method is more flexible and has similar compensation performance compared to the conventional current-controlled method. In addition, by avoiding the implementation of a harmonic current tracking loop, the proposed voltage-based method can be seamlessly incorporated into a voltage-controlled DG unit, which is important to provide direct voltage and frequency support in a microgrid. Moreover, the possible harmonic circulating current among multiple DG systems is also investigated in this paper.

By introducing a tractable model, we derive the success probability for each tier under different spectrum allocation and femtocell access policies. In particular, we consider joint subchannel allocation, in which the whole spectrum is shared by both tiers, as well as disjoint subchannel allocation, whereby disjoint sets of subchannels are assigned to both tiers. We formulate the throughput maximization problem subject to quality of service constraints in terms of success probabilities and per-tier minimum rates, and provide insights into the optimal spectrum allocation. Our results indicate that with closed access femtocells, the optimized joint and disjoint subchannel allocations provide the highest throughput among all schemes in sparse and dense femtocell networks, respectively.

This paper has a twofold contribution. First, we propose a dual-stage energy harvesting circuit composed of a seven-stage and ten-stage design, the former being more receptive in the low input power regions, while the latter is more suitable for higher power range. Each stage here is a modified voltage multiplier, arranged in series and our design provides guidelines on component choice and precise selection of the crossover operational point for these two stages between the high (20 dBm) and low power (-20 dBm) extremities. Second, we fabricate our design on a printed circuit board to demonstrate how such a circuit can run a commercial Mica2 sensor mote, with accompanying simulations on both ideal and non-ideal conditions for identifying the upper bound on achievable efficiency. With a simple yet optimal dual-stage design, experiments and characterization plots reveal approximately 100% improvement over other existing designs in the power range of -20 to 7 dBm.","2156-3365","","10.1109/JETCAS.2012.2187106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6159063","Optimization;power efficiency;radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting circuit;Schottky diode;sensor;voltage multiplier;915 MHz","Energy harvesting;Radio frequency;Schottky diodes;Impedance;Optimization;Antennas;Wireless sensor networks","","347","4","20","IEEE","28 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fog fades the colors and reduces the contrasts in the scene with respect to their distances from the driver. Various camera-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can be improved if efficient algorithms are designed for visibility enhancement in road images. The visibility enhancement algorithm proposed in [1] is not optimized for road images. In this paper, we reformulate the problem as the inference of the local atmospheric veil from constraints. The algorithm in [1] thus becomes a particular case. From this new derivation, we propose to better handle road images by introducing an extra constraint taking into account that a large part of the image can be assumed to be a planar road. The advantages of the proposed local algorithm are the speed, the possibility to handle both color and gray-level images, and the small number of parameters. A new scheme is proposed for rating visibility enhancement algorithms based on the addition of several types of generated fog on synthetic and camera images. A comparative study and quantitative evaluation with other state-of-the-art algorithms is thus proposed. This evaluation demonstrates that the new algorithm produces better results with homogeneous fog and that it is able to deal better with the presence of heterogeneous fog. Finally, we also propose a model allowing to evaluate the potential safety benefit of an ADAS based on the display of defogged images.","1941-1197","","10.1109/MITS.2012.2189969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6190796","","Road vehicles;Hazards;Road accidents;Inference algorithms;Road safety;Vehicles;Automotive engineering;Terrestrial atmosphere;Atmospheric measurements","","345","1","29","IEEE","26 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Our preliminary simulation results show that optimal task partitioning algorithms significantly affect response time with heterogeneous latencies and compute powers. Motivated by these results, we design, implement, and validate the basic functionalities of MOCHA as a proof-of-concept, and develop algorithms that minimize the overall response time for face recognition.

In order to realize satisfied power sharing without the communication between DG units, the voltage droop control and its different variations have been reported in the literature. However, in a low-voltage microgrid, due to the effects of nontrivial feeder impedance, the conventional droop control is subject to the real and reactive power coupling and steady-state reactive power sharing errors. Furthermore, complex microgrid configurations (looped or mesh networks) often make the reactive power sharing more challenging. To improve the reactive power sharing accuracy, this paper proposes an enhanced control strategy that estimates the reactive power control error through injecting small real power disturbances, which is activated by the low-bandwidth synchronization signals from the central controller.

A unified objective function is then proposed to globally align the local models from all the data points so that an optimal ranking score can be assigned to each data point.

Although a significant amount of research has been done on behavioral modalities, less explored characteristics include the physiological signals. This work brings to the table the ECG signal and presents a thorough analysis of its psychological properties. The fact that this signal has been established as a biometric characteristic calls for subject-dependent emotion recognizers that capture the instantaneous variability of the signal from its homeostatic baseline. A solution based on the empirical mode decomposition is proposed for the detection of dynamically evolving emotion patterns on ECG. Classification features are based on the instantaneous frequency (Hilbert-Huang transform) and the local oscillation within every mode. Two experimental setups are presented for the elicitation of active arousal and passive arousal/valence. The results support the expectations for subject specificity, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of determining valence out of the ECG morphology (up to 89 percent for 44 subjects). In addition, this work differentiates for the first time between active and passive arousal, and advocates that there are higher chances of ECG reactivity to emotion when the induction method is active for the subject.","1949-3045","","10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999653","Electrocardiogram;emotion recognition;affective computing;arousal;valence;active stress;passive stress;bivariate empirical mode decomposition;intrinsic mode function;instantaneous frequency;oscillation.","Electrocardiography;Physiology;Muscles;Emotion recognition;Heart rate variability;Stress","","341","","49","IEEE","25 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although a PMSG wind turbine with two back-to-back voltage source IGBT converters is considered more efficient, it has not been widely adopted by the wind power industry. This paper investigates both the conventional and a novel vector control mechanism for a PMSG wind turbine that has two side-by-side voltage source pulsewidth modulation converters. The proposed approach is based on a direct-current vector control mechanism for control of both machine- and grid-side converters of a PMSG wind turbine. Then, an optimal control strategy is developed for integrated control of PMSG maximum power extraction, reactive power, and grid voltage support controls. A transient system simulation using SimPowerSystem is built to investigate the performance of the conventional and proposed control techniques for the PMSG wind turbine under steady and gusty wind conditions.

Based on an improved and unified statistical model characterizing the artifacts that appear in the presence of both A-DJPG or NA-DJPG, the proposed algorithm automatically computes a likelihood map indicating the probability for each 8 × 8 discrete cosine transform block of being doubly compressed. The validity of the proposed approach has been assessed by evaluating the performance of a detector based on thresholding the likelihood map, considering different forensic scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also confirmed by tests carried on realistic tampered images.

Specifically we address the question of whether local feedback is sufficient to maintain coherence in large-scale networks subject to stochastic disturbances. We define macroscopic performance measures which are global quantities that capture the notion of coherence; a notion of global order that quantifies how closely the formation resembles a solid object. We consider how these measures scale asymptotically with network size in the topologies of regular lattices in 1, 2, and higher dimensions, with vehicular platoons corresponding to the 1-D case. A common phenomenon appears where a higher spatial dimension implies a more favorable scaling of coherence measures, with a dimensions of 3 being necessary to achieve coherence in consensus and vehicular formations under certain conditions. In particular, we show that it is impossible to have large coherent 1-D vehicular platoons with only local feedback. We analyze these effects in terms of the underlying energetic modes of motion, showing that they take the form of large temporal and spatial scales resulting in an accordion-like motion of formations. A conclusion can be drawn that in low spatial dimensions, local feedback is unable to regulate large-scale disturbances, but it can in higher spatial dimensions. This phenomenon is distinct from, and unrelated to string instability issues which are commonly encountered in control problems for automated highways.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2012.2202052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209387","Vehicular formation","Convolution;Vehicles;Coherence;Heuristic algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Standards;Measurement uncertainty","","339","","23","IEEE","31 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed neighborhood based differential evolution, the mutation is performed within each Euclidean neighborhood. The neighborhood mutation is able to maintain the multiple optima found during the evolution and evolve toward the respective global/local optimum. To test the performance of the proposed neighborhood mutation DE, a total of 29 problem instances are used. The proposed algorithms are compared with a number of state-of-the-art multimodal optimization approaches and the experimental results suggest that although the idea of neighborhood mutation is simple, it is able to provide better and more consistent performance over the state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms.

In order to address this new problem and further achieve a secure and dependable cloud storage service, we propose in this paper a flexible distributed storage integrity auditing mechanism, utilizing the homomorphic token and distributed erasure-coded data. The proposed design allows users to audit the cloud storage with very lightweight communication and computation cost. The auditing result not only ensures strong cloud storage correctness guarantee, but also simultaneously achieves fast data error localization, i.e., the identification of misbehaving server. Considering the cloud data are dynamic in nature, the proposed design further supports secure and efficient dynamic operations on outsourced data, including block modification, deletion, and append.

Thus an accurate LLC converter model is desired. In this paper, a generalized mode analysis is presented that provides highly accurate prediction on resonant current and voltage behavior and dc gain characteristic. Also, because operation modes are affected by load, frequency, and gain conditions, the boundaries and distribution of modes are discussed and illustrated. Based on the mode analysis, an approximation method is developed to estimate the peak gain point, which is useful in LLC design. This approximation demonstrates high accuracy within the simulation results.

One of the main technical challenges of an MMC is to eliminate/minimize the circulating currents of converter arms while the capacitor voltages are maintained balanced. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) strategy that takes the advantage of a cost function minimization technique to eliminate the circulating currents and carry out the voltage balancing task of an MMC-based back-to-back HVDC system. A discrete-time mathematical model of the system is derived and a predictive model corresponding to the discrete-time model is developed. The predictive model is used to select the best switching states of each MMC unit based on evaluation and minimization a defined cost function associated with the control objectives of MMC units and the overall HVDC system. The proposed predictive control strategy: 1) enables control of real and reactive power of the HVDC system; 2) achieves capacitor voltage balancing of the MMC units; and 3) mitigates the circulating currents of the MMC units. Performance of the proposed MPC-based strategy for a five-level back-to-back MMC-HVDC is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The reported study results demonstrate a satisfactory response of the MMC-HVDC station operating based on the proposed MPC strategy, under various conditions.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2012.2191577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6192340","Modular multilevel converter (MMC);predictive control;capacitor voltage balancing;circulating current control;high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission","HVDC transmission;Switches;Capacitors;Voltage control;Mathematical model;Cost function","","335","2","37","IEEE","30 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These applications desire status updates at the recipients to be as timely as possible; however, this is typically constrained by limited network resources. We employ a time-averaged age metric for characterizing performance of such status update systems. We use system abstractions consisting of a source, a service facility and monitors, with the model of the service facility (physical constraints) a given. While prior work examined first-come-first-served (FCFS) queues, this paper looks at the queue discipline of last-come-first-served (LCFS). We explore LCFS systems with and without the ability to preempt the packet currently in service. For each we derive a general expression for system age and solve for the average age a Poisson source can achieve given memoryless service. Specifically, when preemption is allowed, we evaluate how the source would share the service facility with other independent Poisson sources.","","978-1-4673-3140-1","10.1109/CISS.2012.6310931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310931","","Monitoring;Servers;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Equations;Mathematical model;Real-time systems","","333","","11","IEEE","24 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PEVs are mobile and distributed devices with deferrable options for the supply/utilization of energy at various times and locations. The increased utilization of PEVs, which consume electricity rather than fossil fuel for driving, offers unique economic and environmental opportunities, and brings out new challenges to electric power system operation and planning. The storage capability of PEVs could help power systems mitigate the variability of renewable energy sources and reduce grid operation costs. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables PEVs to have bi-directional power flows once they are connected to the grid, i.e., they can either inject power to, and draw power from, the grid which adds further complexity to power system operations. PEVs signify customers' random behavior when considering their driving patterns, locational energy requirements, topological grid interconnections, and other constraints imposed by the consumers. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for analyzing the impact of PEVs on the grid operation cost and hourly wind energy dispatch.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2186642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218736","Load aggregation;plug-in electric vehicles;renewable energy sources;stochastic security-constrained unit commitment;V2G","Power systems;Batteries;Discharges;System-on-a-chip;Wind forecasting;Wind power generation;Stochastic processes","","332","","27","IEEE","15 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Named “SParse-representation-based SpatioTemporal reflectance Fusion Model” (SPSTFM), the model has been developed for predicting HSR surface reflectances through data blending with LSR scenes. Remarkably, this model forms a unified framework for fusing remote sensing images with temporal reflectance changes, phenology change (e.g., seasonal change of vegetation), or type change (e.g., conversion of farmland to built-up area), by establishing correspondences between structures within HSR images of given areas and their corresponding LSR images. Such corresponding relationship is achieved by means of the sparse representation, specifically by jointly training two dictionaries generated from HSR and LSR difference image patches and sparse coding at the reconstruction stage.

Clustering provides an effective way to prolong the lifetime of WSNs. Current clustering approaches often use two methods: selecting cluster heads with more residual energy, and rotating cluster heads periodically, to distribute the energy consumption among nodes in each cluster and extend the network lifetime. However, most of the previous algorithms have not considered the expected residual energy, which is the predicated remaining energy for being selected as a cluster head and running a round. In this paper, a fuzzy-logic-based clustering approach with an extension to the energy predication has been proposed to prolong the lifetime of WSNs by evenly distributing the workload. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is more efficient than other distributed algorithms. It is believed that the technique presented in this paper could be further applied to large-scale wireless sensor networks.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2012.2204737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6217269","Cluster head selection;energy predication;fuzzy reasoning;wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks;Base stations;Clustering algorithms;Energy consumption;Steady-state;Input variables;Pragmatics","","330","","18","IEEE","13 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose Cache-Conscious Wave front Scheduling (CCWS), an adaptive hardware mechanism that makes use of a novel intra-wave front locality detector to capture locality that is lost by other schedulers due to excessive contention for cache capacity. In contrast to improvements in the replacement policy that can better tolerate difficult access patterns, CCWS shapes the access pattern to avoid thrashing the shared L1. We show that CCWS can outperform any replacement scheme by evaluating against the Belady-optimal policy. Our evaluation demonstrates that cache efficiency and preservation of intra-wave front locality become more important as GPU computing expands beyond use in high performance computing. At an estimated cost of 0.17% total chip area, CCWS reduces the number of threads actively issued on a core when appropriate. This leads to an average 25% fewer L1 data cache misses which results in a harmonic mean 24% performance improvement over previously proposed scheduling policies across a diverse selection of cache-sensitive workloads.","2379-3155","978-1-4673-4819-5","10.1109/MICRO.2012.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6493609","","Benchmark testing;Instruction sets;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Limiting;Registers;Processor scheduling","","328","15","39","IEEE","4 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their update rule combines a consensus step (where each sensor updates the state by weight averaging it with its neighbors' states) and an innovation step (where each sensor processes its local current observation). This makes the three algorithms of the consensus + innovations type, very different from traditional consensus. This paper proves consistency (all sensors reach consensus almost surely and converge to the true parameter value), efficiency, and asymptotic unbiasedness. For LU and NU, it proves asymptotic normality and provides convergence rate guarantees. The three algorithms are characterized by appropriately chosen decaying weight sequences.

We formulate the resource allocation problem for joint BS zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) transmission as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, the limited backhaul capacity, and the minimum required data rate. We transform the considered problem in fractional form into an equivalent optimization problem in subtractive form, which enables the derivation of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, a low-complexity suboptimal semi-orthogonal user selection policy is computed. Besides, by using the concept of perturbation function, we show that in the considered systems under some general conditions, the duality gap with respect to the power optimization variables is zero despite the non-convexity of the primal problem. Thus, dual decomposition can be used in each iteration to derive an efficient closed-form power allocation solution for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bit/Joule delivered to the users). Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithm converges in a small number of iterations, and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, network capacity, and backhaul capacity: (1) In the low transmit power regime, an algorithm which achieves the maximum spectral efficiency may also achieve the maximum energy efficiency; (2) a high spectral efficiency does not necessarily result in a high energy efficiency; (3) spectral efficiency is always limited by the backhaul capacity; (4) energy efficiency increases with the backhaul capacity only until the maximum energy efficiency is achieved.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.083112.111951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6294504","Energy efficiency;green communication;network MIMO;limited backhaul;non-convex optimization;resource allocation","Resource management;Optimization;Mobile communication;Interference;Topology;Power demand;Vectors","","327","","38","IEEE","4 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing simple graph-based transductive learning methods only model the pairwise relationship of images, however, and they are sensitive to the radius parameter used in similarity calculation. Hypergraph learning has been investigated to solve both difficulties. It models the high-order relationship of samples by using a hyperedge to link multiple samples. Nevertheless, the existing hypergraph learning methods face two problems, i.e., how to generate hyperedges and how to handle a large set of hyperedges. This paper proposes an adaptive hypergraph learning method for transductive image classification. In our method, we generate hyperedges by linking images and their nearest neighbors. By varying the size of the neighborhood, we are able to generate a set of hyperedges for each image and its visual neighbors. Our method simultaneously learns the labels of unlabeled images and the weights of hyperedges. In this way, we can automatically modulate the effects of different hyperedges. Thorough empirical studies show the effectiveness of our approach when compared with representative baselines.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2190083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165360","Classification;hypergraph;transductive learning","Learning systems;Image classification;Training;Educational institutions;Manifolds;Support vector machines;Computer science","","327","","49","IEEE","6 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a new topology with a reversing-voltage component is proposed to improve the multilevel performance by compensating the disadvantages mentioned. This topology requires fewer components compared to existing inverters (particularly in higher levels) and requires fewer carrier signals and gate drives. Therefore, the overall cost and complexity are greatly reduced particularly for higher output voltage levels.

One major issue that could strongly impede the progress of such efforts is the lack of understanding of the mathematical properties of the SSIM measure. For example, some highly desirable properties such as convexity and triangular inequality that are possessed by the mean squared error may not hold. In this paper, we first construct a series of normalized and generalized (vector-valued) metrics based on the important ingredients of SSIM. We then show that such modified measures are valid distance metrics and have many useful properties, among which the most significant ones include quasi-convexity, a region of convexity around the minimizer, and distance preservation under orthogonal or unitary transformations.

By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead.

If an ac–dc LED driver with power factor correction (PFC) control is allowed to output a pulsating current for driving the LEDs, the electrolytic capacitor will no longer be required. However, this pulsating current will introduce light flicker that varies at twice the power line frequency. In this paper, a configuration of flicker-free electrolytic capacitor-less single-phase ac–dc driver for LED lighting is proposed. The configuration comprises an electrolytic capacitor-less PFC converter and a bidirectional converter, which serves to absorb the ac component of the pulsating current of the PFC converter, leaving only a dc component to drive the LEDs. The output filter capacitor of the bidirectional converter is intentionally designed to have a large voltage ripple, thus its capacitance can be greatly reduced. Consequently, film capacitors can be used instead of electrolytic capacitors, leading to the realization of a flicker-free ac–dc LED driver that has a long lifetime. The proposed solution is generally applicable to all single-phase PFC converters. A prototype with 48-V, 0.7-A output is constructed and tested.

Furthermore, capacitive ECG sensing is a simple technique that avoids direct contact with the skin and provides maximum convenience to the user. In our work, small capacitive electrodes were integrated into a cotton T-shirt together with a signal processing and transmitting board on a two-layer standard printed circuit board design technology. The entire system has small size, is thin, and has low power consumption compared to recent ECG monitoring systems. In addition, appropriate signal conditioning and processing were implemented to remove motion artifacts. The acquired ECG signals are comparable to ones obtained using conventional glued-on electrodes, and are easily read and interpreted by a cardiologist.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2012.6122530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122530","","Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Wireless communication;Medical services;Wireless sensor networks;Wearable computers;Biomedical monitoring","","322","1","14","IEEE","5 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Using variational inequalities, it is shown that the proposed game possesses a socially optimal Stackelberg equilibrium in which the grid optimizes its price while the PEVGs choose their equilibrium strategies.

To make exploit generation possible at the binary-level, Mayhem addresses two major technical challenges: actively managing execution paths without exhausting memory, and reasoning about symbolic memory indices, where a load or a store address depends on user input. To this end, we propose two novel techniques: 1) hybrid symbolic execution for combining online and offline (concolic) execution to maximize the benefits of both techniques, and 2) index-based memory modeling, a technique that allows Mayhem to efficiently reason about symbolic memory at the binary level.

In order to analyse the new relay selection policy in terms of outage probability and diversity gain, a theoretical framework that models the evolution of the relay buffers as a Markov chain (MC) is introduced. The construction of the state transition matrix and the related steady state of the MC are studied and their impact on the derivation of the outage probability is investigated.

This paper proposes a novel multidevice interleaved boost converter (MDIBC) that interfaces the fuel cell with the powertrain of hybrid electric vehicles. In this research, a multidevice structure with interleaved control is proposed to reduce the input current ripples, the output voltage ripples, and the size of passive components with high efficiency compared with the other topologies. In addition, low EMI and low stress in the switches are expected. The proposed dc/dc converter is compared to other converter topologies such as conventional boost converter (BC), multidevice boost converter (MDBC), and two-phase interleaved boost converter (IBC) to verify its dynamic performance. Furthermore, a generalized small-signal model is derived for these dc/dc converters, which has not been previously discussed. A digital dual-loop control is designed to achieve the proper regulator for the converters with fast transient response. The dc/dc converter topologies and their controller are designed and investigated by using MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, the proposed converter (MDIBC) is experimentally validated with results obtained from a 30-kW prototype that has been built and tested in our laboratory based on TMS320F2808 DSP.

There are large sets of possible optimization configurations that can be applied, and many applications have multiple kernels. Each kernel may require a specific configuration to achieve the best performance, and moving an application to new hardware often requires a new optimization configuration for each kernel. In this work, we apply optimizations to GPU code using HMPP, a high-level directive-based language and source-to-source compiler that can generate CUDA / OpenCL code. However, programming with high-level languages may mean a loss of performance compared to using low-level languages. Our work shows that it is possible to improve the performance of a high-level language by using auto-tuning. We perform auto-tuning on a large optimization space on GPU kernels, focusing on loop permutation, loop unrolling, tiling, and specifying which loop(s) to parallelize, and show results on convolution kernels, codes in the PolyBench suite, and an implementation of belief propagation for stereo vision. The results show that our auto-tuned HMPP-generated implementations are significantly faster than the default HMPP implementation and can meet or exceed the performance of manually coded CUDA / OpenCL implementations.","","978-1-4673-2633-9","10.1109/InPar.2012.6339595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6339595","Auto-tuning;GPU;CUDA;OpenCL;Optimization;Belief Propagation","Graphics processing unit;Abstracts;Programming;Nickel;Tiles;Benchmark testing","","316","1","38","IEEE","25 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To compensate for the spatial nonuniformity and nonideal response of the memristor bridge synapse, a modified chip-in-the-loop learning scheme suitable for the proposed neural network architecture is also proposed. In the proposed method, the initial learning is conducted in software, and the behavior of the software-trained network is learned by the hardware network by learning each of the single-layered neurons of the network independently. The forward calculation of the single-layered neuron learning is implemented on circuit hardware, and followed by a weight updating phase assisted by a host computer. Unlike conventional chip-in-the-loop learning, the need for the readout of synaptic weights for calculating weight updates in each epoch is eliminated by virtue of the memristor bridge synapse and the proposed learning scheme.

To this end, we introduce a “registration” algorithm that generates highly inaccurate image transformations, yet performs extremely well in terms of the surrogate measures. Of the tested criteria, only overlap scores of localized anatomical regions reliably distinguish reasonable from inaccurate registrations, whereas image similarity and tissue overlap do not. We conclude that tissue overlap and image similarity, whether used alone or together, do not provide valid evidence for accurate registrations and should thus not be reported or accepted as such.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2011.2163944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5977031","Nonrigid image registration;registration accuracy;unreliable surrogates;validation","Accuracy;Image registration;Biomedical imaging;Pixel;Correlation;Computer science;Mutual information","Algorithms;Biomarkers;Brain;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","315","","33","IEEE","8 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the concept of deploying femtocells over macrocell has recently attracted growing interests in academia, industry, and standardization forums. Various technical challenges towards mass deployment of femtocells have been addressed in recent literature. Interference mitigation between neighboring femtocells and between the femtocell and macrocell is considered to be one of the major challenges in femtocell networks because femtocells share the same licensed frequency spectrum with macrocell. Further, the conventional radio resource management techniques for hierarchical cellular system is not suitable for femtocell networks since the positions of the femtocells are random depending on the users' service requirement. In this article, we provide a survey of the different state-of-the-art approaches for interference and resource management in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based femtocell networks. A qualitative comparison among the different approaches is provided.

The jumping parameters are modeled as a continuous-time discrete-state Markov chain. Based on a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the generalized Itô's formula, mathematical induction, and stochastic analysis theory, a linear matrix inequality approach is developed to derive some novel sufficient conditions that guarantee the exponential stability in the mean square of the equilibrium point. At the same time, we also investigate the robustly exponential stability in the mean square of the corresponding system with unknown parameters. It should be mentioned that our stability results are delay-dependent, which depend on not only the upper bounds of time delays but also their lower bounds. Moreover, the derivatives of time delays are not necessarily zero or smaller than one since several free matrices are introduced in our results. Consequently, the results obtained in this paper are not only less conservative but also generalize and improve many earlier results.

To answer these questions, we: (1) propose novel algorithmic improvements to GenProg that allow it to scale to large programs and find repairs 68% more often, (2) exploit GenProg's inherent parallelism using cloud computing resources to provide grounded, human-competitive cost measurements, and (3) generate a large, indicative benchmark set to use for systematic evaluations. We evaluate GenProg on 105 defects from 8 open-source programs totaling 5.1 million lines of code and involving 10,193 test cases. GenProg automatically repairs 55 of those 105 defects. To our knowledge, this evaluation is the largest available of its kind, and is often two orders of magnitude larger than previous work in terms of code or test suite size or defect count.

The most recent source of soil moisture is the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. A thorough validation must be conducted to insure product quality that will, in turn, support the widespread utilization of the data. This is especially important since SMOS utilizes a new sensor technology and is the first passive L-band system in routine operation. In this paper, we contribute to the validation of SMOS using a set of four in situ soil moisture networks located in the U.S. These ground-based observations are combined with retrievals based on another satellite sensor, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). The watershed sites are highly reliable and address scaling with replicate sampling. Results of the validation analysis indicate that the SMOS soil moisture estimates are approaching the level of performance anticipated, based on comparisons with the in situ data and AMSR-E retrievals. The overall root-mean-square error of the SMOS soil moisture estimates is 0.043 m3/m3 for the watershed networks (ascending). There are bias issues at some sites that need to be addressed, as well as some outlier responses. Additional statistical metrics were also considered. Analyses indicated that active or recent rainfall can contribute to interpretation problems when assessing algorithm performance, which is related to the contributing depth of the satellite sensor. Using a precipitation flag can improve the performance. An investigation of the vegetation optical depth (tau) retrievals provided by the SMOS algorithm indicated that, for the watershed sites, these are not a reliable source of information about the vegetation canopy. The SMOS algorithms will continue to be refined as feedback from validation is evaluated, and it is expected that the SMOS estimates will improve.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2168533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058645","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E);passive microwave;Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS);soil moisture;validation","Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Accuracy;Microwave radiometry;SMOS mission","","312","","30","IEEE","21 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Intensive training of neurally impaired subjects, with quantifiable outcomes, is the eventual goal of these robot exoskeletons. Conventional arm exoskeletons for rehabilitation are bulky and heavy. In recent years, the authors have proposed to make lightweight exoskeletons for rehabilitation by replacing the rigid links of the exoskeleton with lightweight cuffs fixed to the moving limb segments of the human arm. Cables are routed through these cuffs, which are driven by motors, to move the limb segments relative to each other. However, a scientific limitation of a cable-driven system is that each cable can only pull but not push. This paper is the first to demonstrate via experiments with cable-driven arm exoskeleton (CAREX) that it is possible to achieve desired forces on the hand, i.e., both pull and push, in any direction as required in neural training. In this research, an anthropomorphic arm was used to bench test the design and control concepts proposed in CAREX. As described in this paper, CAREX was attached to the limb segments of a five degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic arm instrumented with joint sensors. The cuffs of CAREX were designed to have adjustable cable routing points to optimize the “tensioned” workspace of the anthropomorphic arm. Simulation results of force field for training and rehabilitation of the arm are first presented. Experiments are conducted to show the performance of a CAREX force field controller when human subjects pull the end-effector of the anthropomorphic arm to travel on prescribed paths. The human-exoskeleton interface is also presented at the end of this paper to demonstrate the feasibility of CAREX on human arm.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2012.2189496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174477","Cable-driven robot;exoskeleton;force control;rehabilitation robot;upper extremity","Exoskeletons;Joints;Force;Humans;Robots;Optimization;Shoulder","","312","","29","IEEE","23 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed DR strategy, consumers will have their own choices to determine which load to control and when.

However, MBI is subject to commission errors due to the similar characteristics between buildings, bare soil and roads. Furthermore, omission errors occur in dark and heterogeneous roofs. In this study, a systematic framework for building extraction from high-resolution imagery is proposed, aiming to alleviate both commission and omission errors for the original MBI algorithm. The improvements include three aspects: 1) a morphological shadow index (MSI) is proposed to detect shadows that are used as a spatial constraint of buildings; 2) a dual-threshold filtering is proposed to integrate the information of MBI and MSI; 3) the proposed framework is implemented in an object-based environment, where a geometrical index and a vegetation index are then used to remove noise from narrow roads and bright vegetation. The proposed framework was validated on an Ikonos image of Washington DC Mall with 1-m resolution and an 8-channel WorldView-2 image of Hangzhou, east of China, with 2-m resolution. By comparison with the ground truth references, it was shown that our method achieved over 90% overall accuracy for discrimination between buildings and backgrounds for both datasets. In the comparative study, it was revealed that the proposed method improved the original MBI significantly. Furthermore, the proposed method was more accurate than the support vector machine interpretation with the differential morphological profiles (DMP) and multiscale urban complexity index (MUCI).","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2168195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6056582","Building detection;high resolution;mathematical morphology;shadow detection;WorldView-2","Buildings;Indexes;Roads;Brightness;Feature extraction;Vegetation mapping;Shape","","311","","16","IEEE","20 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead, the crowd is segmented into components of homogeneous motion, using the mixture of dynamic-texture motion model. A set of holistic low-level features is extracted from each segmented region, and a function that maps features into estimates of the number of people per segment is learned with Bayesian regression. Two Bayesian regression models are examined. The first is a combination of Gaussian process regression with a compound kernel, which accounts for both the global and local trends of the count mapping but is limited by the real-valued outputs that do not match the discrete counts. We address this limitation with a second model, which is based on a Bayesian treatment of Poisson regression that introduces a prior distribution on the linear weights of the model. Since exact inference is analytically intractable, a closed-form approximation is derived that is computationally efficient and kernelizable, enabling the representation of nonlinear functions. An approximate marginal likelihood is also derived for kernel hyperparameter learning. The two regression-based crowd counting methods are evaluated on a large pedestrian data set, containing very distinct camera views, pedestrian traffic, and outliers, such as bikes or skateboarders. Experimental results show that regression-based counts are accurate regardless of the crowd size, outperforming the count estimates produced by state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Results on 2 h of video demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the regression-based crowd size estimation over long periods of time.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2172800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6054049","Bayesian regression;crowd analysis;Gaussian processes;Poisson regression;surveillance","Bayesian methods;Approximation methods;Kernel;Feature extraction;Ground penetrating radar;Training;Motion segmentation","Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Biometry;Censuses;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Population Density;Regression Analysis;Whole Body Imaging","310","1","46","IEEE","19 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Injecting the metal into microfluidic channels provides a simple way to define the shape of the liquid, which is stabilized mechanically by a thin oxide skin that forms spontaneously on its surface. This approach has proven sufficient for forming simple, single layer antenna geometries, such as dipoles. More complex fluidic antennas, particularly those featuring large, co-planar sheet-like geometries, require additional design considerations to achieve the desired shape of the metal.

Recent work has considered the setting where each point has a few arbitrarily corrupted components. Yet, in applications of SVD or PCA, such as robust collaborative filtering or bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective genes, or simply corrupted or contaminated experiments may effectively yield entire points that are completely corrupted. We present an efficient convex optimization-based algorithm that we call outlier pursuit, which under some mild assumptions on the uncorrupted points (satisfied, e.g., by the standard generative assumption in PCA problems) recovers the exact optimal low-dimensional subspace and identifies the corrupted points. Such identification of corrupted points that do not conform to the low-dimensional approximation is of paramount interest in bioinformatics, financial applications, and beyond. Our techniques involve matrix decomposition using nuclear norm minimization; however, our results, setup, and approach necessarily differ considerably from the existing line of work in matrix completion and matrix decomposition, since we develop an approach to recover the correct column space of the uncorrupted matrix, rather than the exact matrix itself. In any problem where one seeks to recover a structure rather than the exact initial matrices, techniques developed thus far relying on certificates of optimality will fail. We present an important extension of these methods, which allows the treatment of such problems.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2173156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126034","","Matrix decomposition;Principal component analysis;Sparse matrices;Noise measurement;Algorithm design and analysis;Vectors;Robustness","","310","2","43","IEEE","9 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stage is designed for high-bandwidth applications that include video-rate scanning probe microscopy and high-throughput probe-based nanofabrication. Specifically, the positioner employs vertically stiff, double-hinged serial flexures for guiding the motion of the sample platform to minimize parasitic motion (runout) and off-axis effects compared to previous designs. Finite element analysis (FEA) predicts the dominant resonances along the fast ( x-axis) and slow (y-axis) scanning axes at 25.9 and 6.0 kHz, respectively. The measured dominant resonances of the prototype stage in the fast and slow scanning directions are 24.2 and 6.0 kHz, respectively, which are in good agreement with the FEA predictions. In the z-direction, the measured dominant resonance is approximately 70 kHz. The lateral and vertical positioning ranges are approximately 9 μm × 9 μm and 1 μm, respectively. Four approaches to control the lateral motion of the stage are evaluated for precision tracking at high-scan rates: (1) open-loop smooth inputs; (2) PID feedback; (3) discrete-time repetitive control implemented using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware; and (4) model-based feed forward control. The stage is integrated with a commercial scan-by-probe atomic force microscope (AFM) and imaging and tracking results up to a line rate of 7 kHz are presented.

In fact, all depths are approximately focused, except for a thin slab where blur size is bounded, i.e., their depth of field is essentially inverted compared to regular cameras. Crucial to their success is the way they sample the LF, trading off spatial versus angular resolution, and how aliasing affects the LF. We show that applying traditional multiview stereo methods to the extracted low-resolution views can result in reconstruction errors due to aliasing. We address these challenges using an explicit image formation model, and incorporate Lambertian and texture preserving priors to reconstruct both scene depth and its superresolved texture in a variational Bayesian framework, eliminating aliasing by fusing multiview information. We demonstrate the method on synthetic and real images captured with our LF camera, and show that it can outperform other computational camera systems.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5989827","Computational photography;superresolution;deconvolution;blind deconvolution;multiview stereo;shape from defocus.","Cameras;Lenses;Microoptics;Apertures;Estimation;Spatial resolution","","308","172","39","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More precisely, a comprehensive analytical framework to compute the average bit error probability (ABEP) is introduced, which can be used for any MIMO setup, for arbitrary correlated fading channels, and for generic modulation schemes. It is shown that, when compared with state-of-the-art literature, our framework 1) has more general applicability over generalized fading channels, 2) is, in general, more accurate as it exploits an improved union-bound method, and, 3) more importantly, clearly highlights interesting fundamental trends about the performance of SM, which are difficult to capture with available frameworks. For example, by focusing on the canonical reference scenario with independent identically distributed Rayleigh fading, we introduce very simple formulas that yield insightful design information on the optimal modulation scheme to be used for the signal constellation diagram, as well as highlight the different roles played by the bit mapping on the signal and spatial constellation diagrams. Numerical results show that, for many MIMO setups, SM with phase-shift-keying (PSK) modulation outperforms SM with quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM), which is a result never reported in the literature. In addition, by exploiting asymptotic analysis, closed-form formulas of the performance gain of SM over other single-antenna transmission technologies are provided. Numerical results show that SM can outperform many single-antenna systems and that, for any transmission rate, there is an optimal allocation of the information bits onto spatial and signal constellation diagrams. Furthermore, by focusing on the Nakagami-$m$ fading scenario with generically correlated fading, we show that fading severity plays a very important role in determining the diversity gain of SM. In particular, the performance gain over single-antenna systems increases for fading channels less severe than Rayleigh fading, whereas it gets smaller for more severe fading channels. In addition, it is shown that the impact of fading correlation at the transmitter is reduced for less severe fading. Finally, analytical frameworks and claims are substantiated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2186158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142142","Large-scale antenna systems;“massive” multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems;performance analysis;single-RF MIMO design;spatial modulation (SM)","MIMO;Rayleigh channels;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Phase shift keying;Receivers","","308","","47","IEEE","30 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such a channel, the information is corrupted by noise that follows an IG distribution. We show that such a channel model is appropriate for molecular communication in fluid media. Taking advantage of the available literature on the IG distribution, upper and lower bounds on channel capacity are developed, and a maximum likelihood receiver is derived. Results are presented which suggest that this channel does not have a single quality measure analogous to signal-to-noise ratio in the additive white Gaussian noise channel.

The recognition accuracies of six different face recognition algorithms (three commercial, two nontrainable, and one trainable) are computed on a large scale gallery that is partitioned so that each partition consists entirely of specific demographic cohorts. Eight total cohorts are isolated based on gender (male and female), race/ethnicity (Black, White, and Hispanic), and age group (18–30, 30–50, and 50–70 years old). Experimental results demonstrate that both commercial and the nontrainable algorithms consistently have lower matching accuracies on the same cohorts (females, Blacks, and age group 18–30) than the remaining cohorts within their demographic. Additional experiments investigate the impact of the demographic distribution in the training set on the performance of a trainable face recognition algorithm. We show that the matching accuracy for race/ethnicity and age cohorts can be improved by training exclusively on that specific cohort. Operationally, this leads to a scenario, called dynamic face matcher selection, where multiple face recognition algorithms (each trained on different demographic cohorts) are available for a biometric system operator to select based on the demographic information extracted from a probe image. This procedure should lead to improved face recognition accuracy in many intelligence and law enforcement face recognition scenarios. Finally, we show that an alternative to dynamic face matcher selection is to train face recognition algorithms on datasets that are evenly distributed across demographics, as this approach offers consistently high accuracy across all cohorts.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2214212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327355","Age;demographics;dynamic face matcher selection;face recognition;gender;race/ethnicity;training","Face recognition;Training;Demographics;Algorithm design and analysis;Training data;Cultural differences","","306","","34","IEEE","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our treatment concerns statistical robustness, which deals with deviations from the distributional assumptions. Many problems encountered in engineering practice rely on the Gaussian distribution of the data, which in many situations is well justified. This enables a simple derivation of optimal estimators. Nominal optimality, however, is useless if the estimator was derived under distributional assumptions on the noise and the signal that do not hold in practice. Even slight deviations from the assumed distribution may cause the estimator's performance to drastically degrade or to completely break down. The signal processing practitioner should, therefore, ask whether the performance of the derived estimator is acceptable in situations where the distributional assumptions do not hold. Isn't it robustness that is of a major concern for engineering practice? Many areas of engineering today show that the distribution of the measurements is far from Gaussian as it contains outliers, which cause the distribution to be heavy tailed. Under such scenarios, we address single and multichannel estimation problems as well as linear univariate regression for independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. A rather extensive treatment of the important and challenging case of dependent data for the signal processing practitioner is also included. For these problems, a comparative analysis of the most important robust methods is carried out by evaluating their performance theoretically, using simulations as well as real-world data.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2012.2183773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6217389","","Tutorials;Robustness;Gaussian distribution;Context awareness;Noise measurement;Area measurement;Signal processing algorithms","","305","1","79","IEEE","13 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, the most important factors for planar transformer (PT) design including winding loss, core loss, leakage inductance, and stray capacitance have individually been investigated. The tradeoffs among these factors have to be analyzed in order to achieve optimal parameters. Combined with an application, four typical winding arrangements have been compared to illustrate their advantages and disadvantages. An improved interleaving structure with optimal behaviors is proposed, which constructs the top layer paralleling with the bottom layer and then in series with the other turns of the primary, so that a lower magnetomotive force ratio $m$ can be obtained, as well as minimized ac resistance, leakage inductance, and even stray capacitance. A 1.2-kW full-bridge dc–dc converter prototype employing the improved PT structure has been constructed, over 96% efficiency is achieved, and a 2.7% improvement, compared with the noninterleaving structure, is obtained.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2010.2046005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437231","Core loss;dc–dc converter;finite-element analysis (FEA);interleaving;leakage inductance;magnetomotive force (MMF);planar transformer (PT);stray capacitance;winding loss","DC-DC power converters;Inductance;Magnetosphere;Core loss;Capacitance;Equations;Interleaved codes;Frequency conversion;Manufacturing;Magnetic separation","","305","","31","IEEE","22 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Especially, we observe a spectral folding phenomenon in bipartite graphs which occurs during downsampling of these graphs and produces aliasing in graph signals. This property of bipartite graphs, allows us to design critically sampled two-channel filter banks, and we propose quadrature mirror filters (referred to as graph-QMF) for bipartite graph which cancel aliasing and lead to perfect reconstruction. For arbitrary graphs we present a bipartite subgraph decomposition which produces an edge-disjoint collection of bipartite subgraphs. Graph-QMFs are then constructed on each bipartite subgraph leading to “multi-dimensional” separable wavelet filter banks on graphs.

To compare to the state of the art, we test our detector on still images, i.e., Pascal VOC 2007.

A statistical-based wind power forecasting without using numerical weather prediction (NWP) inputs is carried out in this work. The proposed approach consists of two stages. In stage-I, wavelet decomposition of wind series is carried out and adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) is used to regress upon each decomposed signal, to predict wind speed up to 30 h ahead. In stage-II, a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is used for nonlinear mapping between wind speed and wind power output, which transforms the forecasted wind speed into wind power prediction.

The two-port approach allows one to predict the power transfer efficiency at any frequency, any type of coil geometry and through any type of media surrounding the coils. Moreover, the results are applicable to any form of passive power transfer such as provided by inductive or capacitive coupling. Our results generalize several well-known special cases.

In the field of human-assistive robotics, these methods provide valuable information to provide effectively support to the user. However, their usability is strongly limited by the necessity of complex user-dependent and session-dependent calibration procedures, which confine their use to the laboratory environment. Nonetheless, an accurate estimate of muscle torque could be unnecessary to provide effective movement assistance to users. The natural ability of human central nervous system of adapting to external disturbances could compensate for a lower accuracy of the torque provided by the robot and maintain the movement accuracy unaltered, while the effort is reduced. In order to explore this possibility, in this paper we study the reaction of ten healthy subjects to the assistance provided through a proportional EMG control applied by an elbow powered exoskeleton. This system gives only a rough estimate of the user muscular torque but does not require any specific calibration. Experimental results clearly show that subjects adapt almost instantaneously to the assistance provided by the robot and can reduce their effort while keeping full control of the movement under different dynamic conditions (i.e., no alterations of movement accuracy are observed).","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2198821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198287","Assistive robotics;electromyography (EMG) control;powered exoskeletons","Electromyography;Torque;Muscles;Exoskeletons;Robots;Elbow;Joints","Adult;Algorithms;Biomechanics;Elbow;Electromyography;Electromyography;Female;Humans;Male;Robotics;Self-Help Devices;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","303","1","58","IEEE","10 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The offset of each category is properly calculated at the encoder and explicitly signaled to the decoder for reducing sample distortion effectively, while the classification of each sample is performed at both the encoder and the decoder for saving side information significantly. To achieve low latency of only one coding tree unit (CTU), a CTU-based syntax design is specified to adapt SAO parameters for each CTU. A CTU-based optimization algorithm can be used to derive SAO parameters of each CTU, and the SAO parameters of the CTU are inter leaved into the slice data.

Beginning with an image, we execute a sequence of steps in which pixels are gradually merged to produce larger and larger regions. In each step, we consider pairs of adjacent regions and provide a probability measure to assess whether or not they should be included in the same segment. Our probabilistic formulation takes into account intensity and texture distributions in a local area around each region. It further incorporates priors based on the geometry of the regions. Finally, posteriors based on intensity and texture cues are combined using “ a mixture of experts” formulation. This probabilistic approach is integrated into a graph coarsening scheme, providing a complete hierarchical segmentation of the image. The algorithm complexity is linear in the number of the image pixels and it requires almost no user-tuned parameters. In addition, we provide a novel evaluation scheme for image segmentation algorithms, attempting to avoid human semantic considerations that are out of scope for segmentation algorithms. Using this novel evaluation scheme, we test our method and provide a comparison to several existing segmentation algorithms.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928348","Computer vision;image segmentation;cue integration;segmentation evaluation.","Image segmentation;Computer vision;Algorithm design and analysis;Probabilistic logic;Noise measurement;Partitioning algorithms;Clustering algorithms","Algorithms;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical","301","1","39","IEEE","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Supplying the output load, charging or discharging the battery can be made by the PV and the FC power sources individually or simultaneously.

By comparing the simulation results with experimental data, it is found that the random current fluctuation experimentally observed in the RESET processes is caused by the competition between trap generation and recombination, whereas the variation of the high resistance states and the tail bits are directly correlated to the randomness of the trap dynamics. A combined strategy with a bilayer dielectric material and a write-verification technique is proposed to minimize the resistance variation.

However, the standard sparse representation does not consider the intrinsic structure, i.e., the nonzero elements occur in clusters, called group sparsity. Furthermore, there is no dictionary learning method for group sparse representation considering the geometrical structure of space spanned by atoms. In this paper, we propose a novel dictionary learning method, called Dictionary Learning with Group Sparsity and Graph Regularization (DL-GSGR). First, the geometrical structure of atoms is modeled as the graph regularization. Then, combining group sparsity and graph regularization, the DL-GSGR is presented, which is solved by alternating the group sparse coding and dictionary updating. In this way, the group coherence of learned dictionary can be enforced small enough such that any signal can be group sparse coded effectively. Finally, group sparse representation with DL-GSGR is applied to 3-D medical image denoising and image fusion. Specifically, in 3-D medical image denoising, a 3-D processing mechanism (using the similarity among nearby slices) and temporal regularization (to perverse the correlations across nearby slices) are exploited. The experimental results on 3-D image denoising and image fusion demonstrate the superiority of our proposed denoising and fusion approaches.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2217493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296694","3-D medical image denoising;dictionary learning;graph regularization;group sparse representation;medical image fusion;temporal regularization","Biomedical imaging;Image denoising;Sparse matrices;Noise measurement;Learning systems","Algorithms;Brain;Diagnostic Imaging;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Middle Aged;Models, Theoretical","301","1","37","IEEE","6 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

UKF propagates the so called sigma points by function evaluations using the unscented transformation (UT), and this is at first glance very different from the standard EKF algorithm which is based on a linearized model. The claimed advantages with UKF are that it propagates the first two moments of the posterior distribution and that it does not require gradients of the system model. We point out several less known links between EKF and UKF in terms of two conceptually different implementations of the Kalman filter: the standard one based on the discrete Riccati equation, and one based on a formula on conditional expectations that does not involve an explicit Riccati equation. First, it is shown that the sigma point function evaluations can be used in the classical EKF rather than an explicitly linearized model. Second, a less cited version of the EKF based on a second-order Taylor expansion is shown to be quite closely related to UKF. The different algorithms and results are illustrated with examples inspired by core observation models in target tracking and sensor network applications.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2172431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051522","Extended Kalman filter (EKF);transformations;unscented Kalman filter (UKF)","Approximation methods;Kalman filters;Taylor series;Jacobian matrices;Riccati equations;Transforms;Covariance matrix","","299","","16","IEEE","18 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on this observation, a recently proposed ""Massive MIMO"" scheme was shown to achieve unprecedented spectral efficiency in realistic conditions of distance-dependent pathloss and channel coherence time and bandwidth. The main focus and contribution of this paper is an improved Network-MIMO TDD architecture achieving spectral efficiencies comparable with ""Massive MIMO"", with one order of magnitude fewer antennas per active user per cell (roughly, from 500 to 50 antennas). The proposed architecture is based on a family of Network-MIMO schemes defined by small clusters of cooperating base stations, zero-forcing multiuser MIMO precoding with suitable inter-cluster interference mitigation constraints, uplink pilot signals allocation and frequency reuse across cells. The key idea consists of partitioning the users into equivalence classes, optimizing the Network-MIMO scheme for each equivalence class, and letting a scheduler allocate the channel time-frequency dimensions to the different classes in order to maximize a suitable network utility function that captures a desired notion of fairness. This results in a mixed-mode Network-MIMO architecture, where different schemes, each of which is optimized for the served user equivalence class, are multiplexed in time-frequency. In order to carry out the performance analysis and the optimization of the proposed architecture in a systematic and computationally efficient way, we consider the large-system regime where the number of users, the number of antennas, and the channel coherence block length go to infinity with fixed ratios.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.070912.111383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6241389","Channel training;downlink scheduling;frequency reuse;inter-cell cooperation;large-system analysis;linear precoding;Massive MIMO;pilot contamination;time-division duplex","Antennas;Computer architecture;Training;MIMO;Coherence;Layout;Microprocessors","","299","33","41","IEEE","16 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a multiple kernel fuzzy c-means (MKFC) algorithm that extends the fuzzy c-means algorithm with a multiple kernel-learning setting. By incorporating multiple kernels and automatically adjusting the kernel weights, MKFC is more immune to ineffective kernels and irrelevant features. This makes the choice of kernels less crucial.

Two embedded internal permanent magnets and a large external magnet are used to actuate the robot remotely. The proposed MASCE has three novel features. First, its outside body is made of soft elastomer-based compliant structures. Such compliant structures can deform passively during the robot–tissue contact interactions, which makes the device safer and less invasive. Next, it can be actively deformed in the axial direction by using external magnetic actuation, which provides an extra degree of freedom that enables various advanced functions such as axial position control, drug releasing, drug injection, or biopsy. Finally, it navigates in three dimensions by rolling on the stomach surface as a new surface locomotion method inside the stomach. Here, the external attractive magnetic force is used to anchor the robot on a desired location, and the external magnetic torque is used to roll it to another location, which provides a stable, continuous, and controllable motion. The paper presents design and fabrication methods for the compliant structures of the robot with its axial deformation and position control capability. Rolling-based surface locomotion of the robot using external magnetic torques is modeled, and its feasibility is tested and verified on a synthetic stomach surface by using a magnetically actuated capsule endoscope prototype.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2011.2163861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999728","Capsule endoscopy;magnetic actuation;medical robotics;miniature robotics;soft robotics","Magnetomechanical effects;Magnetic hysteresis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Stomach;Shape;Robots;Force","","295","2","32","IEEE","25 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Within the new control strategy, the rotor side controller can convert the imbalanced power into the kinetic energy of the WT by increasing its rotor speed, when a low voltage due to a grid fault occurs at, e.g., the point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed grid side control scheme introduces a compensation term reflecting the instantaneous DC-link current of the rotor side converter in order to smooth the DC-link voltage fluctuations during the grid fault. A major difference from other methods is that the proposed control strategy can absorb the additional kinetic energy during the fault conditions, and significantly reduce the oscillations in the stator and rotor currents and the DC bus voltage. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been demonstrated through various simulation cases. Compared with conventional crowbar protection, the proposed control method can not only improve the LVRT capability of the DFIG WT, but also help maintaining continuous active and reactive power control of the DFIG during the grid faults.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2174387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112194","Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG);low voltage ride through;power system fault;wind turbine","Rotors;Circuit faults;Wind turbines;Stators;Generators;Voltage control;Wind speed","","294","","25","IEEE","23 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The data presented here show that at 38 GHz, unobstructed Line of Site (LOS) channels obey free space propagation path loss while non-LOS (NLOS) channels have large multipath delay spreads and can exploit many different pointing angles to provide propagation links. At 60 GHz, there is notably more path loss, smaller delay spreads, and fewer unique antenna angles for creating a link.

There exist a number of sensors and techniques for acquiring 3-D data, many of which have particular utility for various robotic tasks. We introduce a new design for a 3-D sensor system, constructed from a 2-D range scanner coupled with a passive linkage mechanism, such as a spring. By mounting the other end of the passive linkage mechanism to a moving body, disturbances resulting from accelerations and vibrations of the body propel the 2-D scanner in an irregular fashion, thereby extending the device’s field of view outside of its standard scanning plane. The proposed 3-D sensor system is advantageous due to its mechanical simplicity, mobility, low weight, and relatively low cost. We analyze a particular implementation of the proposed device, which we call Zebedee, consisting of a 2-D time-of-flight laser range scanner rigidly coupled to an inertial measurement unit and mounted on a spring. The unique configuration of the sensor system motivates unconventional and specialized algorithms to be developed for data processing. As an example application, we describe a novel 3-D simultaneous localization and mapping solution in which Zebedee is mounted on a moving platform. Using a motion capture system, we have verified the positional accuracy of the sensor trajectory. The results demonstrate that the six-degree-of-freedom trajectory of a passive spring-mounted range sensor can be accurately estimated from laser range data and industrial-grade inertial measurements in real time and that a quality 3-D point cloud map can be generated concurrently using the same data.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2012.2200990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6220900","Mapping;range sensing;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)","Springs;Trajectory;Lasers;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Timing","","291","3","17","IEEE","19 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, coping with the big latency between inertial and visual measurements and processing images in real-time impose great research challenges. Most modern MAV navigation systems avoid to explicitly tackle this by employing a ground station for off-board processing. In this paper, we propose a navigation algorithm for MAVs equipped with a single camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which is able to run onboard and in real-time. The main focus here is on the proposed speed-estimation module which converts the camera into a metric body-speed sensor using IMU data within an EKF framework. We show how this module can be used for full self-calibration of the sensor suite in real-time. The module is then used both during initialization and as a fall-back solution at tracking failures of a keyframe-based VSLAM module. The latter is based on an existing high-performance algorithm, extended such that it achieves scalable 6DoF pose estimation at constant complexity. Fast onboard speed control is ensured by sole reliance on the optical flow of at least two features in two consecutive camera frames and the corresponding IMU readings. Our nonlinear observability analysis and our real experiments demonstrate that this approach can be used to control a MAV in speed, while we also show results of operation at 40Hz on an onboard Atom computer 1.6 GHz.","1050-4729","978-1-4673-1405-3","10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225147","","Navigation;Weight measurement;Atom optics;Optical sensors;Robustness;Equations;Estimation","","291","22","16","IEEE","28 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the hardware is able to measure signals down to levels compatible with sub-centimeter image resolution while keeping an exam time under 2 min. Second, the software overcomes the enormous time burden and produces similarly accurate images in less than 20 min. The combination of the new hardware and software allows us to produce and report here the first clinical 3-D microwave tomographic images of the breast. Two clinical examples are selected out of 400+ exams conducted at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (Lebanon, NH). The first example demonstrates the potential usefulness of our system for breast cancer screening while the second example focuses on therapy monitoring.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2012.2197218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6193442","Breast cancer;breast cancer diagnostic;discrete dipole approximation;Gauss–Newton algorithm;therapy monitoring;tomographic imaging;3-D microwave imaging","Breast;Microwave imaging;Tumors;Microwave theory and techniques;Three dimensional displays;Antenna measurements","Adult;Algorithms;Breast;Breast;Breast Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Microwaves;Middle Aged;Models, Theoretical;Tomography;Tomography","291","6","36","IEEE","2 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since immersive virtual reality (VR) allows us to achieve very high levels of fidelity, we designed and conducted a study that used a six-sided CAVE to evaluate display fidelity and interaction fidelity independently, at extremely high and low levels, for a VR first-person shooter (FPS) game. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of the effects of fidelity on the user in a complex, performance-intensive context. The results of our study indicate that both display and interaction fidelity significantly affect strategy and performance, as well as subjective judgments of presence, engagement, and usability. In particular, performance results were strongly in favor of two conditions: low-display, low-interaction fidelity (representative of traditional FPS games) and high-display, high-interaction fidelity (similar to the real world).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165144","Virtual reality;display fidelity;interaction fidelity;presence;engagement.","Games;Mice;Turning;Humans;Keyboards;Usability;Accuracy","Adolescent;Adult;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Female;Humans;Male;User-Computer Interface;Video Games;Young Adult","289","1","35","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This leads to instability phenomena if the load power exceeds a power limit depending on the filter parameters. The purpose of this paper is to present tools allowing large signal stability analysis of a dc power system. These tools allow estimation of the domain of attraction of the system operating point. It will be shown that this large signal stability analysis gives useful hints on the design of the system to optimize the stability criteria for constant and variable power loads.

This simulation is in reasonable quantitative agreement with double pulse experiments. Simulations using deep-level intrinsic growth defects produced a similar result. By contrast, carbon can induce a strong CC which is dependent on doping density. The difference is attributed to whether the trap levels, whether intrinsic or extrinsic dopants, result in a resistive n-type buffer or a p-type floating buffer with bias-dependent depletion regions.

The principal difficulty in implementing such a system is that, due to the limited attenuation between the relay's transmit and receive antenna arrays, the relay's outgoing signal may overwhelm its limited-dynamic-range input circuitry, making it difficult-if not impossible-to recover the desired incoming signal. While explicitly modeling transmitter/receiver dynamic-range limitations and channel estimation error, we derive tight upper and lower bounds on the end-to-end achievable rate of decode-and-forward-based full-duplex MIMO relay systems, and propose a transmission scheme based on maximization of the lower bound. The maximization requires us to (numerically) solve a nonconvex optimization problem, for which we detail a novel approach based on bisection search and gradient projection. To gain insights into system design tradeoffs, we also derive an analytic approximation to the achievable rate and numerically demonstrate its accuracy. We then study the behavior of the achievable rate as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, interference-to-noise ratio, transmitter/receiver dynamic range, number of antennas, and training length, using optimized half-duplex signaling as a baseline.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2012.120921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280258","MIMO relays;full-duplex relays;limited dynamic range;channel estimation","Relays;MIMO;Channel estimation;Noise;Receiving antennas;Dynamic range","","286","2","23","IEEE","23 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Concurrent sensing and stimulation are needed to maximize usable neural data, minimize time delays for closed-loop actuation, and investigate the instantaneous response to stimulation. Current systems lack concurrent sensing and stimulation primarily because of stimulation interference to neural signals of interest. While careful design of high performance amplifiers has proved useful to reduce disturbances in the system, stimulation continues to contaminate neural sensing due to biological effects like tissue-electrode impedance mismatch and constraints on stimulation parameters needed to deliver therapy. In this work we describe systematic methods to mitigate the effect of stimulation through a combination of sensing hardware, stimulation parameter selection, and classification algorithms that counter residual stimulation disturbances. To validate these methods we implemented and tested a completely implantable system for over one year in a large animal model of epilepsy. The system proved capable of measuring and detecting seizure activity in the hippocampus both during and after stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate an embedded algorithm that actuates neural modulation in response to seizure detection during stimulation, validating the capability to detect bioelectrical markers in the presence of therapy and titrate it appropriately. The capability to detect neural states in the presence of stimulation and optimally titrate therapy is a key innovation required for generalizing closed-loop neural systems for multiple disease states.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2012.2183617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6135801","Chronic;closed-loop;neuromodulation;validation","Sensors;Medical treatment;Closed loop systems;Implantable biomedical devices;Electrical stimulation;Classification algorithms;Nervous system","Action Potentials;Animals;Biofeedback, Psychology;Biofeedback, Psychology;Brain;Deep Brain Stimulation;Electroencephalography;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Feedback;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Prostheses and Implants;Sheep;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","286","24","31","IEEE","23 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For static-texture description, we present LBP histogram Fourier (LBP-HF) features, and for dynamic-texture recognition, we present two rotation-invariant descriptors computed from the LBPs from three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) features in the spatiotemporal domain. LBP-HF is a novel rotation-invariant image descriptor computed from discrete Fourier transforms of LBP histograms. The approach can be also generalized to embed any uniform features into this framework, and combining the supplementary information, e.g., sign and magnitude components of the LBP, together can improve the description ability. Moreover, two variants of rotation-invariant descriptors are proposed to the LBP-TOP, which is an effective descriptor for dynamic-texture recognition, as shown by its recent success in different application problems, but it is not rotation invariant. In the experiments, it is shown that the LBP-HF and its extensions outperform noninvariant and earlier versions of the rotation-invariant LBP in the rotation-invariant texture classification. In experiments on two dynamic-texture databases with rotations or view variations, the proposed video features can effectively deal with rotation variations of dynamic textures (DTs).

However, current PM motors in industrial, residential, and automotive applications are still dominated by interior permanent-magnet motors (IPM) because the claimed advantages of stator PM motors have not been fully investigated and validated. Hence, this paper will perform a comparative study between a stator-PM motor, namely, a flux switching PM motor (FSPM), and an IPM which has been used in the 2004 Prius hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). For a fair comparison, the two motors are designed at the same phase current, current density, and dimensions including the stator outer diameter and stack length. First, the Prius-IPM is investigated by means of finite-element method (FEM). The FEM results are then verified by experimental results to confirm the validity of the methods used in this study. Second, the FSPM design is optimized and investigated based on the same method used for the Prius-IPM. Third, the electromagnetic performance and the material mass of the two motors are compared. It is concluded that FSPM has more sinusoidal back-EMF hence is more suitable for BLAC control. It also offers the advantage of smaller torque ripple and better mechanical integrity for safer and smoother operations. But the FSPM has disadvantages such as low magnet utilization ratio and high cost. It may not be able to compete with IPM in automotive and other applications where cost constraints are tight.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2012.2190614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6168269","Comparative study;finite-element method (FEM);flux switching permanent magnet motor;HEV;hybrid electric vehicle;permanent-magnet motor;stator PM motor","Stator windings;Torque;Permanent magnet motors;Windings;Rotors;Finite element methods","","285","","31","IEEE","12 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to offset their opposing limitations, an active battery/SC hybrid energy storage system (HESS) using a dc/dc converter has been proposed. The major problem concerning an active HESS is in how to control the current flow in order to achieve two objectives: the minimization of the magnitude/fluctuation of the current flowing in and out of the battery and the energy loss seen by the SCs. This problem has not been analytically investigated for an optimal solution regarding these two goals. In this paper, we present an optimal energy management scheme for active HESS. In order to obtain the optimal solution, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem concerning these two objectives. Observing that the feasibility and optimality of the solution critically depends on the boundary parameters of the problem, we present an algorithm that effectively adjusts the parameter values. The proposed algorithm is based on the multiplicative-increase- additive-decrease principle, which guarantees a feasible optimal solution. Through MATLAB simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can optimally minimize the magnitude/fluctuation of the battery current and the SC energy loss.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2164816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6046111","Battery;convex optimization;DC/DC converter;energy management;hybrid energy storage;supercapacitor","Batteries;DC-DC power converters;Topology;Optimization;Energy loss;Energy management","","283","1","21","IEEE","14 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these challenges, we consider systems that use pilot-aided channel estimates to perform transmit beamforming, receive beamforming, and interference cancellation. Modeling transmitter/receiver dynamic-range limitations explicitly, we derive tight upper and lower bounds on the achievable sum-rate, and propose a transmission scheme based on maximization of the lower bound, which requires us to (numerically) solve a nonconvex optimization problem. In addition, we derive an analytic approximation to the achievable sum-rate, and show, numerically, that it is quite accurate. We then study the behavior of the sum-rate as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, interference-to-noise ratio, transmitter/receiver dynamic range, number of antennas, and training length, using optimized half-duplex signaling as a baseline.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2192925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177689","Channel estimation;channel models;full-duplex;information theory;limited dynamic range;MIMO;wireless communication","Modems;Transmitting antennas;MIMO;Channel estimation;Receiving antennas","","282","3","26","IEEE","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, SRC could not well classify the data with the same direction distribution. The same direction distribution means that the sample vectors belonging to different classes distribute on the same vector direction. This paper presents a new classifier, kernel sparse representation-based classifier (KSRC), based on SRC and the kernel trick which is a usual technique in machine learning. KSRC is a nonlinear extension of SRC and can remedy the drawback of SRC. To make the data in an input space separable, we implicitly map these data into a high-dimensional kernel feature space by using some nonlinear mapping associated with a kernel function. Since this kernel feature space has a very high (or possibly infinite) dimensionality, or is unknown, we have to avoid working in this space explicitly. Fortunately, we can indeed reduce the dimensionality of the kernel feature space by exploiting kernel-based dimensionality reduction methods. In the reduced subspace, we need to find sparse combination coefficients for a test sample and assign a class label to it. Similar to SRC, KSRC is also cast into an ℓ1-minimization problem or a quadratically constrained ℓ1 -minimization problem. Extensive experimental results on UCI and face data sets show KSRC improves the performance of SRC.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2179539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104179"," $\ell_{1}$-norm;compressed sensing;kernel method;machine learning;sparse representation","Kernel;Machine learning;Training;Learning systems;Sparse matrices;Compressed sensing;Vectors","","282","","15","IEEE","13 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm implements the paradigm of nonlocal grouping and collaborative filtering, where a higher dimensional transform-domain representation of the observations is leveraged to enforce sparsity, and thus regularize the data: 3-D spatiotemporal volumes are constructed by tracking blocks along trajectories defined by the motion vectors. Mutually similar volumes are then grouped together by stacking them along an additional fourth dimension, thus producing a 4-D structure, termed group, where different types of data correlation exist along the different dimensions: local correlation along the two dimensions of the blocks, temporal correlation along the motion trajectories, and nonlocal spatial correlation (i.e., self-similarity) along the fourth dimension of the group. Collaborative filtering is then realized by transforming each group through a decorrelating 4-D separable transform and then by shrinkage and inverse transformation. In this way, the collaborative filtering provides estimates for each volume stacked in the group, which are then returned and adaptively aggregated to their original positions in the video. The proposed filtering procedure addresses several video processing applications, such as denoising, deblocking, and enhancement of both grayscale and color data. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our method in terms of both subjective and objective visual quality, and show that it outperforms the state of the art in video denoising.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2199324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200335","Adaptive transforms;motion estimation;nonlocal methods;video deblocking;video denoising;video enhancement;video filtering","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Correlation;Collaboration;Noise reduction;Trajectory;Transforms;Noise measurement","","282","7","47","IEEE","15 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main idea is that the objective function is transformed to a weighted sum of rate and power. A generic problem formulation for systems dissipating transmit-independent circuit power in addition to transmit-dependent power is presented. We show that a broad class of EE maximization problems can be solved efficiently, provided the rate is a concave function of the transmit power. We elaborate examples of various system models including time-varying parallel channels. Rate functions with an arbitrary discrete modulation scheme are also treated. The examples considered lead to water-filling solutions, but these are different from the dual problems of power minimization under rate constraints and rate maximization under power constraints, respectively, because the constraints need not be active. We also demonstrate that if the solution to a rate maximization problem is known, it can be utilized to reduce the EE problem into a one-dimensional convex problem.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.060412.111829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6213038","Energy efficiency;fractional programming;optimization;water-filling;power control","Optimization;Wireless communication;Programming;Transmitters;Mathematical model;Minimization;Base stations","","281","","29","IEEE","6 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In classical game theory algorithms, each player employs the knowledge of the functional form of his payoff and the knowledge of the other players' actions, whereas in the proposed algorithm, the players need to measure only their own payoff values. This strategy is based on the extremum seeking approach, which has previously been developed for standard optimization problems and employs sinusoidal perturbations to estimate the gradient. We consider static games with quadratic payoff functions before generalizing our results to games with non-quadratic payoff functions that are the output of a dynamic system. Specifically, we consider general nonlinear differential equations with $N$  inputs and $N$  outputs, where in the steady state, the output signals represent the payoff functions of a noncooperative game played by the steady-state values of the input signals. We employ the standard local averaging theory and obtain local convergence results for both quadratic payoffs, where the actual convergence is semi-global, and non-quadratic payoffs, where the potential existence of multiple Nash equilibria precludes semi-global convergence. Our convergence conditions coincide with conditions that arise in model-based Nash equilibrium seeking. However, in our framework the user is not meant to check these conditions because the payoff functions are presumed to be unknown. For non-quadratic payoffs, convergence to a Nash equilibrium is not perfect, but is biased in proportion to the perturbation amplitudes and the higher derivatives of the payoff functions. We quantify the size of these residual biases and confirm their existence numerically in an example noncooperative game. In this example, we present the first application of extremum seeking with projection to ensure that the players' actions remain in a given closed and bounded action set.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2173412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060862","Extremum seeking;learning;Nash equilibria;noncooperative games","Games;Convergence;Nash equilibrium;Mathematical model;Heuristic algorithms;Stability analysis;Nonlinear dynamical systems","","280","","51","IEEE","25 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second MPPT algorithm controls the power converter between the PV panel and the load and implements a new fuzzy-logic (FLC)-based perturb and observe (P&O) scheme to keep the system power operating point at its maximum. The FLC-MPPT is based on a voltage control approach of the power converter with a discrete PI controller to adapt the duty cycle. The input reference voltage is adaptively perturbed with variable steps until the maximum power is reached. The proposed control scheme achieves stable operation in the entire region of the PV panel and eliminates therefore the resulting oscillations around the maximum power operating point.

How to eliminate such effect so as to enhance the indoor localization performance is a big challenge.

We explore the frequency diversity of the subcarriers in OFDM systems and propose a novel approach called FILA, which leverages the channel state information (CSI) to alleviate multipath effect at the receiver. We implement the FILA system on commercial 802.11 NICs, and then evaluate its performance in different typical indoor scenarios. The experimental results show that the accuracy and latency of distance calculation can be significantly enhanced by using CSI. Moreover, FILA can significantly improve the localization accuracy compared with the corresponding RSSI approach.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0775-8","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195606","","OFDM;Fading;Receivers;Accuracy;Bandwidth;Training;Baseband","","279","3","22","IEEE","10 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, battery models must account for thermal effects because of the paramount importance of temperature in kinetic and transport phenomena of electrochemical systems. This paper presents an effective method for developing a multi-temperature lithium cell simulation model with thermal dependence. An equivalent circuit model with one voltage source, one series resistor, and a single RC block was able to account for the discharge dynamics observed in the experiment. A parameter estimation numerical scheme using pulse current discharge tests on high power lithium (LiNi-CoMnO2 cathode and graphite-based anode) cells under different operating conditions revealed dependences of the equivalent circuit elements on state of charge, average current, and temperature. The process is useful for creating a high fidelity model capable of predicting electrical current/voltage performance and estimating run-time state of charge. The model was validated for a lithium cell with an independent drive cycle showing voltage accuracy within 2%. The model was also used to simulate thermal buildup for a constant current discharge scenario.","","978-1-4673-1561-6","10.1109/IEVC.2012.6183271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6183271","high-power lithium cell;thermal model;electrical equivalent lithium cell model. state of charge;pulse discharge test;energy storage;electric vehicle;hybrid electric vehicle","Integrated circuit modeling;System-on-a-chip;Discharges (electric);Equivalent circuits;Mathematical model;Batteries;Lithium","","278","1","15","IEEE","16 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the training of the RESN is facilitated by employing a bound optimization algorithm, based on which, a proper surrogate function is derived and the Laplace likelihood function is approximated by a Gaussian one, while remaining robust to outliers.

Therefore, we propose a combined problem formulation for active-reactive optimal power flow (A-R-OPF) in DNs with embedded wind generation and battery storage. The solution provides an optimal operation strategy which ensures the feasibility and enhances the profit significantly. Results of a 41-bus distribution network are presented.

For the simulation of uncertainty, the scenario-based approach considers the Monte Carlo (MC) method, while lower and upper bounds are adopted in the interval optimization. The Stochastic SCUC problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) problem and solved using the two approaches. The scenario-based solutions are insensitive to the number of scenarios, but present additional computation burdens. The interval optimization solution requires less computation and automatically generates lower and upper bounds for the operation cost and generation dispatch, but its optimal solution is very sensitive to the uncertainty interval. The numerical results on a six-bus system and the modified IEEE 118-bus system show the attributes of the two approaches for solving the Stochastic SCUC problem.

In order to model human actions, three overcomplete dictionary learning frameworks are investigated. An overcomplete dictionary is constructed using a set of spatio-temporal descriptors (extracted from the video sequences) in such a way that each descriptor is represented by some linear combination of a small number of dictionary elements. This leads to a more compact and richer representation of the video sequences compared to the existing methods that involve clustering and vector quantization. For each framework, a novel classification algorithm is proposed. Additionally, this work also presents the idea of a new local spatio-temporal feature that is distinctive, scale invariant, and fast to compute.

For a suite of 13 benchmarks, we find that (i) irregularity at the warp level varies widely, (ii) control-flow irregularity and memory-access irregularity are largely independent of each other, and (iii) most kernels, including regular ones, exhibit some irregularity. A program's irregularity can change between different inputs, systems, and arithmetic precision but generally stays in a specific region of the irregularity space. Whereas some highly tuned implementations of irregular algorithms exhibit little irregularity, trading off extra irregularity for better locality or less work can improve overall performance.","","978-1-4673-4532-3","10.1109/IISWC.2012.6402918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6402918","","Kernel;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Benchmark testing;Measurement;Hardware;Heuristic algorithms","","276","1","48","IEEE","7 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has led to a higher demand for adjustable speed drives (ASDs), increasing their percentage of share in a market greatly dominated by standard direct grid-connected motor drives (still more than 80% in several industrial sectors). Other factors that have contributed to this recent shift in trend are the developments in power electronics, the increase in reliability of power converters, and the fact that life-cycle costs (initial cost plus cost of operation during the projected life of the drive) have become more important than initial investment in the drive-selection process, especially in HP applications.

This, in turn, places an ever-increasing burden on healthcare due to the increasing prevalence of patients with chronic illnesses and the reducing income-generating population base needed to sustain them. The need to urgently address this healthcare “time bomb” has accelerated the growth in ubiquitous, pervasive, distributed healthcare technologies. The current move from hospital-centric healthcare toward in-home health assessment is aimed at alleviating the burden on healthcare professionals, the health care system and caregivers. This shift will also further increase the comfort for the patient. Advances in signal acquisition, data storage and communication provide for the collection of reliable and useful in-home physiological data. Artifacts, arising from environmental, experimental and physiological factors, degrade signal quality and render the affected part of the signal useless. The magnitude and frequency of these artifacts significantly increases when data collection is moved from the clinic into the home. Signal processing advances have brought about significant improvement in artifact removal over the past few years. This paper reviews the physiological signals most likely to be recorded in the home, documenting the artifacts which occur most frequently and which have the largest degrading effect. A detailed analysis of current artifact removal techniques will then be presented. An evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the proposed artifact detection and removal techniques, with particular application to the personal healthcare domain, is provided.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2012.2188536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6156441","Adaptive Filter;artifact removal;blind source separation (BSS);canonical correlation analysis (CCA);independent component analysis (ICA);Kalman filter;personal healthcare;Wiener filter","Medical services;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Optical variables measurement","Artifacts;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Humans;Monitoring, Physiologic;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Statistics as Topic","275","3","105","IEEE","22 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, a novel Lyapunov functional is constructed to obtain sufficient conditions under which the dynamical network is exponentially mean-square stable.

Existing saliency detection models are built in the uncompressed domain. Since most images over Internet are typically stored in the compressed domain such as joint photographic experts group (JPEG), we propose a novel saliency detection model in the compressed domain in this paper. The intensity, color, and texture features of the image are extracted from discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in the JPEG bit-stream. Saliency value of each DCT block is obtained based on the Hausdorff distance calculation and feature map fusion. Based on the proposed saliency detection model, we further design an adaptive image retargeting algorithm in the compressed domain. The proposed image retargeting algorithm utilizes multioperator operation comprised of the block-based seam carving and the image scaling to resize images. A new definition of texture homogeneity is given to determine the amount of removal block-based seams. Thanks to the directly derived accurate saliency information from the compressed domain, the proposed image retargeting algorithm effectively preserves the visually important regions for images, efficiently removes the less crucial regions, and therefore significantly outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art algorithms, as demonstrated with the in-depth analysis in the extensive experiments.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2199126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6199980","Compressed domain;image retargeting;joint photographic experts group (JPEG);saliency detection;texture homogeneity","Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Transform coding;Image coding;Image color analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Visualization","","273","1","45","IEEE","14 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm for optimally managing a large number of PHEVs (e.g., 3000) charging at a municipal parking station.

Indoor localization can be enabled through wideband or ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) transmission, due to its fine delay resolution and obstacle-penetration capabilities. A major hurdle is the presence of obstacles that block the line-of-sight (LOS) path between devices, affecting ranging performance and, in turn, localization accuracy. Many techniques have been proposed to address this issue, most of which make modifications to the localization algorithm. Since many localization algorithms work with distance or angle estimates, rather than received waveforms, information inherent in the wideband waveform is lost, leading to sub-optimal ranging error mitigation. To avoid this information loss, we present a novel approach to mitigate ranging errors directly in the physical layer. In contrast to existing techniques, which detect the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) condition, our approach directly mitigates the bias incurred in both LOS and non-LOS conditions. In particular, we apply two classes of non-parametric regressors to form an estimate of the ranging error. Our work is based on, and validated by, an extensive indoor measurement campaign with FCC-compliant UWB radios. The results show that the proposed regressors provide significant performance improvements in various practical localization scenarios, compared to conventional approaches.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.042712.110035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6192275","Localization;UWB;ranging error mitigation;support vector machine;Gaussian processes;Bayesian learning","Distance measurement;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Training;Databases;Delay;Niobium","","271","1","70","IEEE","30 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many reported results have shown that IT2 FLCs are better able to handle uncertainties than their type-1 (T1) counterparts. A challenging question is the following: What are the fundamental differences between IT2 and T1 FLCs? Once the fundamental differences are clear, we can better understand the advantages of IT2 FLCs and, hence, make better use of them. This paper explains two fundamental differences between IT2 and T1 FLCs: 1) Adaptiveness, meaning that the embedded T1 fuzzy sets used to compute the bounds of the type-reduced interval change as input changes; and 2) Novelty, meaning that the upper and lower membership functions of the same IT2 fuzzy set may be used simultaneously in computing each bound of the type-reduced interval. T1 FLCs do not have these properties; thus, a T1 FLC cannot implement the complex control surface of an IT2 FLC given the same rulebase. We also present several methods to visualize and analyze the effects of these two fundamental differences, including the control surface, the P-map, the equivalent generalized T1 fuzzy sets, and the equivalent PI gains. Finally, we examine five alternative type reducers for IT2 FLCs and explain why they do not capture the fundamentals of IT2 FLCs.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2186818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6145645","Continuity;equivalent generalized type-1 fuzzy sets (EGT1FSs);equivalent PI gains;interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2 FLC);P-map","Frequency selective surfaces;Xenon;Uncertainty;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Switches;Steady-state","","271","","69","IEEE","3 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although this is a generic super-resolution (SR) problem, our target application is SAR tomography (TomoSAR), where typically the number of acquisitions is N = 10 - 100 and SNR = 0-10 dB. As the TomoSAR algorithm, we introduce ""Scale-down by LI norm Minimization, Model selection, and Estimation Reconstruction"" (SL1MMER), which is a spectral estimation algorithm based on compressive sensing, model order selection, and final maximum likelihood parameter estimation. We investigate the limits of SLIMMER concerning the following questions. How accurately can the positions of two closely spaced scatterers be estimated? What is the closest distance of two scat- terers such that they can be separated with a detection rate of 50% by assuming a uniformly distributed phase difference? How many acquisitions N are required for a robust estimation (i.e., for separating two scatterers spaced by one Rayleigh resolution unit with a probability of 90%)? For all of these questions, we provide numerical results, simulations, and analytical approxima- tions. Although we take TomoSAR as the preferred application, the SLIMMER algorithm and our results on SR are generally applicable to sparse spectral estimation, including SR SAR focus- ing of point-like objects. Our results are approximately applicable to nonlinear least-squares estimation, and hence, although it is derived experimentally, they can be considered as a fundamental bound for SR of spectral estimators. We show that SR factors are in the range of 1.5-25 for the aforementioned parameter ranges of N and SNR.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2160183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5966335","Compressive sensing (CS);SAR tomography (TomoSAR);SL1MMER;spectral estimation;super-resolution (SR);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Estimation;Strontium;Robustness;Minimization;Tomography;Noise;Image resolution","","270","1","30","IEEE","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We provide a generic optimization framework for linear precoding design to handle any objective functions of data rate with general linear and nonlinear power constraints. To achieve this, an iterative algorithm which optimizes the precoding vectors and power allocation alternatingly is proposed and most importantly, the proposed algorithm is proved to always converge. The proposed optimization algorithm is also applicable to nonlinear dirty paper coding. As a special case, a more efficient algorithm is devised to find the optimal solution to the problem of maximizing the proportional fairness among served users. In addition, the aforementioned problems and algorithms are extended to the case that each terminal has multiple co-polarization or dual-polarization antennas. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance improvement of the proposed schemes over conventional multibeam satellite systems, zero-forcing and regularized zero-forcing precoding schemes in terms of meeting the traffic demand, e.g., using real beam patterns, over twice higher throughput can be achieved compared with the conventional scheme.

However, the introduction of microgrids brings some challenges such as the protection of a microgrid and its entities. Due to the existence of generators at all levels of the distribution system, the fault currents vary substantially. Furthermore, grid connected and islanded modes introduce two different sets of fault currents. Consequently, the traditional fixed current relay protection schemes need to be improved. The authors developed a new protection system which utilizes extensive communication to monitor the microgrid and update relay fault currents according to the variations in the system. This system is designed to respond to dynamic changes in the system such as connection/disconnection of DGs. This paper presents the modeling of a microgrid protection system with logical nodes provided in IEC61850 and IEC61850-7-420 communication standards. It also demonstrates how the proposed communication takes place through logical nodes. Firstly, models for different DGs are provided to detail the implementation of the said logical nodes.

This paper presents a novel algorithm, called self-learning particle swarm optimizer (SLPSO), for global optimization problems. In SLPSO, each particle has a set of four strategies to cope with different situations in the search space. The cooperation of the four strategies is implemented by an adaptive learning framework at the individual level, which can enable a particle to choose the optimal strategy according to its own local fitness landscape.

In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient approach based on adaptive step-size least mean squares (AS-LMS) adaptive filter for reducing MA in corrupted PPG signals. The presented method is an extension to our prior work on efficient use of adaptive filters for reduction of MA in PPG signals. The novelty of the method lies in the fact that a synthetic noise reference signal for an adaptive filtering process, representing MA noise, is generated internally from the MA-corrupted PPG signal itself instead of using any additional hardware such as accelerometer or source-detector pair for acquiring noise reference signal. Thus, the generated noise reference signal is then applied to the AS-LMS adaptive filter for artifact removal. While experimental results proved the efficacy of the proposed scheme, the merit of the method is clearly demonstrated using convergence and correlation analysis, thus making it best suitable for present-day pulse oximeters utilizing PPG sensor head with a single pair of source and detector, which does not have any extra hardware meant for capturing noise reference signal. In addition to arterial oxygen saturation estimation, the artifact reduction method facilitated the waveform contour analysis on artifact-reduced PPG, and the conventional parameters were evaluated for assessing the arterial stiffness.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2011.2175832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6111474","Adaptive step-size least mean squares (AS-LMS) adaptive filter;motion artifact (MA);oxygen saturation;photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal;pulse oximeter","Noise;Hardware;Least squares approximation;Vectors;Accelerometers;Equations;Probes","","269","2","31","IEEE","22 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To magnify the torque generated by an electric motor in the limited space of the compact device, a worm gear is utilized. However, the actual torque amplification ratio provided by the worm gear is different from the nominal speed reduction ratio due to friction, which makes the controller design challenging. In this paper, the friction effect is considered in the model of cRSEA, and a robust control algorithm is designed to precisely control the torque output in the presence of nonlinearities such as the friction. The mechanical design and dynamic model of the proposed device and the design of a robust control algorithm are discussed, and actuation performance is verified by experiments.

LARS exploits user rating locations through user partitioning, a technique that influences recommendations with ratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that maximizes system scalability while not sacrificing recommendation quality. LARS exploits item locations using travel penalty, a technique that favors recommendation candidates closer in travel distance to querying users in a way that avoids exhaustive access to all spatial items. LARS can apply these techniques separately, or in concert, depending on the type of location-based rating available. Experimental evidence using large-scale real-world data from both the Foursquare location-based social network and the Movie Lens movie recommendation system reveals that LARS is efficient, scalable, and capable of producing recommendations twice as accurate compared to existing recommendation approaches.","2375-026X","978-0-7695-4747-3","10.1109/ICDE.2012.54","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228105","","Collaboration;Maintenance engineering;Scalability;Merging;Recommender systems;Computational modeling;Motion pictures","","268","1","30","IEEE","2 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The basis of our analysis are brightness temperature (TB) measurements from the spaceborne microwave radiometer WindSat and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager, which are collocated with independent measurements of surface wind speeds and directions. This allows the determination of the emissivity model function for Earth incidence angles (EIA) around 55°. We demonstrate that an essential part in the model development is the absolute calibration of the radiometer measurements over the ocean to the computed TB of the radiative transfer model, one of whose components the emissivity model function is. We combine our results with other established measurements for lower EIA and finally obtain a model function which can be used over the whole EIA range between 0° and 65°. Results for both the isotropic, wind direction independent part as well as the four Stokes parameters of the wind direction signal are presented.

The proposed operational strategy is mainly focused on generation scheduling and demand side management. In generation scheduling, schedule coordinator agent executes a two-stage scheduling: day-ahead and real-time scheduling. The day-ahead scheduling finds out hourly power settings of distributed energy resources (DERs) from a day-ahead energy market. The real-time scheduling updates the power settings of the distributed energy resources by considering the results of the day-ahead scheduling and feedback from real-time operation of the microgrid in real-time digital simulator (RTDS). A demand side management agent performs load shifting before the day-ahead scheduling, and does load curtailing in real-time whenever it is necessary and possible. The distributed multiagent model proposed in this paper provides a common communication interface for all components of the microgrid to interact with one another for autonomous intelligent control actions. Furthermore, the multiagent system maximizes the power production of local distributed generators, minimizes the operational cost of the microgrid, and optimizes the power exchange between the main power grid and the microgrid subject to system constraints and constraints of distributed energy resources.

When multispectral images having B spectral bands are considered, an effective solution to this problem is to exploit all available spectral channels in the framework of supervised or partially supervised approaches. However, in many real applications, it is difficult/impossible to collect ground truth information for either multitemporal or single-date images. On the opposite, unsupervised methods available in the literature are not effective in handling the full information present in multispectral and multitemporal images. They usually consider a simplified subspace of the original feature space having small dimensionality and, thus, characterized by a possible loss of change information. In this paper, we present a framework for the detection of multiple changes in bitemporal and multispectral remote sensing images that allows one to overcome the limits of standard unsupervised methods. The framework is based on the following: 1) a compressed yet efficient 2-D representation of the change information and 2) a two-step automatic decision strategy.

The solution is based on massive deployment of small cells by leveraging high frequency reuse at high frequency bands in conjunction with a Macrocell. The presence, discovery and usage of the small cells are controlled dynamically by a Macrocell in a master-slave configuration hence they are called Phantom Cells. To realize this concept, a new method of managing the connections between mobile terminals and small cell nodes is introduced. It is achieved by splitting the Control and User (C/U) planes of the radio link. The combination of C/U-plane split and Phantom Cells can achieve high capacity enhancement using small cells at the same time taking into consideration mobility, scalability and flexibility requirements for massive deployment. The advantages of this approach as well as the implementation aspects are described in the paper. Simulations were also conducted to verify the concept and the results show some promising capacity enhancements. The rest of the paper describes the Phantom Cell concept as well as the challenges of deploying small cells in LTE networks.","2166-0077","978-1-4673-4941-3","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477646","LTE;C-plane/U-plane Split;Phantom Cell;HetNet","Phantoms;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Macrocell networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Interference;Data transfer","","266","51","20","IEEE","14 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The two existing optical OFDM (O-OFDM) transmission schemes, asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) and direct-current-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM), are studied. Time domain signal clipping generally results from direct current (DC) biasing and/or from physical limitations of the transmitter front-end. These include insufficient forward biasing and the maximum power driving limit of the emitter. The clipping noise can be modeled according to the Bussgang theorem and the central limit theorem (CLT) as attenuation of the data-carrying subcarriers at the receiver and addition of zero-mean complex-valued Gaussian noise. Analytical expressions for the attenuation factor and the clipping noise variance are determined in closed-form and employed in the derivation of the electrical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The validity of the model is verified through a Monte Carlo bit-error ratio (BER) simulation. Finally, the BER performance of ACO-OFDM with DCO-OFDM is compared for different clipping levels and multi-level quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) schemes.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.022712.100493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162931","Wireless communication;optical devices;OFDM;Gaussian processes;non-linear distortion","Optical transmitters;Optical distortion;Optical attenuators;OFDM;Optical receivers;Time domain analysis;Noise","","265","","30","IEEE","1 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm, proposed in this paper, extracts the texture feature by using wavelet transform; then, it forms a feature vector composed of kurtosis value of wavelet energy feature of SAR image. In the next step, segmentation of different textures is applied by using feature vector and level set function. At last, an SVM classifier is designed and trained by using normalized feature vectors of each region texture. The testing sets of SAR images are segmented by this trained SVM.

Time-of-arrival (TOA) localization is ideally suited for high-precision localization of objects in particular in indoor environments, where GPS is not available. This paper considers the case where one transmitter and multiple, distributed, receivers are used to estimate the location of a passive (reflecting) object. It furthermore focuses on the situation when the transmitter and receivers can be synchronized, so that TOA (as opposed to time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)) information can be used. We propose a novel, Two-Step estimation (TSE) algorithm for the localization of the object. We then derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for TOA and show that it is an order of magnitude lower than the CRLB of TDOA in typical setups. The TSE algorithm achieves the CRLB when the TOA measurements are subject to small Gaussian-distributed errors, which is verified by analytical and simulation results. Moreover, practical measurement results show that the estimation error variance of TSE can be 33 dB lower than that of TDOA based algorithms.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.040412.110697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184254","TOA;TDOA;location estimation;CRLB","Receivers;Estimation;Synchronization;Vectors;Radio transmitters;Source separation","","263","1","39","IEEE","16 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ho","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA",IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,"12 Apr 2012","2012","60","5","2101","2114","This paper proposes two methods to reduce the bias of the well-known algebraic explicit solution (Chan and Ho, “A simple and efficient estimator for hyperbolic location,” IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 42, pp. 1905–1915, Aug. 1994) for source localization using TDOA. Bias of a source location estimate is significant when the measurement noise is large and the geolocation geometry is poor. Bias also dominates performance when multiple times of independent measurements are available such as in UWB localization or in target tracking. The paper starts by deriving the bias of the source location estimate from Chan and Ho. The bias is found to be considerably larger than that of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Two methods, called BiasSub and BiasRed, are developed to reduce the bias. The BiasSub method subtracts the expected bias from the solution of Chan and Ho's work, where the expected bias is approximated by the theoretical bias using the estimated source location and noisy data measurements. The BiasRed method augments the equation error formulation and imposes a constraint to improve the source location estimate. The BiasSub method requires the exact knowledge of the noise covariance matrix and BiasRed only needs the structure of it. Analysis shows that both methods reduce the bias considerably and achieve the CRLB performance for distant source when the noise is Gaussian and small. The BiasSub method can nearly eliminate the bias and the BiasRed method is able to lower the bias to the same level as the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. The BiasRed method is extended for TDOA and FDOA positioning. Simulations corroborate the performance of the proposed methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2187283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151186","Bias;localization;FDOA;TDOA","Closed-form solutions;Noise measurement;Position measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Vectors;Covariance matrix","","263","","28","IEEE","10 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method is based on the utilization of the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) technique, and the Mixture of Gaussians Hidden Markov Models (MoG-HMM). The method relies on two phases: an off-line phase, and an on-line phase. During the first phase, the raw data provided by the sensors are first processed to extract features in the form of WPD coefficients. The extracted features are then fed to dedicated learning algorithms to estimate the parameters of a corresponding MoG-HMM, which best fits the degradation phenomenon. The generated model is exploited during the second phase to continuously assess the current health state of the physical component, and to estimate its RUL value with the associated confidence. The developed method is tested on benchmark data taken from the “NASA prognostics data repository” related to several experiments of failures on bearings done under different operating conditions. Furthermore, the method is compared to traditional time-feature prognostics and simulation results are given at the end of the paper. The results of the developed prognostics method, particularly the estimation of the RUL, can help improving the availability, reliability, and security while reducing the maintenance costs. Indeed, the RUL and associated confidence value are relevant information which can be used to take appropriate maintenance and exploitation decisions. In practice, this information may help the maintainers to prepare the necessary material and human resources before the occurrence of a failure. Thus, the traditional maintenance policies involving corrective and preventive maintenance can be replaced by condition based maintenance.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2012.2194177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6190767","Condition monitoring;hidden Markov model;prognostics and health management;remaining useful life","Hidden Markov models;Degradation;Data models;Maintenance engineering;Analytical models;Monitoring;Mathematical model","","263","","57","IEEE","26 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To relax this idealized assumption, we propose hybrid relay selection (HRS) for relays with buffers of finite size. HRS is a combination of conventional best relay selection (BRS) and MMRS and takes into account both the channel state and the buffer state for relay selection. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the outage and symbol error probabilities of both MMRS and HRS for a decode-and-forward protocol in Rayleigh fading. This analysis reveals that BRS, HRS, and MMRS achieve the same diversity gain. However, for N relays, MMRS achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 3(1-1/N) dB compared to BRS, and HRS closely approaches the SNR gain of MMRS for moderate buffer sizes (e.g. 30 transmission intervals).","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.011012.110682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6130553","Cooperative relaying;relay selection;outage analysis;error rate analysis;relays with buffers","Relays;Signal to noise ratio;Markov processes;Fading;Buffer storage;Protocols;Gain","","263","2","18","IEEE","13 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The offshore container crane is used to load/unload containers between a huge container ship (called the “mother ship”) and a smaller ship (called the “mobile harbor”), on which the crane is installed. The purpose of the mobile harbor is to load/unload containers in the open sea and transport them to shallower water where they can be offloaded at existing conventional ports, thereby obviating the need for expansive and expensive new facilities. The load/unload control objective is to suppress the pendulum motion (i.e., “sway”) of the load in the presence of the wave- and wind-induced movements (heave, roll, and pitch) of the mobile harbor. A new mechanism for lateral sway control, therefore, is proposed as well. A sliding surface is designed in such a way that the longitudinal sway of the load is incorporated with the trolley dynamics. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by a control law derived for the purpose. The proposed new mechanism can suppress lateral sway, which functionality is not possible with conventional cranes.

The wrapper approach combines the power of exploration of the bats together with the speed of the Optimum-Path Forest classifier to find the set of features that maximizes the accuracy in a validating set. Experiments conducted in five public datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach can outperform some well-known swarm-based techniques.","2377-5416","978-0-7695-4829-6","10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2012.47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6382769","feature selection;bat algorithm;optimum-path forest","Accuracy;Training;Barium;Optimization;Prototypes;Equations;Vectors","","261","","20","IEEE","20 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been successfully applied to modeling the visual receptive fields of the cortical neurons. Sufficient experimental results in neuroscience suggest that the temporal slowness principle is a general learning principle in visual perception. In this paper, we introduce the SFA framework to the problem of human action recognition by incorporating the discriminative information with SFA learning and considering the spatial relationship of body parts. In particular, we consider four kinds of SFA learning strategies, including the original unsupervised SFA (U-SFA), the supervised SFA (S-SFA), the discriminative SFA (D-SFA), and the spatial discriminative SFA (SD--SFA), to extract slow feature functions from a large amount of training cuboids which are obtained by random sampling in motion boundaries. Afterward, to represent action sequences, the squared first order temporal derivatives are accumulated over all transformed cuboids into one feature vector, which is termed the Accumulated Squared Derivative (ASD) feature. The ASD feature encodes the statistical distribution of slow features in an action sequence. Finally, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is trained to classify actions represented by ASD features. We conduct extensive experiments, including two sets of control experiments, two sets of large scale experiments on the KTH and Weizmann databases, and two sets of experiments on the CASIA and UT-interaction databases, to demonstrate the effectiveness of SFA for human action recognition. Experimental results suggest that the SFA-based approach (1) is able to extract useful motion patterns and improves the recognition performance, (2) requires less intermediate processing steps but achieves comparable or even better performance, and (3) has good potential to recognize complex multiperson activities.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6136516","Human action recognition;slow feature analysis.","Feature extraction;Humans;Visualization;Neurons;Vectors;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Pattern recognition","Algorithms;Humans;Support Vector Machines;Visual Perception","260","1","49","IEEE","23 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The survey is organized around a novel model of the hand gesture recognition process. In the reviewed literature, 13 methods were found for hand localization and 11 were found for gesture classification. 24 of the papers included real-world applications to test a gesture recognition system, but only 8 application categories were found (and three applications accounted for 18 of the papers). The papers that use the Kinect and the OpenNI libraries for hand tracking tend to focus more on applications than on localization and classification methods, and show that the OpenNI hand tracking method is good enough for the applications tested thus far.

Approximate design exploits a tradeoff of accuracy in computation versus performance and power. However, required accuracy varies according to applications, and 100% accurate results are still required in some situations. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-configurable approximate (ACA) adder for which the accuracy of results is configurable during runtime. Because of its configurability, the ACA adder can adaptively operate in both approximate (inaccurate) mode and accurate mode. The proposed adder can achieve significant throughput improvement and total power reduction over conventional adder designs.

Renewable energy sources (RESs), mainly wind and solar, can reduce emissions from the electric energy sector; however, they are very intermittent. Likewise, next generation plug-in vehicles, which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, referred to as gridable vehicles (GVs) by the authors, can reduce emissions from the transportation sector. GVs can be used as loads, energy sources (small portable power plants) and energy storage units in a smart grid integrated with renewable energy sources. However, uncertainty surrounds the controllability of GVs. Forecasted load is used in unit commitment (UC); however, the actual load usually differs from the forecasted one. Thus, UC with plug-in vehicles under uncertainty in a smart grid is very complex considering smart charging and discharging to and from various energy sources and loads to reduce both cost and emissions. A set of valid scenarios is considered for the uncertainties of wind and solar energy sources, load and GVs. In this paper, an optimization algorithm is used to minimize the expected cost and emissions of the UC schedule for the set of scenarios.

The examined software codecs are HM 6.0 using Main Profile (MP) and JM 18.0 using High Profile (HiP). These codes are benchmarked under the all-intra (AI), random access (RA), low-delay B (LB), and low-delay P (LP) coding configurations. In order to obtain a fair comparison, JM HiP anchor codec has been configured to conform to HM MP settings and coding configurations. The rate-distortion comparisons rely on objective quality assessments, i.e., bit rate differences for equal PSNR. The complexities of HM and JM have been profiled at the cycle level with Intel VTune on Intel Core 2 Duo processor. The coding efficiency of HEVC is drastically better than that of AVC. According to our experiments, the average bit rate decrements of HM MP over JM HiP are 23%, 35%, 40%, and 35% under the AI, RA, LB, and LP configurations, respectively. However, HM achieves its coding gain with a realistic overhead in complexity. Our profiling results show that the average software complexity ratios of HM MP and JM HiP encoders are 3.2× in the AI case, 1.2× in the RA case, 1.5× in the LB case, and 1.3× in the LP case. The respective ratios with HM MP and JM HiP decoders are 2.0×, 1.6×, 1.5×, and 1.4×.

The harvested energy is modeled to arrive at the transmitter during the course of transmissions. The transmitter has a fixed number of packets to be delivered to each receiver. The objective is to minimize the time by which all of the packets are delivered to their respective destinations. To this end, we optimize the transmit powers and transmission rates in a deterministic setting. We first analyze the structural properties of the optimal transmission policy in a two-user broadcast channel via the dual problem of maximizing the departure region by a fixed time T. We prove that the optimal total transmit power sequence has the same structure as the optimal single-user transmit power sequence in . In addition, the total power is split optimally based on a cut-off power level; if the total transmit power is lower than this cut-off level, all transmit power is allocated to the stronger user; otherwise, all transmit power above this level is allocated to the weaker user. We then extend our analysis to an M-user broadcast channel. We show that the optimal total power sequence has the same structure as the two-user case and optimally splitting the total power among M users involves M-1 cut-off power levels. Using this structure, we propose an algorithm that finds the globally optimal policy. Our algorithm is based on reducing the broadcast channel problem to a single-user problem as much as possible. Finally, we illustrate the optimal policy and compare its performance with several suboptimal policies under different settings.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2011.120911.101813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6108309","Energy harvesting;rechargeable wireless networks;broadcast channels;transmission completion time minimization;throughput maximization","Transmitters;Energy harvesting;Receivers;Optimal scheduling;Wireless communication;Throughput","","255","","17","IEEE","19 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We argue that using anticipatory information from both the platoon's leader and the followers significantly impacts platoon string stability. The obtained simulation results suggest that the effects of communication delays may be almost completely canceled out. The platoon presents a very stable behavior, even when subjected to strong acceleration patterns. When the communication channel is subjected to a strong load, proper algorithms may be selected, lowering network load and maintaining string stability. Upon emergency occurrences, the platoon's timely response may be ensured by dynamically increasing the weight of the platoons' leaders data over the behavior of their followers. The simulation results suggest that the algorithms are robust under several demanding scenarios. To assess if current intervehicle communication technology can cope with the proposed information-updating schemes, research into its operation was conducted through a network simulator.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2011.2179936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6135795","Autonomous vehicles;intervehicle communication (IVC);network simulation;platooning;traffic information management;traffic simulation","Vehicles;Delay;Stability analysis;Lead;Acceleration;Mobile robots;Asynchronous transfer mode","","254","","46","IEEE","23 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Starting with a stochastic model for wind power production and a model for a perfectly competitive two-settlement market, we derive explicit formulae for optimal contract offerings and the corresponding optimal expected profit. As wind is an inherently variable source of energy, we explore the sensitivity of optimal expected profit to uncertainty in the underlying wind process. We also examine the role of forecast information and recourse markets in this setting.

The first one is considering local and global image patch rarities as two complementary processes. The second one is based on our observation that for different images, one of the RGB and Lab color spaces outperforms the other in saliency detection. We propose a framework that measures patch rarities in each color space and combines them in a final map. For each color channel, first, the input image is partitioned into non-overlapping patches and then each patch is represented by a vector of coefficients that linearly reconstruct it from a learned dictionary of patches from natural scenes. Next, two measures of saliency (Local and Global) are calculated and fused to indicate saliency of each patch. Local saliency is distinctiveness of a patch from its surrounding patches. Global saliency is the inverse of a patch's probability of happening over the entire image. The final saliency map is built by normalizing and fusing local and global saliency maps of all channels from both color systems. Extensive evaluation over four benchmark eye-tracking datasets shows the significant advantage of our approach over 10 state-of-the-art saliency models.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247711","","Image color analysis;Computational modeling;Humans;Visualization;Dictionaries;Adaptation models;Vectors","","253","4","53","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose deep learning as a natural source for obtaining additional, complementary representations. To learn features in high-resolution images, we make use of convolutional deep belief networks. Moreover, to take advantage of global structure in an object class, we develop local convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines, a novel convolutional learning model that exploits the global structure by not assuming stationarity of features across the image, while maintaining scalability and robustness to small misalignments. We also present a novel application of deep learning to descriptors other than pixel intensity values, such as LBP. In addition, we compare performance of networks trained using unsupervised learning against networks with random filters, and empirically show that learning weights not only is necessary for obtaining good multilayer representations, but also provides robustness to the choice of the network architecture parameters. Finally, we show that a recognition system using only representations obtained from deep learning can achieve comparable accuracy with a system using a combination of hand-crafted image descriptors. Moreover, by combining these representations, we achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-world face verification database.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247968","","Face;Face recognition;Training;Vectors;Accuracy;Measurement;Convolutional codes","","253","6","41","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These beams were automatically fabricated, and their physical performance was confirmed within 0.5-7.6% accuracy. We then demonstrate the automatic design of freeform soft robots for forward locomotion using soft volumetrically expanding actuator materials. One robot was fabricated automatically and assembled, and its performance was confirmed with 15% error. We suggest that this approach to design automation opens the door to leveraging the full potential of the freeform multimaterial design space to generate novel mechanisms and deformable robots.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2011.2172702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096440","Design automation;evolutionary robotics;soft robotics","Robots;Materials;Shape;Algorithm design and analysis;Design automation;Evolutionary computation;Collision avoidance","","251","6","33","IEEE","7 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rapid increase of available protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has made it possible to detect protein essentiality on network level. A series of centrality measures have been proposed to discover essential proteins based on network topology. However, most of them tended to focus only on the location of single protein, but ignored the relevance between interactions and protein essentiality. In this paper, a new centrality measure for identifying essential proteins based on edge clustering coefficient, named as NC, is proposed. Different from previous centrality measures, NC considers both the centrality of a node and the relationship between it and its neighbors. For each interaction in the network, we calculate its edge clustering coefficient. A node's essentiality is determined by the sum of the edge clustering coefficients of interactions connecting it and its neighbors. The new centrality measure NC takes into account the modular nature of protein essentiality. NC is applied to three different types of yeast protein-protein interaction networks, which are obtained from the DIP database, the MIPS database and the BioGRID database, respectively. The experimental results on the three different networks show that the number of essential proteins discovered by NC universally exceeds that discovered by the six other centrality measures: DC, BC, CC, SC, EC, and IC. Moreover, the essential proteins discovered by NC show significant cluster effect.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2011.147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081844","Essential proteins;protein interaction network;topology;centrality measures;edge clustering coefficient.","Proteins;Electronics packaging;Databases;Accuracy;Tin;Sensitivity;Bioinformatics","Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;Genes, Essential;Protein Interaction Maps;Reproducibility of Results;Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins;Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins","250","","50","IEEE","15 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our formulation, both the dictionary and the measurements are given by the data matrix, and the unknown sparse codes select the representatives via convex optimization. In general, we do not assume that the data are low-rank or distributed around cluster centers. When the data do come from a collection of low-rank models, we show that our method automatically selects a few representatives from each low-rank model. We also analyze the geometry of the representatives and discuss their relationship to the vertices of the convex hull of the data.

For each parking occurrence, load profile predictions properly take into account important factors, including actual state-of-charge of the battery, parking duration, parking type, and vehicle powertrain. Thus, the deterministic simulations capture the time history of vehicle driving and parking patterns using an equivalent 10 000 urban driving and parking days for the city of Winnipeg. These deterministic results are then compared to stochastic methods that differ in their treatment of how they model vehicle driving and charging habits. The new stochastic method introduced in this study more accurately captures the relationship of vehicle departure, arrival, and travel time compared to two previously used stochastic methods. It outperforms previous stochastic methods, having the lowest error at 3.4% when compared to the deterministic method for an electric sedan with a 24-kWhr battery pack. For regions where vehicle usage data is not available to predict plug-in electric vehicle load, the proposed stochastic method is recommended. In addition, using a combination of home, work, and commercial changing locales, and Level 1 versus Level 2 charging rates, deterministic simulations for urban run-out-of-charge events vary by less than 4% for seven charging scenarios selected. Using the vehicle usage data, charging scenarios simulated have no significant effect on urban run-out-of-charge events when the battery size for the electric sedan is increased. These results contribute towards utilities achieve a more optimal cost balance between: 1) charging infrastructure; 2) power transmission upgrades; 3) vehicle battery size; and 4) the addition of new renewable generation to address new electric vehicle loads for addressing energy drivers.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2162009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6017151","Plug-in electric vehicles;power generation peaking capacity;power generation planning;signal analysis","Vehicles;Stochastic processes;System-on-a-chip;Batteries;Nickel;Cities and towns;Predictive models","","250","5","25","IEEE","12 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cai and Wang's method (abbreviated as CW method) is a recent constrained optimization evolutionary algorithm proposed by the authors. However, its main shortcoming is that a trial-and-error process has to be used to choose suitable parameters. To overcome the above shortcoming, this paper proposes an improved version of the CW method, called CMODE, which combines multiobjective optimization with differential evolution to deal with constrained optimization problems. Like its predecessor CW, the comparison of individuals in CMODE is also based on multiobjective optimization. In CMODE, however, differential evolution serves as the search engine. In addition, a novel infeasible solution replacement mechanism based on multiobjective optimization is proposed, with the purpose of guiding the population toward promising solutions and the feasible region simultaneously. The performance of CMODE is evaluated on 24 benchmark test functions. It is shown empirically that CMODE is capable of producing highly competitive results compared with some other state-of-the-art approaches in the community of constrained evolutionary optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2010.2093582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6129404","Constrained optimization problems;constraint-handling technique;differential evolution;multiobjective optimization","Vectors;Evolutionary computation;Proposals;Pareto optimization;Benchmark testing;Diversity reception","","250","","42","IEEE","11 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous research shows that satisfactory accuracy in head pose and eye location estimation can be achieved in constrained settings. However, in the presence of nonfrontal faces, eye locators are not adequate to accurately locate the center of the eyes. On the other hand, head pose estimation techniques are able to deal with these conditions; hence, they may be suited to enhance the accuracy of eye localization. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid scheme is proposed to combine head pose and eye location information to obtain enhanced gaze estimation. To this end, the transformation matrix obtained from the head pose is used to normalize the eye regions, and in turn, the transformation matrix generated by the found eye location is used to correct the pose estimation procedure. The scheme is designed to enhance the accuracy of eye location estimations, particularly in low-resolution videos, to extend the operative range of the eye locators, and to improve the accuracy of the head pose tracker. These enhanced estimations are then combined to obtain a novel visual gaze estimation system, which uses both eye location and head information to refine the gaze estimates. From the experimental results, it can be derived that the proposed unified scheme improves the accuracy of eye estimations by 16% to 23%. Furthermore, it considerably extends its operating range by more than 15° by overcoming the problems introduced by extreme head poses. Moreover, the accuracy of the head pose tracker is improved by 12% to 24%. Finally, the experimentation on the proposed combined gaze estimation system shows that it is accurate (with a mean error between 2° and 5°) and that it can be used in cases where classic approaches would fail without imposing restraints on the position of the head.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2162740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959981","Eye center location;gaze estimation;head pose estimation","Head;Estimation;Three dimensional displays;Accuracy;Cameras;Solid modeling;Visualization","Eye;Eye Movements;Head;Head Movements;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Posture;Video Recording","250","17","51","IEEE","21 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the separate processes are not optimal. In this paper, we propose a sparse neighbor selection scheme for SR reconstruction. We first predetermine a larger number of neighbors as potential candidates and develop an extended Robust-SL0 algorithm to simultaneously find the neighbors and to solve the reconstruction weights. Recognizing that the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) for reconstruction should have similar local geometric structures based on clustering, we employ a local statistical feature, namely histograms of oriented gradients (HoG) of low-resolution (LR) image patches, to perform such clustering. By conveying local structural information of HoG in the synthesis stage, the k-NN of each LR input patch is adaptively chosen from their associated subset, which significantly improves the speed of synthesizing the HR image while preserving the quality of reconstruction. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method can achieve competitive SR quality compared with other state-of-the-art baselines.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2190080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6166881","Histograms of oriented gradients (HoG);neighbor embedding (NE);sparse representation;super-resolution (SR)","Strontium;Image reconstruction;Training data;Clustering algorithms;Vectors;Feature extraction;Training","","250","4","50","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first selected node operates in the conventional relay mode and assists the sources to deliver their data to the corresponding destinations using an amplify-and-forward protocol. The second and third nodes are used in different communication phases as jammers in order to create intentional interference upon the malicious eavesdropper. First, we find that in a topology where the intermediate nodes are randomly and sparsely distributed, the proposed schemes with cooperative jamming outperform the conventional nonjamming schemes within a certain transmitted power regime. We also find that, in the scenario where the intermediate nodes gather as a close cluster, the jamming schemes may be less effective than their nonjamming counterparts. Therefore, we introduce a hybrid scheme to switch between jamming and nonjamming modes.

In the improved analysis, details in the open circuit voltage, switching phase lag, and intermediate voltages among different phases are discussed, all of which lead to a better understanding on the working principle of SP-SSHI. The total power dissipation from the piezoelectric source is also investigated. It is of concern but has not been considered in the previous literatures. Both analyses and experiments show that, in terms of the harvested power, the higher the excitation level, the closer between SP-SSHI and ideal (externally powered) SSHI; at the same time, the more beneficial the adoption of SP-SSHI treatment in PEH, compared to the standard energy harvesting (SEH) technique.

Under this framework, we learn a robust decision function (referred to as target classifier) for label prediction of instances from the target domain by leveraging a set of base classifiers which are prelearned by using labeled instances either from the source domains or from the source domains and the target domain. With the base classifiers, we propose a new domain-dependent regularizer based on smoothness assumption, which enforces that the target classifier shares similar decision values with the relevant base classifiers on the unlabeled instances from the target domain. This newly proposed regularizer can be readily incorporated into many kernel methods (e.g., support vector machines (SVM), support vector regression, and least-squares SVM (LS-SVM)). For domain adaptation, we also develop two new domain adaptation methods referred to as FastDAM and UniverDAM. In FastDAM, we introduce our proposed domain-dependent regularizer into LS-SVM as well as employ a sparsity regularizer to learn a sparse target classifier with the support vectors only from the target domain, which thus makes the label prediction on any test instance very fast. In UniverDAM, we additionally make use of the instances from the source domains as Universum to further enhance the generalization ability of the target classifier. We evaluate our two methods on the challenging TRECIVD 2005 dataset for the large-scale video concept detection task as well as on the 20 newsgroups and email spam datasets for document retrieval.

As a first step, we propose extensions to controller platforms, switches, and base stations to enable controller applications to (i) express high-level policies based on subscriber attributes, rather than addresses and locations, (ii) apply real-time, fine-grained control through local agents on the switches, (iii)perform deep packet inspection and header compression on packets, and (iv)remotely manage shares of base-station resources.","2379-0369","978-1-4673-4554-5","10.1109/EWSDN.2012.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385040","CellSDN;software defined networks (SDN);local control agent","Base stations;Control systems;Quality of service;Protocols;Real-time systems;IP networks;Scalability","","248","15","13","IEEE","20 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous research results in literature have focused on the estimation of average tire-road friction coefficient for the entire vehicle. This paper explores the development of algorithms for reliable estimation of independent friction coefficients at each individual wheel of the vehicle. Three different observers are developed for the estimation of slip ratios and longitudinal tire forces, based on the types of sensors available. After estimation of slip ratio and tire force, the friction coefficient is identified using a recursive least-squares parameter identification formulation. The observers include one that utilizes engine torque, brake torque, and GPS measurements, one that utilizes torque measurements and an accelerometer and one that utilizes GPS measurements and an accelerometer. The developed algorithms are first evaluated in simulation and then evaluated experimentally on a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of estimating friction coefficients at the individual wheels reliably and quickly. The sensitivities of the observers to changes in vehicle parameters are evaluated and comparisons of robustness of the observers are provided.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2011.2159240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959213","Estimation;observer;tire-road friction coefficient;vehicle dynamics","Vehicle dynamics;Tires;Friction;Wheels;Estimation;Automotive engineering;Observers","","248","3","19","IEEE","21 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We prove that the optimal load vector ρ* that minimizes a generalized system performance function is the fixed point of a certain mapping. Based on this mapping, we propose and analyze an iterative distributed user association policy that adapts to spatial traffic loads and converges to a globally optimal allocation.

This makes it possible to provide strong theoretical guarantees on the privacy and utility of released data. While it is well-understood how to release data based on counts and simple functions under this guarantee, it remains to provide general purpose techniques to release data that is useful for a variety of queries. In this paper, we focus on spatial data such as locations and more generally any multi-dimensional data that can be indexed by a tree structure. Directly applying existing differential privacy methods to this type of data simply generates noise. We propose instead the class of ""private spatial decompositions'': these adapt standard spatial indexing methods such as quad trees and kd-trees to provide a private description of the data distribution. Equipping such structures with differential privacy requires several steps to ensure that they provide meaningful privacy guarantees. Various basic steps, such as choosing splitting points and describing the distribution of points within a region, must be done privately, and the guarantees of the different building blocks composed to provide an overall guarantee. Consequently, we expose the design space for private spatial decompositions, and analyze some key examples. A major contribution of our work is to provide new techniques for parameter setting and post-processing the output to improve the accuracy of query answers. Our experimental study demonstrates that it is possible to build such decompositions efficiently, and use them to answer a variety of queries privately with high accuracy.","2375-026X","978-0-7695-4747-3","10.1109/ICDE.2012.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228069","","Noise;Privacy;Noise measurement;Accuracy;Data privacy;Vegetation;Spatial databases","","247","","26","IEEE","2 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose two-phase distributed analog network coding, or distributed beamforming and power allocation to enhance the secrecy sum rate of the data exchange. In the first phase, the two terminals broadcast their information data simultaneously to all the relay nodes. In the second phase, three different security schemes are proposed: optimal beamforming, null-space beamforming, and artificial noise beamforming. In the first scheme, the objective is to achieve the maximum secrecy sum rate of the two terminals. Mathematically, the objective function is difficult to optimize. In the second scheme, we maximize the total information exchanged while we eliminate the information leakage completely, subject to the total transmission power constraint. We show that the problem has a unique and global optimum, which can be solved using bisection method. When the instantaneous channel state information of the eavesdropper is not available, we propose an artificial noise beamforming in the third scheme. We minimize the information transmission power so that the artificial noise power is maximized to eliminate information leakage, under the constraints of quality of service (QoS) required by terminals.

The 3-level converter enables smaller inductors (1 nH) than a buck, while generating a wide range of output voltages compared to a 1/2 mode switched-capacitor converter. The test-chip prototype delivers up to 0.85 A load current while generating output voltages from 0.4 to 1.4 V from a 2.4 V input supply. It achieves 77% peak efficiency at power density of 0.1 W/mm2 and 63% efficiency at maximum power density of 0.3 W/mm2. The converter scales output voltage from 0.4 V to 1.4 V (or vice-versa) within 20 ns at a constant 450 mA load current. A shunt regulator reduces peak-to-peak voltage noise from 0.27 V to 0.19 V under pseudo-randomly fluctuating load currents.

While face super-resolution (SR) methods can be employed to enhance the resolution of the images, the existing learning-based face SR methods do not perform well on such a VLR face image. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach to learn the relationship between the high-resolution image space and the VLR image space for face SR.

In all cases, their operation requirements are differently altered and their performance is negatively affected rendering them heterogeneous by nature. In the open literature, these networks are known as Intermittently Connected Networks (ICNs). The existing Internet protocols fail to operate properly in the context of ICNs, thus raising a variety of new challenging problems that are attracting the attention of the networking research community. Delay-/Disruption-Tolerant Networking emerged as a highly active area of research where networking experts compete in addressing the various ICN problems. Over time, unicast routing, one of the architectural key components common to all ICNs, became an almost independent field of research in which significant efforts continue to be invested. In contrast, network architectural designs, scheduling and forwarding issues dating from the early days of Inter-Planetary Networks (IPNs) have received relatively little attention and accumulate numerous pending challenges. Moreover, the gap caused by the lack of accurate ICN mathematical models is still large irrespective of some of the appreciated seminal works in this direction.

To go beyond simple greedy solutions for data association, recent approaches often perform multi-target tracking using discrete optimization. This has the disadvantage that trajectories need to be pre-computed or represented discretely, thus limiting accuracy. In this paper we instead formulate multi-target tracking as a discrete-continuous optimization problem that handles each aspect in its natural domain and allows leveraging powerful methods for multi-model fitting. Data association is performed using discrete optimization with label costs, yielding near optimality. Trajectory estimation is posed as a continuous fitting problem with a simple closed-form solution, which is used in turn to update the label costs. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our approach with state-of-the-art performance on several standard datasets.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247893","","Trajectory;Target tracking;Optimization;Labeling;Estimation;Splines (mathematics)","","244","1","27","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, conventional NMF learning methods require the entire dataset to reside in the memory and thus cannot be applied to large-scale or streaming datasets. In this paper, we propose an efficient online RSA-NMF algorithm (OR-NMF) that learns NMF in an incremental fashion and thus solves this problem. In particular, OR-NMF receives one sample or a chunk of samples per step and updates the bases via robust stochastic approximation. Benefitting from the smartly chosen learning rate and averaging technique, OR-NMF converges at the rate of in each update of the bases. Furthermore, we prove that OR-NMF almost surely converges to a local optimal solution by using the quasi-martingale. By using a buffering strategy, we keep both the time and space complexities of one step of the OR-NMF constant and make OR-NMF suitable for large-scale or streaming datasets. Preliminary experimental results on real-world datasets show that OR-NMF outperforms the existing online NMF (ONMF) algorithms in terms of efficiency. Experimental results of face recognition and image annotation on public datasets confirm the effectiveness of OR-NMF compared with the existing ONMF algorithms.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2197827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6203594","Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF);online NMF (ONMF);robust stochastic approximation","Complexity theory;Convergence;Approximation methods;Algorithm design and analysis;Robustness;Approximation algorithms;Streaming media","","244","","48","IEEE","22 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new LIVE Mobile Video Quality Assessment (VQA) database consists of 200 distorted videos created from 10 RAW HD reference videos, obtained using a RED ONE digital cinematographic camera. While the LIVE Mobile VQA database includes distortions that have been previously studied such as compression and wireless packet-loss, it also incorporates dynamically varying distortions that change as a function of time, such as frame-freezes and temporally varying compression rates. In this article, we describe the construction of the database and detail the human study that was performed on mobile phones and tablets in order to gauge the human perception of quality on mobile devices. The subjective study portion of the database includes both the differential mean opinion scores (DMOS) computed from the ratings that the subjects provided at the end of each video clip, as well as the continuous temporal scores that the subjects recorded as they viewed the video. The study involved over 50 subjects and resulted in 5,300 summary subjective scores and time-sampled subjective traces of quality. In the behavioral portion of the article we analyze human opinion using statistical techniques, and also study a variety of models of temporal pooling that may reflect strategies that the subjects used to make the final decision on video quality. Further, we compare the quality ratings obtained from the tablet and the mobile phone studies in order to study the impact of these different display modes on quality. We also evaluate several objective image and video quality assessment (IQA/VQA) algorithms with regards to their efficacy in predicting visual quality. A detailed correlation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing is carried out. Our general conclusion is that existing VQA algorithms are not well-equipped to handle distortions that vary over time.

We formulate video summarization as a novel dictionary selection problem using sparsity consistency, where a dictionary of key frames is selected such that the original video can be best reconstructed from this representative dictionary. An efficient global optimization algorithm is introduced to solve the dictionary selection model with the convergence rates as O(1/K2) (where K is the iteration counter), in contrast to traditional sub-gradient descent methods of O(1/√K). Our method provides a scalable solution for both key frame extraction and video skim generation, because one can select an arbitrary number of key frames to represent the original videos.

The performance of this synchronization technique is related to the quality of the consumed or delivered electric power. The synchronous-reference-frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) has been widely used due to its ease of operation and robust behavior. However, the estimated phase can have a considerable amount of unwanted ripple if the grid voltage disturbances are not properly rejected. The aim of this paper is to propose an adaptive SRF-PLL which strongly rejects these disturbances even if the fundamental frequency of the grid voltage varies. This is accomplished by using several adaptive infinite-impulse-response notch filters, implemented by means of an inherently stable Schur-lattice structure. This structure is perfectly suited to be programmed in fixed-point DSPs (i.e., it has high mapping precision, low roundoff accumulation, and suppression of quantization limit cycle oscillations). The proposed adaptive SRF-PLL has been tested by means of the TI TMS320F2812 DSP. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed synchronization method highly rejects the undesired harmonics even if the fundamental harmonic frequency of a highly polluted grid voltage abruptly varies.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2011.2166236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032093","Adaptive filters;adaptive signal processing;lattice filters;phase-locked loop;power grids;power quality;power system harmonics;three-phase electric power","Power harmonic filters;Harmonic analysis;IIR filters;Adaptive signal processing;Low pass filters;Adaptive filters;Power system stability;Harmonic analysis;Power system harmonics","","242","2","50","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, sliding-mode observers (SMOs) are designed to provide a bank of residuals for fault detection and isolation. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, a novel fault-diagnostic algorithm is proposed to estimate the actuator fault, which removes the classical assumption that the time derivative of the output errors should be known as in some existing work. Further, a novel fault-estimation observer is designed. Utilizing the estimated actuator fault, an accommodation scheme is proposed to compensate for the effect of the fault.

Grouping functions of this type complement the existing concept of overlap functions in a natural way, since the latter can be used to turn two degrees of weak preference into a degree of indifference.

As a result, accurate reconstruction of a spatially or temporally distributed phenomenon (f*) from Poisson data (y) cannot be effectively accomplished by minimizing a conventional penalized least-squares objective function. The problem addressed in this paper is the estimation of f* from y in an inverse problem setting, where the number of unknowns may potentially be larger than the number of observations and f* admits sparse approximation. The optimization formulation considered in this paper uses a penalized negative Poisson log-likelihood objective function with nonnegativity constraints (since Poisson intensities are naturally nonnegative).

This distribution of cloud-computing resources over many locations in the network may be done for several reasons, such as to locate resources closer to users, to reduce bandwidth costs, to increase availability, etc. To get the maximum benefit from a distributed cloud system, we need efficient algorithms for resource allocation which minimize communication costs and latency. In this paper, we develop efficient resource allocation algorithms for use in distributed clouds. Our contributions are as follows: Assuming that users specify their resource needs, such as the number of virtual machines needed for a large computational task, we develop an efficient 2-approximation algorithm for the optimal selection of data centers in the distributed cloud. Our objective is to minimize the maximum distance, or latency, between the selected data centers. Next, we consider use of a similar algorithm to select, within each data center, the racks and servers where the requested virtual machines for the task will be located. Since the network inside a data center is structured and typically a tree, we make use of this structure to develop an optimal algorithm for rack and server selection. Finally, we develop a heuristic for partitioning the requested resources for the task amongst the chosen data centers and racks. We use simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithms over example distributed cloud systems and find that our algorithms provide significant gains over other simpler allocation algorithms.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0775-8","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195847","","Switches","","240","7","16","IEEE","10 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It would be hard to find any other technology that is more undervalued scientifically and at the same time has bigger impact on the presence and future of engineered systems. The unique challenges in CPS integration emerge from the heterogeneity of components and interactions. This heterogeneity drives the need for modeling and analyzing cross-domain interactions among physical and computational/networking domains and demands deep understanding of the effects of heterogeneous abstraction layers in the design flow. To address the challenges of CPS integration, significant progress needs to be made toward a new science and technology foundation that is model based, precise, and predictable. This paper presents a theory of composition for heterogeneous systems focusing on stability. Specifically, the paper presents a passivity-based design approach that decouples stability from timing uncertainties caused by networking and computation. In addition, the paper describes cross-domain abstractions that provide effective solution for model-based fully automated software synthesis and high-fidelity performance analysis. The design objectives demonstrated using the techniques presented in the paper are group coordination for networked unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and high-confidence embedded control software design for a quadrotor UAV.

The network-on-chip (NoC) is an enabling technology for integration of large numbers of embedded cores on a single die. The existing method of implementing a NoC with planar metal interconnects is deficient due to high latency and significant power consumption arising out of long multi-hop links used in data exchange. The latency, power consumption and interconnect routing problems of conventional NoCs can be addressed by replacing or augmenting multi-hop wired paths with high-bandwidth single-hop long-range wireless links.

However, it is a challenge to inspect such defects in a vision system because of illumination inequality and the variation of reflection property of rail surfaces. This paper puts forward a real-time visual inspection system (VIS) for discrete surface defects. VIS first acquires a rail image by the image acquisition system, and then, it cuts the subimage of rail track by the track extraction algorithm. Subsequently, VIS enhances the contrast of the rail image using the local normalization (LN) method, which is nonlinear and illumination independent. At last, VIS detects defects using the defect localization based on projection profile (DLBP), which is robust to noise and very fast. Our experimental results demonstrate that VIS detects the Type-II defects with a recall of 93.10% and Type-I defects with a recall of 80.41%, and the proposed LN method and DLBP algorithm are better than the related well-established approaches. Furthermore, VIS is very fast with a linear computational time complexity, and it can be in real time to run on a 216-km/h test train under our experimental setup.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2012.2184959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151140","Discrete surface defects;local normalization (LN);projection profile;visual inspection","Rails;Inspection;Lighting;Visualization;Head;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces","","240","3","25","IEEE","10 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, we present a technique for comparing the octree data structures of consecutive point clouds. By encoding their structural differences, we can successively extend the point clouds at the decoder. In this way, we are able to detect and remove temporal redundancy from the point cloud data stream. Our experimental results show a strong compression performance of a ratio of 14 at 1 mm coordinate precision and up to 40 at a coordinate precision of 9 mm.","1050-4729","978-1-4673-1405-3","10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224647","","Octrees;Encoding;Decoding;Entropy;Real time systems;Sensors","","240","29","15","IEEE","28 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This problem is an extension of single channel sparse recovery, which lies at the heart of compressed sensing. Inspired by the links to array signal processing, a new family of MMV algorithms is considered that highlight the role of rank in determining the difficulty of the MMV recovery problem. The simplest such method is a discrete version of MUSIC which is guaranteed to recover the sparse vectors in the full rank MMV setting, under mild conditions. This idea is extended to a rank aware pursuit algorithm that naturally reduces to Order Recursive Matching Pursuit (ORMP) in the single measurement case while also providing guaranteed recovery in the full rank setting. In contrast, popular MMV methods such as Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SOMP) and mixed norm minimization techniques are shown to be rank blind in terms of worst case analysis. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the rank aware techniques are significantly better than existing methods in dealing with multiple measurements.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2173722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6145474","Compressed sensing;multiple measurement vectors;rank;sparse representations","Multiple signal classification;Vectors;Signal processing algorithms;Sparse matrices;Matching pursuit algorithms;Joints;Signal processing","","240","","49","IEEE","6 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of the statistical environment created inside a reverberation chamber, they offer a unique test facility. In particular, these chambers are ideally suited for performing radiated power measurements of either an antenna or device under test, and as such, it is possible to determine the efficiency of antennas. There have been several reverberation chamber techniques proposed over the years for measuring the antenna efficiency; however, these techniques require either the use of a reference antenna (i.e., an antenna with a known efficiency) and/or require the assumption that the two antennas used in the test have identical efficiencies. In this paper, we present three different approaches for determining both the radiation and total efficiencies of an unknown antenna that overcome these limitations and assumptions. We present a one-antenna approach, a two-antenna approach, and a three-antenna approach. We present measured data for three different antennas in order to compare these three approaches. We also discuss the uncertainties related to these types of measurements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2012.2186263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142030","Antenna measurements;antenna radiation efficiency;reverberation chambers;total efficiency;uncertainties","Antenna measurements;Equations;Receiving antennas;Reverberation chamber;Transmitting antennas;Frequency domain analysis","","240","","24","USGov","30 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Characterized by passing on the real-time wholesale electricity prices to the end consumers, real-time pricing creates a closed-loop feedback system between the physical layer and the market layer of the system. In the absence of a carefully designed control law, such direct feedback can increase sensitivity and lower the system's robustness to uncertainty in demand and generation. It is shown that price volatility can be characterized in terms of the system's maximal relative price elasticity, defined as the maximal ratio of the generalized price-elasticity of consumers to that of the producers. As this ratio increases, the system may become more volatile. Since new demand response technologies increase the price-elasticity of demand, and since increased penetration of distributed generation can also increase the uncertainty in price-based demand response, the theoretical findings suggest that the architecture under examination can potentially lead to increased volatility. This study highlights the need for assessing architecture systematically and in advance, in order to optimally strike the trade-offs between volatility/robustness and performance metrics such as economic efficiency and environmental efficiency.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2195037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6197252","Lyapunov analysis;marginal cost pricing;real-time pricing;volatility","Pricing;Real-time systems;Power system dynamics;Uncertainty;Load modeling;Power grids;Lyapunov methods","","240","1","38","IEEE","8 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Charging such vehicles will impose additional demands on the electricity network but given the pattern of vehicle usage, the possibility exists to discharge the stored energy back to the grid when required, for example when lower than expected wind generation is available. Such vehicle-to-grid operation could see vehicle owners supplying the grid if they are rewarded for providing such services. This paper describes a model of an electric vehicle storage system integrated with a standardized power system (the IEEE 30-node power system model). A decision-making strategy is established for the deployment of the battery energy stored, taking account of the state of charge, time of day, electricity prices and vehicle charging requirements. Applying empirical data, the benefits to the network in terms of load balancing and the energy and cost savings available to the vehicle owner are analyzed. The results show that for the case under study, the EVs have only a minor impact on the network in terms of distribution system losses and voltage regulation but more importantly the vehicle owner's costs are roughly halved.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2178043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6123186","Electric vehicle;power flow;state of charge;vehicle to grid","Batteries;Vehicles;Discharges;Power systems;System-on-a-chip;Load modeling;Electricity","","240","","23","IEEE","5 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes channel feedback reduction techniques based on the theory of compressive sensing, which permits the transmitter to obtain channel information with acceptable accuracy under substantially reduced feedback load.

The fundamental of this algorithm is discussed and the instantaneous variation rates of d- and q-axes currents are deduced when each converter voltage vector is applied in six different sectors. A Luenberger observer is constructed for parameter mismatch and model uncertainty which affect the performance of the MPC. The gains of the disturbance observer are determined by root-locus analysis. Moreover, the stability of the disturbance observer is analyzed when there are errors in the inductor filter parameter. The proposed method has an inherent rapid dynamic response as a result of the MPC controller, as well as robust control performance with respect to the disturbance due to use of the combined observation algorithm.

For cooperative sensing (CS) in cognitive radio networks, a distributed detection approach with displaced sensors and a fusion center (FC) is employed. For HD based CS, each secondary user (SU) sends a one-bit hard local decision to the FC. For SD based CS, each SU sends a quantized version of a local decision statistic such as the log-likelihood ratio or any suitable sufficient statistic. The decision statistics are sent through channels that may cause errors. The effects of channel errors are incorporated in the analysis through the bit error probability (BEP). For HD based CS, the counting rule or the K-out-of-N rule is used at the FC. For SD based CS, the optimal fusion rule in the presence of reporting channel errors is derived and its distribution is established. A comparison of the two schemes is conducted to show that there is a performance gain in using SD based CS even in the presence of reporting channel errors. In addition, a BEP wall is shown to exist for CS such that if the BEP is above a certain value, then irrespective of the received signal strength corresponding to the primary user, the constraints on false alarm probability and detection probability cannot be met. It is shown that the performance of HD based CS is very sensitive to the BEP wall phenomenon while the SD based CS is more robust in that sense.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2170978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6036191","BEP wall;counting rule;distributed sensing;multi-bit decision statistics;performance analysis","High definition video;Quantization;Detectors;Probability;Lead;Signal to noise ratio","","239","","34","IEEE","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The impact of wind will be seen in the reserves for nonevent operation (normal operation dealing with deviations from schedules). Wind power will also result in some events of larger variability and large forecast errors that could be categorized as slow events.

Moreover, the data missing phenomena are modeled by introducing a diagonal matrix composed of Bernoulli distributed stochastic variables taking values of 1 and 0, which describes that the data from different sensors may be lost with different missing probabilities. Subsequently, a sufficient condition is first derived in virtue of the method of sector-bounded uncertainties, which guarantees that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable and the controlled output satisfies H∞ performance constraint for all nonzero exogenous disturbances under the zero-initial condition. Then, the sufficient condition is decoupled into some inequalities for the convenience of practical verification. Based on that, quantized H∞ controllers are designed successfully for some special classes of nonlinear stochastic time-delay systems by using Matlab linear matrix inequality toolbox.

Mukherjee","DOCOMO Innovations, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA",IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,"22 Mar 2012","2012","30","3","575","585","The Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio (SINR) on a wireless link is an important basis for consideration of outage, capacity, and throughput in a cellular network. It is therefore important to understand the SINR distribution within such networks, and in particular heterogeneous cellular networks, since these are expected to dominate future network deployments . Until recently the distribution of SINR in heterogeneous networks was studied almost exclusively via simulation, for selected scenarios representing pre-defined arrangements of users and the elements of the heterogeneous network such as macro-cells, femto-cells, etc. However, the dynamic nature of heterogeneous networks makes it difficult to design a few representative simulation scenarios from which general inferences can be drawn that apply to all deployments. In this paper, we examine the downlink of a heterogeneous cellular network made up of multiple tiers of transmitters (e.g., macro-, micro-, pico-, and femto-cells) and provide a general theoretical analysis of the distribution of the SINR at an arbitrarily-located user. Using physically realistic stochastic models for the locations of the base stations (BSs) in the tiers, we can compute the general SINR distribution in closed form. We illustrate a use of this approach for a three-tier network by calculating the probability of the user being able to camp on a macro-cell or an open-access (OA) femto-cell in the presence of Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) femto-cells. We show that this probability depends only on the relative densities and transmit powers of the macro- and femto-cells, the fraction of femto-cells operating in OA vs. Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) mode, and on the parameters of the wireless channel model.

In this paper, the IDBB converter is analyzed, and a design methodology is proposed. It is demonstrated that, with a careful design of the converter, the filter capacitances can be made small enough so that film capacitors may be used.

This can be useful either to increase the flexibility of comfort systems or, in the more interesting case, to detect potentially dangerous situations as early as possible. In this contribution, a novel approach for trajectory prediction is proposed which has the capability to predict the vehicle's trajectory several seconds in advance, the so called long-term prediction. To achieve this, previously observed motion patterns are used to infer a joint probability distribution as motion model. Using this distribution, a trajectory can be predicted by calculating the probability for the future motion, conditioned on the current observed history motion pattern. The advantage of the probabilistic modeling is that the result is not only a prediction, but rather a whole distribution over the future trajectories and a specific prediction can be made by the evaluation of the statistical properties, e.g. the mean of this conditioned distribution. Additionally, an evaluation of the variance can be used to examine the reliability of the prediction.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-2118-1","10.1109/IVS.2012.6232277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6232277","","Trajectory;Chebyshev approximation;Predictive models;Vehicles;History;Probabilistic logic","","238","","17","IEEE","5 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that there exists a requirement on the network over which an unstable plant can be stabilized. In the case of state feedback, necessary and sufficient conditions on the network for mean square stabilizability are derived. Under a parallel transmission strategy and the assumption that the overall mean square capacity of the network is fixed and can be assigned among parallel input channels, a tight lower bound on the overall mean square capacity for mean square stabilizability is presented in terms of the Mahler measure of the plant. The minimal overall capacity for stabilizability is also provided under a serial transmission strategy. For the case of dynamic output feedback, a tight lower bound on the capacity requirement for stabilization of SISO plants is given in terms of the anti-stable poles, nonminimum phase zeros and relative degree of the plant. Sufficient and necessary conditions are further derived for triangularly decoupled MIMO plants. The effect of pre- and post-channel processing and channel feedback is also discussed, where the channel feedback is identified as a key component in eliminating the limitation on stabilization induced by the nonminimum phase zeros and high relative degree of the plant.

The method proposed here enables the detection of a much larger range of facial behavior by recognizing facial muscle actions [action units (AUs)] that compound expressions. AUs are agnostic, leaving the inference about conveyed intent to higher order decision making (e.g., emotion recognition). The proposed fully automatic method not only allows the recognition of 22 AUs but also explicitly models their temporal characteristics (i.e., sequences of temporal segments: neutral, onset, apex, and offset). To do so, it uses a facial point detector based on Gabor-feature-based boosted classifiers to automatically localize 20 facial fiducial points. These points are tracked through a sequence of images using a method called particle filtering with factorized likelihoods. To encode AUs and their temporal activation models based on the tracking data, it applies a combination of GentleBoost, support vector machines, and hidden Markov models. We attain an average AU recognition rate of 95.3% when tested on a benchmark set of deliberately displayed facial expressions and 72% when tested on spontaneous expressions.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2163710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6020812","Facial expression analysis;GentleBoost;particle filtering;spatiotemporal facial behavior analysis;support vector machine (SVM)","Face;Detectors;Face recognition;Hidden Markov models;Gold;Image sequences;Emotion recognition","Artificial Intelligence;Facial Expression;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Subtraction Technique;Video Recording","237","","87","IEEE","15 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These variable speed systems have several advantages over the traditional wind turbine operating methods, such as the reduction of the mechanical stress and an increase in the energy capture. To fully exploit this latest advantage, many control schemes have been developed for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control schemes. In this context, this paper proposes a second-order sliding mode to control the wind turbine DFIG according to references given by an MPPT. Traditionally, the desired DFIG torque is tracked using control currents. However, the estimations used to define current references drive some inaccuracies mainly leading to nonoptimal power extraction. Therefore, using robust control, such as the second-order sliding mode, will allow one to directly track the DFIG torque leading to maximum power extraction. Moreover, the proposed control strategy presents attractive features such as chattering-free behavior (no extra mechanical stress), finite reaching time, and robustness with respect to external disturbances (grid) and unmodeled dynamics (generator and turbine). Simulations using the wind turbine simulator FAST and experiments on a 7.5-kW real-time simulator are carried out for the validation of the proposed high-order sliding mode control approach.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2011.2181515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6130597","Control;doubly fed induction generator (DFIG);second-order sliding mode (SOSM);wind turbine (WT)","Wind turbines;Aerodynamics;Torque;Generators;Rotors;Control systems","","237","","22","IEEE","13 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main purpose of this paper is to design a fuzzy fault detection filter such that the overall fault detection dynamics is exponentially stable in the mean square and, at the same time, the error between the residual signal and the fault signal is made as small as possible. Sufficient conditions are first established via intensive stochastic analysis for the existence of the desired fuzzy fault detection filters, and then, the corresponding solvability conditions for the desired filter gains are established.

In this paper, a design procedure is introduced for using this converter as a wide output range voltage source. Unlike constant output voltage applications which need small converter inductance ratio and narrow switching frequency variations, for wide output range applications, large values of these parameters are needed simultaneously and should be optimized. Instead of minimizing the components stresses, leading to a great value of the inductance ratio, proper choice of the converter parameters resulting in a smaller inductance ratio has been done. Maximum value of the capacitor in parallel with the power MOSFETs drain-sources has been derived to realize the zero voltage switching operation in the converter inductive region. Soft switching is achieved for all power devices under all operating conditions. A prototype of the converter has been tested for different regulated output voltages (35–165 V$_{\rm dc}$ ) under different loads (0–3 A$_{\rm dc}$) and input voltages (320–370 V$_{\rm dc}$) for using an ion implanter arc power supply, with maximum efficiency value of 94.7%.

This principle is to use standard MVDR beamformer in tandem with an estimate of the desired signal steering vector found based on some imprecise prior information. Differences between various MVDR RAB techniques occur only because of the differences in the assumed prior information and the corresponding signal steering vector estimation techniques. A new MVDR RAB technique, which uses as little as possible and easy to obtain imprecise prior information, is developed. The objective for estimating the steering vector is the maximization of the beamformer output power, while the constraints are the normalization condition and the requirement that the estimate does not converge to any of the interference steering vectors and their linear combinations. The prior information used is only the imprecise knowledge of the antenna array geometry and angular sector in which the actual steering vector lies. Mathematically, the proposed MVDR RAB is expressed as the well known non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem with two constraints, which can be efficiently and exactly solved. Some new results for the corresponding optimization problem such as a new algebraic way of finding the rank-one solution from the general-rank solution of the relaxed problem and the condition under which the solution of the relaxed problem is guaranteed to be rank-one are derived.

During the engineering science revolution, curricula moved from hands-on practice to mathematical modeling and scientific analyses. The first shift was initiated by engineering faculty members from Europe; accelerated during World War II, when physicists contributed multiple engineering breakthroughs; codified in the Grinter report; and kick-started by Sputnik. Did accreditation hinder curricular innovations? Were engineering graduates ready for practice? Spurred by these questions, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) required engineering programs to formulate outcomes, systematically assess achievement, and continuously improve student learning. The last three shifts are in progress. Since the engineering science revolution may have marginalized design, a distinctive feature of engineering, faculty members refocused attention on capstone and first-year engineering design courses. However, this third shift has not affected the two years in between. Fourth, research on learning and education continues to influence engineering education. Examples include learning outcomes and teaching approaches, such as cooperative learning and inquiry that increase student engagement. In shift five, technologies (e.g., the Internet, intelligent tutors, personal computers, and simulations) have been predicted to transform education for over 50 years; however, broad transformation has not yet been observed. Together, these five shifts characterize changes in engineering education over the past 100 years.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2012.2190167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6185632","Accreditation;design;engineering education;engineering science;instructional technologies;learning","Educational institutions;Accreditation;Technological innovation;Engineering education;Engineering students;Engineering profession;Education","","236","","224","IEEE","17 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that this can be done at the fundamental switching frequency without measuring the capacitor voltages or using any other form of feedback control. Such a modulation scheme has not been presented before. The theoretical results are verified by both simulations and experimental results. The simulation results show successful operation at the fundamental switching frequency with a larger number of submodules. When a smaller number of submodules are used, harmonic elimination methods may be applied. This is verified experimentally on a converter with eight submodules per phase leg.

From the experimental results obtained, we conclude that the degree of partition-induced covariate shift depends on the cross-validation scheme considered.

In WAVE, an upstream node recommends the number of chunks to be cached at its downstream node, which is exponentially increased as the request count increases. Simulation results reveal that the average hop count of content delivery of WAVE is lower than other schemes, and the inter-ISP traffic volume of WAVE is the second lowest (CDN is the lowest).

The proposed CGI template first extracts the contour in each gait frame, followed by encoding each of the gait contour images in the same gait sequence with a multichannel mapping function and compositing them to a single CGI. To make the templates robust to a complex surrounding environment, we also propose CGI-based real and synthetic temporal information preserving templates by using different gait periods and contour distortion techniques.

Until recently it was believed that in multi-cellular LSAS, even in the asymptotic regime, as the number of service antennas tends to infinity, the performance is limited by directed inter-cellular interference. The interference results from unavoidable re-use of reverse-link pilot sequences (pilot contamination) by terminals in different cells. We devise a new concept that leads to the effective elimination of inter-cell interference in TDD LSAS systems. This is achieved by outer multi-cellular pre-coding, which we call pilot contamination pre-coding (PCP). The main idea of PCP is that each base station linearly combines messages aimed to terminals from different cells that re-use the same pilot sequence. Crucially, the combining coefficients depend only on the slow-fading coefficients between the terminals and the base stations. Each base station independently transmits its PCP-combined symbols using conventional linear pre-coding that is based on estimated fast-fading coefficients. Further we derive estimates for SINRs and a capacity lower bound for the case of LSASs with PCP and finite number of antennas M.","2157-8117","978-1-4673-2579-0","10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6283031","","Base stations;Interference;Vectors;Signal to noise ratio;Antennas;Fading;Contamination","","234","12","5","IEEE","27 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the Markovian mode jumping, the transition probability matrix is allowed to have partially unknown entries, while the cases with completely known or completely unknown transition probabilities are also investigated as two special cases. The randomly varying nonlinearities and the sensor saturations are introduced to reflect the limited capacity of the communication networks resulting from the noisy environment, probabilistic communication failures, measurements of limited amplitudes, etc. Two energy norm indices are used for the fault detection problem in order to account for, respectively, the restraint of disturbance and the sensitivity of faults. The purpose of the problem addressed is to design an optimized fault detection filter such that 1) the fault detection dynamics is stochastically stable; 2) the effect from the exogenous disturbance on the residual is attenuated with respect to a minimized H∞ -norm; and 3) the sensitivity of the residual to the fault is enhanced by means of a maximized H∞-norm. The characterization of the gains of the desired fault detection filters is derived in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem that can be easily solved by using the semi-definite programme method.

This paper presents a fully automatic stem-mapping algorithm using single-scan TLS data for collecting individual tree information from forest plots. In this method, the stem points are identified by the spatial distribution properties of the laser points, the stem model is built up of a series of cylinders, and the location of the stem is estimated by the model. The experiment was performed on nine plots with 10-m radius. The stem-location maps measured in the field by traditional methods were used as the ground truth. The overall stem-mapping accuracy was 73%. The result shows that, in a relatively dense managed forest, the majority of stems can be located by the automatic algorithm.

Based on this concept, the magnetoelectric dipole was invented by integrating an electric dipole with an -probe fed shorted quarter-wave patch antenna. A number of magnetoelectric dipoles with different radiation patterns and different polarizations have been developed in recent years. An overview of the characteristics of this new class of complementary antennas is presented. Major design challenges are explained. Finally, a new magnetoelectric dipole that is low in profile and robust in structure is presented. The magnetic dipole part of this antenna is realized by a triangular-shaped loop antenna.

In addition, stress may affect the plant pigment system, influencing the photosynthetic capacity of plants. Chlorophyll content is the main driver for this primary production. The chlorophyll content is indirectly related to the nitrogen (N) content. In this paper emphasis is on estimation of canopy chlorophyll content and N content using remote sensing techniques. Hyperspectral reflectance data representing a range of canopies were simulated using the PROSAIL radiative transfer model at a 1 nm sampling interval. Various indices were tested for estimating canopy chlorophyll content. Subsequently, tests with field data were performed for sampling locations within an extensively grazed fen meadow using ASD FieldSpec measurements and within a potato field with a Cropscan radiometer for estimating canopy N content. PROSAIL simulations showed that the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge) was linearly related to the canopy chlorophyll content over the full range of potential values (R2=0.94) . In contrast, highly non-linear relationships of chlorophyll content with most traditional red-edge indices were found. At the study sites the CI2 was found to be a good and linear estimator of canopy N content (no chlorophyll was measured) for both the grassland site (R2=0.77) and for the potato field (R2=0.88) . The latter number refers to plots showing no “luxury” N consumption. However, for the full potato data set, including highly fertilized plants, an exponential relationship yielded a better fit (R2=0.85) as compared to a linear fit (R2=0.65) . Currently, this approach can, e.g., be applied with MERIS and Hyperion data and with the upcoming Sentinel-2 and -3 systems.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2176468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096423","Chlorophyll;hyperspectral;nitrogen;PROSAIL;remote sensing;spectroscopy","Indexes;Vegetation mapping;Nitrogen;Hyperspectral imaging;Biological system modeling","","233","","43","IEEE","7 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed learning techniques have mainly been concentrated on three directions: on the production of weight matrices on the basis of historical data, on adaptation of the cause-effect relationships of the FCM on the basis of experts' intervention, and on the production of weight matrices by combining experts' knowledge and data. The learning techniques could be categorized into three groups on the basis of the learning paradigm: Hebbian-based, population-based, and hybrid, which subsequently combine the main aspects of Hebbian-based- and population-based-type learning algorithms. These types of learning algorithms are the most efficient and widely used to train the FCMs, according to the existing literature. A survey on recent advances on learning methodologies and algorithms for FCMs that present their dynamic capabilities and application characteristics in diverse scientific fields is established here.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2138694","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5766766","Evolutionary algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);fuzzy logic;genetic algorithms (GAs);Hebbian learning (HL);learning algorithms;neural networks","Learning systems;Heuristic algorithms;Adaptation model;Pragmatics;Artificial neural networks;Numerical models;Cognition","","233","1","88","IEEE","12 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While these L1 trackers showed impressive tracking accuracies, they are very computationally demanding and the speed bottleneck is the solver to ℓ1 norm minimizations. This paper aims at developing an L1 tracker that not only runs in real time but also enjoys better robustness than other L1 trackers. In our proposed L1 tracker, a new ℓ1 norm related minimization model is proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by adding an ℓ1 norm regularization on the coefficients associated with the trivial templates. Moreover, based on the accelerated proximal gradient approach, a very fast numerical solver is developed to solve the resulting ℓ1 norm related minimization problem with guaranteed quadratic convergence. The great running time efficiency and tracking accuracy of the proposed tracker is validated with a comprehensive evaluation involving eight challenging sequences and five alternative state-of-the-art trackers.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247881","","Minimization;Target tracking;Real time systems;Robustness;Accuracy;Visualization;Noise","","233","2","27","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the recently proposed Trojan detection methods are based on Trojan activation to observe either a faulty output or measurable abnormality on side-channel signals. Time to activate a hardware Trojan circuit is a major concern from the authentication standpoint. This paper analyzes time to generate a transition in functional Trojans. Transition is modeled by geometric distribution and the number of clock cycles required to generate a transition is estimated. Furthermore, a dummy scan flip-flop insertion procedure is proposed aiming at decreasing transition generation time. The procedure increases transition probabilities of nets beyond a specific threshold. The relation between circuit topology, authentication time, and the threshold is carefully studied. The simulation results on s38417 benchmark circuit demonstrate that, with a negligible area overhead, our proposed method can significantly increase Trojan activity and reduce Trojan activation time.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2093547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678829","Dummy flip-flop insertion;hardware trojan;security;trojan activation time;trojan detection","Trojan horses;Logic gates;Clocks;Simulation;Hardware;Benchmark testing;Authentication","","233","1","23","IEEE","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, it is difficult for BCI systems to provide the multiple independent control signals necessary for the multi-degree continuous control of a wheelchair. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a hybrid BCI that uses the motor imagery-based mu rhythm and the P300 potential to control a brain-actuated simulated or real wheelchair. The objective of the hybrid BCI is to provide a greater number of commands with increased accuracy to the BCI user. Our paradigm allows the user to control the direction (left or right turn) of the simulated or real wheelchair using left- or right-hand imagery. Furthermore, a hybrid manner can be used to control speed. To decelerate, the user imagines foot movement while ignoring the flashing buttons on the graphical user interface (GUI). If the user wishes to accelerate, then he/she pays attention to a specific flashing button without performing any motor imagery. Two experiments were conducted to assess the BCI control; both a simulated wheelchair in a virtual environment and a real wheelchair were tested. Subjects steered both the simulated and real wheelchairs effectively by controlling the direction and speed with our hybrid BCI system. Data analysis validated the use of our hybrid BCI system to control the direction and speed of a wheelchair.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2012.2197221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6213127","Direction;hybrid brain–computer interface (BCI);motor imagery;P300;speed;wheelchair","Wheelchairs;Electroencephalography;Foot;Velocity control;Feature extraction;Ash;Vectors","Biofeedback, Psychology;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Computer-Aided Design;Electroencephalography;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Humans;Models, Theoretical;Motion;Systems Integration;User-Computer Interface;Wheelchairs","233","1","31","IEEE","6 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The electromagnetic properties of such contributions are retrieved from multipolarimetric acquisitions, whereas their vertical structure is retrieved from multibaseline acquisitions through tomographic imaging. Combining baseline and polarization diversity provides most information, allowing the decomposition of the SAR signal into ground- and volume-only contributions. A formal treatment of this problem is provided with the algebraic synthesis technique, which extends the concepts of PolInSAR. The decomposition, however, is shown to be ambiguous in that different solutions are equally consistent with the data. The main goal of this paper is to discuss this topic in light of the experimental results from a tomographic and polarimetric analysis of the boreal forest within the Krycklan River catchment, Northern Sweden, investigated at P- and L-bands during the ESA campaign BioSAR 2008. Different solutions to the decomposition problem will be discussed by examining the corresponding vertical structures accessible through tomographic techniques. Elements are shown supporting the idea that ground-volume interactions play a nonnegligible role at P-band, and a solution is proposed to isolate contributions from direct volume backscattering. The retrieval of forest top height is discussed as well, leading to the conclusion that such parameter is robust against erroneous choices in the identification of volume-only contributions, thus corroborating the PolInSAR approach for the analysis of single-baseline data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2159614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5961624","Forestry;polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);tomography","Covariance matrix;Matrix decomposition;Tomography;Coherence;Backscatter;L-band","","233","","40","IEEE","25 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Particularly, Petri nets are considered as a popular formalism because of their inherent characteristics. They received much attention over the past decades to deal with deadlock problems, leading to a variety of deadlock-control policies. This study surveys the state-of-the-art deadlock-control strategies for automated manufacturing systems by reviewing the principles and techniques that are involved in preventing, avoiding, and detecting deadlocks. The focus is deadlock prevention due to its large and continuing stream of efforts. A control strategy is evaluated in terms of computational complexity, behavioral permissiveness, and structural complexity of its deadlock-free supervisor.

Optimization criteria of a TSF that are concerned with secondary objectives, such as minimization of copper losses or maximization of drive performance, are described. In addition, a novel family of TSFs is introduced. An optimal TSF can be easily extracted from the proposed family to satisfy one of the secondary objectives or to create balance between more of them. Control performances of the two extracted TSFs and the two optimized conventional (linear and sinusoidal) TSFs are compared. These four TSFs keep the copper losses to nearly the theoretical minimum. Each of them provides approximately the same operation efficiency of the considered three-phase 6/4 SRM drive. However, due to extension of the commutation angle between adjacent phases, TSFs from the proposed family provide better torque-speed characteristics. Moreover, one of them expands the possible speed range of torque-ripple-free drive operation, and another one, which provides the best torque-speed characteristics, reduces the peak phase current.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2011.2158447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5783348","Copper loss;switched reluctance motor (SRM);torque-ripple minimization;torque-sharing function (TSF)","Torque;Reluctance motors;Rotors;Copper;Minimization","","232","1","20","IEEE","2 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Novel update laws for tuning the unknown weights of the NNs online are derived. Lyapunov techniques are used to show that all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and that the approximated control signal approaches the optimal control input with small bounded error over time. In the absence of disturbances, an optimal control is demonstrated. Simulation results are included to show the effectiveness of the approach. The end result is the systematic design of an optimal controller with guaranteed convergence that is suitable for hardware implementation.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2196708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208889","Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman;online approximators;online nonlinear optimal control;time-based policy update","Optimal control;Cost function;Artificial neural networks;Approximation methods;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Estimation error","","231","","30","IEEE","30 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we propose and assess strategies to concentrate network traffic on a minimal subset of network resources. Given a telecommunication infrastructure, our aim is to turn off network nodes and links while still guaranteeing full connectivity and maximum link utilization constraints. We first derive a simple and complete formulation, which results into an NP-hard problem that can be solved only for trivial cases. We then derive more complex formulations that can scale up to middle-sized networks. Finally, we provide efficient heuristics that can be used for large networks. We test the effectiveness of our algorithms on both real and synthetic topologies, considering the daily fluctuations of Internet traffic and different classes of users.

The problem is that as features approach the range of a few nanometers, electron-based devices depart radically from the ideal switch and, in fact, become very leaky in the off state. It is argued that there are some short-term solutions involving more highly parallel manufacturing, increased design efficiency, and lower cost packaging technologies that could continue the steep learning curve for cost reductions that have historically been achieved via Moore's Law scaling. Another alternative might be to increase chip functionality by integrating devices that offer broadened chip functionality including, e.g., sensors, energy sources, oscillators, etc. A third alternative would be to invent an entirely new information processing state variable based on different physics, using electron spin, magnetic dipoles, photons, etc., to improve the performance and reduce switching energy for devices whose smallest features are on the order of a few nanometers. Each of these alternatives is being actively explored and an overview of each strategy and progress to date is given in the paper. A final alternative offered in the paper is to learn from information processing examples in nature, specifically in living systems. An E.coli cell of about one cubic micrometer volume is shown to be an incredibly powerful and energy-efficient information processor relative to the performance of an end-of-scaling silicon processor of the same volume. The paper concludes by pointing out some of the crucial differences between E.coli information processing and conventional approaches with the hope technologies can be invented using the hints offered by biosystems.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2012.2190155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6186749","Beyond CMOS;biological computation;logic;memory;more than Moore;scaling limits","Transistors;CMOS integrated circuits;Logic gates;CMOS technology;Microprocessors;Performance evaluation;Optical switches;Moore's Law;Semiconductor devices","","230","","182","IEEE","18 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Observing that consumer videos generally contain large intraclass variations within the same type of events, we first propose a new method, called Aligned Space-Time Pyramid Matching (ASTPM), to measure the distance between any two video clips. Second, we propose a new transfer learning method, referred to as Adaptive Multiple Kernel Learning (A-MKL), in order to 1) fuse the information from multiple pyramid levels and features (i.e., space-time features and static SIFT features) and 2) cope with the considerable variation in feature distributions between videos from two domains (i.e., web video domain and consumer video domain). For each pyramid level and each type of local features, we first train a set of SVM classifiers based on the combined training set from two domains by using multiple base kernels from different kernel types and parameters, which are then fused with equal weights to obtain a prelearned average classifier. In A-MKL, for each event class we learn an adapted target classifier based on multiple base kernels and the prelearned average classifiers from this event class or all the event classes by minimizing both the structural risk functional and the mismatch between data distributions of two domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework that requires only a small number of labeled consumer videos by leveraging web data. We also conduct an in-depth investigation on various aspects of the proposed method A-MKL, such as the analysis on the combination coefficients on the prelearned classifiers, the convergence of the learning algorithm, and the performance variation by using different proportions of labeled consumer videos. Moreover, we show that A-MKL using the prelearned classifiers from all the event classes leads to better performance when compared with A-MKL using the prelearned classifiers only from each individual event class.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112768","Event recognition;transfer learning;domain adaptation;cross-domain learning;adaptive MKL;aligned space-time pyramid matching.","Videos;Kernel;YouTube;Learning systems;Feature extraction;Visualization;Support vector machines","Human Activities;Humans;Internet;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Support Vector Machines;Video Recording","230","","50","IEEE","27 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Optimal locations and sizes, which are independent of CHP-based DERs types, are selected, here, by loss sensitivity index (LSI) and by loss minimization using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, respectively. In a micro-grid, both fuel costs and NOx emissions are, mainly, dependent on types of DERs used. So the main focus of the present paper is to incorporate originality in ideas to evaluate how different optimal output sets of DER-mix, operating within their respective capacity limits, could share an electrical tracking demand, economically, among micro-turbines and diesel generators of various sizes, satisfying different heat demands, on the basis of multi-objective optimization compromising between fuel cost and emission in a 4-DER 14-bus radial micro-grid.

In advanced traveler information systems, recent efforts have been made in developing a new navigation concept called “eco-routing,” which finds a route that requires the least amount of fuel and/or produces the least amount of emissions. This paper presents an eco-routing navigation system that determines the most eco-friendly route between a trip origin and a destination. It consists of the following four components: 1) a Dynamic Roadway Network database, which is a digital map of a roadway network that integrates historical and real-time traffic information from multiple data sources through an embedded data fusion algorithm; 2) an energy/emissions operational parameter set, which is a compilation of energy/emission factors for a variety of vehicle types under various roadway characteristics and traffic conditions; 3) a routing engine, which contains shortest path algorithms used for optimal route calculation; and 4) user interfaces that receive origin–destination inputs from users and display route maps to the users. Each of the system components and the system architecture are described. Example results are also presented to prove the validity of the eco-routing concept and to demonstrate the operability of the developed eco-routing navigation system.

The proposed DC/DC converter is part of a plug-in AC/DC converter used to charge the traction battery (high voltage battery) in an electric vehicle. The key challenge in this application is operation of the full-bridge converter from absolutely no-load to full-load conditions. In order to confirm reliable operation of the full-bridge converter under such wide load variations, the converter should not only operate with soft-switching from full load to no-load condition with satisfactory efficiency for the full range of operation, but also the voltage across the output diode bridge needs to be clamped to avoid any adverse voltage overshoots arising during turn-OFF of the output diodes as commonly found in regular full bridge converters. In order to achieve such stringent requirements and high reliability, the converter employs a symmetric passive near lossless auxiliary circuit to provide the reactive current for the full-bridge semiconductor switches, which guarantees zero voltage switching at turn-ON times for all load conditions. Moreover the proposed topology is based on a current driven rectifier in order to clamp the voltage of the output diode bridge and also satisfy ZVZCS operation of the converter resulting in superior efficiency for all load conditions.

The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined.

A low-cost Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver has widely been used for conventional automotive applications, but it does not guarantee accuracy, reliability, or continuity of position data when GPS errors occur. To mitigate GPS errors, numerous Bayesian filters based on sensor fusion algorithms have been studied. The estimation performance of Bayesian filters primarily relies on the choice of process model. For this reason, the change in vehicle dynamics with driving conditions should be addressed in the process model of the Bayesian filters. This paper presents a positioning algorithm based on an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter that integrates low-cost GPS and in-vehicle sensors to adapt the vehicle model to various driving conditions. The model set of the IMM filter is composed of a kinematic vehicle model and a dynamic vehicle model. The algorithm developed in this paper is verified via intensive simulation and evaluated through experimentation with a real-time embedded system. Experimental results show that the performance of the positioning system is accurate and reliable under a wide range of driving conditions.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2011.2171033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095631","Information fusion;interacting multiple mode (IMM) filter;in-vehicle sensors;vehicle positioning","Vehicles;Adaptation models;Global Positioning System;Vehicle dynamics;Wheels;Kinematics;Tires","","229","1","47","IEEE","6 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Towards this goal, we utilize a conditional model trained in a max-margin framework that is able to automatically discover discriminative and interesting segments of video, while simultaneously achieving competitive accuracies on difficult detection and recognition tasks. We introduce latent variables over the frames of a video, and allow our algorithm to discover and assign sequences of states that are most discriminative for the event. Our model is based on the variable-duration hidden Markov model, and models durations of states in addition to the transitions between states.

CPSs can use the information available from the physical environment to provide such ubiquitous, energy-efficient and low-cost functionalities. Their operation needs to ensure three key properties, collectively referred to as S3: 1) safety: avoidance of hazards; 2) security: assurance of integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of information; and 3) sustainability: maintenance of long-term operation of CPSs using green sources of energy. Ensuring S3 properties in a CPS is a challenging task given the spatio–temporal dynamics of the underlying physical environment. In this paper, the formal underpinnings of recent CPS S3 solutions are aligned together in a theoretical framework for cyber–physical interactions, empowering CPS researchers to systematically design solutions for ensuring safety, security, or sustainability. The general applicability of this framework is demonstrated with various exemplar solutions for S3 in diverse CPS domains. Further, insights are provided on some of the open research problems for ensuring S3 in CPSs.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2011.2165689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061910","Body area networks (BANs);cyber–physical systems (CPSs);data centers (DCs);model-based engineering;safety;security;smart infrastructures (SIs);sustainability;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Nework security;Cyberspace;Network toplogy;Hazards;Mission critical systems;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Surveillance","","228","2","18","IEEE","26 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The perception and understanding of an image is modeled as an active inference process, in which the brain tries to explain the scene using an internal generative model. The psychovisual quality is thus closely related to how accurately visual sensory data can be explained by the generative model, and the upper bound of the discrepancy between the image signal and its best internal description is given by the free energy of the cognition process. Therefore, the perceptual quality of an image can be quantified using the free energy. Constructively, we develop a reduced-reference free-energy-based distortion metric (FEDM) and a no-reference free-energy-based quality metric (NFEQM). The FEDM and the NFEQM are nearly invariant to many global systematic deviations in geometry and illumination that hardly affect visual quality, for which existing image quality metrics wrongly predict severe quality degradation. Although with very limited or even without information on the reference image, the FEDM and the NFEQM are highly competitive compared with the full-reference SSIM image quality metric on images in the popular LIVE database. Moreover, FEDM and NFEQM can measure correctly the visual quality of some model-based image processing algorithms, for which the competing metrics often contradict with viewers' opinions.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2161092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5936730","Brain theory;free-energy principle;image modeling;image quality assessment","Brain modeling;Measurement;Visualization;Image quality;Computational modeling;Data models;Visual perception","Algorithms;Biomimetics;Brain;Computer Simulation;Energy Transfer;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Neurological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Detection, Psychological;Visual Perception","228","","37","IEEE","30 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, two real data and two synthetic experiments have been carried out to assess the effects of assimilating soil moisture estimates into a two-layer rainfall-runoff model. By using the ensemble Kalman filter, both the surface- and root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) products derived by the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) have been assimilated and the model performance on flood estimation is analyzed. RZSM estimates are obtained through the application of an exponential filter. Hourly rainfall-runoff observations for the period 1994-2010 collected in the Niccone catchment (137 km2), Central Italy, are employed as case study. The ASCAT soil moisture products are found to be in good agreement with the modeled soil moisture data for both the surface layer (correlation coefficient (R) of 0.78) and the root zone (R = 0.94). In the real data experiment, the assimilation of the RZSM product has a significant impact on runoff simulation that provides a clear improvement in the discharge modeling performance. On the other hand, the assimilation of the surface soil moisture product has a small effect. The same findings are also confirmed by the synthetic twin experiments. Even though the obtained results are model dependent and site specific, the possibility to efficiently employ coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products for improving flood prediction is proven, mainly if RZSM data are assimilated into the hydrological model.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2177468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112677","Hydrologic measurements;hydrology;remote sensing;satellite applications","Soil moisture;Data models;Predictive models;Data assimilation;Satellites;Atmospheric modeling","","228","","69","IEEE","26 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, a novel spare process is proposed to handle an emergency situation when the number of faulty power modules exceeds the module redundancy. Since topological redundancy may cause the switching commutations of power modules in an arm to be unevenly distributed, a practical and effective mitigation measure is incorporated to keep the energy balance while avoiding the undesired switching stresses.

Built with off-the-shelf components, a data projector and a camera, they are easy to deploy and compare in precision with expensive laser scanners. But such a high precision is only possible if camera and projector are both accurately calibrated. Robust calibration methods are well established for cameras but, while cameras and projectors can both be described with the same mathematical model, it is not clear how to adapt these methods to projectors. In consequence, many of the proposed projector calibration techniques make use of a simplified model, neglecting lens distortion, resulting in loss of precision. In this paper, we present a novel method to estimate the image coordinates of 3D points in the projector image plane. The method relies on an uncalibrated camera and makes use of local homographies to reach sub-pixel precision. As a result, any camera model can be used to describe the projector, including the extended pinhole model with radial and tangential distortion coefficients, or even those with more complex lens distortion models.","1550-6185","978-0-7695-4873-9","10.1109/3DIMPVT.2012.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375029","structured-light;camera;projector;calibration;local homography","Cameras;Calibration;Software;Image resolution;Reflective binary codes;Image color analysis;Robustness","","227","4","24","IEEE","6 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Outliers are objects that highly deviate from regular objects in their local neighborhood. Density-based outlier ranking methods score each object based on its degree of deviation. In many applications, these ranking methods degenerate to random listings due to low contrast between outliers and regular objects. Outliers do not show up in the scattered full space, they are hidden in multiple high contrast subspace projections of the data. Measuring the contrast of such subspaces for outlier rankings is an open research challenge. In this work, we propose a novel subspace search method that selects high contrast subspaces for density-based outlier ranking. It is designed as pre-processing step to outlier ranking algorithms. It searches for high contrast subspaces with a significant amount of conditional dependence among the subspace dimensions. With our approach, we propose a first measure for the contrast of subspaces. Thus, we enhance the quality of traditional outlier rankings by computing outlier scores in high contrast projections only. The evaluation on real and synthetic data shows that our approach outperforms traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, naive random projections as well as state-of-the-art subspace search techniques and provides enhanced quality for outlier ranking.","2375-026X","978-0-7695-4747-3","10.1109/ICDE.2012.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228154","","Correlation;Data mining;Probability density function;Joints;Density measurement;Noise level;Atmospheric measurements","","227","","29","IEEE","2 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The comparison experiments indicate that I-V and P-V characteristic curves of simulation match the measurements from outdoor experiment well.

Our solution covers space, time, and attribute values. Based on an analysis of relevant visualization tasks, we designed the visualization solution around the principle of stacking trajectory bands. The core of our approach is a hybrid 2D/3D display. A 2D map serves as a reference for the spatial context, and the trajectories are visualized as stacked 3D trajectory bands along which attribute values are encoded by color. Time is integrated through appropriate ordering of bands and through a dynamic query mechanism that feeds temporally aggregated information to a circular time display. An additional 2D time graph shows temporal information in full detail by stacking 2D trajectory bands. Our solution is equipped with analytical and interactive mechanisms for selecting and ordering of trajectories, and adjusting the color mapping, as well as coordinated highlighting and dedicated 3D navigation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our novel visualization by three examples related to radiation surveillance, traffic analysis, and maritime navigation.

While DSA has attracted many research efforts recently, in this article, we discuss the challenges of DSA and aim to shed light on its future. We first give an introduction to the state-of- the-art in spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing. Then, we examine the challenges that prevent DSA from major commercial deployment. We believe that, to address these challenges, a new DSA model is critical, where the licensed users cooperate in DSA and hence much more flexible spectrum sharing is possible. Furthermore, the future DSA model should consider the political, social, economic, and technological factors all together, to pave the way for the commercial success of DSA. To support this future DSA model, the future cognitive radio is expected to have additional components and capabilities, to enforce policy, provide incentive and coexistence mechanisms, etc. We call the future cognitive radio with the expanded capabilities a network radio, and discuss its architecture as well as the design issues for future DSA.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2012.6155873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6155873","","Sensors;Interference;Cognitive radio;Receivers;Noise measurement;Radio spectrum management;Transmitters","","226","","13","IEEE","23 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

RUL estimation can be done by using two main approaches, namely model-based and data-driven approaches. The first approach is based on the utilization of physics of failure models of the degradation, while the second approach is based on the transformation of the data provided by the sensors into models that represent the behavior of the degradation. This paper deals with a data-driven prognostics method, where the RUL of the physical system is assessed depending on its critical component. Once the critical component is identified, and the appropriate sensors installed, the data provided by these sensors are exploited to model the degradation's behavior. For this purpose, Mixture of Gaussians Hidden Markov Models (MoG-HMMs), represented by Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), are used as a modeling tool. MoG-HMMs allow us to represent the evolution of the component's health condition by hidden states by using temporal or frequency features extracted from the raw signals provided by the sensors. The prognostics process is then done in two phases: a learning phase to generate the behavior model, and an exploitation phase to estimate the current health state and calculate the RUL. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is verified by implementing prognostics performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and prediction horizon. Finally, the proposed method is applied to real data corresponding to the accelerated life of bearings, and experimental results are discussed.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2012.2194175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6190764","Condition monitoring;condition-based maintenance;dynamic Bayesian networks;mixture of Gaussians hidden Markov models;performance metrics;prognostics;remaining useful life","Hidden Markov models;Degradation;Sensors;Estimation;Feature extraction;Data models;Monitoring","","226","1","31","IEEE","26 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is achieved by making the topology of the underlying factor graph representation subject to the optimization instead of keeping it fixed. The evaluation shows that the approach can deal with up to 1000 false positive loop closure constraints on various datasets. This largely increases the robustness of the overall SLAM system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers.","2153-0866","978-1-4673-1736-8","10.1109/IROS.2012.6385590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385590","","Switches;Robustness;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Convergence;Cost function;Estimation","","226","1","14","IEEE","20 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our system is based on the Kinect sensor and thus can extract comprehensive gait information from all parts of the body. Beyond standard stride information, we also measure arm kinematics, demonstrating the wide range of parameters that can be extracted. We further improve over existing work by using information from the entire body to more accurately measure stride intervals.

The classical “hill climbing” and “incremental conductance” MPPT algorithms are widely applied in many papers and applications. Both algorithms perturb the operating conditions of the PV array and detect the changes in generated power. Since the detected change in generated power also could be a result of changes in irradiance, both algorithms are prone to failure in case of large changes in irradiance. This paper starts to discuss the size of the perturbation of the operating conditions for both algorithms, based on the single-diode model. The result is used to select the updating frequency for the two algorithms, in order not to run away under certain dynamic conditions. Both algorithms are implemented in an inverter and tested over 16 days of simultaneous operation. Basic statistical procedures, the paired t-test, have been applied to the data with the conclusion that the two algorithms perform equally good.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2012.2218816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6329418","Benchmark testing;efficiency;maximum power point tracker (MPPT);photovoltaic (PV) power systems;solar power generation","Algorithm design and analysis;Voltage measurement;Solar power generation;Maximum power point tracking;Photovoltaic systems","","225","","38","IEEE","11 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is a strong need to develop systematic procedure for optimal construction of microgrids. This paper presents systematic and optimized approaches for clustering of the distribution system into a set of virtual microgrids with optimized self-adequacy. The probabilistic characteristics of distributed generation (DG) units are also considered by defining two new probabilistic indices representing real and reactive power of the lines. Next, the advantages of installing both distributed energy storage resources (DESRs) and distributed reactive sources (DRSs) are investigated to improve the self-adequacy of the constructed micro-grids. The new strategy facilitates robust infrastructure for smart distribution systems operational control functions, such as self-healing, by using virtual microgrids as building blocks in future distribution systems. The problem formulation and solution algorithms are presented in this paper. The well-known PG&E 69-bus distribution system is selected as a test case and through several sensitivity studies, the effect of the total DESRs or DRSs capacities on the design and the robustness of the algorithm are investigated.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2198246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205347","Energy losses;energy storage devices;graph partitioning;microgrid design;power imbalance;reactive sources;tabu search","Generators;Reactive power;Probabilistic logic;Wind turbines;Load modeling;Resource management","","225","","38","IEEE","25 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, planar antennas are dominating in the lower frequency range, while lens and reflector antennas had been the first choice at 76.5 GHz, partly in folded configurations.

We then study a more general setting with multiple mobile ground-based terminals, and develop an algorithm for dynamically adjusting the UAV heading to maximize the approximate ergodic sum rate of the uplink channel, using a prediction filter to track the positions of the mobile ground nodes. For the common scenario where a strong line-of-sight (LOS) channel exists between the ground nodes and UAV, we use an asymptotic analysis to find simplified versions of the algorithm for low and high SNR.

Under SCDL, a pair of dictionaries and a mapping function will be simultaneously learned. The dictionary pair can well characterize the structural domains of the two styles of images, while the mapping function can reveal the intrinsic relationship between the two styles' domains. In SCDL, the two dictionaries will not be fully coupled, and hence much flexibility can be given to the mapping function for an accurate conversion across styles. Moreover, clustering and image nonlocal redundancy are introduced to enhance the robustness of SCDL.

First, a networked control system model is constructed for wide-area closed-loop power systems; in this model, network-induced delays, data packet dropout, and disordering are captured by time-varying delays in wide-area measurement systems. Then, linear matrix inequality based methods are applied to design a controller for better power system performance using wide-area information as feedback signals.

However, due to the lack of information about other users and the restriction that the spectrum is time-varying with unknown availability statistics, the task of achieving Nash equilibrium (NE) points of the game is challenging. Firstly, we propose a genie-aided algorithm to achieve the NE points under the assumption of perfect environment knowledge.

The construction of a dry contact electrode, featuring fingered contact posts and active buffering circuitry is presented. Additionally, the development of a new, noncontact, capacitive electrode that utilizes a custom integrated, high-impedance analog front-end is introduced.

Online BCI experiments demonstrate that the information transfer rate (ITR) with the dry electrodes is comparable to that of wet electrodes, completely without the need for gel or other conductive media. In addition, data from the noncontact electrode, operating on the top of hair, show a maximum ITR in excess of 19 bits/min at 100% accuracy (versus 29.2 bits/min for wet electrodes and 34.4 bits/min for dry electrodes), a level that has never been demonstrated before.

First, a speed regulation scheme based on standard internal model control (IMC) method is designed. For the speed loop, a standard internal model controller is first designed based on a first-order model of PMSM by analyzing the relationship between reference quadrature axis current and speed. For the two current loops, PI algorithms are employed respectively. Second, considering the disadvantages that the standard IMC method is sensitive to control input saturation and may lead to poor speed tracking and load disturbance rejection performances, a modified IMC scheme is developed based on a two-port IMC method, where a feedback control term is added to form a composite control structure. Third, considering the case of large variations of load inertia, two adaptive IMC schemes with two different adaptive laws are proposed. A method based on disturbance observer is adopted to identify the inertia of PMSM and its load. Then a linear adaptive law is developed by analyzing the relationship between the internal model and identified inertia. Considering the control input saturation in practical applications, a fuzzy adaptive law based IMC scheme is developed based on apriori experimental tests and experiences, where a fuzzy inferencer based supervisor is designed to automatically tune the parameter of speed controller according to the identified inertia. The effectiveness of the proposed methods have been verified by Matlab simulation and TMS320F2808 DSP experimental results.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2012.2205581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6222327","Adaptive control;control saturation;fuzzy inferencer;inertial identification;internal model control;PMSM","Load modeling;Adaptation models;Mathematical model;Adaptive control;Feedback control;Stators","","223","","36","IEEE","21 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first analyze about 35 million check-ins made by about 1 million Foursquare users in over 5 million venues across the globe, spanning a period of five months. We then propose a set of features that aim to capture the factors that may drive users' movements. Our features exploit information on transitions between types of places, mobility flows between venues, and spatio-temporal characteristics of user check-in patterns. We further extend our study combining all individual features in two supervised learning models, based on linear regression and M5 model trees, resulting in a higher overall prediction accuracy. We find that the supervised methodology based on the combination of multiple features offers the highest levels of prediction accuracy: M5 model trees are able to rank in the top fifty venues one in two user check-ins, amongst thousands of candidate items in the prediction list.","2374-8486","978-1-4673-4649-8","10.1109/ICDM.2012.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413812","human mobility;data mining;location-based services","Accuracy;Predictive models;Cities and towns;Mobile communication;Filtering;Humans;Supervised learning","","223","1","10","IEEE","17 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These attacks aim to compromise the readings of multiple power grid sensors and phasor measurement units in order to mislead the operation and control centers. Recent studies have shown that if an adversary has complete knowledge on the power grid topology and transmission-line admittance values, he can adjust the false data injection attack vector such that the attack remains undetected and successfully passes the residue-based bad data detection tests that are commonly used in power system state estimation. However, in this paper, we explain that a realistic false data injection attack is essentially an attack with incomplete information due to the attackers lack of real-time knowledge with respect to various grid parameters and attributes such as the position of circuit breaker switches and transformer tap changers and also because of the attacker's limited physical access to most grid facilities. We mathematically characterize false data injection attacks with incomplete information from both the attacker's and grid operator's viewpoints. Furthermore, we introduce a novel vulnerability measure that can compare and rank different power grid topologies against such attacks.

The first approach computes stereo saliency based on the global disparity contrast in the input image. The second approach leverages domain knowledge in stereoscopic photography. A good stereoscopic image takes care of its disparity distribution to avoid 3D fatigue. Particularly, salient content tends to be positioned in the stereoscopic comfort zone to alleviate the vergence-accommodation conflict. Accordingly, our method computes stereo saliency of an image region based on the distance between its perceived location and the comfort zone. Moreover, we consider objects popping out from the screen salient as these objects tend to catch a viewer's attention. We build a stereo saliency analysis benchmark dataset that contains 1000 stereoscopic images with salient object masks. Our experiments on this dataset show that stereo saliency provides a useful complement to existing visual saliency analysis and our method can successfully detect salient content from images that are difficult for monocular saliency analysis methods.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247708","","Stereo image processing;Visualization;Cameras;Photography;Benchmark testing;Image color analysis","","222","1","41","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The common denoising methods, such as 2-D (two dimensions) filter, actually rearrange data from 3-D to 2-D and ignore the spectral relationships among different bands of the image. Tensor decomposition method has been adapted to denoise HSIs, for instance Tucker3 (three-mode factor analysis) model. However, this model has problems in uniqueness of decomposition and in estimation of multiple ranks. In this paper, to overcome these problems, we exploit a powerful multilinear algebra model, named parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), and the number of estimated rank is reduced to one. Assumed that HSI is disturbed by white Gaussian noise, the optimal rank of PARAFAC is estimated according to that the covariance matrix of the $n$-mode unfolding matrix of the removed noise should be approach to a scalar matrix. Then, the denoising results by PARAFAC decomposition are presented and compared with those obtained by Tucker3 model and 2-D filters. To further verify the denoising performance of PARAFAC decomposition, Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) of denoising is deduced theoretically for the first time, and the experiment results show that the PARAFAC model is a preferable denoising method since the variance of the HSI denoised by it is closer to the CRLB than by other considered methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2187063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170555","Classification;Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB);denoising;hyperspectral image (HSI);parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC);Tucker3","Tensile stress;Noise reduction;Covariance matrix;Noise;Vectors;Matrix decomposition;Argon","","222","","32","IEEE","15 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of these key video enhancing solutions is HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS), which has recently been spreading as a form of Internet video delivery and is expected to be deployed more broadly over the next few years. As a relatively new technology in comparison with traditional push-based adaptive streaming techniques, deployment of HAS presents new challenges and opportunities for content developers, service providers, network operators and device manufacturers. One of these important challenges is developing evaluation methodologies and performance metrics to accurately assess user QoE for HAS services, and effectively utilizing these metrics for service provisioning and optimizing network adaptation. In that vein, this article provides an overview of HAS concepts, and reviews the recently standardized QoE metrics and reporting framework in 3GPP. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end QoE evaluation study on HAS conducted over 3GPP LTE networks and conclude with a discussion of future challenges and opportunities in QoE optimization for HAS services.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2012.6178830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6178830","","Streaming media;Media;Servers;Wireless communication;Throughput;Supply and demand;Multimedia communication","","221","53","10","IEEE","5 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This impact is derived by means of a control-oriented state-of-health model. The results indicate that the proposed causal strategy effectively reduces battery wear with only a relatively small penalty on fuel consumption. Ultimately, in terms of cost of fuel and battery replacements, the total cost of ownership over the entire life of the vehicle is significantly reduced.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2203836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6214629","Batteries;energy management;optimal control;road vehicle propulsion","Batteries;Fuels;Energy management;Mathematical model;Optimal control;Computational modeling;Electronic countermeasures","","221","","28","IEEE","8 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The distinguishing feature of these scenarios is that outside this spatio-temporal anomalous region, activities appear normal. We develop a probabilistic framework to account for such local spatio-temporal anomalies. We show that our framework admits elegant characterization of optimal decision rules. A key insight of the paper is that if anomalies are local optimal decision rules are local even when the nominal behavior exhibits global spatial and temporal statistical dependencies. This insight helps collapse the large ambient data dimension for detecting local anomalies. Consequently, consistent data-driven local empirical rules with provable performance can be derived with limited training data. Our empirical rules are based on scores functions derived from local nearest neighbor distances. These rules aggregate statistics across spatio-temporal locations & scales, and produce a single composite score for video segments. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme on several video surveillance datasets and compare with existing work.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-1228-8","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247917","","Training;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Vectors;Markov processes;Streaming media;Training data","","220","1","23","IEEE","26 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previously, several attempts have been made to estimate the attenuation coefficients from emission data only. These attempts had limited success, because the problem does not have a unique solution, and severe and persistent “cross-talk” between the estimated activity and attenuation distributions was observed. In this paper, we show that the availability of time-of-flight (TOF) information eliminates the cross-talk problem by destroying symmetries in the associated Fisher information matrix. We propose a maximum-a-posteriori reconstruction algorithm for jointly estimating the attenuation and activity distributions from TOF PET data. The performance of the algorithm is studied with 2-D simulations, and further illustrated with phantom experiments and with a patient scan. The estimated attenuation image is robust to noise, and does not suffer from the cross-talk that was observed in non-TOF PET. However, some constraining is still mandatory, because the TOF data determine the attenuation sinogram only up to a constant offset.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2012.2212719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6264102","Activity and attenuation cross-talk;attenuation correction;joint estimation;maximum likelihood;time-of-flight (TOF) positron emission tomography (PET)","Attenuation;Image reconstruction;Positron emission tomography;Phantoms;Image resolution;Maximum likelihood estimation;Joints","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Phantoms, Imaging;Positron-Emission Tomography;Thorax","220","5","34","IEEE","9 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most MCBF designs assume perfect channel state information (CSI) of mobile stations (MSs); however CSI errors are inevitable at the BSs in practice. Assuming elliptically bounded CSI errors, this paper studies the robust MCBF design problem that minimizes the weighted sum power of BSs subject to worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints on the MSs. Our goal is to devise a distributed optimization method to obtain the worst-case robust beamforming solutions in a decentralized fashion with only local CSI used at each BS and limited backhaul information exchange between BSs. However, the considered problem is difficult to handle even in the centralized form. We first propose an efficient approximation method for solving the nonconvex centralized problem, using semidefinite relaxation (SDR), an approximation technique based on convex optimization. Then a distributed robust MCBF algorithm is further proposed, using a distributed convex optimization technique known as alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We analytically show the convergence of the proposed distributed robust MCBF algorithm to the optimal centralized solution. We also extend the worst-case robust beamforming design as well as its decentralized implementation method to a fully coordinated scenario. Simulation results are presented to examine the effectiveness of the proposed SDR method and the distributed robust MCBF algorithm.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2188719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6156468","Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM);convex optimization;coordinated multipoint (CoMP);distributed optimization;multicell processing;robust beamforming;semidefinite relaxation (SDR)","Robustness;Array signal processing;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation methods;Signal processing algorithms","","220","2","45","IEEE","22 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach is based on the consensus + innovations framework, in which each network agent participates in a collaborative process of neighborhood message exchange and local computation. The distributed approach is shown to converge to the optimal dispatch under rather weak assumptions on the agent communication network connectivity. Intuitively, the proposed approach includes a consensus term which achieves convergence to a common incremental cost value and an innovation term which ensures that the total generation is equal to the load to be supplied. Further, in the proposed approach each network bus only needs to be aware of its local cost parameters and the local predicted load and the neighborhood communication involves exchanging only the locally determined marginal energy price with a few neighbors. Robustness of the proposed approach and techniques for convergence rate improvement are discussed. Finally, simulation studies on the benchmark IEEE 14 bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","1944-9925","978-1-4673-2729-9","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345156","","Generators;Indexes;Technological innovation;Robustness;Economics;Convergence;Laplace equations","","219","2","15","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this, we explore and evaluate a number of different techniques using realistic simulation models under the many-to-one communication paradigm known as convergecast. We first consider time scheduling on a single frequency channel with the aim of minimizing the number of time slots required (schedule length) to complete a convergecast. Next, we combine scheduling with transmission power control to mitigate the effects of interference, and show that while power control helps in reducing the schedule length under a single frequency, scheduling transmissions using multiple frequencies is more efficient. We give lower bounds on the schedule length when interference is completely eliminated, and propose algorithms that achieve these bounds. We also evaluate the performance of various channel assignment methods and find empirically that for moderate size networks of about 100 nodes, the use of multifrequency scheduling can suffice to eliminate most of the interference. Then, the data collection rate no longer remains limited by interference but by the topology of the routing tree. To this end, we construct degree-constrained spanning trees and capacitated minimal spanning trees, and show significant improvement in scheduling performance over different deployment densities. Lastly, we evaluate the impact of different interference and channel models on the schedule length.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2011.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710940","Convergecast;TDMA scheduling;multiple channels;power control;routing trees.","Interference;Schedules;Routing protocols;Power control;Time division multiple access;Wireless sensor networks","","219","1","27","IEEE","10 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The power generation and radiator core is based on a novel method called distributed active radiation, which enables high conversion efficiency from DC to radiated terahertz power above fmax of a technology. The design evolution of the distributed active radiator (DAR) follows from an inverse design approach, where metal surface currents at different harmonics are formulated in the silicon chip for the desired electromagnetic field profiles. Circuits and passives are then designed conjointly to synthesize and control the surface currents. The DAR consists of a self-oscillating active electromagnetic structure, comprising of two loops which sustain out-of-phase currents at the fundamental frequency and in-phase currents at the second harmonic. The fundamental signal, thus gets, spatially filtered, while the second harmonic is radiated selectively, thereby consolidating signal generation, frequency multiplication, radiation of desired harmonic and filtration of undesired harmonics simultaneously in a small silicon footprint. A two-dimensional 4×4 radiating array implemented in 45 nm SOI CMOS (without high-resistivity substrate) radiates with an EIRP of +9.4 dBm at 0.28 THz and beam-steers in 2D over 80° in both azimuth and elevation. The chip occupies 2.7 mm × 2.7 mm and dissipates 820 mW of DC power.

In the signal injection sensorless control, however, the fundamental control performance is limited by the frequency of the injected signal, and no negligible acoustic noise is generated. If the frequency of the injected voltage signal would increase to pulsewidth modulation (PWM) switching frequency and if the switching frequency is near or above audible range, the dynamics of the sensorless control can be improved, and the acoustic noise can be remarkably reduced or totally eliminated. This paper describes how to extract the rotor position information of IPMSM using the voltage signal injection whose frequency is the same as the PWM switching frequency. Compared to the conventional heterodyning process, the proposed method is simple to implement and appropriate for PWM switching frequency signal injection. The high-frequency voltage signal can be injected in the stationary reference frame or in the estimated rotor reference frame. In this paper, the 5- and 16-kHz signal injections are proposed, implemented, and compared. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2012.2210175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6266731","AC machine;motor drives;sensorless control;signal injection","Rotors;Pulse width modulation;Vectors;Inductance;Switching frequency;Demodulation;Voltage measurement","","218","4","24","IEEE","13 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The frequency of each DER unit is specified by its independent internal oscillator and all oscillators are synchronized by a common time-reference signal received from a global positioning system. The PMS specifies the voltage set points for the local controllers. A linear, time-invariant, multivariable, robust, decentralized, servomechanism control system is designed to track the set points.

This limit arises from the interplay of a number of factors including the Shannon limit, optical fiber nonlinearities, the fiber fuse effect, as well as optical amplifier bandwidth. This article reviews the most recent research efforts around the globe launched over the past few years with a view to overcome these limitations and substantially increase capacity by exploring the last degree of freedom available: the spatial domain.

The SMOS operational products and the SMOS reprocessing products are both used and compared over year 2010. First, a direct node-to-site comparison is performed by taking advantage of the oversampling of the SMOS product grid. The comparison is performed over several adjacent nodes to site, and several representative couples of site-node are identified.

A radiometric aggregation approach based on the antenna footprint and spatial description is used. A global comparison of the SCAN/SNOTEL versus SMOS is made. Statistics show an underestimation of the soil moisture from SMOS compared to the SCAN/SNOTEL local measurements.

A secure networked predictive control system (SNPCS) architecture is presented, which integrates the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, Message Digest (MD5) algorithm, timestamp strategy, and recursive networked predictive control (RNPC) method. The former three parts are used to form a secure transmission mechanism between the controller side and the plant side, which is responsible for enforcing the data confidentiality and checking the data integrity and authenticity. To guarantee the control system performance when suffering from deception attacks, the RNPC method based on round-trip time delays is proposed to compensate for the adverse effects introduced by the deception attacks as well as the network communication constraints, such as time-varying network delay, packet disorder and packet dropout. A theoretical result using the switched system theory is obtained for the closed-loop stability of the RNPC system.

At each time multiple random variables can be selected, subject to an arbitrary constraint on weights associated with the selected variables. All of the selected individual random variables are observed at that time, and a linearly weighted combination of these selected variables is yielded as the reward. The goal is to find a policy that minimizes regret, defined as the difference between the reward obtained by a genie that knows the mean of each random variable, and that obtained by the given policy. This formulation is broadly applicable and useful for stochastic online versions of many interesting tasks in networks that can be formulated as tractable combinatorial optimization problems with linear objective functions, such as maximum weighted matching, shortest path, and minimum spanning tree computations. Prior work on multi-armed bandits with multiple plays cannot be applied to this formulation because of the general nature of the constraint. On the other hand, the mapping of all feasible combinations to arms allows for the use of prior work on MAB with single-play, but results in regret, storage, and computation growing exponentially in the number of unknown variables. We present new efficient policies for this problem that are shown to achieve regret that grows logarithmically with time, and polynomially in the number of unknown variables. Furthermore, these policies only require storage that grows linearly in the number of unknown parameters. For problems where the underlying deterministic problem is tractable, these policies further require only polynomial computation. For computationally intractable problems, we also present results on a different notion of regret that is suitable when a polynomial-time approximation algorithm is used.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6166915","Combinatorial network optimization;multi-armed bandits (MABs);online learning","Random variables;Optimization;Upper bound;Polynomials;Indexes;Algorithm design and analysis;Radiation detectors","","217","1","38","IEEE","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method can generate an output voltage with maximally 2N+1 (where N is the number of submodules in the upper or lower arm of MMC) levels, which is as great as that of the carrier-phase-shifted PWM (CPSPWM) method. However, no phase-shifted carrier is needed. Compared with the existing submodule unified pulse width modulated (SUPWM) method, the level number of the output voltage is almost doubled and the height of the step in the staircase voltage is reduced by 50%. Meanwhile, the equivalent switching frequency in the output voltage is twice that of the conventional SUPWM method. All these features lead to much reduced harmonic content in the output voltage. What is more, the voltages of the submodule capacitors can be well balanced without any close-loop voltage balancing controllers which are mandatory in the CPSPWM schemes.

Specifically, we extract statistical features from a multiscale multiorientation divisive normalization transform and develop a distortion measure by following the philosophy in the construction of SSIM. We find an interesting linear relationship between the FR SSIM measure and our RR estimate when the image distortion type is fixed. A regression-by-discretization method is then applied to normalize our measure across image distortion types. We use six publicly available subject-rated databases to test the proposed RR-SSIM method, which shows strong correlations with both SSIM and subjective quality evaluations. Finally, we introduce the novel idea of partially repairing an image using RR features and use deblurring as an example to demonstrate its application.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2197011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6193206","Divisive normalization transform;image deblurring;image repairing;natural image statistics;reduced-reference image quality assessment (RR-IQA);structural similarity","Distortion measurement;Feature extraction;Nonlinear distortion;Transforms;Image quality;Receivers;Estimation","Algorithms;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reference Values;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","216","1","62","IEEE","1 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is motivated from the observation that human actions are rarely performed in isolation; the contextual information of what other people in the scene are doing provides a useful cue for understanding high-level activities. We propose a novel framework for recognizing group activities which jointly captures the group activity, the individual person actions, and the interactions among them. Two types of contextual information, group-person interaction and person-person interaction, are explored in a latent variable framework. In particular, we propose three different approaches to model the person-person interaction. One approach is to explore the structures of person-person interaction. Differently from most of the previous latent structured models, which assume a predefined structure for the hidden layer, e.g., a tree structure, we treat the structure of the hidden layer as a latent variable and implicitly infer it during learning and inference. The second approach explores person-person interaction in the feature level. We introduce a new feature representation called the action context (AC) descriptor. The AC descriptor encodes information about not only the action of an individual person in the video, but also the behavior of other people nearby. The third approach combines the above two. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using contextual information for disambiguating group activities.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095563","Group activity recognition;context;latent structured models.","Context;Feature extraction;Biological system modeling;Humans;Adaptation models;Vectors;Context modeling","Accidental Falls;Activities of Daily Living;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Discriminant Analysis;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Interpersonal Relations;Models, Theoretical;Nursing Homes;ROC Curve;Social Behavior;Spatial Behavior;Video Recording","216","2","48","IEEE","6 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The adaptive control strategy consists of a Lyapunov stability-based fuzzy speed controller that capitalizes on the machine's inverse model to achieve accurate tracking with unknown nonlinear system dynamics. As such, robustness to modeling and parametric uncertainties is achieved. Moreover, no explicit currents loop regulation is needed, which simplifies the control structure and unlike other control strategies, no a priori offline training, weights initialization, parameters knowledge, voltage, or current transducer is required. The system's convergence and stability are proved by Lyapunov stability theory, which yields an improved performance. Simulation results for different situations highlight the performance of the proposed controller in transient, steady-state, and standstill conditions. Furthermore, the adaptive fuzzy systems inherent parallelism makes them a good candidate for implementation in real-time PMSM drive systems.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2011.2148678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5759077","Artificial intelligence;fuzzy logic;Lyapunov stability;neurofuzzy control;speed control;synchronous machine","Fuzzy logic;Friction;Uncertainty;Mathematical model;Torque;Computational modeling;Voltage control","","216","","25","IEEE","29 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network virtualization is being adopted in both telecommunications and the Internet as a key attribute for the next generation networking. Virtualization, as a potential enabler of profound changes in both communications and computing domains, is expected to bridge the gap between these two fields. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), when applied in network virtualization, enables a Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) paradigm that may greatly facilitate the convergence of networking and Cloud computing. Recently the application of SOA in network virtualization has attracted extensive interest from both academia and industry. Although numerous relevant research works have been published, they are currently scattered across multiple fields in the literature, including telecommunications, computer networking, Web services, and Cloud computing. In this article we present a comprehensive survey on the latest developments in service-oriented network virtualization for supporting Cloud computing, particularly from a perspective of network and Cloud convergence through NaaS. Specifically, we first introduce the SOA principle and review recent research progress on applying SOA to support network virtualization in both telecommunications and the Internet. Then we present a framework of network-Cloud convergence based on service-oriented network virtualization and give a survey on key technologies for realizing NaaS, mainly focusing on state of the art of network service description, discovery, and composition. We also discuss the challenges brought in by network-Cloud convergence to these technologies and research opportunities available in these areas, with a hope to arouse the research community's interest in this emerging interdisciplinary field.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2012.113012.120310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375901","Network virtualization;the service-oriented architecture;cloud computing;network-as-a-Service (NaaS)","Cloud computing;Service oriented architecture;Virtualization","","216","2","133","IEEE","10 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, based on this assumption, we propose using robust principal component analysis for singing-voice separation from music accompaniment. Moreover, we examine the separation result by using a binary time-frequency masking method.

We applied our approach to the 32,108 non-zero priced apps available in the Blackberry app store in September 2011. Our results show that there is a strong correlation between customer rating and the rank of app downloads, though perhaps surprisingly, there is no correlation between price and downloads, nor between price and rating.

This has led to the extensive use of peak load plants and thus to higher costs for the whole system. Wind energy represents a strongly increasing percentage of overall electricity production, but wind normally does not follow the typical demand profile. As generation flexibility is limited due to technical restrictions, and in absence of large energy storages, the other side of the equilibrium generation-demand has to react. Demand side management measures intend to adapt the demand profile to the situation in the system. In this paper, the operation of an electric system with high wind penetration is modeled by means of a unit commitment problem. Demand shifting and peak shaving are considered in this operation problem. Demand shifting is modeled in two different ways. Firstly, the system operator controls the shift of demand; secondly, each consumer decides its reaction to prices depending on its elasticity. The model is applied to the isolated power system of Gran Canaria. The impact of an increased installed wind capacity on operation and the cost savings resulting from the introduction of responsive demand are assessed. Furthermore, results from the different implemented demand response options are compared.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2159252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999750","Large-scale integration;load management;power system modeling;wind power generation","Load management;Production;Electricity;Elasticity;Mathematical model;Wind forecasting;Load modeling","","216","1","29","IEEE","25 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The randomly occurring phenomena include randomly occurring sensor saturations (ROSSs) and randomly varying sensor delays (RVSDs) that result typically from networked environments. A novel sensor model is proposed to describe the ROSSs and the RVSDs within a unified framework via two sets of Bernoulli-distributed white sequences with known conditional probabilities. Rather than employing the commonly used Lipschitz-type function, a more general sector-like nonlinear function is used to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that, for all probabilistic sensor saturations and sensor delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be exponentially mean-square stable and the effect from the exogenous disturbances to the estimation accuracy is attenuated at a given level by means of an  $H_{\infty}$-norm. In terms of a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and the Kronecker product, sufficient conditions are established under which the addressed state estimation problem is recast as solving a convex optimization problem via the semidefinite programming method.

In this paper, we extract and analyze experimental performance data from a large body of published designs to establish several facts that have not previously been demonstrated: (1) The theoretical performance limit for size, bandwidth, and efficiency are validated by all available experimental evidence. (2) Although derived for electrically small antennas, the same theoretical limit is also generally a good design rule for antennas that are not electrically small. (3) The theoretical predictions for the performance due to design factors such as permittivity, aspect ratio, and the internal structure of the antenna are also supported by the experimental evidence.

Although weather-based modeling is common, univariate models can be useful when the lead time of interest is less than one day. A class of univariate methods that has performed well with intraday data is exponential smoothing. This paper considers five recently developed exponentially weighted methods that have not previously been used for load forecasting. These methods include several exponential smoothing formulations, as well as methods using discount weighted regression, cubic splines, and singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, this paper presents a new SVD-based exponential smoothing formulation. Using British and French half-hourly load data, these methods are compared for point forecasting up to one day ahead. Although the new SVD-based approach showed some potential, the best performing method was a previously developed exponential smoothing method. A second empirical study showed the better of the univariate methods outperforming a weather-based method up to about five hours ahead, with a combination of these methods producing the best results overall.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2161780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978238","Discount weighted regression;exponential smoothing;load forecasting;singular value decomposition;spline functions","Smoothing methods;Load modeling;Splines (mathematics);Integrated circuit modeling;Artificial neural networks;Forecasting","","215","","20","IEEE","8 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Real-world rear-end crashes were extracted from a nationally representative sample of collisions in the United States. A sample of 1396 collisions, corresponding to 1.1 million crashes, were computationally simulated as if they occurred, with the driver operating a precollision-system-equipped vehicle. A probability-based framework was developed to account for the variable driver reaction to the warning system. As more components were added to the algorithms, greater benefits were realized. The results indicate that the exemplar PCS investigated in this paper could reduce the severity (i.e., ΔV) of the collision between 14% and 34%. The number of moderately to fatally injured drivers who wore their seat belts could have been reduced by 29% to 50%. These collision-mitigating algorithms could have prevented 3.2% to 7.7% of rear-end collisions. This paper shows the dramatic reductions in serious and fatal injuries that a PCS, which is one of the first intelligent vehicle technologies to be deployed in production cars, can bring to highway safety when available throughout the fleet. This paper also presents the framework of an innovative safety benefits methodology that, when adapted to other emerging active safety technologies, can be employed to estimate potential reductions in the frequency and severity of highway crashes.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2012.2191542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6180219","Crash-imminent braking;intelligent transportation systems (ITSs);precollision system (PCS);rear-end collisions;safety systems","Vehicle safety;Vehicle crash testing;Algorithm design and analysis;Collision avoidance","","215","","32","IEEE","10 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system behavior modeling by MATLAB Stateflow leads to the whole control strategy design, which concerns the power balancing and imposed power limits by the utility grid, while providing interface for energy management. Experimental results evaluate the feasibility of the proposed control strategy. As further development of this control design, an intelligent multi-layer supervision is suggested. This supervision, able to exchange data with the smart grid, deals with the end-user demand, forecast of photovoltaic production, prediction of load consumption, and energy management. The major technical contribution of this paper is linked to the proposed control design that permits better DC microgrid integration (avoids undesired injection, mitigates fluctuations in grid power, reduces grid peak consumption) and provides possibility to reduce the negative impact on the utility grid thanks to the supervision interface.

It is revealed that, when the bending radius is large and the correlation length is large, the average PCC is inversely proportional to the correlation length and to the square of the propagation constant difference Δβmn between core m and core n, and when the bending radius is small and the correlation length is large, the average PCC is proportional to the bending radius and is independent of the correlation length. When the correlation length is small, on the other hand, the average PCC is proportional to the correlation length and is independent of the bending radius. For homogeneous MCFs (Δβmn = 0) with small bending radius, the average PCC coincides with the mean crosstalk increase per unit length derived from the coupled-mode theory of Hayashi et al. that is proportional to the bending radius. Average crosstalk values calculated by using the analytical expression derived here are in excellent agreement with those of numerical solutions of coupled-power equations, irrespective of the values of bending radius and correlation length.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2012.2221085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6316044","Multicore fiber (MCF);intercore crosstalk;coupled-power theory (CPT);power-coupling coefficient (PCC);analytical expression","Correlation;Crosstalk;Optical fiber networks;Optical fiber theory;Propagation constant;Mathematical model;Integral equations","","215","212","16","IEEE","28 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the problem of a plane wave obliquely impinging on a graphene sheet is analyzed to provide physical insight into the fundamentals of graphene gyrotropy. It is found that graphene rotates the polarization of any plane wave impinging on it. The rotation angle is larger for H-polarized oblique waves than for normally incident waves and increases as the angle of incidence increases. The opposite holds for E waves. A general transmission matrix model is then developed for an arbitrary cylindrical waveguide and for a graphene sheet inside such a waveguide. This model is next applied to a circular cylindrical waveguide loaded with one or several graphene sheets and excited in its dominant H11 mode. Although the rotation angle from a single graphene sheet is quite high at high chemical potential, the corresponding transmission level is small due to the poor matching associated with the high density of the sheet. This fact prohibits the cascading of graphene sheets with high chemical potential as an approach to increase the amount of rotation. However, by decreasing the chemical potential, graphene may be well matched to waveguide modes, and therefore a large number of graphene sheets (ten in this study) may be used to produce a significant amount of rotation with relatively low insertion loss.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2011.2182205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133310","Faraday rotation;graphene;nonreciprocal components","Conductivity;Cyclotrons;Optical waveguides;Charge carrier processes;Chemicals;Microwave theory and techniques","","215","","30","IEEE","17 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, because of flaws in the measurement systems or difficulties posed by the measurement problem itself, missing, ambiguous, or indirect data are common. In the case where such data have spatio-temporal structure, it is natural to try to leverage this structure to deal with the challenges posed by the problematic nature of the data. Our work involving network datasets draws on ideas from the area of compressive sensing and matrix completion, where sparsity is exploited in estimating quantities of interest. However, the standard results on compressive sensing are: 1) reliant on conditions that generally do not hold for network datasets; and 2) do not allow us to exploit all we know about their spatio-temporal structure. In this paper, we overcome these limitations with an algorithm that has at its heart the same ideas espoused in compressive sensing, but adapted to the problem of network datasets. We show how this algorithm can be used in a variety of ways, in particular on traffic data, to solve problems such as simple interpolation of missing values, traffic matrix inference from link data, prediction, and anomaly detection. The elegance of the approach lies in the fact that it unifies all of these tasks and allows them to be performed even when as much as 98% of the data is missing.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2169424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058636","Compressed sensing;interpolation;prediction methods;tomography","Interpolation;Compressed sensing;Sparse matrices;Matrix decomposition;Redundancy;Approximation algorithms","","215","","44","IEEE","21 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We determine the information-theoretic capacity of the classical additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with an energy harvesting transmitter with an unlimited sized battery. As the energy arrives randomly and can be saved in the battery, codewords must obey cumulative stochastic energy constraints. We show that the capacity of the AWGN channel with such stochastic channel input constraints is equal to the capacity with an average power constraint equal to the average recharge rate. We provide two capacity achieving schemes: save-and-transmit and best-effort-transmit. In the save-and-transmit scheme, the transmitter collects energy in a saving phase of proper duration that guarantees that there will be no energy shortages during the transmission of code symbols. In the best-effort-transmit scheme, the transmission starts right away without an initial saving period, and the transmitter sends a code symbol if there is sufficient energy in the battery, and a zero symbol otherwise. Finally, we consider a system in which the average recharge rate is time varying in a larger time scale and derive the optimal offline power policy that maximizes the average throughput, by using majorization theory.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2012.2204389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6216430","Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel;energy harvesting;offline power management;Shannon capacity","Batteries;Energy harvesting;AWGN channels;Decoding;Random variables;AWGN;Data communication","","215","","23","IEEE","12 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, we implement the Bug algorithm for autonomous wall-following which could optionally be selected as the substitute exploration algorithm in sparse environments where the frontier-based exploration under-performs. We incrementally build a 3D global occupancy map on-board the MAV.

During the exploration phase, images from the front-looking camera are transmitted over Wi-Fi to the ground station. These images are input to a large-scale visual SLAM process running off-board on the ground station. SLAM is carried out with pose-graph optimization and loop closure detection using a vocabulary tree. We improve the robustness of the pose estimation by fusing optical flow and visual odometry.

When the delay is left uncompensated, the sampling period is generally required to be sufficiently small, the delay sufficiently short, and, for nonlinear systems, only semiglobal practical stability is generally achieved. For example, global stabilization of strict-feedforward systems under sampled measurements, sampled-data stabilization of the nonholonomic unicycle with arbitrarily sparse sampling, and sampled-data stabilization of LTI systems over networks with long delays, are open problems. In this paper, we present two general results that address these example problems as special cases. First, we present global asymptotic stabilizers for forward complete systems under arbitrarily long input and output delays, with arbitrarily long sampling periods, and with continuous application of the control input. Second, we consider systems with sampled measurements and with control applied through a zero-order hold, under the assumption that the system is stabilizable under sampled-data feedback for some sampling period, and then construct sampled-data feedback laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization under arbitrarily long input and measurement delays. All the results employ “nominal” feedback laws designed for the continuous-time systems in the absence of delays, combined with “predictor-based” compensation of delays and the effect of sampling.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2170451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032730","Feedback stabilization;nonlinear control;sampled-data systems;time-delay systems","Delay;Nonlinear systems;Asymptotic stability;Differential equations;Networked control systems;Sufficient conditions","","214","","44","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Answers, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and etc.) emerged in recent years that allow requesters from all around the world to post tasks and seek help from an equally global pool of workers. However, intrinsic incentive problems reside in crowdsourcing applications as workers and requester are selfish and aim to strategically maximize their own benefit. In this paper, we propose to provide incentives for workers to exert effort using a novel game-theoretic model based on repeated games. As there is always a gap in the social welfare between the non-cooperative equilibria emerging when workers pursue their self-interests and the desirable Pareto efficient outcome, we propose a novel class of incentive protocols based on social norms which integrates reputation mechanisms into the existing pricing schemes currently implemented on crowdsourcing websites, in order to improve the performance of the non-cooperative equilibria emerging in such applications. We first formulate the exchanges on a crowdsourcing website as a two-sided market where requesters and workers are matched and play gift-giving games repeatedly. Subsequently, we study the protocol designer's problem of finding an optimal and sustainable (equilibrium) protocol which achieves the highest social welfare for that website. We prove that the proposed incentives protocol can make the website operate close to Pareto efficiency.

In addition, to increase the system utilization, the three-phase neutral point clamped inverter can be designed to also provide functions of active filter using the p-q theory.

Two kinds of modified schemes for three-level DTC are proposed to solve these problems. They also provide performance enhancement while maintaining robustness and simplicity. Fuzzy logic control and the speed-adaptive flux observer (with novel gain and load toque observation) are introduced to enhance the performance of the system. The issue of large starting current is investigated and solved by introducing the technique of preexcitation.

One of the main connection problems occurs when voltage sags appear in the grid due to short circuits, lightning, etc. International standards regulate the grid connection of PV systems, forcing the source to remain connected during short-time grid-voltage faults. As a consequence, during the voltage sag, the source should operate with increasing converter currents to maintain the injection of the generated power. This abnormal operation may result in nondesired system disconnections due to overcurrents. This paper proposes a controller for a PV three-phase inverter that ensures minimum peak values in the grid-injected currents, as compared with conventional controllers.

We call this optimum detector a linear-threshold detector (LTD). Then, we show that the compound-Gaussian model presented here varies parametrically from the Gaussian clutter model to a clutter model whose tails are evidently heavier than any K-distribution model. Moreover, we show that the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), which is a popular suboptimum detector because of its constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) property, is an optimum detector for our clutter model in the limit as the tails get extremely heavy. The GLRT-LTD is tested against simulated high-resolution sea clutter data to investigate the dependence of its performance on the various clutter parameters.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2012.6129621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6129621","","Clutter;Detectors;Vectors;Radar detection;Noise;Radar clutter","","212","","53","IEEE","16 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Martinelli","INRIA Rhone-Alpes, Grenoble, France",IEEE Transactions on Robotics,"2 Feb 2012","2012","28","1","44","60","This paper investigates the problem of vision and inertial data fusion. A sensor assembling that is constituted by one monocular camera, three orthogonal accelerometers, and three orthogonal gyroscopes is considered. The first paper contribution is the analytical derivation of all the observable modes, i.e., all the physical quantities that can be determined by only using the information in the sensor data that are acquired during a short time interval. Specifically, the observable modes are the speed and attitude (roll and pitch angles), the absolute scale, and the biases that affect the inertial measurements. This holds even in the case when the camera only observes a single point feature. The analytical derivation of the aforementioned observable modes is based on a nonstandard observability analysis, which fully accounts for the system nonlinearities. The second contribution is the analytical derivation of closed-form solutions, which analytically express all the aforementioned observable modes in terms of the visual and inertial measurements that are collected during a very short time interval. This allows the introduction of a very simple and powerful new method that is able to simultaneously estimate all the observable modes with no need for any initialization or a priori knowledge. Both the observability analysis and the derivation of the closed-form solutions are carried out in several different contexts, including the case of biased and unbiased inertial measurements, the case of a single and multiple features, and in the presence and absence of gravity. In addition, in all these contexts, the minimum number of camera images that are necessary for the observability is derived. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations and real experiments.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2011.2160468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959226","Aerial robotics;computer vision;nonlinear observability;sensor fusion;vision-aided inertial navigation","Robot sensing systems;Vehicles;Cameras;Observability;Closed-form solution;Accelerometers","","212","12","31","IEEE","21 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cognitive radios need to not only rapidly identify spectrum opportunities over very wide bandwidth, but also make reliable decisions in noise-uncertain environments. Cyclic spectrum sensing techniques work well under noise uncertainty, but require high-rate sampling which is very costly in the wideband regime. This paper develops robust and compressive wideband spectrum sensing techniques by exploiting the unique sparsity property of the two-dimensional cyclic spectra of communications signals. To do so, a new compressed sensing framework is proposed for extracting useful second-order statistics of wideband random signals from digital samples taken at sub-Nyquist rates. The time-varying cross-correlation functions of these compressive samples are formulated to reveal the cyclic spectrum, which is then used to simultaneously detect multiple signal sources over the entire wide band. Because the proposed wideband cyclic spectrum estimator utilizes all the cross-correlation terms of compressive samples to extract second-order statistics, it is also able to recover the power spectra of stationary signals as a special case, permitting lossless rate compression even for non-sparse signals. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed spectrum sensing algorithms against both sampling rate reduction and noise uncertainty in wireless networks.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2181940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6117060","Cognitive radio (CR);compressive sampling;cyclic spectrum;feature detection;wideband spectrum sensing","Wideband;Sensors;Noise;Vectors;Covariance matrix;Feature extraction;Robustness","","212","","36","IEEE","28 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The power, secrecy data rate, and subcarrier allocation policies are optimized for maximization of the energy efficiency of secure data transmission (bit/joule securely delivered to the users). The considered nonconvex optimization problem is transformed into a convex optimization problem by exploiting the properties of fractional programming, which results in an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, the transformed problem is solved by using dual decomposition. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithm not only converges in a small number of iterations but maximizes the system energy efficiency and guarantees a nonzero secrecy data rate for the desired users as well.

Base stations in the same cooperation cluster employ joint transmission with linear zero-forcing beamforming, subject to sum or per-base station power constraints. Intercluster interference is treated as noise at the user terminals. Analytic expressions for the system spectral efficiency are found in the large-system limit where both the numbers of users and antennas per base station tend to infinity with a given ratio. In particular, for the per-base station power constraint, we find new results in random matrix theory, yielding the squared Frobenius norm of submatrices of the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse for the structured non-i.i.d. channel matrix resulting from the cooperation cluster, user distribution, and path-loss coefficients. The analysis is extended to the case of nonideal Channel State Information at the Transmitters obtained through explicit downlink channel training and uplink feedback. Specifically, our results illuminate the trade-off between the benefit of a larger number of cooperating antennas and the cost of estimating higher-dimensional channel vectors. Furthermore, our analysis leads to a new simplified downlink scheduling scheme that preselects the users according to probabilities obtained from the large-system results, depending on the desired fairness criterion.

Each component can be used to quantify the maximum energy storage requirement for different types of energy storage. This requirement is the physical limit that could be theoretically accommodated by a power system. The actual energy storage capacity can be further quantified within this limit by the cost-benefit analysis (future work).

We introduce the Fast Sampling Plane Filtering (FSPF) algorithm to reduce the volume of the 3D point cloud by sampling points from the depth image, and classifying local grouped sets of points as belonging to planes in 3D (the “plane filtered” points) or points that do not correspond to planes within a specified error margin (the “outlier” points). We then introduce a localization algorithm based on an observation model that down-projects the plane filtered points on to 2D, and assigns correspondences for each point to lines in the 2D map. The full sampled point cloud (consisting of both plane filtered as well as outlier points) is processed for obstacle avoidance for autonomous navigation. All our algorithms process only the depth information, and do not require additional RGB data. The FSPF, localization and obstacle avoidance algorithms run in real time at full camera frame rates (30Hz) with low CPU requirements (16%).

Vehicle-safety-related communication services, which require reliable and fast message delivery, usually demand broadcast communications in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In this paper, we propose and justify a distributive cross-layer scheme for the design of the control channel in DSRC with three levels of broadcast services that are critical to most potential vehicle-safety-related applications. The new scheme for enhancing broadcast reliability includes preemptive priority in safety services, dynamic receiver-oriented packet repetitions for one-hop emergency warning message dissemination, a multifrequency busy tone and minislot within the distributed interframe space (DIFS) in IEEE 802.11, and robust distance-based relay selection for multihop broadcast of emergency notification messages. Compared with a current draft of IEEE 802.11p and other schemes for DSRC safety-related services, the scheme proposed in this paper is more robust and scalable and easy to implement. Additionally, we investigate the reliability and performance of the proposed broadcast scheme for DSRC VANET safety-related services on the highway analytically and by simulations. The analytic model accounts for the impact of the hidden terminal problem, the fading channel conditions, varied message arrival intervals, and the backoff counter process on reliability and performance.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2011.2177675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092508","Broadcast;IEEE 802.11p;performance;reliability;safety-related service;vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)","Vehicles;Safety;Reliability;Ad hoc networks;Protocols;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Analytical models","","211","1","36","IEEE","29 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a novel band-limited digital predistortion technique in which a band-limiting function is inserted into the general Volterra operators in the DPD model to control the signal bandwidth under modeling, which logically transforms the general Volterra series-based model into a band-limited version. This new approach eliminates the system bandwidth constraints of the conventional DPD techniques, and it allows users to arbitrarily choose the bandwidth to be linearized in the PA output according to the system requirement without sacrificing performance, which makes the DPD system design much more flexible and feasible. In order to validate this idea, a high-power LDMOS Doherty PA excited by various wideband signals, including 100-MHz long-term evolution advanced signals, was tested. Experimental results showed that excellent linearization performance can be obtained by employing the proposed approach. Furthermore, this technique can be applied to other linear-in-parameter models.

Most fingerprinting-based systems so far rely on the received signal strength (RSS), which can be easily measured at the receiver with commercial WLAN equipment. However, RSS is a coarse value which simply measures the received power for a whole channel. Thus, it fluctuates over time in typical indoor environments with rich multipath effects and not unique for a specific location. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Fine-grained Indoor Fingerprinting System (FIFS). FIFS explores a PHYlayer Channel State Information (CSI) that specifies the channel status over all the subcarriers for location fingerprinting in WLAN. The system leverages the CSI values including different amplitudes and phases at multiple propagation paths, known as the frequency diversity, to uniquely manifest a location. Moreover, the multiple antennas provides the spatial diversity that can be further augmented in fingerprinting. We also present a coherence bandwidth-enhanced probability algorithm with a correlation filter to map object to the fingerprints. We conducted experiments in two typical indoor scenarios with commercial IEEE 802.11 NICs. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall positioning accuracy can be improved compared with the RSS-based Horus system.","1095-2055","978-1-4673-1544-9","10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289200","","OFDM;Antennas;Correlation;Accuracy;Receivers;Estimation;Fingerprint recognition","","210","1","20","IEEE","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this vein, this paper focuses on the discrimination between subjects' electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to self-assessed liked or disliked music, acquired during an experimental procedure, by evaluating different feature extraction approaches and classifiers to this end. Feature extraction is based on time-frequency (TF) analysis by implementing three TF techniques, i.e., spectrogram, Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution and Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS). Feature estimation also accounts for physiological parameters that relate to EEG frequency bands, reference states, time intervals, and hemispheric asymmetries. Classification is performed by employing four classifiers, i.e., support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), quadratic and Mahalanobis distance-based discriminant analyses. According to the experimental results across nine subjects, best classification accuracy {86.52 (±0.76)%} was achieved using k-NN and HHS-based feature vectors ( FVs) representing a bilateral average activity, referred to a resting period, in β (13-30 Hz) and γ (30-49 Hz) bands. Activity in these bands may point to a connection between music preference and emotional arousal phenomena. Furthermore, HHS-based FVs were found to be robust against noise corruption. The outcomes of this study provide early evidence and pave the way for the development of a generalized brain computer interface for music preference recognition.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2217495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6313893","Electroencephalogram (EEG);machine learning;music liking/disliking;time–frequency (TF) analysis","Electroencephalography;Time frequency analysis;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Brain models","Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Brain Mapping;Electroencephalography;Female;Humans;Male;Music;Pleasure;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Young Adult","210","1","43","IEEE","27 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, when two requests go to the same bank, they have to be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of off-chip memory. Adding more banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. Our goal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks with a low cost approach. To this end, we propose three new mechanisms that overlap the latencies of different requests that go to the same bank. The key observation exploited by our mechanisms is that a modern DRAM bank is implemented as a collection of subarrays that operate largely independently while sharing few global peripheral structures. Our proposed mechanisms (SALP-1, SALP-2, and MASA) mitigate the negative impact of bank serialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies of multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank. SALP-1 requires no changes to the existing DRAM structure and only needs reinterpretation of some DRAM timing parameters. SALP-2 and MASA require only modest changes (<;0.15% area overhead) to the DRAM peripheral structures, which are much less design constrained than the DRAM core. Evaluations show that all our schemes significantly improve performance for both single-core systems and multi-core systems.

The objective is to design a suitable observer-based dynamic output feedback controller that guarantees the global stability of the resulting closed-loop fuzzy system with a prescribed ${\mathscr H}_{\infty }$ disturbance attenuation level. Based on common/piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions combined with S-procedure and some matrix inequality convexification techniques, some new results are developed to the controller synthesis for the underlying continuous-time T–S fuzzy affine systems with unmeasurable premise variables. All the solutions to the problem are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approaches.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2191790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174468","Controller design;measurement quantization;piecewise Lyapunov functions;robust ${\mathscr H}_{\infty }$ control;Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy affine dynamic systems","Lyapunov methods;Output feedback;Fuzzy systems;Observers;Quantization;Linear matrix inequalities","","209","","50","IEEE","23 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

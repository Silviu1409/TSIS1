Wakin","Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, FR; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA",IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,"21 Mar 2008","2008","25","2","21","30","Conventional approaches to sampling signals or images follow Shannon's theorem: the sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal (Nyquist rate). In the field of data conversion, standard analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology implements the usual quantized Shannon representation - the signal is uniformly sampled at or above the Nyquist rate. This article surveys the theory of compressive sampling, also known as compressed sensing or CS, a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against the common wisdom in data acquisition. CS theory asserts that one can recover certain signals and images from far fewer samples or measurements than traditional methods use.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2007.914731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4472240","","Sampling methods;Image sampling;Protocols;Signal sampling;Image coding;Frequency;Signal processing;Data acquisition;Biomedical imaging;Receivers","","7749","170","30","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Biogeography-Based Optimization","D.

Mathematical equations that govern the distribution of organisms were first discovered and developed during the 1960s. The mindset of the engineer is that we can learn from nature. This motivates the application of biogeography to optimization problems. Just as the mathematics of biological genetics inspired the development of genetic algorithms (GAs), and the mathematics of biological neurons inspired the development of artificial neural networks, this paper considers the mathematics of biogeography as the basis for the development of a new field: biogeography-based optimization (BBO). We discuss natural biogeography and its mathematics, and then discuss how it can be used to solve optimization problems. We see that BBO has features in common with other biology-based optimization methods, such as GAs and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This makes BBO applicable to many of the same types of problems that GAs and PSO are used for, namely, high-dimension problems with multiple local optima. However, BBO also has some features that are unique among biology-based optimization methods. We demonstrate the performance of BBO on a set of 14 standard benchmarks and compare it with seven other biology-based optimization algorithms. We also demonstrate BBO on a real-world sensor selection problem for aircraft engine health estimation.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2008.919004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4475427","Biogeography;evolutionary algorithms;Kalman filter;optimization;sensor selection","Biogeography;Mathematics;Optimization methods;Biological systems;Equations;Organisms;Genetic algorithms;Neurons;Artificial neural networks;Particle swarm optimization","","3251","1","39","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and random forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.","2374-8486","978-0-7695-3502-9","10.1109/ICDM.2008.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781136","anomaly detection;outlier detection;novelty detection;isolation forest;binary trees;model based","Application software;Credit cards;Detectors;Constraint optimization;Data mining;Information technology;Laboratories;Isolation technology;Performance evaluation;Astronomy","","3080","15","14","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It uses a pixelwise, mutual information (Ml)-based matching cost for compensating radiometric differences of input images. Pixelwise matching is supported by a smoothness constraint that is usually expressed as a global cost function. SGM performs a fast approximation by pathwise optimizations from all directions. The discussion also addresses occlusion detection, subpixel refinement, and multibaseline matching. Additionally, postprocessing steps for removing outliers, recovering from specific problems of structured environments, and the interpolation of gaps are presented. Finally, strategies for processing almost arbitrarily large images and fusion of disparity images using orthographic projection are proposed. A comparison on standard stereo images shows that SGM is among the currently top-ranked algorithms and is best, if subpixel accuracy is considered. The complexity is linear to the number of pixels and disparity range, which results in a runtime of just 1-2 seconds on typical test images. An in depth evaluation of the Ml-based matching cost demonstrates a tolerance against a wide range of radiometric transformations. Finally, examples of reconstructions from huge aerial frame and pushbroom images demonstrate that the presented ideas are working well on practical problems.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359315","stereo;mutual information;global optimization;multi-baseline;stereo;mutual information;global optimization;multi-baseline","Mutual information;Stereo vision;Radiometry;Cost function;Computational efficiency;Pixel;Interpolation;Image reconstruction;Image segmentation;Runtime","","2907","47","27","IEEE","18 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set.

To support this spectrum reuse functionality, the secondary users are required to sense the radio frequency environment, and once the primary users are found to be active, the secondary users are required to vacate the channel within a certain amount of time. Therefore, spectrum sensing is of significant importance in cognitive radio networks. There are two parameters associated with spectrum sensing: probability of detection and probability of false alarm. The higher the probability of detection, the better the primary users are protected. However, from the secondary users' perspective, the lower the probability of false alarm, the more chances the channel can be reused when it is available, thus the higher the achievable throughput for the secondary network. In this paper, we study the problem of designing the sensing duration to maximize the achievable throughput for the secondary network under the constraint that the primary users are sufficiently protected. We formulate the sensing-throughput tradeoff problem mathematically, and use energy detection sensing scheme to prove that the formulated problem indeed has one optimal sensing time which yields the highest throughput for the secondary network. Cooperative sensing using multiple mini-slots or multiple secondary users are also studied using the methodology proposed in this paper. Computer simulations have shown that for a 6 MHz channel, when the frame duration is 100 ms, and the signal-to-noise ratio of primary user at the secondary receiver is -20 dB, the optimal sensing time achieving the highest throughput while maintaining 90% detection probability is 14.2 ms. This optimal sensing time decreases when distributed spectrum sensing is applied.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2008.060869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489760","","Cognitive radio;Throughput;FCC;Protection;Wireless sensor networks;TV;Radio frequency;Computer simulation;Receivers","","2365","13","20","IEEE","15 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general- purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.","2375-5261","978-0-7695-3132-8","10.1109/ISORC.2008.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4519604","Cyber-physical systems;real time;embedded systems","Physics computing;Computer networks;Embedded computing;Computerized monitoring;Process control;Feedback loop;Investments;Safety;Software quality;Yarn","","2241","1","34","IEEE","14 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The basic idea is to map a block of information bits to two information carrying units: 1) a symbol that was chosen from a constellation diagram and 2) a unique transmit antenna number that was chosen from a set of transmit antennas. The use of the transmit antenna number as an information-bearing unit increases the overall spectral efficiency by the base-two logarithm of the number of transmit antennas. At the receiver, a maximum receive ratio combining algorithm is used to retrieve the transmitted block of information bits. Here, we apply SM to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. We develop an analytical approach for symbol error ratio (SER) analysis of the SM algorithm in independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh channels. The analytical and simulation results closely match. The performance and the receiver complexity of the SM–OFDM technique are compared to those of the vertical Bell Labs layered space–time (V-BLAST–OFDM) and Alamouti–OFDM algorithms. V-BLAST uses minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection with ordered successive interference cancellation. The combined effect of spatial correlation, mutual antenna coupling, and Rician fading on both coded and uncoded systems are presented. It is shown that, for the same spectral efficiency, SM results in a reduction of around 90% in receiver complexity as compared to V-BLAST and nearly the same receiver complexity as Alamouti. In addition, we show that SM achieves better performance in all studied channel conditions, as compared with other techniques. It is also shown to efficiently work for any configuration of transmit and receive antennas, even for the case of fewer receive antennas than transmit antennas.

Compressive sensing is a framework whereby one does not measure one of the aforementioned N-dimensional signals directly, but rather a set of related measurements, with the new measurements a linear combination of the original underlying N-dimensional signal. The number of required compressive-sensing measurements is typically much smaller than N, offering the potential to simplify the sensing system. Let f denote the unknown underlying N-dimensional signal, and g a vector of compressive-sensing measurements, then one may approximate f accurately by utilizing knowledge of the (under-determined) linear relationship between f and g, in addition to knowledge of the fact that f is compressible in B. In this paper we employ a Bayesian formalism for estimating the underlying signal f based on compressive-sensing measurements g. The proposed framework has the following properties: i) in addition to estimating the underlying signal f, ""error bars"" are also estimated, these giving a measure of confidence in the inverted signal; ii) using knowledge of the error bars, a principled means is provided for determining when a sufficient number of compressive-sensing measurements have been performed; iii) this setting lends itself naturally to a framework whereby the compressive sensing measurements are optimized adaptively and hence not determined randomly; and iv) the framework accounts for additive noise in the compressive-sensing measurements and provides an estimate of the noise variance.

This article reviews some recent work on MIMO radar with widely separated antennas. Widely separated transmit/receive antennas capture the spatial diversity of the target's radar cross section (RCS). Unique features of MIMO radar are explained and illustrated by examples. It is shown that with noncoherent processing, a target's RCS spatial variations can be exploited to obtain a diversity gain for target detection and for estimation of various parameters, such as angle of arrival and Doppler. For target location, it is shown that coherent processing can provide a resolution far exceeding that supported by the radar's waveform.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2008.4408448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408448","","Radar antennas;MIMO;Radar cross section;Doppler radar;Transmitters;Receiving antennas;Diversity methods;Object detection;Parameter estimation;Spatial resolution","","1794","2","36","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

These include electric ship propulsion, locomotive traction, electric and hybrid electric vehicles, ldquomore-electricrdquo aircraft, and high-power industrial applications. As a consequence, there has been a substantial increase in the interest for such drive systems worldwide, resulting in a huge volume of work published during the last ten years. An attempt is made in this paper to provide a brief review of the current state of the art in the area. After addressing the reasons for potential use of multiphase rather than three-phase drives and the available approaches to multiphase machine designs, various control schemes are surveyed. This is followed by a discussion of the multiphase voltage source inverter control. Various possibilities for the use of additional degrees of freedom that exist in multiphase machines are further elaborated. Finally, multiphase machine applications in electric energy generation are addressed.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.918488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454446","Multiphase electric machines;multiphase variable-speed drives;multiphase voltage-source inverters (VSIs);multiphase electric machines;multiphase voltage source inverters;multiphase variable speed drives","Electric machines;Pulse width modulation inverters;Frequency;Marine vehicles;Aircraft propulsion;Electric variables control;Voltage control;Variable speed drives;Torque;Switches","","1777","","229","IEEE","30 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each pixel independently and in continuous time quantizes local relative intensity changes to generate spike events. These events appear at the output of the sensor as an asynchronous stream of digital pixel addresses. These address-events signify scene reflectance change and have sub-millisecond timing precision. The output data rate depends on the dynamic content of the scene and is typically orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional frame-based imagers. By combining an active continuous-time front-end logarithmic photoreceptor with a self-timed switched-capacitor differencing circuit, the sensor achieves an array mismatch of 2.1% in relative intensity event threshold and a pixel bandwidth of 3 kHz under 1 klux scene illumination. Dynamic range is > 120 dB and chip power consumption is 23 mW. Event latency shows weak light dependency with a minimum of 15 mus at > 1 klux pixel illumination. The sensor is built in a 0.35 mum 4M2P process. It has 40times40 mum2 pixels with 9.4% fill factor.

Optically, this is due to the substantial presence of particles in the atmosphere that absorb and scatter light. In computer vision, the absorption and scattering processes are commonly modeled by a linear combination of the direct attenuation and the airlight. Based on this model, a few methods have been proposed, and most of them require multiple input images of a scene, which have either different degrees of polarization or different atmospheric conditions. This requirement is the main drawback of these methods, since in many situations, it is difficult to be fulfilled. To resolve the problem, we introduce an automated method that only requires a single input image. This method is based on two basic observations: first, images with enhanced visibility (or clear-day images) have more contrast than images plagued by bad weather; second, airlight whose variation mainly depends on the distance of objects to the viewer, tends to be smooth. Relying on these two observations, we develop a cost function in the framework of Markov random fields, which can be efficiently optimized by various techniques, such as graph-cuts or belief propagation. The method does not require the geometrical information of the input image, and is applicable for both color and gray images.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587643","","Optical scattering;Layout;Optical attenuators;Light scattering;Particle scattering;Atmospheric modeling;Degradation;Atmosphere;Computer vision;Absorption","","1619","14","12","IEEE","5 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper considers the problem of secret communication between two nodes, over a fading wireless medium, in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. The assumption used is that the transmitter and its helpers (amplifying relays) have more antennas than the eavesdropper. The transmitter ensures secrecy of communication by utilizing some of the available power to produce 'artificial noise', such that only the eavesdropper's channel is degraded. Two scenarios are considered, one where the transmitter has multiple transmit antennas, and the other where amplifying relays simulate the effect of multiple antennas. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be publicly known, and hence, the secrecy of communication is independent of the secrecy of CSI.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2008.060848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4543070","","Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Degradation;Noise generators;Broadcasting;Relays;Decoding;Fading;Channel state information;Privacy","","1613","13","21","IEEE","17 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the insights from this analysis, a practical secure communication protocol is developed, which uses a four-step procedure to ensure wireless information-theoretic security: (i) common randomness via opportunistic transmission, (ii) message reconciliation, (iii) common key generation via privacy amplification, and (iv) message protection with a secret key. A reconciliation procedure based on multilevel coding and optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is introduced, which allows to achieve communication rates close to the fundamental security limits in several relevant instances. Finally, a set of metrics for assessing average secure key generation rates is established, and it is shown that the protocol is effective in secure key renewal—even in the presence of imperfect channel state information.

The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2008.923738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4608934","Attitude estimates;complementary filter;nonlinear observer;special orthogonal group","Passive filters;Costs;Measurement units;Noise level;Time varying systems;Additive noise;Filtering;Kinematics;Position measurement;Angular velocity","","1353","35","43","IEEE","26 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, the ADASYN approach improves learning with respect to the data distributions in two ways: (1) reducing the bias introduced by the class imbalance, and (2) adaptively shifting the classification decision boundary toward the difficult examples.

This effort in general-purpose computing on the GPU, also known as GPU computing, has positioned the GPU as a compelling alternative to traditional microprocessors in high-performance computer systems of the future. We describe the background, hardware, and programming model for GPU computing, summarize the state of the art in tools and techniques, and present four GPU computing successes in game physics and computational biophysics that deliver order-of-magnitude performance gains over optimized CPU applications.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2008.917757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4490127","General-purpose computing on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU);GPU computing;parallel computing","Graphics;Central Processing Unit;Physics computing;Engines;Arithmetic;Bandwidth;Microprocessors;Hardware;Computational biophysics;Performance gain","","1314","31","32","IEEE","15 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to overcome the difficulties caused by intensity inhomogeneities, we propose a region-based active contour model that draws upon intensity information in local regions at a controllable scale. A data fitting energy is defined in terms of a contour and two fitting functions that locally approximate the image intensities on the two sides of the contour. This energy is then incorporated into a variational level set formulation with a level set regularization term, from which a curve evolution equation is derived for energy minimization. Due to a kernel function in the data fitting term, intensity information in local regions is extracted to guide the motion of the contour, which thereby enables our model to cope with intensity inhomogeneity. In addition, the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically preserved by the level set regularization term to ensure accurate computation and avoids expensive reinitialization of the evolving level set function. Experimental results for synthetic and real images show desirable performances of our method.

The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.

From a computer vision perspective, this task is extremely challenging because it is massively ill-posed - at each pixel we must estimate the foreground and the background colors, as well as the foreground opacity (""alpha matte"") from a single color measurement. Current approaches either restrict the estimation to a small part of the image, estimating foreground and background colors based on nearby pixels where they are known, or perform iterative nonlinear estimation by alternating foreground and background color estimation with alpha estimation. In this paper, we present a closed-form solution to natural image matting. We derive a cost function from local smoothness assumptions on foreground and background colors and show that in the resulting expression, it is possible to analytically eliminate the foreground and background colors to obtain a quadratic cost function in alpha. This allows us to find the globally optimal alpha matte by solving a sparse linear system of equations. Furthermore, the closed-form formula allows us to predict the properties of the solution by analyzing the eigenvectors of a sparse matrix, closely related to matrices used in spectral image segmentation algorithms. We show that high-quality mattes for natural images may be obtained from a small amount of user input.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359322","Matting;Interactive Image Editing;Spectral Segmentation;Matting;Interactive Image Editing;Spectral Segmentation","Closed-form solution;Cost function;Image color analysis;Sparse matrices;Computer vision;Pixel;Iterative methods;Linear systems;Equations;Image analysis","","1238","64","20","IEEE","18 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Small modeling uncertainties are unavoidable in any practical system and so robustness to them is a fundamental performance metric. The impact of these modeling uncertainties can be quantified by the position of the ""SNR wall"" below which a detector will fail to be robust, no matter how long it can observe the channel. We propose simple mathematical models for the uncertainty in the noise and fading processes. These are used to show what aspects of the model lead to SNR walls for differing levels of knowledge of the signal to be detected. These results have implications for wireless spectrum regulators. The context is opportunistically sharing spectrum with primary users that must be detected in order to avoid causing harmful interference on a channel. Ideally, a secondary system would be able to detect primaries robustly without having to know much about their signaling strategies. We argue that the tension between primary and secondary users is captured by the technical question of computing the optimal tradeoff between the primary user's capacity and the secondary user's sensing robustness as quantified by the SNR wall. This is an open problem, but we compute this tradeoff for some simple detectors.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2007.914879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4453895","Capacity robustness tradeoff;cognitive radio;coherent detection;noise calibration;noise uncertainty;radiometer;robust sensing;SNR wall","Signal detection;Uncertainty;Signal to noise ratio;Measurement;Detectors;Noise robustness;Mathematical model;Fading;Regulators;Interference","","1181","16","32","IEEE","15 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, many kinds of channel adaptive techniques have been deemed impractical in the past because of the problem of obtaining channel knowledge at the transmitter. The transmitter in many systems (such as those using frequency division duplexing) can not leverage techniques such as training to obtain channel state information. Over the last few years, research has repeatedly shown that allowing the receiver to send a small number of information bits about the channel conditions to the transmitter can allow near optimal channel adaptation. These practical systems, which are commonly referred to as limited or finite-rate feedback systems, supply benefits nearly identical to unrealizable perfect transmitter channel knowledge systems when they are judiciously designed.

These structures can be of two types: ldquostep-downrdquo and ldquostep-up.rdquo These blocks are inserted in classical converters: buck, boost, buck-boost, Cuk, Zeta, Sepic. The ldquostep-downrdquo C- or L-switching structures can be combined with the buck, buck-boost, Cuk, Zeta, Sepic converters in order to get a step-down function. When the active switch of the converter is on, the inductors in the L-switching blocks are charged in series or the capacitors in the C-switching blocks are discharged in parallel. When the active switch is off, the inductors in the L-switching blocks are discharged in parallel or the capacitors in the C-switching blocks are charged in series. The ldquostep-uprdquo C- or L-switching structures are combined with the boost, buck-boost, Cuk, Zeta, Sepic converters, to get a step-up function. The steady-state analysis of the new hybrid converters allows for determing their DC line-to-output voltage ratio. The gain formula shows that the hybrid converters are able to reduce/increase the line voltage more times than the original, classical converters. The proposed hybrid converters contain the same number of elements as the quadratic converters. Their performances (DC gain, voltage and current stresses on the active switch and diodes, currents through the inductors) are compared to those of the available quadratic converters. The superiority of the new, hybrid converters is mainly based on less energy in the magnetic field, leading to saving in the size and cost of the inductors, and less current stresses in the switching elements, leading to smaller conduction losses.

The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space.

"Adaptive Decentralized Droop Controller to Preserve Power Sharing Stability of Paralleled Inverters in Distributed Generation Microgrids","Y. A. -R. I. Mohamed; E. F.

In the sense of the small-signal dynamics of a microgrid, it can be shown that as the demanded power of each inverter changes, the low-frequency modes of the power sharing dynamics drift to new locations and the relative stability is remarkably affected, and eventually, instability can be yielded. To preserve the power sharing stability, an adaptive decentralized droop controller of paralleled inverter-based DG units is presented in this paper. The proposed power sharing strategy is based on the static droop characteristics combined with an adaptive transient droop function. Unlike conventional droop controllers, which yield 1-DOF tunable controller, the proposed droop controller yields 2-DOF tunable controller. Subsequently, the dynamic performance of the power sharing mechanism can be adjusted, without affecting the static droop gain, to damp the oscillatory modes of the power sharing controller. To account for the power modes immigration at different loading conditions, the transient droop gains are adaptively scheduled via small-signal analysis of the power sharing mechanism along the loading trajectory of each DG unit to yield the desired transient and steady-state response. The gain adaptation scheme utilizes the filtered active and reactive powers as indices; therefore, a stable and smooth power injection performance can be obtained at different loading conditions. The adaptive nature of the proposed controller ensures active damping of power oscillations at different operating conditions, and yields a stable and robust performance of the paralleled inverter system.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696040","Adaptive control;decentralized control;distributed generation (DG);microgrid;parallel operation;power sharing stability;Adaptive control;decentralized control;distributed generation (DG);microgrid;parallel operation;power sharing stability","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Stability;Inverters;Distributed control;Performance gain;Transient analysis;Steady-state;Active filters;Reactive power","","1002","2","20","IEEE","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our eavesdropper can be viewed as the wireless counterpart of Wyner's wiretapper. The secrecy capacity of such a system is characterized under the assumption of asymptotically long coherence intervals. We first consider the full channel state information (CSI) case, where the transmitter has access to the channel gains of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. The secrecy capacity under this full CSI assumption serves as an upper bound for the secrecy capacity when only the CSI of the legitimate receiver is known at the transmitter, which is characterized next. In each scenario, the perfect secrecy capacity is obtained along with the optimal power and rate allocation strategies. We then propose a low-complexity on/off power allocation strategy that achieves near-optimal performance with only the main channel CSI. More specifically, this scheme is shown to be asymptotically optimal as the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to infinity, and interestingly, is shown to attain the secrecy capacity under the full CSI assumption. Overall, channel fading has a positive impact on the secrecy capacity and rate adaptation, based on the main channel CSI, is critical in facilitating secure communications over slow fading channels.

Often, the PV arrays get shadowed, completely or partially, by the passing clouds, neighboring buildings and towers, trees, and utility and telephone poles. The situation is of particular interest in case of large PV installations such as those used in distributed power generation schemes. Under partially shaded conditions, the PV characteristics get more complex with multiple peaks. Yet, it is very important to understand and predict them in order to extract the maximum possible power. This paper presents a MATLAB-based modeling and simulation scheme suitable for studying the I-V and P-V characteristics of a PV array under a nonuniform insolation due to partial shading. It can also be used for developing and evaluating new maximum power point tracking techniques, especially for partially shaded conditions. The proposed models conveniently interface with the models of power electronic converters, which is a very useful feature. It can also be used as a tool to study the effects of shading patterns on PV panels having different configurations. It is observed that, for a given number of PV modules, the array configuration (how many modules in series and how many in parallel) significantly affects the maximum available power under partially shaded conditions. This is another aspect to which the developed tool can be applied. The model has been experimentally validated and the usefulness of this research is highlighted with the help of several illustrations. The MATLAB code of the developed model is freely available for download.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2007.914308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4453994","Array configuration;maximum power point tracking (MPPT);partial shading;photovoltaic (PV) characteristics","Computer languages;Mathematical model;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Temperature;Clouds;Poles and towers;Telephone poles;Distributed power generation;Power electronics","","963","3","16","IEEE","15 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several applications such as content-based video annotation and retrieval, highlight extraction and video summarization require recognition of the activities occurring in the video. The analysis of human activities in videos is an area with increasingly important consequences from security and surveillance to entertainment and personal archiving. Several challenges at various levels of processing-robustness against errors in low-level processing, view and rate-invariant representations at midlevel processing and semantic representation of human activities at higher level processing-make this problem hard to solve. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of efforts in the past couple of decades to address the problems of representation, recognition, and learning of human activities from video and related applications. We discuss the problem at two major levels of complexity: 1) ""actions"" and 2) ""activities."" ""Actions"" are characterized by simple motion patterns typically executed by a single human. ""Activities"" are more complex and involve coordinated actions among a small number of humans. We will discuss several approaches and classify them according to their ability to handle varying degrees of complexity as interpreted above. We begin with a discussion of approaches to model the simplest of action classes known as atomic or primitive actions that do not require sophisticated dynamical modeling. Then, methods to model actions with more complex dynamics are discussed. The discussion then leads naturally to methods for higher level representation of complex activities.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2005594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4633644","Human activity analysis;image sequence analysis;machine vision;surveillance","Humans;Image recognition;Surveillance;Image sequence analysis;Computer vision;Pattern recognition;Biological system modeling;Cameras;Explosions;Content based retrieval","","957","26","144","IEEE","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Denoising is a crucial step to increase image quality and to improve the performance of all the tasks needed for quantitative imaging analysis. The method proposed in this paper is based on a 3-D optimized blockwise version of the nonlocal (NL)-means filter (Buades, , 2005). The NL-means filter uses the redundancy of information in the image under study to remove the noise. The performance of the NL-means filter has been already demonstrated for 2-D images, but reducing the computational burden is a critical aspect to extend the method to 3-D images. To overcome this problem, we propose improvements to reduce the computational complexity. These different improvements allow to drastically divide the computational time while preserving the performances of the NL-means filter. A fully automated and optimized version of the NL-means filter is then presented. Our contributions to the NL-means filter are: 1) an automatic tuning of the smoothing parameter; 2) a selection of the most relevant voxels; 3) a blockwise implementation; and 4) a parallelized computation. Quantitative validation was carried out on synthetic datasets generated with BrainWeb (Collins, , 1998). The results show that our optimized NL-means filter outperforms the classical implementation of the NL-means filter, as well as two other classical denoising methods [anisotropic diffusion (Perona and Malik, 1990)] and total variation minimization process (Rudin, , 1992) in terms of accuracy (measured by the peak signal-to-noise ratio) with low computation time. Finally, qualitative results on real data are presented.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2007.906087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359947","Image denoising;image enhancement;nonlocal means filter","Noise reduction;Magnetic separation;Filters;Magnetic resonance;Optimization methods;Image restoration;Magnetic noise;Image quality;Magnetic resonance imaging;Image analysis","Algorithms;Artifacts;Brain;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","935","14","58","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The presented technique is versatile enough to be used with any global region-based active contour energy and instill in it the benefits of localization. We describe this framework and demonstrate the localization of three well-known energies in order to illustrate how our framework can be applied to any energy. We then compare each localized energy to its global counterpart to show the improvements that can be achieved. Next, an in-depth study of the behaviors of these energies in response to the degree of localization is given.

The approach is an extension of previous approaches and uses both the spatial and spectral information for classification. One previous approach is based on using several principal components (PCs) from the hyperspectral data and building several morphological profiles (MPs). These profiles can be used all together in one extended MP. A shortcoming of that approach is that it was primarily designed for classification of urban structures and it does not fully utilize the spectral information in the data. Similarly, the commonly used pixelwise classification of hyperspectral data is solely based on the spectral content and lacks information on the structure of the features in the image. The proposed method overcomes these problems and is based on the fusion of the morphological information and the original hyperspectral data, i.e., the two vectors of attributes are concatenated into one feature vector. After a reduction of the dimensionality, the final classification is achieved by using a support vector machine classifier. The proposed approach is tested in experiments on ROSIS data from urban areas. Significant improvements are achieved in terms of accuracies when compared to results obtained for approaches based on the use of MPs based on PCs only and conventional spectral classification. For instance, with one data set, the overall accuracy is increased from 79% to 83% without any feature reduction and to 87% with feature reduction. The proposed approach also shows excellent results with a limited training set.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.922034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4686022","Data fusion;extended morphological profile (EMP);feature extraction (FE);high spatial resolution;hyperspectral data;support vector machines (SVMs)","Hyperspectral imaging;Personal communication networks;Spatial resolution;Buildings;Pixel;Concatenated codes;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Testing;Urban areas","","910","","41","IEEE","21 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rate of change of the flow and efficiency denotes an otherwise unspecified fault with increasingly worsening effect. The rates of change of the faults were constrained to an upper threshold but were otherwise chosen randomly. Damage propagation was allowed to continue until a failure criterion was reached. A health index was defined as the minimum of several superimposed operational margins at any given time instant and the failure criterion is reached when health index reaches zero.

It is assumed that, at each iteration, the value and action update equations can be exactly solved. The following two standard neural networks (NN) are used: a critic NN is used to approximate the value function, whereas an action network is used to approximate the optimal control policy. It is stressed that this approach allows the implementation of HDP without knowing the internal dynamics of the system. The exact solution assumption holds for some classes of nonlinear systems and, specifically, in the specific case of the DT linear quadratic regulator (LQR), where the action is linear and the value quadratic in the states and NNs have zero approximation error. It is stressed that, for the LQR, HDP may be implemented without knowing the system A matrix by using two NNs.

The proposed DPS control consists of a phase shift between the primary and secondary voltages of the isolation transformer, and a phase shift between the gate signals of the diagonal switches of each H-bridge. Simulation on a 600-V/5-kW prototype shows that the DPS control has excellent dynamic and static performance compared to the traditional phase-shift control (single phase shift). In this paper, the concept of ldquoreactive powerrdquo is defined, and the corresponding equations are derived for isolated bidirectional DC-DC converters. It is shown that the reactive power in traditional phase-shift control is inherent, and is the main factor contributing to large peak current and large system loss. The DPS control can eliminate reactive power in isolated bidirectional DC-DC converters. In addition, the DPS control can decrease the peak inrush current and steady-state current, improve system efficiency, increase system power capability (by 33%), and minimize the output capacitance as compared to the traditional phase-shift control. The soft-switching range and the influence of short-time-scale factors, such as deadband and system-level safe operation area, are also discussed in detail. Under certain operation conditions, deadband compensation can be implemented easily in the DPS control without a current sensor.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4700286","DC–DC converter;deadband;dual active bridge (DAB);phase-shift control;reactive power;safe operational area (SOA);DC-DC converter;deadband;dual active bridge (DAB);phase-shift control;reactive power;safe operational area (SOA)","Reactive power control;Control systems;DC-DC power converters;Voltage control;Switches;Virtual prototyping;Equations;Surges;Steady-state;Capacitance","","868","9","18","IEEE","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper develops a model to include the WECS in the ED problem, and in addition to the classic economic dispatch factors, factors to account for both overestimation and underestimation of available wind power are included. With the stochastic wind speed characterization based on the Weibull probability density function, the optimization problem is numerically solved for a scenario involving two conventional and two wind-powered generators.

We consider three potential sources for bias: comparing classifiers over one or a small number of proprietary data sets, relying on accuracy indicators that are conceptually inappropriate for software defect prediction and cross-study comparisons, and, finally, limited use of statistical testing procedures to secure empirical findings. To remedy these problems, a framework for comparative software defect prediction experiments is proposed and applied in a large-scale empirical comparison of 22 classifiers over 10 public domain data sets from the NASA Metrics Data repository. Overall, an appealing degree of predictive accuracy is observed, which supports the view that metric-based classification is useful.

Spectrum sensing, as a key enabling functionality in cognitive radio networks, needs to reliably detect signals from licensed primary radios to avoid harmful interference. However, due to the effects of channel fading/shadowing, individual cognitive radios may not be able to reliably detect the existence of a primary radio. In this paper, we propose an optimal linear cooperation framework for spectrum sensing in order to accurately detect the weak primary signal. Within this framework, spectrum sensing is based on the linear combination of local statistics from individual cognitive radios. Our objective is to minimize the interference to the primary radio while meeting the requirement of opportunistic spectrum utilization. We formulate the sensing problem as a nonlinear optimization problem. By exploiting the inherent structures in the problem formulation, we develop efficient algorithms to solve for the optimal solutions. To further reduce the computational complexity and obtain solutions for more general cases, we finally propose a heuristic approach, where we instead optimize a modified deflection coefficient that characterizes the probability distribution function of the global test statistics at the fusion center. Simulation results illustrate significant cooperative gain achieved by the proposed strategies. The insights obtained in this paper are useful for the design of optimal spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks.

In addition, most of the existing schemes are unable to extract maximum power from the PV array under these conditions. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to track the global power peak under partially shaded conditions. The formulation of the algorithm is based on several critical observations made out of an extensive study of the PV characteristics and the behavior of the global and local peaks under partially shaded conditions. The proposed algorithm works in conjunction with a DC-DC converter to track the GP. In order to accelerate the tracking speed, a feedforward control scheme for operating the DC-DC converter is also proposed, which uses the reference voltage information from the tracking algorithm to shift the operation toward the MPP. The tracking time with this controller is about one-tenth as compared to a conventional controller.

We first discuss the critical aspects that may affect the scaling of PCRAM, including materials properties, power consumption during programming and read operations, thermal cross-talk between memory cells, and failure mechanisms. We then discuss experiments that directly address the scaling properties of the phase-change materials themselves, including studies of phase transitions in both nanoparticles and ultrathin films as a function of particle size and film thickness. This work in materials directly motivated the successful creation of a series of prototype PCRAM devices, which have been fabricated and tested at phase-change material cross-sections with extremely small dimensions as low as 3 nm × 20 nm. These device measurements provide a clear demonstration of the excellent scaling potential offered by this technology, and they are also consistent with the scaling behavior predicted by extensive device simulations.

MACH is capable of capturing intra-class variability by synthesizing a single Action MACH filter for a given action class. We generalize the traditional MACH filter to video (3D spatiotemporal volume), and vector valued data. By analyzing the response of the filter in the frequency domain, we avoid the high computational cost commonly incurred in template-based approaches. Vector valued data is analyzed using the Clifford Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform intended for both scalar and vector-valued data. Finally, we perform an extensive set of experiments and compare our method with some of the most recent approaches in the field by using publicly available datasets, and two new annotated human action datasets which include actions performed in classic feature films and sports broadcast television.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587727","","Humans;Image motion analysis;Data analysis;Fourier transforms;Optical films;Optical filters;Computer vision;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Frequency domain analysis;Computational efficiency","","775","2","20","IEEE","5 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification methods, have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers: (i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to generate ""bags-of-words "", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'image-to-image' distance, instead of 'image-to-class' distance. We propose a trivial NN-based classifier - NBNN, (Naive-Bayes nearest-neighbor), which employs NN- distances in the space of the local image descriptors (and not in the space of images). NBNN computes direct 'image- to-class' distances without descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes assumption, the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately approximated by NBNN. Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based image classifiers. Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging databases (Caltech-101 ,Caltech-256 and Graz-01).","1063-6919","978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587598","","Image classification;Image databases;Quantization;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Boosting;Neural networks;Classification tree analysis;Degradation;Rendering (computer graphics)","","767","15","31","IEEE","5 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This system can be considered as a combination of two broadcast channels (from the transmitters' points of view) and two multiple-access channels (from the receivers' points of view). Taking advantage of both perspectives, two signaling schemes for such a scenario are developed. In these schemes, some linear filters are employed at the transmitters and at the receivers which decompose the system into either two noninterfering multiple-antenna broadcast subchannels or two noninterfering multiple-antenna multiple-access subchannels. The main objective in the design of the filters is to exploit the structure of the channel matrices to achieve the highest multiplexing gain (MG). It is shown that the proposed noncooperative signaling schemes outperform other known noncooperative schemes in terms of the achievable MG.

As an example, the propagation properties of surface waves along the high-impedance surfaces are studied.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2008.923327","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4538157","Analytical model;high impedance surface;oblique incidence excitation","Analytical models;Strips;Surface impedance;Surface waves;Microwave antennas;Reflector antennas;Antennas and propagation;Dielectrics;Reflection;Magnetic analysis","","742","20","35","IEEE","6 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A total of nine cameras are mounted horizontally on an arc arm to simultaneously capture images across different poses. Each subject is asked to look straight ahead, up, and down to obtain 27 images in three shots. Five facial expressions, six accessories, and 15 lighting changes are also included in the database. A selected subset of the database (CAS-PEAL-R1, containing 30 863 images of the 1040 subjects) is available to other researchers now. We discuss the evaluation protocol based on the CAS-PEAL-R1 database and present the performance of four algorithms as a baseline to do the following: 1) elementarily assess the difficulty of the database for face recognition algorithms; 2) preference evaluation results for researchers using the database; and 3) identify the strengths and weaknesses of the commonly used algorithms.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2007.909557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4404053","Accessory;evaluation protocol;expression;face databases;face recognition;lighting;pose","Large-scale systems;Face recognition;Image databases;Research and development;Computer science;Object recognition;Application software;Computer security;Cameras;Access protocols","","741","","50","IEEE","17 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper investigates the potential of physiological signals as reliable channels for emotion recognition. All essential stages of an automatic recognition system are discussed, from the recording of a physiological data set to a feature-based multiclass classification. In order to collect a physiological data set from multiple subjects over many weeks, we used a musical induction method that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states, without any deliberate laboratory setting. Four-channel biosensors were used to measure electromyogram, electrocardiogram, skin conductivity, and respiration changes. A wide range of physiological features from various analysis domains, including time/frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc., is proposed in order to find the best emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. The best features extracted are specified in detail and their effectiveness is proven by classification results. Classification of four musical emotions (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, and positive/low arousal) is performed by using an extended linear discriminant analysis (pLDA). Furthermore, by exploiting a dichotomic property of the 2D emotion model, we develop a novel scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification (EMDC) and compare its performance with direct multiclass classification using the pLDA. An improved recognition accuracy of 95 percent and 70 percent for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification, respectively, is achieved by using the EMDC scheme.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4441720","Signal analysis;synthesis;and processing;Methodologies and techniques;User/Machine Systems;Theory and methods;Interaction styles;Human-centered computing;Classifier design and evaluation;Feature evaluation and selection;Pattern analysis;Signal processing;Robotics;Signal analysis;synthesis;and processing;Methodologies and techniques;User/Machine Systems;Theory and methods;Interaction styles;Human-centered computing;Classifier design and evaluation;Feature evaluation and selection;Pattern analysis;Signal processing;Robotics","Emotion recognition;Entropy;Speech;Disk recording;Audio recording;Laboratories;Biosensors;Conductivity measurement;Skin;Frequency","Adaptation, Physiological;Algorithms;Arousal;Artificial Intelligence;Auditory Perception;Emotions;Humans;Monitoring, Physiologic;Music;Pattern Recognition, Automated","733","3","47","IEEE","2 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Algorithms such as graph cuts and loopy belief propagation (LBP) have proven to be very powerful: For example, such methods form the basis for almost all the top-performing stereo methods. However, the trade-offs among different energy minimization algorithms are still not well understood. In this paper, we describe a set of energy minimization benchmarks and use them to compare the solution quality and runtime of several common energy minimization algorithms. We investigate three promising methods-graph cuts, LBP, and tree-reweighted message passing-in addition to the well-known older iterated conditional mode (ICM) algorithm.

Our algorithm satisfies a set of requirements that are critical for successful deployment of any large-scale surveillance system. In particular it requires a minimal setup (taking only a few minutes) and is fully automatic afterwards. Since it is not based on objects' tracks, it is robust and works well in crowded scenes where tracking-based algorithms are likely to fail. The algorithm is effective as soon as sufficeint low-level observations representing the routine activity have been collected, which usually happens after a few minutes. Our algorithm runs in realtime. It was tested on a variety of real-life crowded scenes. A ground-truth was extracted for these scenes, with respect to which detection and false-alarm rates are reported.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407716","Video analysis;Computer vision;Video analysis;Computer vision","Robustness;Event detection;Cameras;Layout;Surveillance;Large-scale systems;Humans;Streaming media;Statistics;Current measurement","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Systems;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Security Measures;Sensitivity and Specificity;Video Recording;Video Recording","719","3","35","IEEE","21 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The confidential information needs to be kept as secret as possible from receiver 2. The broadcast channel from the source node to receivers 1 and 2 is corrupted by multiplicative fading gain coefficients in addition to additive Gaussian noise terms. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and the receivers. The parallel BCC with independent subchannels is first studied, which serves as an information-theoretic model for the fading BCC. The secrecy capacity region of the parallel BCC is established, which gives the secrecy capacity region of the parallel BCC with degraded subchannels. The secrecy capacity region is then established for the parallel Gaussian BCC, and the optimal source power allocations that achieve the boundary of the secrecy capacity region are derived. In particular, the secrecy capacity region is established for the basic Gaussian BCC. The secrecy capacity results are then applied to study the fading BCC. The ergodic performance is first studied. The ergodic secrecy capacity region and the optimal power allocations that achieve the boundary of this region are derived. The outage performance is then studied, where a long-term power constraint is assumed. The power allocation is derived that minimizes the outage probability where either the target rate of the common message or the target rate of the confidential message is not achieved. The power allocation is also derived that minimizes the outage probability where the target rate of the confidential message is not achieved subject to the constraint that the target rate of the common message must be achieved for all channel states.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2008.921678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529282","Confidential message;ergodic capacity;fading broadcast channel;Gaussian broadcast channel;outage probability;parallel broadcast channel;power allocation;secrecy capacity","Fading;Broadcasting;Capacity planning;Information theory;Additive noise;Gaussian noise;Channel state information;Transmitters;Degradation;Channel capacity","","707","","61","IEEE","23 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These charges can cause large radiation-induced threshold voltage shifts and increases in leakage currents. Two alternate dielectrics that have been investigated for replacing silicon dioxide are hafnium oxides and reoxidized nitrided oxides (RNO). For advanced technologies, which may employ alternate dielectrics, radiation-induced voltage shifts in these insulators may be negligible. Radiation-induced charge buildup in parasitic field oxides and in SOI buried oxides can also lead to device degradation and failure. Indeed, for advanced commercial technologies, the total-dose hardness of ICs is normally dominated by radiation-induced charge buildup in either parasitic field oxides and/or SOI buried oxides.

Vehicular safety communications applications cannot tolerate long connection establishment delays before being enabled to communicate with other vehicles encountered on the road. Similarly, non-safety applications also demand efficient connection setup with roadside stations providing services (e.g. digital map update) because of the limited time it takes for a car to drive through the coverage area. Additionally, the rapidly moving vehicles and complex roadway environment present challenges at the PHY level. The IEEE 802.11 standard body is currently working on a new amendment, IEEE 802.1 lp, to address these concerns. This document is named wireless access in vehicular environment, also known as WAVE. As of writing, the draft document for IEEE 802.11p is making progress and moving closer towards acceptance by the general IEEE 802.11 working group. It is projected to pass letter ballot in the first half of 2008. This paper provides an overview of the latest draft proposed for IEEE 802.11p. It is intended to provide an insight into the reasoning and approaches behind the document.","1550-2252","978-1-4244-1644-8","10.1109/VETECS.2008.458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4526014","","Vehicle safety;Vehicle driving;FCC;Road safety;Road vehicles;Broadcasting;Standardization;Communication standards;Standards development;North America","","675","10","9","IEEE","20 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Coding for Errors and Erasures in Random Network Coding","R. Koetter; F. R.

A “noncoherent” or “channel oblivious” model is assumed where neither transmitter nor receiver is assumed to have knowledge of the channel transfer characteristic. Motivated by the property that linear network coding is vector-space preserving, information transmission is modeled as the injection into the network of a basis for a vector space $V$ and the collection by the receiver of a basis for a vector space  $U$. A metric on the projective geometry associated with the packet space is introduced, and it is shown that a minimum-distance decoder for this metric achieves correct decoding if the dimension of the space $V \cap U$ is sufficiently large. If the dimension of each codeword is restricted to a fixed integer, the code forms a subset of a finite-field Grassmannian, or, equivalently, a subset of the vertices of the corresponding Grassmann graph. Sphere-packing and sphere-covering bounds as well as a generalization of the Singleton bound are provided for such codes. Finally, a Reed–Solomon-like code construction, related to Gabidulin's construction of maximum rank-distance codes, is described and a Sudan-style “list-1” minimum-distance decoding algorithm is provided.

"Exploiting Multi-Antennas for Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","R. Zhang; Y. -C. Liang","Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore; Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore",IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing,"15 Feb 2008","2008","2","1","88","102","In cognitive radio (CR) networks, there are scenarios where the secondary (lower priority) users intend to communicate with each other by opportunistically utilizing the transmit spectrum originally allocated to the existing primary (higher priority) users. For such a scenario, a secondary user usually has to tradeoff between two conflicting goals at the same time: one is to maximize its own transmit throughput; and the other is to minimize the amount of interference it produces at each primary receiver. In this paper, we study this fundamental tradeoff from an information-theoretic perspective by characterizing the secondary user's channel capacity under both its own transmit-power constraint as well as a set of interference-power constraints each imposed at one of the primary receivers. In particular, this paper exploits multi-antennas at the secondary transmitter to effectively balance between spatial multiplexing for the secondary transmission and interference avoidance at the primary receivers. Convex optimization techniques are used to design algorithms for the optimal secondary transmit spatial spectrum that achieves the capacity of the secondary transmission. Suboptimal solutions for ease of implementation are also presented and their performances are compared with the optimal solution. Furthermore, algorithms developed for the single-channel transmission are also extended to the case of multichannel transmission whereby the secondary user is able to achieve opportunistic spectrum sharing via transmit adaptations not only in space, but in time and frequency domains as well. Simulation results show that even under stringent interference-power constraints, substantial capacity gains are achievable for the secondary transmission by employing multi-antennas at the secondary transmitter. This is true even when the number of primary receivers exceeds that of secondary transmit antennas in a CR network, where an interesting ""interference diversity"" effect can be exploited.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2007.914894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4453898","Channel capacity;cognitive radio (CR);convex optimization;dynamic resource allocation;interference diversity;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);opportunistic spectrum sharing","Cognitive radio;Interference constraints;Chromium;Throughput;Channel capacity;Radio transmitters;Design optimization;Algorithm design and analysis;Frequency domain analysis;Receiving antennas","","668","1","40","IEEE","15 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both digital forensics tasks are then achieved by detecting the presence of sensor PRNU in specific regions of the image under investigation. The detection is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem. The statistical distribution of the optimal test statistics is obtained using a predictor of the test statistics on small image blocks. The predictor enables more accurate and meaningful estimation of probabilities of false rejection of a correct camera and missed detection of a tampered region.

In the GGMAC-WT, multiple users communicate with an intended receiver in the presence of an eavesdropper who receives their signals through another GMAC. In the GTW-WT, two users communicate with each other over a common Gaussian channel, with an eavesdropper listening through a GMAC. A secrecy measure that is suitable for this multiterminal environment is defined, and achievable secrecy rate regions are found for both channels. For both cases, the power allocations maximizing the achievable secrecy sum rate are determined. It is seen that the optimum policy may prevent some terminals from transmission in order to preserve the secrecy of the system. Inspired by this construct, a new scheme cooperative jamming is proposed, where users who are prevented from transmitting according to the secrecy sum rate maximizing power allocation policy ldquojamrdquo the eavesdropper, thereby helping the remaining users. This scheme is shown to increase the achievable secrecy sum rate. Overall, our results show that in multiple-access scenarios, users can help each other to collectively achieve positive secrecy rates. In other words, cooperation among users can be invaluable for achieving secrecy for the system.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2008.921680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529293","Confidential messages;Gaussian multiple-access channel (GMAC);Gaussian two-way channel;secrecy capacity;wiretap channel","Jamming;Wire;Channel capacity;Gaussian channels;Communication system security;Communication system control;Information theory;Information security;Information analysis;Cryptography","","662","","47","IEEE","23 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed consensus control strategy is implemented based on the state information of each agent's neighbors at some discrete times. The asynchrony means that each agent's update times, at which the agent adjusts its dynamics, are independent of others'. Furthermore, it is assumed that the communication topology among agents is time-dependent and the information transmission is with bounded time-varying delays. If the union of the communication topology across any time interval with some given length contains a spanning tree, the consensus problem is shown to be solvable. The analysis tool developed in this paper is based on nonnegative matrix theory and graph theory. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a valid distributed consensus algorithm that overcomes the difficulties caused by unreliable communication channels, such as intermittent information transmission, switching communication topology, and time-varying communication delays, and therefore has its obvious practical applications.

For a class of kernels we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements, independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification accuracy on various tasks. This approximation also applies to 1 - chi2 and other kernels of similar form. We also introduce novel features based on a multi-level histograms of oriented edge energy and present experiments on various detection datasets. On the INRIA pedestrian dataset an approximate IKSVM classifier based on these features has the current best performance, with a miss rate 13% lower at 10-6 False Positive Per Window than the linear SVM detector of Dalal & Triggs. On the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15times faster. In these experiments our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000times faster than a standard implementation and requires 200times less memory. Finally we show that a 50times speedup is possible using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset with negligible loss of accuracy.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587630","","Kernel;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Histograms;Runtime;Object detection;Testing;Face detection;Decision trees;Classification tree analysis","","656","5","16","IEEE","5 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present.

However, their accuracy rapidly degrades with time. The requirements for an accurate estimation of navigation information necessitate the modeling of the sensors' error components. Several variance techniques have been devised for stochastic modeling of the error of inertial sensors. They are basically very similar and primarily differ in that various signal processings, by way of weighting functions, window functions, etc., are incorporated into the analysis algorithms in order to achieve a particular desired result for improving the model characterizations. The simplest is the Allan variance. The Allan variance is a method of representing the root means square (RMS) random-drift error as a function of averaging time. It is simple to compute and relatively simple to interpret and understand. The Allan variance method can be used to determine the characteristics of the underlying random processes that give rise to the data noise. This technique can be used to characterize various types of error terms in the inertial-sensor data by performing certain operations on the entire length of data. In this paper, the Allan variance technique will be used in analyzing and modeling the error of the inertial sensors used in different grades of the inertial measurement units. By performing a simple operation on the entire length of data, a characteristic curve is obtained whose inspection provides a systematic characterization of various random errors contained in the inertial-sensor output data. Being a directly measurable quantity, the Allan variance can provide information on the types and magnitude of the various error terms. This paper covers both the theoretical basis for the Allan variance for modeling the inertial sensors' error terms and its implementation in modeling different grades of inertial sensors.

Based on this regularity property, we propose a regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) for continuous multiobjective optimization problems with variable linkages. At each generation, the proposed algorithm models a promising area in the decision space by a probability distribution whose centroid is a (m - 1)-D piecewise continuous manifold. The local principal component analysis algorithm is used for building such a model. New trial solutions are sampled from the model thus built. A nondominated sorting-based selection is used for choosing solutions for the next generation. Systematic experiments have shown that, overall, RM-MEDA outperforms three other state-of-the-art algorithms, namely, GDE3, PCX-NSGA-II, and MIDEA, on a set of test instances with variable linkages. We have demonstrated that, compared with GDE3, RM-MEDA is not sensitive to algorithmic parameters, and has good scalability to the number of decision variables in the case of nonlinear variable linkages. A few shortcomings of RM-MEDA have also been identified and discussed in this paper.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2007.894202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358761","Estimation of distribution algorithm;local principal component analysis;multiobjective optimization;regularity;scalability;sensitivity;the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition;variable linkages;Estimation of distribution algorithm;local principal component analysis;multiobjective optimization;regularity;scalability;sensitivity;the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition;variable linkages","Couplings;Pareto optimization;Principal component analysis;Scalability;Evolutionary computation;Probability distribution;System testing;Mathematical model;Computer science;Europe","","633","","50","IEEE","31 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these problems, the training data usually consist simply of binary data reflecting a user's action or inaction, such as page visitation in the case of news item recommendation or webpage bookmarking in the bookmarking scenario. Usually this kind of data are extremely sparse (a small fraction are positive examples), therefore ambiguity arises in the interpretation of the non-positive examples. Negative examples and unlabeled positive examples are mixed together and we are typically unable to distinguish them. For example, we cannot really attribute a user not bookmarking a page to a lack of interest or lack of awareness of the page. Previous research addressing this one-class problem only considered it as a classification task. In this paper, we consider the one-class problem under the CF setting.

In particular, the four-terminal relay–eavesdropper channel is introduced and an outer-bound on the optimal rate-equivocation region is derived. Several cooperation strategies are then devised and the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation region are characterized. Of particular interest is the novel noise-forwarding (NF) strategy, where the relay node sends codewords independent of the source message to confuse the eavesdropper. This strategy is used to illustrate the deaf helper phenomenon, where the relay is able to facilitate secure communications while being totally ignorant of the transmitted messages. Furthermore, NF is shown to increase the secrecy capacity in the reversely degraded scenario, where the relay node fails to offer performance gains in the classical setting. The gain offered by the proposed cooperation strategies is then proved theoretically and validated numerically in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.

In this paper, we treat the channel as having a common Doppler scaling factor on all propagation paths, and propose a two-step approach to mitigating the Doppler effect: 1) nonuniform Doppler compensation via resampling that converts a ""wideband"" problem into a ""narrowband"" problem and 2) high-resolution uniform compensation of the residual Doppler. We focus on zero-padded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to minimize the transmission power. Null subcarriers are used to facilitate Doppler compensation, and pilot subcarriers are used for channel estimation. The receiver is based on block-by-block processing, and does not rely on channel dependence across OFDM blocks; thus, it is suitable for fast-varying UWA channels. The data from two shallow-water experiments near Woods Hole, MA, are used to demonstrate the receiver performance. Excellent performance results are obtained even when the transmitter and the receiver are moving at a relative speed of up to 10 kn, at which the Doppler shifts are greater than the OFDM subcarrier spacing. These results suggest that OFDM is a viable option for high-rate communications over wideband UWA channels with nonuniform Doppler shifts.","1558-1691","","10.1109/JOE.2008.920471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4554200","Multicarrier modulation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM);underwater acoustic (UWA) communication;wideband channels","Underwater communication;Underwater acoustics;Doppler shift;OFDM;Wideband;Bandwidth;Acoustic propagation;Doppler effect;Narrowband;Frequency division multiplexing","","611","3","31","IEEE","27 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the MAC protocols enable the secondary users to identify and utilize the leftover frequency spectrum in a way that constrains the level of interference to the primary users. In our proposed protocols, each secondary user is equipped with two transceivers. One transceiver is tuned to the dedicated control channel, while the other is designed specifically as a cognitive radio that can periodically sense and dynamically use the identified un-used channels. To obtain the channel state accurately, we propose two collaborative channel spectrum-sensing policies, namely, the random sensing policy and the negotiation-based sensing policy, to help the MAC protocols detect the availability of leftover channels. Under the random sensing policy, each secondary user just randomly selects one of the channels for sensing. On the other hand, under the negotiation-based sensing policy, different secondary users attempt to select the distinct channels to sense by overhearing the control packets over the control channel. We develop the Markov chain model and the M/GY/1-based queueing model to characterize the performance of our proposed multi-channel MAC protocols under the two types of channel-sensing policies for the saturation network and the non-saturation network scenarios, respectively. In the non-saturation network case, we quantitatively identify the tradeoff between the aggregate traffic throughput and the packet transmission delay, which can provide the insightful guidelines to improve the delay-QoS provisionings over cognitive radio wireless networks.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413145","","Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Cognitive radio;Wireless networks;Access protocols;Transceivers;Physical layer;Scheduling algorithm;Mobile ad hoc networks;Radiofrequency identification","","610","3","21","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With a simple statistical analysis, it can be shown that this is not valid. To obtain a more appropriate probability density function (pdf) of the wind power forecast error, an indirect algorithm based on the Beta pdf is proposed. Measured one-year time series from two different wind farms are used to generate the forecast data. Three different forecast scenarios are simulated based on the persistence approach. This makes the results comparable to other forecast methods. It is found that the forecast error pdf has a variable kurtosis ranging from 3 (like the Gaussian) to over 10, and therefore it can be categorized as fat-tailed. A new approximation function for the parameters of the Beta pdf is proposed because results from former publications could not be confirmed. Besides, a linear approximation is developed to describe the relationship between the persistence forecast and the related mean measured power. An energy storage system (ESS), which reduces the forecast error and smooths the wind power output, is considered. Results for this case show the usefulness of the proposed forecast error pdf for finding the optimum rated ESS power.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2008.922526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530750","Error analysis;forecasting;wind;wind power generation","Statistical analysis;Wind energy;Wind forecasting;Electronic switching systems;Gaussian distribution;Probability density function;Time measurement;Wind farms;Wind energy generation;Predictive models","","605","2","19","IEEE","23 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Objects of interest in many computer vision and pattern recognition applications, such as 2D/3D images and video sequences are naturally described as tensors or multilinear arrays. The proposed framework performs feature extraction by determining a multilinear projection that captures most of the original tensorial input variation. The solution is iterative in nature and it proceeds by decomposing the original problem to a series of multiple projection subproblems. As part of this work, methods for subspace dimensionality determination are proposed and analyzed. It is shown that the MPCA framework discussed in this work supplants existing heterogeneous solutions such as the classical principal component analysis (PCA) and its 2D variant (2D PCA).

Shamai","Univ. of California, Irvine; NA",IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,"4 Jan 2008","2008","54","1","151","170"," We provide achievability as well as converse results for the degrees of freedom region of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) $X$ channel, i.e., a system with two transmitters, two receivers, each equipped with multiple antennas, where independent messages need to be conveyed over fixed channels from each transmitter to each receiver. The inner and outer bounds on the degrees of freedom region are tight whenever integer degrees of freedom are optimal for each message. With $M=1$  antennas at each node, we find that the total (sum rate) degrees of freedom are bounded above and below as  $1 \leq \eta _{X}^{\star} \leq {{ 4}\over { 3}}$. If $M>1$ and channel matrices are nondegenerate then the precise degrees of freedom $\eta _{X}^{\star} = {{ 4}\over { 3}}M$. Thus, the MIMO $X$ channel has noninteger degrees of freedom when  $M$ is not a multiple of  $3$. Simple zero forcing without dirty paper encoding or successive decoding, suffices to achieve the ${{ 4}\over { 3}}M$ degrees of freedom. If the channels vary with time/frequency then the $X$ channel with single antennas $(M=1)$ at all nodes has exactly ${4\over 3}$ degrees of freedom. The key idea for the achievability of the degrees of freedom is interference alignment—i.e., signal spaces are aligned at receivers where they constitute interference while they are separable at receivers where they are desired. We also explore the increase in degrees of freedom when some of the messages are made available to a transmitter or receiver in the manner of cognitive radio.

Examples include location-aware emergency response, location-based advertisement, and location-based entertainment. An important challenge in wide deployment of location-based services (LBSs) is the privacy-aware management of location information, providing safeguards for location privacy of mobile clients against vulnerabilities for abuse. This paper describes a scalable architecture for protecting location privacy from various privacy threats resulting from uncontrolled usage of LBSs. This architecture includes the development of a personalized location anonymization model and a suite of location perturbation algorithms. A unique characteristic of our location privacy architecture is the use of a flexible privacy personalization framework to support location k-anonymity for a wide range of mobile clients with context-sensitive privacy requirements. This framework enables each mobile client to specify the minimum level of anonymity it desires and the maximum temporal and spatial tolerances it is willing to accept when requesting for k-anonymity preserving LBSs. We devise an efficient message perturbation engine to implement the proposed location privacy framework. The prototype we develop is designed to be run by the anonymity server on a trusted platform and performs location anonymization on LBS request messages of mobile clients, such as identity removal and spatio-temporal cloaking of location information. We study the effectiveness of our location cloaking algorithms under various conditions using realistic location data that is synthetically generated from real road maps and traffic volume data. Our experiments show that the personalized location k-anonymity model together with our location perturbation engine can achieve high resilience to location privacy threats without introducing any significant performance penalty.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2007.1062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359010","k-anonymity;Location Privacy;Location-based Applications;Mobile Computing Systems;k-anonymity;Location Privacy;Location-based Applications;Mobile Computing Systems","Protection;Business;Engines;Data privacy;Disaster management;Information management;Prototypes;Roads;Traffic control;Resilience","","591","5","33","IEEE","21 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important issue associated with MAC-layer sensing in CRNs is how often to sense the availability of licensed channels and in which order to sense those channels. To resolve this issue, we address (1) how to maximize the discovery of spectrum opportunities by sensing-period adaptation and (2) how to minimize the delay in finding an available channel. Specifically, we develop a sensing-period optimization mechanism and an optimal channel-sequencing algorithm, as well as an environment- adaptive channel-usage pattern estimation method. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed schemes and its significant performance improvement over nonoptimal schemes. The sensing-period optimization discovers more than 98 percent of the analytical maximum of discoverable spectrum-opportunities, regardless of the number of channels sensed. For the scenarios tested, the proposed scheme is shown to discover up to 22 percent more opportunities than nonoptimal schemes, which may become even greater with a proper choice of initial sensing periods. The idle-channel discovery delay with the optimal channel-sequencing technique ranges from 0.08 to 0.35 seconds under the tested scenarios, which is much faster than nonoptimal schemes. Moreover, our estimation method is shown to track time-varying channel-parameters accurately.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2007.70751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358995","Emerging technologies;communication;Network management;Network monitoring;Mobile communication systems;Emerging technologies;communication;Network management;Network monitoring;Mobile communication systems","Cognitive radio;Monitoring;Delay;Testing;Access protocols;Optimization methods;Degradation;Wireless networks;FCC;Physical layer","","589","9","26","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

People detectors have been shown to be able to locate pedestrians even in complex street scenes, but false positives have remained frequent. The identification of particular individuals has remained challenging as well. Tracking methods are able to find a particular individual in image sequences, but are severely challenged by real-world scenarios such as crowded street scenes. In this paper, we combine the advantages of both detection and tracking in a single framework. The approximate articulation of each person is detected in every frame based on local features that model the appearance of individual body parts. Prior knowledge on possible articulations and temporal coherency within a walking cycle are modeled using a hierarchical Gaussian process latent variable model (hGPLVM). We show how the combination of these results improves hypotheses for position and articulation of each person in several subsequent frames.

The main objective of spectrum sensing is to provide more spectrum access opportunities to cognitive radio users without interfering with the operations of the licensed network. Hence, recent research has been focused on the interference avoidance problem. Moreover, current radio frequency (RF) front-ends cannot perform sensing and transmission at the same time, which inevitably decreases their transmission opportunities, leading to the so-called sensing efficiency problem. In this paper, in order to solve both the interference avoidance and the spectrum efficiency problem, an optimal spectrum sensing framework is developed. More specifically, first a theoretical framework is developed to optimize the sensing parameters in such a way as to maximize the sensing efficiency subject to interference avoidance constraints. Second, in order to exploit multiple spectrum bands, spectrum selection and scheduling methods are proposed where the best spectrum bands for sensing are selected to maximize the sensing capacity. Finally, an adaptive and cooperative spectrum sensing method is proposed where the sensing parameters are optimized adaptively to the number of cooperating users. Simulation results show that the proposed sensing framework can achieve maximum sensing efficiency and opportunities in multi-user/multi-spectrum environments, satisfying interference constraints.","1558-2248","","10.1109/T-WC.2008.070391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4657330","Cognitive radio networks, spectrum sensing, sensing efficiency, interference avoidance, optimization, scheduling, cooperation","Cognitive radio;Chromium;Radio transmitters;Radio frequency;Interference constraints;Matched filters;Signal detection;Leak detection;Constraint optimization;Constraint theory","","576","2","16","IEEE","28 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When in future small non-synchronous generation units replace a significant part of the synchronous power generation capacity, the total rotational inertia of the synchronous generators is decreased significantly. This causes large frequency variations that can end up in an unstable grid. A way to stabilize the grid frequency is to add virtual rotational inertia to the distributed generators. A virtual inertia can be attained for any generator by adding a short-term energy storage to it, combined with a suitable control mechanism for its power electronics converter.

There are many real networks that follow this model, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, etc. In this context, conventional routing schemes fail, because they try to establish complete end-to-end paths, before any data is sent. To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. While flooding-based schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention which can significantly degrade their performance. Furthermore, proposed efforts to reduce the overhead of flooding-based schemes have often been plagued by large delays. With this in mind, we introduce a new family of routing schemes that ""spray"" a few message copies into the network, and then route each copy independently towards the destination. We show that, if carefully designed, spray routing not only performs significantly fewer transmissions per message, but also has lower average delivery delays than existing schemes; furthermore, it is highly scalable and retains good performance under a large range of scenarios. Finally, we use our theoretical framework proposed in our 2004 paper to analyze the performance of spray routing. We also use this theory to show how to choose the number of copies to be sprayed and how to optimally distribute these copies to relays.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2007.897964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4430784","Ad hoc networks;delay tolerant networks;intermittent connectivity;routing","Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Ad hoc networks;Spraying;Delay;IP networks;Web and internet services;Military computing;Wildlife;Degradation","","567","","45","IEEE","15 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Being different from existing carry and forward solutions, we make use of predictable vehicle mobility, which is limited by traffic pattern and road layout. Based on the existing traffic pattern, a vehicle can find the next road to forward the packet to reduce the delay. We propose several vehicle-assisted data delivery (VADD) protocols to forward the packet to the best road with the lowest data-delivery delay. Experimental results show that the proposed VADD protocols outperform existing solutions in terms of packet-delivery ratio, data packet delay, and protocol overhead.

However, the large-scale integration of wind power represents a challenge for power system operations planning because wind power 1) cannot be dispatched in the classical sense; and 2) its output varies as weather conditions change. This warrants the investigation of alternative short-term power system operations planning methods capable of better coping with the nature of wind generation while maintaining or even improving the current reliability and economic performance of power systems. To this end, this paper formulates a short-term forward electricity market-clearing problem with stochastic security capable of accounting for nondispatchable and variable wind power generation sources. The principal benefit of this stochastic operation planning approach is that, when compared to a deterministic worst-case scenario planning philosophy, it allows greater wind power penetration without sacrificing security.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470561","Electricity markets;expected load not served;level of penetration;reserve;stochastic security;uncertainty;unit commitment;wind power generation","Stochastic processes;Wind power generation;Power system planning;Power system security;Power system reliability;Wind energy;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Global warming;Large scale integration","","561","","38","IEEE","22 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At very low nanoparticle loadings, results demonstrate some interesting dielectric behaviors for nanocomposites and some of the electrical properties are found to be unique and advantageous for use in several existing and potential electrical systems. The nanocomposite dielectric properties are analyzed in detail with respect to different experimental parameters like frequency (for permittivity/tan delta), filler size, filler concentration and filler permittivity. In addition, epoxy microcomposites for the same systems were synthesized and their dielectric properties were compared to the results already obtained for nanocomposites. The interesting dielectric characteristics for epoxy based nanodielectric systems are attributed to the large volume fraction of interfaces in the bulk of the material and the ensuing interactions between the charged nanoparticle surface and the epoxy chains.","1558-4135","","10.1109/T-DEI.2008.4446732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446732","","Nanocomposites;Nanoparticles;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Zinc oxide;Artificial intelligence;Dispersion;Performance evaluation;Dielectric measurements;Permittivity measurement;Volume measurement","","556","","33","IEEE","7 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key concept is direct parametrization of the inverse depth of features relative to the camera locations from which they were first viewed, which produces measurement equations with a high degree of linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope with features over a huge range of depths, even those that are so far from the camera that they present little parallax during motion---maintaining sufficient representative uncertainty that these points retain the opportunity to ""come in'' smoothly from infinity if the camera makes larger movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in the sense that even distant features are immediately used to improve camera motion estimates, acting initially as bearing references but not permanently labeled as such. The inverse depth parametrization remains well behaved for features at all stages of SLAM processing, but has the drawback in computational terms that each point is represented by a 6-D state vector as opposed to the standard three of a Euclidean XYZ representation. We show that once the depth estimate of a feature is sufficiently accurate, its representation can safely be converted to the Euclidean XYZ form, and propose a linearity index that allows automatic detection and conversion to maintain maximum efficiency---only low parallax features need be maintained in inverse depth form for long periods. We present a real-time implementation at 30 Hz, where the parametrization is validated in a fully automatic 3-D SLAM system featuring a handheld single camera with no additional sensing.

This paper investigates the combined optimization of a wind farm and a pumped-storage facility from the point of view of a generation company in a market environment. The optimization model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming problem with two random parameters: market prices and wind generation. The optimal bids for the day-ahead spot market are the ldquohere and nowrdquo decisions while the optimal operation of the facilities are the recourse variables.

A procedure for the characterization of hot carrier phenomena based on EL microscopy and spectroscopy is described. At high drain bias (VDS>30-50 V), new failure mechanisms are triggered, which induce an increase of gate leakage current.

Activity recognition with wearable sensors can provide feedback to the user about his/her lifestyle regarding physical activity and sports, and thus, promote a more active lifestyle. So far, activity recognition has mostly been studied in supervised laboratory settings. The aim of this study was to examine how well the daily activities and sports performed by the subjects in unsupervised settings can be recognized compared to supervised settings. The activities were recognized by using a hybrid classifier combining a tree structure containing a priori knowledge and artificial neural networks, and also by using three reference classifiers. Activity data were collected for 68 h from 12 subjects, out of which the activity was supervised for 21 h and unsupervised for 47 h. Activities were recognized based on signal features from 3-D accelerometers on hip and wrist and GPS information. The activities included lying down, sitting and standing, walking, running, cycling with an exercise bike, rowing with a rowing machine, playing football, Nordic walking, and cycling with a regular bike. The total accuracy of the activity recognition using both supervised and unsupervised data was 89% that was only 1% unit lower than the accuracy of activity recognition using only supervised data. However, the accuracy decreased by 17% unit when only supervised data were used for training and only unsupervised data for validation, which emphasizes the need for out-of-laboratory data in the development of activity-recognition systems. The results support a vision of recognizing a wider spectrum, and more complex activities in real life settings.

Our approach consists of first discovering latent "";topics""; using probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), a generative model from the statistical text literature here applied to a bag of visual words representation for each image, and subsequently, training a multiway classifier on the topic distribution vector for each image. We compare this approach to that of representing each image by a bag of visual words vector directly and training a multiway classifier on these vectors. To this end, we introduce a novel vocabulary using dense color SIFT descriptors and then investigate the classification performance under changes in the size of the visual vocabulary, the number of latent topics learned, and the type of discriminative classifier used (k-nearest neighbor or SVM). We achieve superior classification performance to recent publications that have used a bag of visual word representation, in all cases, using the authors' own data sets and testing protocols.

Given N as the processing gain, under this new arrangement, users' symbols are spread over N chips but virtually only dv < N chips that contain nonzero-values. The spread symbol is then so uniquely interleaved as the sampled, at chip rate, received signal contains the contribution from only dc < K number of users, where K denotes the total number of users in the system. Furthermore, a near-optimum chip-level iterative soft-in-soft-out (SISO) multiuser decoding (MUD), which is based on message passing algorithm (MPA) technique, is proposed to approximate optimum detection by efficiently exploiting the LDS structure. Given beta = K/N as the system loading, our simulation suggested that the proposed system alongside the proposed detection technique, in AWGN channel, can achieve an overall performance that is close to single-user performance, even when the system has 200% loading, i.e., when beta = 2. Its robustness against near-far effect and its performance behavior that is very similar to optimum detection are demonstrated in this paper. In addition, the complexity required for detection is now exponential to dc instead of K as in conventional code division multiple access (CDMA) structure employing optimum multiuser detector.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.909320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4471881","Chip-level iterative SISO MUD;Gaussian channel;low-density signature;message passing algorithm;overloaded condition","Code division multiplexing;AWGN channels;Multiuser detection;Multiaccess communication;Gaussian channels;Intersymbol interference;Multiple access interference;Forward error correction;Message passing;Iterative algorithms","","546","31","37","IEEE","14 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of TinyECC, a configurable library for ECC operations in wireless sensor networks. The primary objective of TinyECC is to provide a ready-to-use, publicly available software package for ECC-based PKC operations that can be flexibly configured and integrated into sensor network applications. TinyECC provides a number of optimization switches, which can turn specific optimizations on or off based on developers' needs. Different combinations of the optimizations have different execution time and resource consumptions, giving developers great flexibility in integrating TinyECC into sensor network applications. This paper also reports the experimental evaluation of TinyECC on several common sensor platforms, including MICAz, Tmote Sky, and Imotel. The evaluation results show the impacts of individual optimizations on the execution time and resource consumptions, and give the most computationally efficient and the most storage efficient configuration of TinyECC.","","978-0-7695-3157-1","10.1109/IPSN.2008.47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4505478","Wireless sensor network security;public key cryptography;ECC;TinyECC","Elliptic curve cryptography;Wireless sensor networks;Application software;Public key cryptography;Cryptographic protocols;IP networks;Web and internet services;Software libraries;Software packages;Switches","","535","2","33","IEEE","2 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This sparsity-seeking property is of interest in signal processing and information transmission. However, general-purpose optimizers are much too slow for lscr1 minimization in many large-scale applications.In this paper, the Homotopy method, originally proposed by Osborne et al. and Efron et al., is applied to the underdetermined lscr1-minimization problem min parxpar1 subject to y=Ax. Homotopy is shown to run much more rapidly than general-purpose LP solvers when sufficient sparsity is present. Indeed, the method often has the following k-step solution property: if the underlying solution has only k nonzeros, the Homotopy method reaches that solution in only k iterative steps. This k-step solution property is demonstrated for several ensembles of matrices, including incoherent matrices, uniform spherical matrices, and partial orthogonal matrices. These results imply that Homotopy may be used to rapidly decode error-correcting codes in a stylized communication system with a computational budget constraint. The approach also sheds light on the evident parallelism in results on lscr1 minimization and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and aids in explaining the inherent relations between Homotopy, least angle regression (LARS), OMP, and polytope faces pursuit.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2008.929958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4655448","basis pursuit; $\ell _{1}$ minimization;Homotopy methods;Least Angle Regression (Lars);LASSO;orthogonal matching pursuit;polytope faces pursuit;sparse representations;underdetermined systems of linear equations","Matching pursuit algorithms;Equations;Signal processing;Optimization methods;Minimization methods;Large-scale systems;Iterative methods;Iterative decoding;Error correction codes;Parallel processing","","533","1","55","IEEE","21 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm for estimating a distribution over geographic locations from a single image using a purely data-driven scene matching approach. For this task, we leverage a dataset of over 6 million GPS-tagged images from the Internet. We represent the estimated image location as a probability distribution over the Earthpsilas surface. We quantitatively evaluate our approach in several geolocation tasks and demonstrate encouraging performance (up to 30 times better than chance).

The development of a fully automated web inspection system requires robust and efficient fabric defect detection algorithms. The inspection of real fabric defects is particularly challenging due to the large number of fabric defect classes, which are characterized by their vagueness and ambiguity. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect fabric defects and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and/or describe these algorithms. This paper attempts to present the first survey on fabric defect detection techniques presented in about 160 references. Categorization of fabric defect detection techniques is useful in evaluating the qualities of identified features. The characterization of real fabric surfaces using their structure and primitive set has not yet been successful. Therefore, on the basis of the nature of features from the fabric surfaces, the proposed approaches have been characterized into three categories; statistical, spectral and model-based. In order to evaluate the state-of-the-art, the limitations of several promising techniques are identified and performances are analyzed in the context of their demonstrated results and intended application. The conclusions from this paper also suggest that the combination of statistical, spectral and model-based approaches can give better results than any single approach, and is suggested for further research.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.1930.896476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4418522","Automated visual inspection (AVI);fabric defect detection;industrial inspection;quality assurance;textile inspection","Fabrics;Inspection;Raw materials;Textiles;Automation;Investments;Robustness;Detection algorithms;Performance evaluation","","523","9","162","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from existing alternatives, our approach does not require the centralized estimator to be expressible in a separable closed form in terms of averages, thus allowing for decentralized computation even of nonlinear estimators, including maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) in nonlinear and non-Gaussian data models. We prove that these algorithms have guaranteed convergence to the desired estimator when the sensor links are assumed ideal. Furthermore, our decentralized algorithms exhibit resilience in the presence of receiver and/or quantization noise. In particular, we introduce a decentralized scheme for least-squares and best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) and establish its convergence in the presence of communication noise.

Recent reports show that most available spectrum has been allocated. While some of the spectrum bands (e.g., unlicensed band, GSM band) have seen increasingly crowded usage, most of the other spectrum resources are underutilized. This drives the emergence of open spectrum and dynamic spectrum access concepts, which allow unlicensed users equipped with cognitive radios to opportunistically access the spectrum not used by primary users. Cognitive radio has many advanced features, such as agilely sensing the existence of primary users and utilizing multiple spectrum bands simultaneously. However, in practice such capabilities are constrained by hardware cost. In this paper, we discuss how to conduct efficient spectrum management in ad hoc cognitive radio networks while taking the hardware constraints (e.g., single radio, partial spectrum sensing and spectrum aggregation limit) into consideration. A hardware-constrained cognitive MAC, HCMAC, is proposed to conduct efficient spectrum sensing and spectrum access decision. We identify the issue of optimal spectrum sensing decision for a single secondary transmission pair, and formulate it as an optimal stopping problem. A decentralized MAC protocol is then proposed for the ad hoc cognitive radio networks.

Tendon actuation leads to compression of the manipulator, extension of the actuators, and is limited by the practical constraint that tendons cannot support compression. In light of these observations, we present a new linear model for transforming desired beam configuration to tendon displacements and vice versa. We begin from first principles in solid mechanics by analyzing the effects of geometrically nonlinear tendon loads. These loads act both distally at the termination point and proximally along the conduit contact interface. The resulting model simplifies to a linear system including only the bending and axial modes of the manipulator as well as the actuator compliance. The model is then manipulated to form a concise mapping from beam configuration-space parameters to n redundant tendon displacements via the internal loads and strains experienced by the system. We demonstrate the utility of this model by implementing an optimal feasible controller. The controller regulates axial strain to a constant value while guaranteeing positive tendon forces and minimizing their magnitudes over a range of articulations. The mechanics-based model from this study provides insight as well as performance gains for this increasingly ubiquitous class of manipulators.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2008.2002311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4660316","Cable drive;elastic manipulator;flexible manipulator;kinematics;redundant tendons;robotic surgery;slack tendon;snake robot;statics;tendon drive;Cable drive;elastic manipulator;flexible manipulator;kinematics;redundant tendons;robotic surgery;slack tendon;snake robot;statics;tendon drive","Manipulators;Tendons;Capacitive sensors;Robots;Solids;Linear systems;Hydraulic actuators;Optimal control;Force control;Strain control","","513","17","29","IEEE","28 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the increasing resolution capabilities of modern sensors, however, this assumption is often no longer valid as different scattering centers of an object can cause distinct detections when passing the signal processing chain. Examples of extended targets are found in short-range applications (littoral surveillance, autonomous weapons, or robotics). A collectively moving target group can also be considered as an extended target. This point of view is the more appropriate, the smaller the mutual distances between the individual targets are. Due to the resulting data association and resolution conflicts any attempt of tracking the individual objects within the group seems to be no longer reasonable. With simulated sensor data produced by a partly unresolvable aircraft formation the addressed phenomena are illustrated and an approximate Bayesian solution to the resulting tracking problem is proposed. Ellipsoidal object extensions are modeled by random matrices, which are treated as additional state variables to be estimated or tracked.

As it is customary in iterative optimization, in each iteration the nonlinear objective function is approximated by an alternative expression for which the corresponding optimization is simple. In our case we propose an efficient approximation that leads to a closed form solution (per iteration) which is of low computational complexity, the latter property being particularly strong in our inverse version. The proposed schemes are tested against the forward additive Lucas-Kanade and the simultaneous inverse compositional algorithm through simulations. Under noisy conditions and photometric distortions our forward version achieves more accurate alignments and exhibits faster convergence whereas our inverse version has similar performance as the simultaneous inverse compositional algorithm but at a lower computational complexity.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4515873","Image Processing and Computer Vision;Registration;Motion;Gradient methods;Image Processing and Computer Vision;Registration;Motion;Gradient methods","Photometry;Nonlinear distortion;Computational complexity;Distortion measurement;Iterative methods;Closed-form solution;Testing;Additives;Computational modeling;Predistortion","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Subtraction Technique","506","5","22","IEEE","12 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This synthesis is performed with the help of a high spatial but low spectral resolution image: the panchromatic (Pan) image. The fusion of the Pan and MS images is classically referred as pan-sharpening. A fused product reaches good quality only if the characteristics and differences between input images are taken into account. Dissimilarities existing between these two data sets originate from two causes-different times and different spectral bands of acquisition. Remote sensing physics should be carefully considered while designing the fusion process. Because of the complexity of physics and the large number of unknowns, authors are led to make assumptions to drive their development. Weaknesses and strengths of each reported method are raised and confronted to these physical constraints. The conclusion of this critical survey of literature is that the choice in the assumptions for the development of a method is crucial, with the risk to drastically weaken fusion performance.

Wavelets and principal component analysis (PCA) methods have been a popular choice for spatial and spectral transformations, respectively. Current PCA-based pan-sharpening methods make an assumption that the first principal component (PC) of high variance is an ideal choice for replacing or injecting it with high spatial details from the high-resolution histogram-matched panchromatic (PAN) image. This paper presents a combined adaptive PCA-contourlet approach for pan-sharpening, where the adaptive PCA is used to reduce the spectral distortion and the use of nonsubsampled contourlets for spatial transformation in pan-sharpening is incorporated to overcome the limitation of the wavelets in representing the directional information efficiently and capturing intrinsic geometrical structures of the objects. The efficiency of the presented method is tested by performing pan-sharpening of the high-resolution (IKONOS and QuickBird) and the medium-resolution (Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) datasets. The evaluation of the pan-sharpened images using global validation indexes reveal that the adaptive PCA approach helps reducing the spectral distortion, and its merger with contourlets provides better fusion results.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.916211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4490068","Contourlets;image fusion;pan-sharpening;principal component analysis (PCA);wavelets","Principal component analysis;Spatial resolution;Signal resolution;Discrete wavelet transforms;Image resolution;Image fusion;Multispectral imaging;Wavelet analysis;Remote sensing;Optical distortion","","502","2","36","IEEE","15 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this way, a noise figure (NF) close to or below 3 dB can be achieved, while good linearity is possible when the CS-stage is carefully optimized. We show that a CS-stage with deep submicron transistors can have high IIP2, because the nugsldr nuds cross-term in a two-dimensional Taylor approximation of the IDS(VGS, VDS) characteristic can cancel the traditionally dominant square-law term in the IDS(VGS) relation at practical gain values.

However, if the transformer is removed, the galvanic isolation between the PV generator and the grid is lost. This may cause safety hazards in the event of ground faults. In addition, the circulation of leakage currents (common-mode currents) through the stray capacitance between the PV array and the ground would be enabled. Furthermore, when no transformer is used, the inverter could inject direct current (dc) to the grid, causing the saturation of the transformers along the distribution network. While safety requirements in transformerless systems can be met by means of external elements, leakage currents and the injection of dc into the grid must be guaranteed topologically or by the inverter's control system. This paper proposes a new high-efficiency topology for transformerless systems, which does not generate common-mode currents and topologically guarantees that no dc is injected into the grid. The proposed topology has been verified in a 5-kW prototype with satisfactory results.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.924015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550670","Direct current (dc)–alternating current (ac) power conversion;half bridge;photovoltaic (PV) systems;single-phase three-level diode-clamped inverter;transformerless inverter","Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Inverters;Circuit faults;Mesh generation;Safety;Leakage current;Costs;Galvanizing;Hazards","","492","5","23","IEEE","24 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We advocate a broad approach to addressing this problem that includes making power-awareness a primary objective in the design and configuration of networks, and in the design and implementation of network protocols. We support our arguments by providing a case study of power demands of two standard router platforms that enables us to create a generic model for router power consumption.

According to the property-rights model of cognitive radio, the primary terminals own a given bandwidth and may decide to lease it for a fraction of time to secondary nodes in exchange for appropriate remuneration. In this paper, we propose and analyze an implementation of this framework, whereby a primary link has the possibility to lease the owned spectrum to an ad hoc network of secondary nodes in exchange for cooperation in the form of distributed space-time coding. On one hand, the primary link attempts to maximize its quality of service in terms of either rate or probability of outage, accounting for the possible contribution from cooperation. On the other hand, nodes in the secondary ad hoc network compete among themselves for transmission within the leased time-slot following a distributed power control mechanism. The investigated model is conveniently cast in the framework of Stackelberg games. We consider both a baseline scenario with full channel state information and information-theoretic transmission strategies, and a more practical model with long-term channel state information and randomized distributed space-time coding. Analysis and numerical results show that spectrum leasing based on trading secondary spectrum access for cooperation is a promising framework for cognitive radio.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413152","","Ad hoc networks;Cognitive radio;Bandwidth;Remuneration;Quality of service;Channel state information;Information theory;Wireless communication;Frequency;Power control","","489","8","24","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the system integrates continuous visual odometry computation with tracking-by-detection in order to track pedestrians in spite of frequent occlusions and egomotion of the camera rig. To achieve reliable performance under real-world conditions, it has long been advocated to extract and combine as much visual information as possible. We propose a way to closely integrate the vision modules for visual odometry, pedestrian detection, depth estimation, and tracking. The integration naturally leads to several cognitive feedback loops between the modules. Among others, we propose a novel feedback connection from the object detector to visual odometry which utilizes the semantic knowledge of detection to stabilize localization. Feedback loops always carry the danger that erroneous feedback from one module is amplified and causes the entire system to become instable. We therefore incorporate automatic failure detection and recovery, allowing the system to continue when a module becomes unreliable. The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver stable tracking performance in scenes of previously infeasible complexity.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587581","","Machine vision;Layout;Feedback loop;Object detection;Mobile robots;Noise robustness;Cameras;Data mining;Detectors;Video sequences","","488","2","30","IEEE","5 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pixel structure dictated by the learnt model is enforced by the soft-decision estimation process onto a block of pixels, including both observed and estimated. The result is equivalent to that of a high-order adaptive nonseparable 2-D interpolation filter. This new image interpolation approach preserves spatial coherence of interpolated images better than the existing methods, and it produces the best results so far over a wide range of scenes in both PSNR measure and subjective visual quality.

The core problem is a multicast generalization of the multiuser downlink beamforming problem; the difference is that each transmitted stream is directed to multiple receivers, each with its own channel. Such generalization is relevant and timely, e.g., in the context of the emerging WiMAX and UMTS-LTE wireless networks. The joint problem also contains single-group multicast beamforming as a special case. The latter (and therefore also the former) is NP-hard. This motivates the pursuit of computationally efficient quasi-optimal solutions. It is shown that Lagrangian relaxation coupled with suitable randomization/cochannel multicast power control yield computationally efficient high-quality approximate solutions.

Spectrum sensing is one of the essential mechanisms of CRs and its operational aspects are being investigated actively. However, the security aspects of spectrum sensing have garnered little attention. In this paper, we identify a threat to spectrum sensing, which we call the primary user emulation (PUE) attack. In this attack, an adversary's CR transmits signals whose characteristics emulate those of incumbent signals. The highly flexible, software-based air interface of CRs makes such an attack possible. Our investigation shows that a PUE attack can severely interfere with the spectrum sensing process and significantly reduce the channel resources available to legitimate unlicensed users. To counter this threat, we propose a transmitter verification scheme, called LocDef (localization-based defense), which verifies whether a given signal is that of an incumbent transmitter by estimating its location and observing its signal characteristics. To estimate the location of the signal transmitter, LocDef employs a non-interactive localization scheme. Our security analysis and simulation results suggest that LocDef is effective in identifying PUE attacks under certain conditions.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413138","","Emulation;Cognitive radio;Chromium;Radio transmitters;Communication system security;FCC;Interference;Wireless sensor networks;Radio spectrum management;White spaces","","483","1","27","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since fading variance is distance-dependent in free-space optical systems, relay-assisted transmission takes advantage of the resulting shorter hops and yields significant performance improvements. We derive outage probability of the relaying schemes under consideration which are further confirmed through Monte-Carlo simulations. Our outage probability analysis demonstrates that an impressive performance improvement of 18.5 dB is possible with the use of a single relay at a target outage probability of 10-6.","1558-2248","","10.1109/T-WC.2008.071352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4723353","Free-space optical systems, cooperative diversity;fading channels.","Relays;Optical fiber communication;Power system relaying;Fading;Stimulated emission;Decoding;Atmospheric modeling;Power system modeling;Protective relaying;Performance analysis","","482","1","28","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, semi supervised learning algorithms have aroused considerable interests from the data mining and machine learning fields. In recent years, graph-based semi supervised learning has been becoming one of the most active research areas in the semi supervised learning community. In this paper, a novel graph-based semi supervised learning approach is proposed based on a linear neighborhood model, which assumes that each data point can be linearly reconstructed from its neighborhood. Our algorithm, named linear neighborhood propagation (LNP), can propagate the labels from the labeled points to the whole data set using these linear neighborhoods with sufficient smoothness. A theoretical analysis of the properties of LNP is presented in this paper. Furthermore, we also derive an easy way to extend LNP to out-of-sample data.

In the network, we first connect two transmission lines (TLs) individually to the input ports of two strongly coupled antennas. The length of the TLs is designed so that the trans-admittance between ports changes from a complex one at the antenna inputs to a pure imaginary one. A shunt reactive component is then attached in between the TL ends to cancel the resultant imaginary trans-admittance. Finally, a simple lumped-element circuit is added to each port for input impedance matching. The even-odd mode analysis is adopted to investigate the currents excited on the antennas for predicting the radiation pattern of the two-element antenna array. Two examples of printed antennas at 2.45 GHz are tackled by using the proposed decoupling structure. The measurement results agree quite well with the simulation ones. High antenna isolation and good input return loss are simultaneously achieved in both cases, which demonstrates the feasibility of the structure. The decoupled antenna array in each example radiates, as prediction, toward different but complementary directions when the input power is fed in turn to the two input ports. The array efficiency is estimated better than 75% in each example. This pattern diversity effect is helpful for reducing the channel correlation in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2008.2005469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4718024","Decoupling network;high isolation antennas;multiple-input multiple output (MIMO);pattern diversity;wireless local area network (WLAN)","Couplings;Antenna arrays;MIMO;Power transmission lines;Transmission line antennas;Circuits;Impedance matching;Pattern analysis;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna measurements","","472","22","20","IEEE","27 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It enables the surgeon to feel organic tissue hardness, measure tissue properties, evaluate anatomical structures, and allows him/her to commit appropriate force control actions for safe tissue manipulation. However, in minimally invasive surgery, the surgeon's ability of perceiving valuable haptic information through surgical instruments is severely impaired. Performing the surgery without such sensory information could lead to increase of tissue trauma and vital organic tissue damage. In order to restore the surgeon's perceptual capability, methods of force and tactile sensing have been applied with attempts to develop instruments that can be used to detect tissue contact forces and generate haptic feedback to the surgeon. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in force and tactile sensing technologies applied in minimally invasive surgery.

In most of these problems, a uniform and symmetrical distribution of the linguistic term sets for linguistic modeling is assumed. However, there exist problems whose assessments need to be represented by means of unbalanced linguistic term sets, i.e., using term sets that are not uniformly and symmetrically distributed. The use of linguistic variables implies processes of computing with words (CW). Different computational approaches can be found in the literature to accomplish those processes. The 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation introduces a computational model that allows the possibility of dealing with linguistic terms in a precise way whenever the linguistic term set is uniformly and symmetrically distributed. In this paper, we present a fuzzy linguistic methodology in order to deal with unbalanced linguistic term sets. To do so, we first develop a representation model for unbalanced linguistic information that uses the concept of linguistic hierarchy as representation basis and afterwards an unbalanced linguistic computational model that uses the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic computational model to accomplish processes of CW with unbalanced term sets in a precise way and without loss of information.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2007.896353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470556","Computing with words;linguistic aggregation;linguistic variables;unbalanced linguistic term sets","Fuzzy sets;Computational modeling;Computer science;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Humans;Resource management;Safety;Decision making;Artificial intelligence","","463","","57","IEEE","4 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Change classification uses a machine learning classifier to determine whether a new software change is more similar to prior buggy changes, or clean changes. In this manner, change classification predicts the existence of bugs in software changes. The classifier is trained using features (in the machine learning sense) extracted from the revision history of a software project, as stored in its software configuration management repository. The trained classifier can classify changes as buggy or clean with 78% accuracy and 65% buggy change recall (on average). Change classification has several desirable qualities: (1) the prediction granularity is small (a change to a single file), (2) predictions do not require semantic information about the source code, (3) the technique works for a broad array of project types and programming languages, and (4) predictions can be made immediately upon completion of a change. Contributions of the paper include a description of the change classification approach, techniques for extracting features from source code and change histories, a characterization of the performance of change classification across 12 open source projects, and evaluation of the predictive power of different groups of features.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2007.70773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408585","Software maintenance;Metrics/Measurement;Clustering;classification;and association rules;Configuration Management;Data mining;Software maintenance;Metrics/Measurement;Clustering;classification;and association rules;Configuration Management;Data mining","Computer bugs;Machine learning;Open source software;Classification algorithms;History;Data mining;Feature extraction;Software debugging;Project management;Computer languages","","463","9","56","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are many real networks that follow this model, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), etc. In this context, conventional routing schemes would fail, because they try to establish complete end-to-end paths, before any data is sent. To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. While flooding-based schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention which can significantly degrade their performance. With this in mind, we look into a number of ldquosingle-copyrdquo routing schemes that use only one copy per message, and hence significantly reduce the resource requirements of flooding-based algorithms. We perform a detailed exploration of the single-copy routing space in order to identify efficient single-copy solutions that (i) can be employed when low resource usage is critical, and (ii) can help improve the design of general routing schemes that use multiple copies. We also propose a theoretical framework that we use to analyze the performance of all single-copy schemes presented, and to derive upper and lower bounds on the delay of any scheme.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2007.897962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4430783","Ad hoc networks;delay tolerant networks;intermittent connectivity;routing","Routing;Disruption tolerant networking;Ad hoc networks;Wildlife;IP networks;Degradation;Performance analysis;Delay;Wireless networks;Remote monitoring","","456","","45","IEEE","15 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transition probabilities of the mode jumps are considered to be partially known, which relax the traditional assumption in Markov jump systems that all of them must be completely known a priori. Following the recent study on the class of systems, a monotonicity is further observed in concern of the conservatism of obtaining the maximal delay range due to the unknown elements in the transition probability matrix.

Then, we proceed to examine individual per-antenna power constraints. In this case, the pseudo-inverse is not necessarily the optimal inverse. In fact, finding the optimal matrix is nontrivial and depends on the specific performance measure.

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance.

In this communication, an asynchronous (self-paced) four-class BCI based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) was used to control a two-axes electrical hand prosthesis. During training, four healthy participants reached an online classification accuracy between 44% and 88%. Controlling the prosthetic hand asynchronously, the participants reached a performance of 75.5 to 217.5 s to copy a series of movements, whereas the fastest possible duration determined by the setup was 64 s. The number of false negative (FN) decisions varied from 0 to 10 (the maximal possible decisions were 34).

We group left and right lane boundaries separately to effectively handle merging and splitting lanes. A fast and robust algorithm, based on random-sample consensus and particle filtering, is proposed to generate a large number of hypotheses in real time. The generated hypotheses are evaluated and grouped based on a probabilistic framework. The suggested framework effectively combines a likelihood-based object-recognition algorithm with a Markov-style process (tracking) and can also be applied to general-part-based object-tracking problems.

Two topics are discussed: heart modeling and automatic model fitting to an unseen volume. Heart modeling is a nontrivial task since the heart is a complex nonrigid organ. The model must be anatomically accurate, allow manual editing, and provide sufficient information to guide automatic detection and segmentation. Unlike previous work, we explicitly represent important landmarks (such as the valves and the ventricular septum cusps) among the control points of the model. The control points can be detected reliably to guide the automatic model fitting process. Using this model, we develop an efficient and robust approach for automatic heart chamber segmentation in 3-D CT volumes. We formulate the segmentation as a two-step learning problem: anatomical structure localization and boundary delineation. In both steps, we exploit the recent advances in learning discriminative models. A novel algorithm, marginal space learning (MSL), is introduced to solve the 9-D similarity transformation search problem for localizing the heart chambers. After determining the pose of the heart chambers, we estimate the 3-D shape through learning-based boundary delineation. The proposed method has been extensively tested on the largest dataset (with 323 volumes from 137 patients) ever reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the fastest with a speed of 4.0 s per volume (on a dual-core 3.2-GHz processor) for the automatic segmentation of all four chambers.

Soft-switching conditions over the full operating range are achievable by adjusting the duty ratio of the voltage applied to the transformer winding in response to the dc voltage variations at the port. Keeping the volt-second product (half-cycle voltage-time integral) equal for all the windings leads to ZVS conditions over the entire operating range. A detailed analysis is provided for both the two-port and the three-port converters.

For most voiced speech, the most significant excitation takes place around the instant of glottal closure. Extraction of epochs from speech is a challenging task due to time-varying characteristics of the source and the system. Most epoch extraction methods attempt to remove the characteristics of the vocal-tract system, in order to emphasize the excitation characteristics in the residual. The performance of such methods depends critically on our ability to model the system. In this paper, we propose a method for epoch extraction which does not depend critically on characteristics of the time-varying vocal-tract system. The method exploits the nature of impulse-like excitation. The proposed zero resonance frequency filter output brings out the epoch locations with high accuracy and reliability. The performance of the method is demonstrated using CMU-Arctic database using the epoch information from the electroglottograph as reference. The proposed method performs significantly better than the other methods currently available for epoch extraction. The interesting part of the results is that the epoch extraction by the proposed method seems to be robust against degradations like white noise, babble, high-frequency channel, and vehicle noise.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2008.2004526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4648930","Epoch extraction;glottal closure instant;group-delay;Hilbert envelope;instantaneous frequency","Speech;Time varying systems;Data mining;Production systems;Resonance;Resonant frequency;Filters;Databases;Noise robustness;Degradation","","446","3","33","IEEE","21 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Interdependencies between computer communication system and the physical infrastructure also become more complex as information technologies are further integrated into devices and networks. This paper proposes a vulnerability assessment framework to systematically evaluate the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems at three levels: system, scenarios, and access points. The proposed method is based on cyber systems embedded with the firewall and password models, the primary mode of protection in the power industry today. The impact of a potential electronic intrusion is evaluated by its potential loss of load in the power system. This capability is enabled by integration of a logic-based simulation method and a module for the power flow computation. The IEEE 30-bus system is used to evaluate the impact of attacks launched from outside or from within the substation networks.

This study includes detailed benchmarking of the GPU memory system that reveals sizes and latencies of caches and TLB. We present a couple of algorithmic optimizations aimed at increasing parallelism and regularity in the problem that provide us with slightly higher performance.","2167-4337","978-1-4244-2834-2","10.1109/SC.2008.5214359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5214359","","Linear algebra;Kernel;Computer science;Delay;Libraries;Performance analysis;Bandwidth;Mathematics;Hardware;Computer architecture","","442","5","23","IEEE","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two specific problems are addressed. The first is the constrained optimization problem of finding the value of R which causes the true transmit beampattern to be close in some sense to a desired beampattern. This is approached using convex optimization techniques. The second is the problem of designing multiple constant-modulus waveforms with given cross-correlation R. The use of coded binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) waveforms is considered. A method for finding the code sequences based on random signaling with a structured correlation matrix is proposed. It is also shown that by restricting the class of admissible waveforms one reduces the set of possible signal correlation matrices.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2008.4516997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4516997","","Array signal processing;MIMO;Symmetric matrices;Linear matrix inequalities;Radar signal processing;Signal synthesis;Transmitters;Radar tracking;Target tracking;Storage area networks","","439","4","15","IEEE","12 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To avoid any possible malicious attack and resource abuse, employing a digital signature scheme is widely recognized as the most effective approach for VSNs to achieve authentication, integrity, and validity. However, when the number of signatures received by a Roadside Unit (RSU) becomes large, a scalability problem emerges immediately, where the RSU could be difficult to sequentially verify each received signature within 300 ms interval according to the current Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) broadcast protocol. We introduce an efficient batch signature verification scheme for communications between vehicles and RSUs (or termed vehicle- to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications), in which an RSU can verify multiple received signatures at the same time such that the total verification time can be dramatically reduced. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve conditional privacy preservation that is essential in VSNs, where each message launched by a vehicle is mapped to a distinct pseudo identity, while a trust authority can always retrieve the real identity of a vehicle from any pseudo identity. With the proposed scheme, since identity-based cryptography is employed in generating private keys for pseudo identities, certificates are not needed and thus transmission overhead can be significantly reduced.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509653","","Vehicles;Communication system traffic control;Sensor systems and applications;Humans;Control systems;Telecommunication control;Digital signatures;Authentication;Scalability;Broadcasting","","438","9","38","IEEE","2 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The coupling of the plasmons to interband electron-hole transitions in population inverted graphene layers can lead to plasmon amplification through stimulated emission. Plasmon gain values in graphene can be very large due to the small group velocity of the plasmons and the strong confinement of the plasmon field in the vicinity of the graphene layer. We present a transmission line model for plasmon propagation in graphene that includes plasmon dissipation and plasmon interband gain due to stimulated emission. Using this model, we discuss design for terahertz plasmon oscillators and derive the threshold condition for oscillation taking into account internal losses and also losses due to external coupling. The threshold condition is shown to depend on the ratio of the external impedance and the characteristic impedance of the plasmon transmission line. The large gain values available at terahertz frequencies in graphene can lead to integrated oscillators that have dimensions in the 1-10 mum range.","1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2007.910334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4362685","Carbon;nanotechnology;plasmons;submillimeter-wave oscillators;Plasmons;Submillimeter Wave Oscillators;Carbon;Nanotechnology","Plasmons;Oscillators;Stimulated emission;Frequency;Impedance;Optical scattering;Transmission line theory;Couplings;Photonic band gap;Laser modes","","438","10","31","IEEE","14 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With some local knowledge about individuals in a social network, an adversary may attack the privacy of some victims easily. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies on privacy preservation can deal with relational data only, and cannot be applied to social network data. In this paper, we take an initiative towards preserving privacy in social network data. We identify an essential type of privacy attacks: neighborhood attacks. If an adversary has some knowledge about the neighbors of a target victim and the relationship among the neighbors, the victim may be re-identified from a social network even if the victim's identity is preserved using the conventional anonymization techniques. We show that the problem is challenging, and present a practical solution to battle neighborhood attacks. The empirical study indicates that anonymized social networks generated by our method can still be used to answer aggregate network queries with high accuracy.","2375-026X","978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497459","","Social network services;Privacy;Loss measurement;Data privacy;Knowledge engineering;Publishing;Data models","","438","13","23","IEEE","25 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rather than uniformly sampling the signal, compressive sensing computes inner products with a randomized dictionary of test functions. The signal is then recovered by a convex optimization that ensures the recovered signal is both consistent with the measurements and sparse. Compressive sensing reconstruction has been shown to be robust to multi-level quantization of the measurements, in which the reconstruction algorithm is modified to recover a sparse signal consistent to the quantization measurements. In this paper we consider the limiting case of 1-bit measurements, which preserve only the sign information of the random measurements. Although it is possible to reconstruct using the classical compressive sensing approach by treating the 1-bit measurements as plusmn 1 measurement values, in this paper we reformulate the problem by treating the 1-bit measurements as sign constraints and further constraining the optimization to recover a signal on the unit sphere. Thus the sparse signal is recovered within a scaling factor. We demonstrate that this approach performs significantly better compared to the classical compressive sensing reconstruction methods, even as the signal becomes less sparse and as the number of measurements increases.","","978-1-4244-2246-3","10.1109/CISS.2008.4558487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4558487","","Quantization;Dictionaries;Sampling methods;Image reconstruction;Reconstruction algorithms;Image coding;Hardware;Electric variables measurement;Testing;Robustness","","434","12","16","IEEE","9 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper also identifies some possible applications of it, in particular, in a hydro dominated system. To be able to quantify the system characteristic, a delay model of the studied hydro system is developed. Due to the fact that the initial power surge of a hydro turbine is opposite to that desired, the short-term extra active power support from a wind farm (WF) could be beneficial for a hydro dominated system in arresting the initial frequency fall, which corresponds to an improvement in the system temporary minimum frequency (TMF). The improvements in the TMF are calculated by using both the developed delay model and a detailed model, and the results show good agreement. It is shown that the WT under consideration can provide a 0.1 pu extra active power support for 10 s quite easily which is twice the Hydro-Quebec requirement.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2008.920076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4480153","Delay model;hydro turbine;inertia;load frequency control (LFC);non-minimum phase system;primary frequency control;rotational energy;steam turbine;variable speed wind turbine;wind turbine modeling","Frequency control;Wind speed;Wind turbines;Hydraulic turbines;Power system modeling;Surges;Wind farms;Power systems;Power system stability;Blades","","428","11","20","IEEE","22 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Competitive Pricing for Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks: Dynamic Game, Inefficiency of Nash Equilibrium, and Collusion","D. Niyato; E.

By using an equilibrium pricing scheme, each of the primary service providers aims to maximize its profit under quality of service (QoS) constraint for primary users. We formulate this situation as an oligopoly market consisting of a few firms and a consumer. The QoS degradation of the primary services is considered as the cost in offering spectrum access to the secondary users. For the secondary users, we adopt a utility function to obtain the demand function. With a Bertrand game model, we analyze the impacts of several system parameters such as spectrum substitutability and channel quality on the Nash equilibrium (i.e., equilibrium pricing adopted by the primary services). We present distributed algorithms to obtain the solution for this dynamic game. The stability of the proposed dynamic game algorithms in terms of convergence to the Nash equilibrium is studied. However, the Nash equilibrium is not efficient in the sense that the total profit of the primary service providers is not maximized. An optimal solution to gain the highest total profit can be obtained. A collusion can be established among the primary services so that they gain higher profit than that for the Nash equilibrium. However, since one or more of the primary service providers may deviate from the optimal solution, a punishment mechanism may be applied to the deviating primary service provider. A repeated game among primary service providers is formulated to show that the collusion can be maintained if all of the primary service providers are aware of this punishment mechanism, and therefore, properly weight their profits to be obtained in the future.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413151","","Pricing;Cognitive radio;Nash equilibrium;Quality of service;Oligopoly;Degradation;Costs;Distributed algorithms;Stability;Heuristic algorithms","","428","1","22","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A large class of constant-dimension subspace codes is investigated. It is shown that codes in this class can be easily constructed from rank-metric codes, while preserving their distance properties. Moreover, it is shown that minimum distance decoding of such subspace codes can be reformulated as a generalized decoding problem for rank-metric codes where partial information about the error is available. This partial information may be in the form of erasures (knowledge of an error location but not its value) and deviations (knowledge of an error value but not its location). Taking erasures and deviations into account (when they occur) strictly increases the error correction capability of a code: if $\mu$ erasures and $\delta$ deviations occur, then errors of rank $t$  can always be corrected provided that $2t \leq d - 1 + \mu + \delta$, where $d$ is the minimum rank distance of the code. For Gabidulin codes, an important family of maximum rank distance codes, an efficient decoding algorithm is proposed that can properly exploit erasures and deviations. In a network coding application, where $n$ packets of length $M$ over $\BBF _{q}$ are transmitted, the complexity of the decoding algorithm is given by  $O(dM)$ operations in an extension field $\BBF _{q^{n}}$.

Moreover, the architecture of this estimator is independent of the communication protocol and can be implemented using a finite memory buffer if the delivered packets have a finite maximum delay. We also present two alternative estimator architectures that are more computationally efficient and provide upper and lower bounds for the performance of the time-varying estimator.

We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background.

The complex networks addressed which include neural and social networks as special cases are quite general. Rather than the commonly used Lipschitz-type function, a more general sector-like nonlinear function is employed to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. The distributed infinite time delays in the discrete-time domain are first defined. By utilizing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed discrete-time complex network with distributed delays is synchronized if certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. The state estimation problem is then studied for the same complex network, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that, for all admissible discrete and distributed delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be globally asymptotically stable. Again, an LMI approach is developed for the state estimation problem. Two simulation examples are provided to show the usefulness of the proposed global synchronization and state estimation conditions. It is worth pointing out that our main results are valid even if the nominal subsystems within the network are unstable.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2008.925745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595626","Complex networks;discrete time delays;distributed time delays;linear matrix inequality (LMI);Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional;neural networks;state estimation;synchronization;Complex networks;discrete time delays;distributed time delays;linear matrix inequality (LMI);Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional;neural networks;state estimation;synchronization","State estimation;Complex networks;Delay estimation;Delay effects;Biological neural networks;Couplings;Linear matrix inequalities;Mathematics;Information systems;Chaotic communication","Action Potentials;Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Nerve Net;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Synaptic Transmission","421","1","39","IEEE","12 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Estimation is performed via a two stage strategy, the first being a Kalman-like measurement update which does not require communication, and the second being an estimate fusion using a consensus matrix. In particular we study the interaction between the consensus matrix, the number of messages exchanged per sampling time, and the Kalman gain for scalar systems. We prove that optimizing the consensus matrix for fastest convergence and using the centralized optimal gain is not necessarily the optimal strategy if the number of exchanged messages per sampling time is small. Moreover, we show that although the joint optimization of the consensus matrix and the Kalman gain is in general a non-convex problem, it is possible to compute them under some relevant scenarios.

However, it is still a challenging problem for the existing computer vision systems to automatically and effectively estimate human ages. The aging process is determined by not only the person's gene, but also many external factors, such as health, living style, living location, and weather conditions. Males and females may also age differently. The current age estimation performance is still not good enough for practical use and more effort has to be put into this research direction. In this paper, we introduce the age manifold learning scheme for extracting face aging features and design a locally adjusted robust regressor for learning and prediction of human ages. The novel approach improves the age estimation accuracy significantly over all previous methods. The merit of the proposed approaches for image-based age estimation is shown by extensive experiments on a large internal age database and the public available FG-NET database.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2008.924280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531189","Age manifold;human age estimation;locally adjusted robust regression;manifold learning;nonlinear regression;support vector machine (SVM);support vector regression (SVR)","Robustness;Aging;Image databases;Image analysis;Application software;Human computer interaction;Multimedia communication;Computer vision;Face;Feature extraction","Aging;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Face;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Regression Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","421","7","35","IEEE","28 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The application domains are disparate, ranging from video surveillance to automatic video annotation for sport videos or TV shots. Whatever the application field, most of the works in event analysis are based on two main approaches: the former based on explicit event recognition, focused on finding high-level, semantic interpretations of video sequences, and the latter based on anomaly detection. This paper deals with the second approach, where the final goal is not the explicit labeling of recognized events, but the detection of anomalous events differing from typical patterns. In particular, the proposed work addresses anomaly detection by means of trajectory analysis, an approach with several application fields, most notably video surveillance and traffic monitoring. The proposed approach is based on single-class support vector machine (SVM) clustering, where the novelty detection SVM capabilities are used for the identification of anomalous trajectories. Particular attention is given to trajectory classification in absence of a priori information on the distribution of outliers. Experimental results prove the validity of the proposed approach.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2005599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4633642","Anomaly detection;event analysis;support vector machines (SVMs);trajectory clustering","Event detection;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Video surveillance;Video sequences;Labeling;Pattern recognition;Layout;Intelligent sensors;Stochastic processes","","419","5","42","IEEE","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The source determines when it needs to cooperate with one relay only, and which relay to cooperate with in case of cooperation, i.e., ""When to cooperate?"" and ""Whom to cooperate with?"". An optimal relay is the one which has the maximum instantaneous scaled harmonic mean functionof its source-relay and relay-destination channel gains. For the symmetric scenario, we derive an approximate expression of the bandwidth efficiency and obtain an upper bound on the symbol error rate (SER) performance.

We consider a system of cognitive radio users who cooperate with each other in trying to detect licensed transmissions. Assuming that the cooperating nodes use identical energy detectors, we model the received signals as correlated log-normal random variables and study the problem of fusing the decisions made by the individual nodes. We design a linear-quadratic (LQ) fusion strategy based on a deflection criterion for this problem, which takes into account the correlation between the nodes.

To this end, various solutions have been proposed by FPGA manufacturers based on the idea of bitstream encryption. An alternative solution was advocated in (E. Simpson and P. Schaumont, 2006). Simpson and Schaumont proposed a new approach based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) for IP protection on FPGAs. PUFs are a unique class of physical systems that extract secrets from complex physical characteristics of the integrated circuits which along with the properties of unclonability provide a highly secure means of generating volatile secret keys for cryptographic operations. However, the first practical PUF on an FPGA was proposed only later in (J. Guajardo et al., 2007) based on the startup values of embedded SRAM memories which are intrinsic in some of the current FPGAs. The disadvantage of these intrinsic SRAM PUFs is that not all FPGAs support uninitialized SRAM memory. In this paper, we propose a new PUF structure called the butterfly PUF that can be used on all types of FPGAs. We also present experimental results showing their identification and key generation capabilities.","","978-1-4244-2401-6","10.1109/HST.2008.4559053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559053","Physical Unclonable Functions;Intrinsic PUFs;SRAM;cross-coupled circuits;identification;secret-key storage;FPGAs;IP Protection","Protection;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Circuits;Manufacturing processes;Cryptography;Nonvolatile memory;Batteries;Security;Inverters","","414","36","22","IEEE","9 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Bearing problems are one major cause for drive failures. Their detection is possible by vibration monitoring of characteristic bearing frequencies. As it is possible to detect other machine faults by monitoring the stator current, a great interest exists in applying the same method for bearing fault detection. After a presentation of the existing fault model, a new detailed approach is proposed. It is based on the following two effects of a bearing fault: 1. the introduction of a particular radial rotor movement and 2. load torque variations caused by the bearing fault. The theoretical study results in new expressions for the stator current frequency content. Experimental tests with artificial and realistic bearing damage were conducted by measuring vibration, torque, and stator current.

Local Kalman filters are implemented on nl-dimensional subsystems, nl Lt n, obtained by spatially decomposing the large-scale system. The distributed Kalman filter is optimal under an Lth order Gauss-Markov approximation to the centralized filter. We quantify the information loss due to this Lth-order approximation by the divergence, which decreases as L increases. The order of the approximation L leads to a bound on the dimension of the subsystems, hence, providing a criterion for subsystem selection. The (approximated) centralized Riccati and Lyapunov equations are computed iteratively with only local communication and low-order computation by a distributed iterate collapse inversion (DICI) algorithm. We fuse the observations that are common among the local Kalman filters using bipartite fusion graphs and consensus averaging algorithms. The proposed algorithm achieves full distribution of the Kalman filter. Nowhere in the network, storage, communication, or computation of n-dimensional vectors and matrices is required; only nl Lt n dimensional vectors and matrices are communicated or used in the local computations at the sensors.

High-radix networks, however, require longer cables than their low-radix counterparts. Because cables dominate network cost, the number of cables, and particularly the number of long, global cables should be minimized to realize an efficient network. In this paper, we introduce the dragonfly topology which uses a group of high-radix routers as a virtual router to increase the effective radix of the network. With this organization, each minimally routed packet traverses at most one global channel. By reducing global channels, a dragonfly reduces cost by 20% compared to a flattened butterfly and by 52% compared to a folded Clos network in configurations with ≥ 16K nodes.We also introduce two new variants of global adaptive routing that enable load-balanced routing in the dragonfly. Each router in a dragonfly must make an adaptive routing decision based on the state of a global channel connected to a different router. Because of the indirect nature of this routing decision, conventional adaptive routing algorithms give degraded performance. We introduce the use of selective virtual-channel discrimination and the use of credit round-trip latency to both sense and signal channel congestion. The combination of these two methods gives throughput and latency that approaches that of an ideal adaptive routing algorithm.","1063-6897","978-0-7695-3174-8","10.1109/ISCA.2008.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4556717","interconnection networks;topology;dragonfly","Costs;Network topology;Routing;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Delay;Cables;Bandwidth;Optical network units;Optical sensors;Computer architecture","","409","23","33","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the problem of efficiently transmitting or sharing information from and among a vast number of distributed nodes remains a great challenge, primarily because we do not yet have well developed theories and tools for distributed signal processing, communications, and information theory in large-scale networked systems.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2007.914732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4472248","","Compressed sensing;Collaboration;Internet;Wireless sensor networks;Large-scale systems;Information retrieval;Source coding;Cellular phones;Sensor systems;Actuators","","409","7","30","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

These methods were developed for editing detailed high-resolution meshes like those produced by scanning real-world objects. The challenge of manipulating such complex surfaces is threefold: The deformation technique has to be sufficiently fast, robust, intuitive, and easy to control to be useful for interactive applications. An intuitive and, thus, predictable deformation tool should provide physically plausible and aesthetically pleasing surface deformations, which, in particular, requires its geometric details to be preserved. The methods that we survey generally formulate surface deformation as a global variational optimization problem that addresses the differential properties of the edited surface. Efficiency and robustness are achieved by linearizing the underlying objective functional such that the global optimization amounts to solving a sparse linear system of equations. We review the different deformation energies and detail preservation techniques that were proposed in recent years, together with the various techniques to rectify the linearization artifacts. Our goal is to provide the reader with a systematic classification and comparative description of the different techniques, revealing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in common editing scenarios.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.1054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359478","mesh editing;linear optimization;discrete differential operators;mesh editing;linear optimization;discrete differential operators","Linear systems;Deformable models;Robustness;Equations;Minimization methods;Robust control;Optimization methods;Active shape model;Solid modeling;Machinery","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Elasticity;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Linear Models;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","406","16","74","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the proposed methodology can reduce the features of the disturbance signal to a great extent without losing its original property, less memory space and learning PNN time are required for classification. Eleven types of disturbances are considered for the classification problem. The simulation results reveal that the combination of S-Transform and PNN can effectively detect and classify different PQ events.

However, the performance of this spatial filter depends on the operational frequency band of the EEG. Thus, setting a broad frequency range, or manually selecting a subject-specific frequency range, are commonly used with the CSP algorithm. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to perform autonomous selection of key temporal-spatial discriminative EEG characteristics. After the EEG measurements have been bandpass-filtered into multiple frequency bands, CSP features are extracted from each of these bands. A feature selection algorithm is then used to automatically select discriminative pairs of frequency bands and corresponding CSP features. A classification algorithm is subsequently used to classify the CSP features. A study is conducted to assess the performance of a selection of feature selection and classification algorithms for use with the FBCSP. Extensive experimental results are presented on a publicly available dataset as well as data collected from healthy subjects and unilaterally paralyzed stroke patients. The results show that FBCSP, using a particular combination feature selection and classification algorithm, yields relatively higher cross-validation accuracies compared to prevailing approaches.","2161-4407","978-1-4244-1820-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2008.4634130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4634130","","Classification algorithms;Filter bank;Filtering algorithms;Electroencephalography;Band pass filters;Gabor filters;Accuracy","","400","4","33","IEEE","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior research into this field has mostly been limited to theoretical considerations and case studies. More general work has usually focused either on external technology acquisition or on external technology exploitation. Accordingly, I take an integrated perspective and regard the two types of technology transactions as the main dimensions of a firm's strategic approach to open innovation. Drawing on these dimensions, I use data from a questionnaire-based study of 154 middle and large companies to identify groups of firms that pursue homogeneous strategies regarding open innovation. Accordingly, this analysis is the first large-scale study that describes the current state of open innovation in practice.

First, we present a thorough experimental study to show the superiority of the generalization capability of the support vector machine (SVM) approach in the automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. Second, we propose a novel classification system based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the generalization performance of the SVM classifier. For this purpose, we have optimized the SVM classifier design by searching for the best value of the parameters that tune its discriminant function, and upstream by looking for the best subset of features that feed the classifier. The experiments were conducted on the basis of ECG data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database to classify five kinds of abnormal waveforms and normal beats. In particular, they were organized so as to test the sensitivity of the SVM classifier and that of two reference classifiers used for comparison, i.e., the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network classifier, with respect to the curse of dimensionality and the number of available training beats. The obtained results clearly confirm the superiority of the SVM approach as compared to traditional classifiers, and suggest that further substantial improvements in terms of classification accuracy can be achieved by the proposed PSO-SVM classification system. On an average, over three experiments making use of a different total number of training beats (250, 500, and 750, respectively), the PSO-SVM yielded an overall accuracy of 89.72% on 40438 test beats selected from 20 patient records against 85.98%, 83.70%, and 82.34% for the SVM, the kNN, and the RBF classifiers, respectively.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2008.923147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4487050","Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification;feature detection;feature reduction;generalization capability;model selection issue;particle swarm optimization (PSO);support vector machine (SVM);ECG signal classification;feature detection;feature reduction;generalization capability;model selection issue;particle swarm optimization (PSO);support vector machine (SVM)","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Particle swarm optimization;Electrocardiography;Testing;Design optimization;Feeds;Hospitals;Spatial databases;Neural networks","Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Artificial Intelligence;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","396","","27","IEEE","11 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two-stage classifier is integrated with the mixed-band wavelet-chaos methodology, developed earlier by the authors, for accurate and robust classification of electroencephalogram (EEGs) into healthy, ictal, and interictal EEGs. A nine-parameter mixed-band feature space discovered in previous research for effective EEG representation is used as input to the two-stage classifier. In the first stage, PCA is employed for feature enhancement. The rearrangement of the input space along the principal components of the data improves the classification accuracy of the cosine radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) employed in the second stage significantly. The classification accuracy and robustness of the classifier are validated by extensive parametric and sensitivity analysis. The new wavelet-chaos-neural network methodology yields high EEG classification accuracy (96.6%) and is quite robust to changes in training data with a low standard deviation of 1.4%. For epilepsy diagnosis, when only normal and interictal EEGs are considered, the classification accuracy of the proposed model is 99.3%. This statistic is especially remarkable because even the most highly trained neurologists do not appear to be able to detect interictal EEGs more than 80% of the times.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.905490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4360124","Chaos;classification;electroencephalogram (EEG) subbands;epilepsy;radial basis function neural network;principal component analysis;wavelet;Epilepsy;Chaos;Wavelet;EEG Sub-bands;Classification;Radial Basis Function Neural Network;Principal Component Analysis","Radial basis function networks;Robustness;Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Biomedical engineering;Principal component analysis;Biomedical computing;Sensitivity analysis;Training data","Algorithms;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Expert Systems;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","395","1","18","IEEE","16 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our method handles blur due to defocus, slight camera motion, and inherent aspects of the imaging system. Our algorithm can be used to measure blur due to limited sensor resolution by estimating a sub-pixel, super-resolved PSF even for in-focus images. It operates by predicting a ldquosharprdquo version of a blurry input image and uses the two images to solve for a PSF.

Both network-induced delays and data packet dropouts have been taken into consideration in the controller design. The network-induced delays are assumed to have both an upper bound and a lower bound, which is more general than those used in the literature. The introduction of the lower bound is shown to be advantageous for reducing conservatism. Moreover, the controller design method is further extended to more general cases, where the system matrices of the physical plant contain parameter uncertainties, represented in either polytopic or norm-bounded frameworks.

The exchange of ""energy"" between the active subsystem and an inactive subsystem is characterized by cross-supply rates. Stability is reached when all supply rates can be made negative, as long as the total exchanged energy between the active subsystem and any inactive subsystems is finite in some sense. Two special forms of dissipativity, passivity and L 2 -gain, are addressed. For both cases, asymptotic stability is guaranteed under certain ""negative"" output feedback plus asymptotic zero state detectability.

The VS-Joint features a highly dynamic stiffness adjustment along with a mechanically programmable system behavior. This allows an easy adaption to a big variety of tasks.

The principle of compressed sensing ensures that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signal. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of sparsity as a prior for regularizing the otherwise ill-posed super-resolution problem.

The controller uses a standard model-based, adaptive control approach in order to learn the patient's abilities and assist in completing movements while remaining compliant. Assistance-as-needed is achieved by adding a novel force reducing term to the adaptive control law, which decays the force output from the robot when errors in task execution are small.

Then we provide a new estimation scheme that directly estimates the overall channels from the source to the destination. The proposed channel estimation well serves the AF based space time coding (STC) that was recently developed. There exists many differences between the proposed channel estimation and that in the traditional single input single out (SISO) and multiple input single output (MISO) systems. For example, a relay must linearly precode its received training sequence by a sophisticatedly designed matrix in order to minimize the channel estimation error. Besides, each relay node is individually constrained by a different power requirement because of the non-cooperation among all relay nodes. We study both the linear least-square (LS) estimator and the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) estimator. The corresponding optimal training sequences, as well as the optimal preceding matrices are derived from an efficient convex optimization process.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2008.070118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4524288","","Channel estimation;Power system relaying;Wireless communication;Transmitting antennas;Digital relays;Decoding;Throughput;Fading;Mobile antennas;Channel state information","","382","7","28","IEEE","20 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several collision tests were carried out, illustrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. While a subjective “safety” feeling is experienced by users when being able to naturally stop the robot in autonomous motion, a quantitative analysis of different reaction strategies was lacking.

"Compliant actuation of rehabilitation robots","H. Vallery; J. Veneman; E. van Asseldonk; R. Ekkelenkamp; M.

After illustrating the bandwidth limitations, a new result has been derived: if stability in terms of passivity of the haptic device is desired, the renderable stiffness is bounded by the stiffness of the SEA's elastic component. In practical experiments with the VMC, the aforementioned limitations affected the control performance. Desired gait modifications were not tracked exactly, because the subjects were able to deviate from the prescribed pattern even in the stiffest possible configuration. Despite the limitations, the practical experiments also demonstrated the general effectiveness of the realization. Manipulation of selected gait parameters is possible, whereby other parameters are left unaffected. This high selectivity is made possible by the low level of undesired interaction torques, which is achieved by elastic decoupling of motor mass and a lightweight exoskeleton. The discrepancy between theoretical bounds and rendered stiffness indicated that healthy subjects might represent a stabilizing component of the coupled system, which could be different for patients. In light of the theoretical stability analysis and with the focus on patients, the LOPES actuation was slightly modified. The robot was equipped with stiffer springs to obtain sufficient stiffness and to ensure stability without relying on stabilizing effects of the human. For this application, the disadvantages of compliant actuation can thus be tolerated or dealt with, and they are small compared with the advantages. Given that a rehabilitation robot, in the first place, is supposed to imitate therapist action, the limitations of bandwidth and stiffness do not pose severe problems. In contrast, safety and backdrivability are highly relevant, and they can be ensured easier with a compliant actuator. Therefore, we conclude that compliant actuation and a lightweight exoskeleton provide effective means to accomplish the desired AAN behavior of a rehabilitation robot. The next step is to evaluate the robot behavior, control performance, and therapeutic effectiveness in patient studies.","1558-223X","","10.1109/MRA.2008.927689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624584","series elastic actuators;gait training;passivity-based control;stroke;compliance;rehabilitation robots","Rehabilitation robotics;Bandwidth;Exoskeletons;Haptic interfaces;Couplings;Stability analysis;Springs;Humans;Safety;Actuators","","380","21","33","IEEE","12 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We consider both interference constraints for primary users and quality of service (QoS) constraints for secondary users. Specifically, interference from secondary users to primary users is constrained to be below a tolerable limit. Also, signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each secondary user is maintained higher than a desired level for QoS insurance. We propose admission control algorithms to be used during high network load conditions which are performed jointly with power control so that QoS requirements of all admitted secondary users are satisfied while keeping the interference to primary users below the tolerable limit. If all secondary users can be supported at minimum rates, we allow them to increase their transmission rates and share the spectrum in a fair manner. We formulate the joint power/rate allocation with proportional and max-min fairness criteria as optimization problems. We show how to transform these optimization problems into a convex form so that their globally optimal solutions can be obtained. Numerical results show that the proposed admission control algorithms achieve performance very close to that of the optimal solution. Also, impacts of different system and QoS parameters on the network performance are investigated for the admission control, and rate/power allocation algorithms under different fairness criteria.","1558-2248","","10.1109/T-WC.2008.070890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4723340","Cognitive radio, spectrum sharing, spectrum underlay;spectrum overlay, interference temperature limit;admission control, rate and power allocation.","Resource management;Cognitive radio;Quality of service;Interference constraints;Admission control;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless networks;Noise level;Insurance;Power control","","378","1","25","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, given a video recording of a talking person, we would like to estimate the 3D shape of the face at each instant, and learn a model of facial deformation. Time-varying shape is modeled as a rigid transformation combined with a non-rigid deformation. Reconstruction is ill-posed if arbitrary deformations are allowed, and thus additional assumptions about deformations are required. We first suggest restricting shapes to lie within a low-dimensional subspace, and describe estimation algorithms. However, this restriction alone is insufficient to constrain reconstruction. To address these problems, we propose a reconstruction method using a Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (PPCA) shape model, and an estimation algorithm that simultaneously estimates 3D shape and motion for each instant, learns the PPCA model parameters, and robustly fills-in missing data points. We then extend the model to model temporal dynamics in object shape, allowing the algorithm to robustly handle severe cases of missing data.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359359","Motion;Shape;Machine learning;3D/stereo scene analysis;Motion;Shape;Machine learning;3D/stereo scene analysis","Motion estimation;Shape;Image reconstruction;Principal component analysis;Tracking;Training data;Deformable models;Robustness;Animal structures;Cameras","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Statistical;Motion;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","374","3","35","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with other state-of-the-art greedy algorithms, the most innovative feature of the SAMP is its capability of signal reconstruction without prior information of the sparsity. This makes it a promising candidate for many practical applications when the number of non-zero (significant) coefficients of a signal is not available. The proposed algorithm adopts a similar flavor of the EM algorithm, which alternatively estimates the sparsity and the true support set of the target signals. In fact, SAMP provides a generalized greedy reconstruction framework in which the orthogonal matching pursuit and the subspace pursuit can be viewed as its special cases. Such a connection also gives us an intuitive justification of trade-offs between computational complexity and reconstruction performance.

A new digital circuit has been developed to amplify the time residue with a higher gain (>16) and larger range (>80 ps) than existing solutions do. However, adapting the conventional coarse-fine architecture from ADCs is not an appropriate solution for TDCs: input time cannot be stored, and the gain of a time amplifier (TA) cannot be controlled precisely. This paper proposes a new coarse-fine TDC architecture by using an array of time amplifiers and two identical fine TDCs that compensate for the variation of the TA gain during the conversion process. The measured DNL and INL are plusmn0.8 LSB and plusmn3 LSB, respectively, with a value of 1.25 ps per 1 LSB, while the standard deviation of output code for constant inputs remains below 1 LSB across the TDC range. Although the nonlinearity is larger than 1 LSB, using an INL lookup table or better matched delays in the coarse TDC delay chain will improve the linearity further.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2008.917405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476497","Coarse–fine architecture;open-loop residue amplification;subrange normalization;time amplifier;time-to-digital converter (TDC)","Analog-digital conversion;Phase locked loops;Delay lines;Linearity;Calibration;Phase noise;Signal resolution;Time measurement;Delay effects;Digital circuits","","368","28","14","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce the noise level function (NLF), which is a continuous function describing the noise level as a function of image brightness. We then estimate an upper bound of the real noise level function by fitting a lower envelope to the standard deviations of per-segment image variances. For denoising, the chrominance of color noise is significantly removed by projecting pixel values onto a line fit to the RGB values in each segment. Then, a Gaussian conditional random field (GCRF) is constructed to obtain the underlying clean image from the noisy input. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the proposed algorithm, which is shown to outperform state-of-the-art denoising algorithms.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359321","image denoising;piecewise smooth image model;segmentation-based computer vision algorithms;noise estimation;Gaussian conditional random field;automatic vision system;image denoising;piecewise smooth image model;segmentation-based computer vision algorithms;noise estimation;Gaussian conditional random field;automatic vision system","Additive white noise;Colored noise;Gaussian noise;AWGN;Noise level;Noise reduction;Image denoising;Charge coupled devices;Digital cameras;Brightness","","366","15","57","IEEE","18 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we are looking into assigning the incoming tasks to machines of a data center in such a way so as to affect the heat recirculation and make cooling more efficient. Using a low complexity linear heat recirculation model, we formulate the problem of minimizing the peak inlet temperature within a data center through task assignment, consequently leading to minimal cooling power consumption. We also provide two methods to solve the formulation, one that uses a genetic algorithm and the other that uses sequential quadratic programming. We show through formalization that minimizing the peak inlet temperature allows for the lowest cooling power needs. Results from a simulated, small-scale data center show that solving the formulation leads to an inlet temperature distribution that is 2 °C to 5 °C lower compared to other approaches, and achieves about 20%-30% cooling energy savings at moderate data center utilization rates.

For such a network, assuming that the second-order statistics of the channel coefficients are available, we study two different beamforming design approaches. As the first approach, we design the beamformer through minimization of the total transmit power subject to the receiver quality of service constraint. We show that this approach yields a closed-form solution. In the second approach, the beamforming weights are obtained through maximizing the receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) subject to two different types of power constraints, namely the total transmit power constraint and individual relay power constraints. We show that the total power constraint leads to a closed-form solution while the individual relay power constraints result in a quadratic programming optimization problem. The later optimization problem does not have a closed-form solution. However, it is shown that using semidefinite relaxation, this problem can be turned into a convex feasibility semidefinite programming (SDP), and therefore, can be efficiently solved using interior point methods. Furthermore, we develop a simplified, thus suboptimal, technique which is computationally more efficient than the SDP approach. In fact, the simplified algorithm provides the beamforming weight vector in a closed form. Our numerical examples show that as the uncertainty in the channel state information is increased, satisfying the quality of service constraint becomes harder, i.e., it takes more power to satisfy these constraints. Also our simulation results show that when compared to the SDP-based method, our simplified technique suffers a 2-dB loss in SNR for low to moderate values of transmit power.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.925945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4527195","Convex feasibility problem;distributed beamforming;distributed signal processing;relay networks;semidefinite programming;Distributed beamforming;relay networks;semi-definite programming;convex feasibility problem;distributed signal processing","Array signal processing;Relays;Statistical distributions;Channel state information;Closed-form solution;Quality of service;Wireless networks;Transmitters;Signal to noise ratio;Quadratic programming","","364","","25","IEEE","23 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional optimization methods assume generator cost curves to be continuous and monotonically increasing, but modern generators have a variety of nonlinearities in their cost curves making this assumption inaccurate, and the resulting approximate dispatches cause a lot of revenue loss. Evolutionary methods like particle swarm optimization perform better for such problems as no convexity assumptions are imposed, but these methods converge to sub-optimum solutions prematurely, particularly for multimodal problems. To handle the problem of premature convergence, this paper proposes to apply a novel self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimization (SOH_PSO) for the nonconvex economic dispatch (NCED). The performance further improves when time-varying acceleration coefficients are included.

Moreover, since both main and auxiliary switches can be turned on with zero-voltage switching, switching loss can be reduced, and conversion efficiency therefore can be improved significantly.

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Intrusion detection;Data security;Data mining;Information security;Encoding;Knowledge based systems;Training data;Pattern matching;Detection algorithms;Cryptography","","363","2","39","IEEE","19 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm combines a novel channel matrix ordering with a search through a very small subset of the complete transmit constellation. A geometrically-based method is used to study the effect the proposed ordering has on the statistics of the MIMO channel. Using those results, a generalization is given for the structure this subset needs to follow in order to achieve quasi-maximum likelihood (ML) performance.

The proposed structure consists of two antenna elements and a coupling element which is located in between the two antenna elements. The idea is to use field cancellation to enhance isolation by putting a coupling element which artificially creates an additional coupling path between the antenna elements. To validate the idea, a design for a USB dongle MIMO antenna for the 2.4 GHz WLAN band is presented. In this design, the antenna elements are etched on a compact low-cost FR4 PCB board with dimensions of 20times40times1.6 mm3. According to our measurement results, we can achieve more than 30 dB isolation between the antenna elements even though the two parallel individual planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) in the design share a solid ground plane with inter-antenna spacing (Center to Center) of less than 0.095 lambdao or edge to edge separations of just 3.6 mm (0.0294 lambdao). Both simulation and measurement results are used to confirm the antenna isolation and performance. The method can also be applied to different types of antennas such as non-planar antennas. Parametric studies and current distribution for the design are also included to show how to tune the structure and control the isolation.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2008.2005460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685877","Diversity antennas;multiple input and multiple output (MIMO);mutual coupling;planar inverted F antenna (PIFA);wireless communications","MIMO;Antenna measurements;Solids;Mutual coupling;Antenna arrays;Receiving antennas;Antenna feeds;Antennas and propagation;Frequency;Universal Serial Bus","","359","10","24","IEEE","21 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, energy constrained applications, where performance requirements are secondary, benefit significantly from an SRAM that offers read and write functionality at the lowest possible voltage. However, bit-cells and architectures achieving very high density conventionally fail to operate at low voltages. This paper describes a high density SRAM in 65 nm CMOS that uses an 8T bit-cell to achieve a minimum operating voltage of 350 mV. Buffered read is used to ensure read stability, and peripheral control of both the bit-cell supply voltage and the read-buffer's foot voltage enable sub- $V_{t}$ write and read without degrading the bit-cell's density. The plaguing area-offset tradeoff in modern sense-amplifiers is alleviated using redundancy, which reduces read errors by a factor of five compared to device up-sizing. At its lowest operating voltage, the entire 256 kb SRAM consumes 2.2 $\mu$W in leakage power.

It is shown that if the dc offset of the baseband signal is accurately calibrated, both demodulation techniques can be used for random body movement cancellation. While the complex signal demodulation is less likely to be affected by a dc offset, the arctangent demodulation has the advantage of eliminating harmonic and intermodulation interference at high carrier frequencies. When the dc offset cannot be accurately calibrated, the complex signal demodulation is more favorable. Ray-tracing model is used to show the effects of constellation deformation and optimum/null detection ambiguity caused by the phase offset due to finite antenna directivity.

This is achieved bycombining inertial measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with visual observations from a camera under the assumption that the rigid transformation between the two sensors is known. Errors in the IMU-camera extrinsic calibration process cause biases that reduce the estimation accuracy and can even lead to divergence of any estimator processing the measurements from both sensors. In this paper, we present an extended Kalman filter for precisely determining the unknown transformation between a camera and an IMU. Contrary to previous approaches, we explicitly account for the time correlation of the IMU measurements and provide a figure of merit (covariance) for the estimated transformation. The proposed method does not require any special hardware (such as spin table or 3-D laser scanner) except a calibration target. Furthermore, we employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives and prove that the nonlinear system describing the IMU-camera calibration process is observable. Simulation and experimental results are presented that validate the proposed method and quantify its accuracy.

Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite.

The proposed algorithms are evaluated through eight benchmark classification problems and two real-world application problems, a plant species identification task involving 50 plant species and a palmprint recognition task. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is feasible and efficient for the structure optimization of the RBPNN.

The first goal is to find a good tradeoff between good grasping capabilities and low attention required by the user to complete grasping tasks, without addressing advanced algorithm for electromyographic processing. The second goal is to understand whether a vibrotactile feedback system is subjectively or objectively useful and how it changes users' performance. Experiments showed that users were able to successfully operate the device in the three control strategies, and that the grasp success increased with more interactive control. Practice has proven that when too much effort is required, subjects do not do their best, preferring, instead, a less-interactive control strategy. Moreover, the experiments showed that when grasping tasks are performed under visual control, the enhanced proprioception offered by a vibrotactile system is practically not exploited.

The second protocol considers sequential transmissions from the two users followed by a transmission from the relay while the third protocol is a hybrid of the first two protocols and has four phases. In the latter two protocols the bounds are not identical. Numerical evaluation shows that in some cases of interest our bounds do not differ significantly. Finally, in the Gaussian case with path loss, we derive achievable rates and compare the relative merits of each protocol. This case is of interest in cellular systems.

In this paper, we present inner and outer bounds on secrecy capacity regions for these two communication systems. The derived outer bounds have an identical mutual information expression that applies to both channel models. The difference is in the input distributions over which the expression is optimized. The inner bound rate regions are achieved by random binning techniques. For the broadcast channel, a double-binning coding scheme allows for both joint encoding and preserving of confidentiality. Furthermore, we show that, for a special case of the interference channel, referred to as the switch channel, derived bounds meet. Finally, we describe several transmission schemes for Gaussian interference channels and derive their achievable rate regions while ensuring mutual information-theoretic secrecy.

The position and orientation of the boat are measured using a camera that detects two infrared diodes attached near the front and back ends of the boat. A computer with a capture card processes the camera image to determine the position, calculates the control forces and their corresponding input voltages, and sends the control signals to wireless receivers on the vessel using a wireless transmitter.

Lane-change maneuvers have been used to move into or out of a circulation lane or platoon; however, overtaking operations have not received much coverage in the literature. In this paper, we present an overtaking system for autonomous vehicles equipped with path-tracking and lane-change capabilities.

This is the discrete analogue of recent continuous Euclidean nonlocal regularization functionals. The proposed formulation leads to a family of simple and fast nonlinear processing methods based on the weighted -Laplace operator, parameterized by the degree of regularity, the graph structure and the graph weight function. These discrete processing methods provide a graph-based version of recently proposed semi-local or nonlocal processing methods used in image and mesh processing, such as the bilateral filter, the TV digital filter or the nonlocal means filter.

When the desired object information is known, this task can be achieved by finding the bands that contain the most information about these objects. When the desired object information is unknown, i.e., unsupervised band selection, the objective is to select the most distinctive and informative bands. It is expected that these bands can provide an overall satisfactory detection and classification performance.

As a target impedance, a desired stiffness and damping are considered without inertia shaping. For this problem, two controllers of different complexity are proposed. Both have a cascaded structure with an inner torque feedback loop and an outer impedance controller. For the torque feedback, a physical interpretation as a scaling of the motor inertia is given, which allows to incorporate the torque feedback into a passivity-based analysis. The outer impedance control law is then designed differently for the two controllers. In the first approach, the stiffness and damping terms and the gravity compensation term are designed separately. This outer control loop uses only the motor position and velocity, but no noncollocated feedback of the joint torques or link side positions. In combination with the physical interpretation of torque feedback, this allows us to give a proof of the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system based on the passivity properties of the system. The second control law is a refinement of this approach, in which the gravity compensation and the stiffness implementation are designed in a combined way. Thereby, a desired static stiffness relationship is obtained exactly. Additionally, some extensions of the controller to viscoelastic joints and to Cartesian impedance control are given. Finally, some experiments with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) lightweight robots verify the developed controllers and show the efficiency of the proposed control approach.

The success of such research may bring in many innovative HCI tools used for the applications of human-centered multimedia communication. Due to the temporal property of age progression, face images with aging features may display some sequential patterns with low-dimensional distributions. In this paper, we demonstrate that such aging patterns can be effectively extracted from a discriminant subspace learning algorithm and visualized as distinct manifold structures. Through the manifold method of analysis on face images, the dimensionality redundancy of the original image space can be significantly reduced with subspace learning. A multiple linear regression procedure, especially with a quadratic model function, can be facilitated by the low dimensionality to represent the manifold space embodying the discriminative property.

A simplified analytical approach based on torque-slip characteristics is first proposed to quantify the effect of the STATCOM and the SVC on the transient stability margin. Results from experiments with a STATCOM and a 7.5 kW induction machine emulating a wind turbine are used to validate the suggested analytical approach. Further verifications based on detailed time-domain simulations are also provided. Calculations, simulations and measurements confirm how the increased STATCOM rating can provide an increased transient stability margin and thus enhanced LVRT capability. Compared to the SVC, the STATCOM gives a larger contribution to the transient margin as indicated by both calculations and simulations. The inaccuracies introduced by neglecting the flux transients in the suggested approach are discussed and found reasonable for an estimation method when considering the simplicity compared to detailed time-domain simulation studies.

Through experimentation, it is shown that the mixture of dynamic textures is a suitable representation for both the appearance and dynamics of a variety of visual processes that have traditionally been challenging for computer vision (for example, fire, steam, water, vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and so forth). When compared with state-of-the-art methods in motion segmentation, including both temporal texture methods and traditional representations (for example, optical flow or other localized motion representations), the mixture of dynamic textures achieves superior performance in the problems of clustering and segmenting video of such processes.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359353","Dynamic texture;temporal textures;video modeling;video clustering;motion segmentation;mixture models;linear dynamical systems;time-series clustering;Kalman filter;probabilistic models;expectation-maximization;Dynamic texture;temporal textures;video modeling;video clustering;motion segmentation;mixture models;linear dynamical systems;time-series clustering;Kalman filter;probabilistic models;expectation-maximization","Vehicle dynamics;Computer vision;Video sequences;Machine learning;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Linear systems;Control theory;Fires;Marine vehicles","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Likelihood Functions;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Video Recording","340","1","64","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most widely used radio synthesis deconvolution method is the CLEAN algorithm of Hogbom. This algorithm works extremely well for collections of point sources and surprisingly well for extended objects. However, the performance for extended objects can be improved by adopting a multiscale approach. We describe and demonstrate a conceptually simple and algorithmically straightforward extension to CLEAN that models the sky brightness by the summation of components of emission having different size scales. While previous multiscale algorithms work sequentially on decreasing scale sizes, our algorithm works simultaneously on a range of specified scales.

Many of the distributed generations are set up in the vicinity of the customer, with the advantage that this decreases transmission losses. However, output power generated from natural energy, such as wind power, photovoltaics, etc., which is distributed generation, is influenced by meteorological conditions. Therefore, when the distributed generation increases by conventional control techniques, it is expected that the voltage change of each node becomes a problem. Proposed in this paper is the optimal control of distribution voltage with coordination of distributed installations, such as the load ratio control transformer, step voltage regulator (SVR), shunt capacitor, shunt reactor, and static var compensator. In this research, SVR is assumed to be a model with tap changing where the signal is received from a central control unit. Moreover, the communication infrastructure in the supply of a distribution system is assumed to be widespread. The genetic algorithm is used to determine the operation of this control. In order to confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulations are carried out for a distribution network model with distributed generation (photovoltaic generation).","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2007.908816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374135","Centralized control;coordinated control;distribution system;genetic algorithm (GA);voltage/reactive power control","Voltage control;Distributed control;Communication system control;Distributed power generation;Power generation;Photovoltaic cells;Optimal control;Shunt (electrical);Cogeneration;Global warming","","339","2","15","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In principle, publish- subscribe is particularly useful in mobile environments, since it minimizes the coupling among communication parties. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the (few) works that tackled publish-subscribe in mobile environments has yet addressed intermittently-connected human networks. Socially-related people tend to be co-located quite regularly. This characteristic can be exploited to drive forwarding decisions in the interest-based routing layer supporting the publish-subscribe network, yielding not only improved performance but also the ability to overcome high rates of mobility and long-lasting disconnections. In this paper we propose SocialCast, a routing framework for publish-subscribe that exploits predictions based on metrics of social interaction (e.g., patterns of movements among communities) to identify the best information carriers. We highlight the principles underlying our protocol, illustrate its operation, and evaluate its performance using a mobility model based on a social network validated with real human mobility traces. The evaluation shows that prediction of colocation and node mobility allow for maintaining a very high and steady event delivery with low overhead and latency, despite the variation in density, number of replicas per message or speed.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530732","","Routing;Publish-subscribe;Mobile ad hoc networks;Humans;Advertising;Mobile communication;Drives;Protocols;Social network services;Delay","","339","7","39","IEEE","23 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ever-growing number of possible applications and, in particular, the ever-increasing problem sizes now addressed lead to new challenges in terms of computational strategies and the development of fast and efficient algorithms has become paramount. Recently, very fast algorithms have been developed to solve convex optimization problems that are often used to approximate the sparse approximation problem; however, it has also been shown, that in certain circumstances, greedy strategies, such as orthogonal matching pursuit, can have better performance than the convex methods. In this paper, improvements to greedy strategies are proposed and algorithms are developed that approximate orthogonal matching pursuit with computational requirements more akin to matching pursuit. Three different directional optimization schemes based on the gradient, the conjugate gradient, and an approximation to the conjugate gradient are discussed, respectively. It is shown that the conjugate gradient update leads to a novel implementation of orthogonal matching pursuit, while the gradient-based approach as well as the approximate conjugate gradient methods both lead to fast approximations to orthogonal matching pursuit, with the approximate conjugate gradient method being superior to the gradient method.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.916124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4480155","Conjugate gradient optimization;gradient optimization;matching pursuit (MP);orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP);sparse representations/approximations","Matching pursuit algorithms;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Pursuit algorithms;Gradient methods;Dictionaries;Source separation;Noise reduction;Bayesian methods;Approximation algorithms","","339","3","34","IEEE","16 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pin limitations, the energy cost of electrical signaling, and the non-scalability of chip-length global wires are significant bandwidth impediments. Recent developments in silicon nanophotonic technology have the potential to meet these off- and on-stack bandwidth requirements at acceptable power levels. Corona is a 3 D many-core architecture that uses nanophotonic communication for both inter-core communication and off-stack communication to memory or I/O devices.

A fundamental challenge for realizing such a system is to ensure the quality of service (QoS) of the PUs as well as to maximize the throughput or ensure the QoS, such as signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs), of the secondary users (SUs). In this paper, we study single-input multiple output multiple access channels (SIMO-MAC) for the CR network. Subject to interference constraints for the PUs as well as peak power constraints for the SUs, two optimization problems involving a joint beamforming and power allocation for the CR network are considered: the sum-rate maximization problem and the SINR balancing problem. For the sum-rate maximization problem, zero-forcing based decision feedback equalizers are used to decouple the SIMO-MAC, and a capped multi-level (CML) water-filling algorithm is proposed to maximize the achievable sum-rate of the SUs for the single PU case. When multiple PUs exist, a recursive decoupled power allocation algorithm is proposed to derive the optimal power allocation solution. For the SINR balancing problem, it is shown that, using linear minimum mean-square-error receivers, each of the interference constraints and peak power constraints can be completely decoupled, and thus the multi-constraint optimization problem can be solved through multiple single-constraint sub-problems. Theoretical analysis for the proposed algorithms is presented, together with numerical simulations which compare the performances of different power allocation schemes.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413139","","Array signal processing;Cognitive radio;Interference constraints;Chromium;Quality of service;Signal to noise ratio;Constraint optimization;Radio spectrum management;Throughput;Decision feedback equalizers","","332","1","24","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This algorithm separates the effects of the irradiation change from the effect of the tracker's perturbation and uses this information to optimize the tracking according to the irradiation change. The knowledge of the direction of the irradiation change enables the MPPT to use different optimized tracking schemes for the different cases of increasing, decreasing, or steady irradiance. When the irradiance is changing rapidly this strategy leads to faster and better tracking, while in steady-state conditions it leads to lower oscillations around the MPP.

Our descriptor is inspired from earlier ones such as SIFT and GLOH but can be computed much faster for our purposes. Unlike SURF which can also be computed efficiently at every pixel, it does not introduce artifacts that degrade the matching performance.

Until this date, while almost all fabrication efforts have been directed toward multiwalled CNT (MWCNT) interconnects, there is a lack of MWCNT modeling work. This paper presents, for the first time, a detailed investigation of MWCNT-based interconnect performance. A compact equivalent circuit model of MWCNTs is presented for the first time, and the performance of MWCNT interconnects is evaluated and compared against traditional Cu interconnects, as well as Single-Walled CNT (SWCNT)-based interconnects, at different interconnect levels (local, intermediate, and global) for future technology nodes. It is shown that at the intermediate and global levels, MWCNT interconnects can achieve smaller signal delay than that of Cu interconnects, and the improvements become more significant with technology scaling and increasing wire lengths. At 1000- global or 500- intermediate level interconnects, the delay of MWCNT interconnects can reach as low as 15% of Cu interconnect delay. It is also shown that in order for SWCNT bundles to outperform MWCNT interconnects, dense and high metallic-fraction SWCNT bundles are necessary. On the other hand, since MWCNTs are easier to fabricate with less concern about the chirality and density control, they can be attractive for immediate use as horizontal wires in VLSI, including local, intermediate, and global level interconnects.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2008.922855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4527062","Carbon nanotube (CNT);circuit model;interconnect;multi-walled CNT (MWCNT);performance analysis;signal delay;single-walled CNT (SWCNT)","Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit modeling;Analytical models;Resistance;Contact resistance;Performance analysis;Delays","","324","1","36","IEEE","20 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the framework, sensing/communication is described mathematically by a time-varying matrix whose dimension is equal to the number of dynamical systems in the group and whose elements assume piecewise-constant and binary values. Dynamical systems are generally heterogeneous and can be transformed into a canonical form of different, arbitrary, but finite relative degrees. Utilizing a set of new results on augmentation of irreducible matrices and on lower triangulation of reducible matrices, the framework allows a designer to study how a general local-and-output-feedback cooperative control can determine group behaviors of the dynamical systems and to see how changes of sensing/communication would impact the group behaviors over time. A necessary and sufficient condition on convergence of a multiplicative sequence of reducible row-stochastic (diagonally positive) matrices is explicitly derived, and through simple choices of a gain matrix in the cooperative control law, the overall closed-loop system is shown to exhibit cooperative behaviors (such as single group behavior, multiple group behaviors, adaptive cooperative behavior for the group, and cooperative formation including individual behaviors). Examples, including formation control of nonholonomic systems in the chained form, are used to illustrate the proposed framework.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2008.920232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4522625","Consensus;cooperative control;cooperative controllability;formation control;high-order dynamical systems;matrix theory;networked systems;time-varying sensing/communication","Control systems;Remotely operated vehicles;Mobile robots;Communication system control;Robot kinematics;Time varying systems;Sufficient conditions;Robot sensing systems;Senior members;Convergence","","324","","48","IEEE","16 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present in this paper a method to automatically detect the position of the OD in digital retinal fundus images. The method starts by normalizing luminosity and contrast through out the image using illumination equalization and adaptive histogram equalization methods respectively. The OD detection algorithm is based on matching the expected directional pattern of the retinal blood vessels. Hence, a simple matched filter is proposed to roughly match the direction of the vessels at the OD vicinity. The retinal vessels are segmented using a simple and standard 2-D Gaussian matched filter. Consequently, a vessels direction map of the segmented retinal vessels is obtained using the same segmentation algorithm. The segmented vessels are then thinned, and filtered using local intensity, to represent finally the OD-center candidates. The difference between the proposed matched filter resized into four different sizes, and the vessels' directions at the surrounding area of each of the OD-center candidates is measured. The minimum difference provides an estimate of the OD-center coordinates. The proposed method was evaluated using a subset of the STARE project's dataset, containing 81 fundus images of both normal and diseased retinas, and initially used by literature OD detection methods. The OD-center was detected correctly in 80 out of the 81 images (98.77%).

The salient-pole rotor machines, where magnetic saturation plays a key role, still pose notable problems in flux, rotor position and speed estimations for motion-sensorless control, especially in the low-speed range (below 30 rpm in general), leading to numerous dedicated state observers. This letter introduces a rather novel (or generalization) concept-active flux or torque-producing flux-and its utilization in all ac drives by employing a unified state observer for motion-sensorless control in a wide speed range. The active-flux concept turns all salient-pole traveling field machines into nonsalient-pole ones. The active-flux vector is aligned to the rotor d axis for all synchronous machines and to the rotor-flux vector axis for induction machines. This way, the rotor position and speed observer seems more amenable to a wide speed range, with smaller dynamic errors. This observer, based on the active-flux concept, is pretty much the same for all ac drives. An example of implementation for an interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor with weak permanent magnets and large magnetic saliency that compares very favorably with respect to most signal injection methods, down to 1 rpm and up to 4000 rpm, is provided through digital simulations.

The aim of this paper is to obtain the key device characteristics of SiC MOSFETs so that their realistic application prospect can be provided. In particular, the emphasis is on obtaining their losses in various operation conditions from the extensive characterization study and a proposed behavioral SPICE model. Using the validated MOSFET SPICE model, a 20-kHz 370-W dc/dc boost converter based on a 10-kV 4H-SiC DMOSFET and diodes is designed and experimentally demonstrated. In the steady state of the boost converter, the total power loss in the 15.45-mm2 SiC MOSFET is 23.6 W for the input power of 428 W. The characterization study of the experimental SiC MOSFET and the experiment of the SiC MOSFET-based boost converter indicate that the turn-on losses of SiC MOSFETs are the dominant factors in determining their maximum operation frequency in hard-switched circuits with conventional thermal management. Replacing a 10-kV SiC PiN diode with a 10-kV SiC JBS diode as a boost diode and using a small external gate resistor, the turn-on loss of the SiC MOSFET can be reduced, and the 10-kV 5-A SiC MOSFET-based boost converter is predicted to be capable of a 20-kHz operation with a 5-kV dc output voltage and a 1.25-kW output power by the PSpice simulation with the MOSFET model. The low losses and fast switching speed of 10-kV SiC MOSFETs shown in the characterization study and the preliminary demonstration of the boost converter make them attractive in high-frequency high-voltage power-conversion applications.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2008.926650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4578891","Converter;high frequency;loss;model;MOSFET;silicon carbide (SiC)","","","323","6","25","IEEE","25 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

GSSK modulation inherently exploits fading in wireless communication to provide better performance over conventional amplitude/phase modulation (APM) techniques. In GSSK, only the antenna indices, and not the symbols themselves (as in the case of SM and APM), relay information. We exploit GSSKpsilas degrees of freedom to achieve better performance, which is done by formulating its constellation in an optimal manner. To support our results, we also derive upper bounds on GSSKpsilas bit error probability, where the source of GSSKpsilas strength is made clear. Analytical and simulation results show performance gains (1.5-3 dB) over popular multiple antenna APM systems (including Bell Laboratories layered space time (BLAST) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) schemes), making GSSK an excellent candidate for future wireless applications.","2166-9589","978-1-4244-2643-0","10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4699782","","MIMO;Samarium;Phase modulation;Amplitude modulation;Fading;Wireless communication;Relays;Upper bound;Error probability;Performance analysis","","321","1","9","IEEE","8 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Algorithms based on the differentiated ECG are computationally efficient and hence ideal for real-time analysis of large datasets. Here, we analyze traditional first-derivative based squaring function (Hamilton-Tompkins) and Hilbert transform-based methods for QRS detection and their modifications with improved detection thresholds. On a standard ECG dataset, the Hamilton-Tompkins algorithm had the highest detection accuracy (99.68% sensitivity, 99.63% positive predictivity) but also the largest time error. The modified Hamilton-Tompkins algorithm as well as the Hilbert transform-based algorithms had comparable, though slightly lower, accuracy; yet these automated algorithms present an advantage for real-time applications by avoiding human intervention in threshold determination. The high accuracy of the Hilbert transform-based method compared to detection with the second derivative of the ECG is ascribable to its inherently uniform magnitude spectrum. For all algorithms, detection errors occurred mainly in beats with decreased signal slope, such as wide arrhythmic beats or attenuated beats. For best performance, a combination of the squaring function and Hilbert transform-based algorithms can be applied such that differences in detection will point to abnormalities in the signal that can be further analyzed.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2007.912658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432721","Electrocardiography;heart rate variability;Hilbert transform;peak detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Detection algorithms;Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Heart rate detection;Data analysis;Signal analysis;Humans;Performance analysis;Data mining","Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","320","2","27","IEEE","16 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, using agile parsing it provides user-specified flexible pretty- printing to remove noise, standardize formatting and break program statements into parts such that potential changes can be detected as simple linewise text differences. Second, it provides efficient flexible extraction of potential clones to be compared using island grammars and agile parsing to select granularities and enumerate potential clones. Third, using transformation rules it provides flexible code normalization to allow for local editing differences between similar code segments and filtering out of uninteresting parts of potential clones. In this paper we introduce the theory and practice of the framework and demonstrate its use in finding function clones in C code.

However, to date, the inherent nature of this desirable feature has not been investigated in detail. Thus, a typical three-phase FSPM motor with 12 stator teeth and ten rotor poles is considered. It is found that, since there is a significant difference in the magnetic flux paths associated with the coils of each phase, this results in harmonics in the coil back EMF waveforms being cancelled, resulting in essentially sinusoidal phase back EMF waveforms.

Such systems often result from the discretization of nonlinear partial differential equations. A projection-based model reduction framework is used where projection spaces are inferred from proper orthogonal decompositions of data-dependent correlation operators. The key contribution of the MPE method is to perform online computations efficiently by computing Galerkin projections over a restricted subset of the spatial domain. Quantitative criteria for optimally selecting such a spatial subset are proposed and the resulting optimization problem is solved using an efficient heuristic method. The effectiveness of the MPE method is demonstrated by applying it to a nonlinear computational fluid dynamic model of an industrial glass furnace. For this example, the Galerkin projection can be computed using only 25% of the spatial grid points without compromising the accuracy of the reduced model.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2008.2006102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4668528","Model reduction;parameter-varying systems;proper orthogonal decomposition;time-varying systems","Reduced order systems;Large-scale systems;Partial differential equations;Moment methods;Optimization methods;Computational fluid dynamics;Computational modeling;Computer industry;Glass industry;Glass manufacturing","","318","","45","IEEE","7 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Innovative solutions with HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) and FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) have the potential to cope with the new challenges. New power electronic technologies with self-commutated converters provide advanced technical features, such as independent control of active and reactive power, the capability to supply weak or passive networks and less space requirements.

These generators are both grid-connected and stand-alone applications. We present an overview of the essential research results. The paper concentrates on the operation and modeling of stand-alone power systems with PV power generators. Systems with PV array-inverter assemblies, operating in the slave-and-master modes, are discussed, and the simulation results obtained using a renewable energy power system modular simulator are presented. These results demonstrate that simulation is an essential step in the system development process and that PV power generators constitute a valuable energy source. They have the ability to balance the energy and supply good power quality. It is demonstrated that when PV array- inverters are operating in the master mode in stand-alone applications, they well perform the task of controlling the voltage and frequency of the power system. The mechanism of switching the master function between the diesel generator and the PV array-inverter assembly in a stand-alone power system is also proposed and analyzed. Finally, some experimental results on a practical system are compared to the simulation results and confirm the usefulness of the proposed approach to the development of renewable energy systems with PV power generators.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.920583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470592","Autonomous power systems;master/slave inverter operation;photovoltaic (PV) systems;power system modeling and simulation;Photovoltaic (PV) systems;autonomous power systems;master/slave inverter operation;power system modeling and simulation","Renewable energy resources;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Power generation;Power system modeling;Power system simulation;Assembly systems;Power system analysis computing;Photovoltaic cells;Manufacturing","","317","","17","IEEE","24 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A provably fastest model verification strategy is designed for the (theoretical) situation when the contamination of data by outliers is known. In this case, the algorithm is the fastest possible (on average) of all randomized \\RANSAC algorithms guaranteeing a confidence in the solution. The derivation of the optimality property is based on Wald's theory of sequential decision making, in particular a modified sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Next, the R-RANSAC with SPRT algorithm is introduced. The algorithm removes the requirement for a priori knowledge of the fraction of outliers and estimates the quantity online. We show experimentally that on standard test data the method has performance close to the theoretically optimal and is 2 to 10 times faster than standard RANSAC and is up to 4 times faster than previously published methods.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359381","G.3.m Robust regression;I.4.1.b Imaging geometry;G.3.m Robust regression;I.4.1.b Imaging geometry","Contamination;Decision making;Standards publication;Testing;Sequential analysis;Robustness;Computer vision;Cost function;Performance evaluation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software","317","1","16","IEEE","20 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. The airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres.

Ethernet network interface controllers (NICs) in the US alone consume hundreds of millions of US dollars in electricity per year. Most Ethernet links are underutilized and link energy consumption can be reduced by operating at a lower data rate. In this paper, we investigate adaptive link rate (ALR) as a means of reducing the energy consumption of a typical Ethernet link by adaptively varying the link data rate in response to utilization. Policies to determine when to change the link data rate are studied. Simple policies that use output buffer queue length thresholds and fine-grain utilization monitoring are shown to be effective. A Markov model of a state-dependent service rate queue with rate transitions only at service completion is used to evaluate the performance of ALR with respect to the mean packet delay, the time spent in an energy-saving low link data rate, and the oscillation of link data rates. Simulation experiments using actual and synthetic traffic traces show that an Ethernet link with ALR can operate at a lower data rate for over 80 percent of the time, yielding significant energy savings with only a very small increase in packet delay.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2007.70836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378356","Power management;energy-aware systems;local-area networks;Ethernet;Energy Efficient Ethernet;Power management;energy-aware systems;local-area networks;Ethernet;Energy Efficient Ethernet","Delay;Oscillators;Internet;Adaptation model;Electricity;Numerical models;Switches;Data models;Computational modeling","","316","9","38","IEEE","26 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This will complicate short-term load forecasting and challenge the existing forecasting methods that are applied to a fixed-price environment. In regard to the influence of real-time electricity prices on short-term load, a model to forecast short-term load is established by combining the radial basis function (RBF) neural network with the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The model first makes use of the nonlinear approaching capacity of the RBF network to forecast the load on the prediction day with no account of the factor of electricity price, and then, based on the recent changes of the real-time price, it uses the ANFIS system to adjust the results of load forecasting obtained by RBF network. This system integration will improve forecasting accuracy and overcome the defects of the RBF network. As shown in this paper by the results of an example of factual forecasting, the model presented can work effectively.

In this paper we propose a low-power maximum power point tracker (MPPT) circuit specifically designed for wireless sensor nodes (hence effective, flexible, low cost and power-aware), i.e., a power transferring circuit for optimally conveying solar energy into rechargeable batteries even in not optimal weather conditions. High efficiency is granted by an ad hoc adaptive algorithm which, by keeping the MPPT electronics in its optimal working point, maximizes energy transfer from the solar cell to the batteries.

The design objective is to maximize the throughput of a secondary user while limiting the probability of colliding with primary users. Integrated in the joint design are three basic components: a spectrum sensor that identifies spectrum opportunities, a sensing strategy that determines which channels in the spectrum to sense, and an access strategy that decides whether to access based on potentially erroneous sensing outcomes. This joint design is formulated as a constrained partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and a separation principle is established. The separation principle reveals the optimality of myopic policies for the design of the spectrum sensor and the access strategy, leading to closed-form optimal solutions. Furthermore, it decouples the design of the sensing strategy from that of the spectrum sensor and the access strategy, and reduces the constrained POMDP to an unconstrained one. Numerical examples are provided to study the tradeoff between sensing time and transmission time, the interaction between the physical layer spectrum sensor and the MAC layer sensing and access strategies, and the robustness of the ensuing design to model mismatch.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2008.920248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4494711","Cognitive radio;opportunistic spectrum access;partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)","Signal processing;Throughput;Physical layer;Laboratories;Availability;Robustness;Military computing;Conferences;Wireless communication;Limiting","","313","2","27","IEEE","22 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel framework, called Riemannian manifold learning (RML), based on the assumption that the input high-dimensional data lie on an intrinsically low-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The main idea is to formulate the dimensionality reduction problem as a classical problem in Riemannian geometry, that is, how to construct coordinate charts for a given Riemannian manifold? We implement the Riemannian normal coordinate chart, which has been the most widely used in Riemannian geometry, for a set of unorganized data points. First, two input parameters (the neighborhood size k and the intrinsic dimension d) are estimated based on an efficient simplicial reconstruction of the underlying manifold. Then, the normal coordinates are computed to map the input high-dimensional data into a low- dimensional space. Experiments on synthetic data, as well as real-world images, demonstrate that our algorithm can learn intrinsic geometric structures of the data, preserve radial geodesic distances, and yield regular embeddings.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359350","Dimensionality reduction;manifold learning;manifold reconstruction;Riemannian manifolds;Riemannian normal coordinates.;Dimensionality reduction;manifold learning;manifold reconstruction;Riemannian manifolds;Riemannian normal coordinates.","Manifolds;Principal component analysis;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Data analysis;Linear discriminant analysis;Geometry;Image reconstruction;Shape;Kernel","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","312","2","60","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These systems have two operation regions depending on the wind turbine tip-speed ratio. They are distinguished by minimum phase behavior in one of these regions and a nonminimum phase in the other one. A sliding mode control strategy is then proposed to ensure stability in both operation regions and to impose the ideal feedback control solution despite model uncertainties. The proposed sliding mode control strategy presents attractive features such as robustness to parametric uncertainties of the turbine and the generator as well as to electric grid disturbances. The proposed sliding mode control approach has been simulated on a 1.5-MW three-blade wind turbine to evaluate its consistency and performance. The next step was the validation using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine simulator called the fatigue, aerodynamics, structures, and turbulence code (FAST). Both simulation and validation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in terms of power regulation. Moreover, the sliding mode approach is arranged so as to produce no chattering in the generated torque that could lead to increased mechanical stress because of strong torque variations.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2007.914163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4458228","Power generation control;sliding mode control;wind energy conversion system;Power generation control;sliding mode control;wind energy conversion system","Power control;Wind energy;Sliding mode control;Wind turbines;Wind energy generation;Uncertainty;Torque;Control systems;Wind power generation;Stability","","311","","32","IEEE","30 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We conclude that in a circular multihop sensor network (modeled as concentric coronas) with nonuniform node distribution and constant data reporting, the unbalanced energy depletion among all the nodes in the network is unavoidable. Even if the nodes in the inner coronas of the network have used up their energy simultaneously, the ones in the outermost corona may still have unused energy. This is due to the intrinsic many-to-one traffic pattern of WSNs. Nevertheless, nearly balanced energy depletion in the network is possible if the number of nodes increases in geometric progression from the outer coronas to the inner ones except the outermost one. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel nonuniform node distribution strategy to achieve nearly balanced energy depletion in the network. We regulate the number of nodes in each corona and derive the ratio between the node densities in the adjacent (i + 1)th and ith coronas by the strategy. Finally, we propose (q-switch routing, a distributed shortest path routing algorithm tailored for the proposed nonuniform node distribution strategy. Extensive simulations have been performed to validate the analysis.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2007.70770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359450","Sensor networks;Wireless communication;Sensor networks;Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks;Corona;Distribution strategy;Telecommunication traffic;Routing;Analytical models;Energy efficiency;Data communication;Computer Society;Spread spectrum communication","","309","","28","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is based on a self-developing (evolving) fuzzy-rule-based (FRB) classifier system of Takagi-Sugeno ( eTS) type. The proposed approach, called eClass (evolving class ifier), includes different architectures and online learning methods. The family of alternative architectures includes: 1) eClass0, with the classifier consequents representing class label and 2) the newly proposed method for regression over the features using a first-order eTS fuzzy classifier, eClass1. An important property of eClass is that it can start learning ldquofrom scratch.rdquo Not only do the fuzzy rules not need to be prespecified, but neither do the number of classes for eClass (the number may grow, with new class labels being added by the online learning process). In the event that an initial FRB exists, eClass can evolve/develop it further based on the newly arrived data. The proposed approach addresses the practical problems of the classification of streaming data (video, speech, sensory data generated from robotic, advanced industrial applications, financial and retail chain transactions, intruder detection, etc.). It has been successfully tested on a number of benchmark problems as well as on data from an intrusion detection data stream to produce a comparison with the established approaches. The results demonstrate that a flexible (with evolving structure) FRB classifier can be generated online from streaming data achieving high classification rates and using limited computational resources.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.925904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529082","Evolving fuzzy systems;fuzzy-rule-based (FRB) classifiers;recursive least squares (RLS);Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy models;FRB classifiers;Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models;recursive least squares;evolving fuzzy systems","Fuzzy systems;Classification tree analysis;Streaming media;Aerospace industry;Learning systems;Speech;Service robots;Robot sensing systems;Benchmark testing;Intrusion detection","","308","","56","IEEE","23 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For most wireless applications, the ambient vibration is generally at very low frequencies (1-100 Hz), and traditional scavenging techniques cannot generate enough energy for proper operation. The reported generator up-converts low-frequency environmental vibrations to a higher frequency through a mechanical frequency up-converter using a magnet, and hence provides more efficient energy conversion at low frequencies. Power is generated by means of EM induction using a magnet and coils on top of resonating cantilever beams. The proposed approach has been demonstrated using a macroscale version, which provides 170 nW maximum power and 6 mV maximum voltage. For the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) version, the expected maximum power and maximum voltage from a single cantilever is 3.97 muW and 76 mV, respectively, in vacuum. Power level can be increased further by using series-connected cantilevers without increasing the overall generator area, which is 4 mm2. This system provides more than an order of magnitude better energy conversion for 10-100 Hz ambient vibration range, compared to a conventional large mass/coil system.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2008.917125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448348","Energy scavenging;energy harvesting;frequency up-conversion;microelectromechanical systems (MEMS);wireless sensors","Wireless sensor networks;Vibrations;Power generation;Induction generators;Frequency conversion;Energy conversion;Coils;Voltage;Mechanical sensors;Structural beams","","308","13","25","IEEE","8 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Developments in nanowire growth have led to the demonstration of a wide range of nanowire materials with precise control of composition, morphology, and electrical properties, and it is believed that this excellent control together with small channel size could yield device performance exceeding that obtained using top-down techniques. Here, we review advances in chemically synthesized semiconductor nanowires as nanoelectronic devices. We first introduce basic nanowire field-effect transistor structures and review results obtained from both p- and n-channel homogeneous composition nanowires. Second, we describe nanowire heterostructures, show that by using nanowire heterostructures, several limiting factors in homogeneous nanowire devices can be mitigated, and demonstrate that nanowire transistor performance can reach the ballistic limit and exceed state-of-the-art planar devices. Third, we discuss basic methods for organization of nanowires necessary for fabricating arrays of device and circuits.

Using the theoretical principles in this framework, three main contributions are presented. First, a novel family of kernel-based methods for multitemporal classification of remote sensing images is presented. The second contribution is the development of nonlinear kernel classifiers for the well-known difference and ratioing change detection methods by formulating them in an adequate high-dimensional feature space. Finally, the presented methodology allows the integration of contextual information and multisensor images with different levels of nonlinear sophistication. The binary support vector (SV) classifier and the one-class SV domain description classifier are evaluated by using both linear and nonlinear kernel functions.

In this paper, we focus on the challenging issue of recognizing the emotion content of music signals, or music emotion recognition (MER). Specifically, we formulate MER as a regression problem to predict the arousal and valence values (AV values) of each music sample directly. Associated with the AV values, each music sample becomes a point in the arousal-valence plane, so the users can efficiently retrieve the music sample by specifying a desired point in the emotion plane. Because no categorical taxonomy is used, the regression approach is free of the ambiguity inherent to conventional categorical approaches. To improve the performance, we apply principal component analysis to reduce the correlation between arousal and valence, and RReliefF to select important features. An extensive performance study is conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the regression approach for predicting AV values. The best performance evaluated in terms of the R 2 statistics reaches 58.3% for arousal and 28.1% for valence by employing support vector machine as the regressor. We also apply the regression approach to detect the emotion variation within a music selection and find the prediction accuracy superior to existing works.

The plug-in HEV (PHEV), utilizing more battery power, has become a more attractive upgrade of the HEV. The charge-depletion mode is more appropriate for the power management of PHEVs, i.e., the state of charge (SOC) is expected to drop to a low threshold when the vehicle reaches the trip destination. Trip information has so far been considered as future information for vehicle operation and is thus not available a priori. This situation can be changed by the recent advancement in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) based on the use of on-board global positioning systems (GPSs), geographical information systems (GISs), and advanced traffic flow modeling techniques. In this paper, a new approach to optimal power management of PHEVs in the charge-depletion mode is proposed with driving cycle modeling based on the historic traffic information. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is applied to reinforce the charge-depletion control such that the SOC drops to a specific terminal value at the end of the driving cycle. The vehicle model was based on a hybrid electric sport utility vehicle (SUV). Only fuel consumption is considered for the current stage of the study. A simulation study was conducted for several standard driving cycles and two trip models using the proposed method, and the results showed significant improvement in fuel economy compared with a rule-based control and a depletion sustenance control for most cases. Furthermore, the results showed much better consistency in fuel economy compared with rule-based and depletion sustenance control.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2008.921622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476296","Dynamic programming (DP);intelligent transportation systems (ITSs);plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs);power management;Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles;Power Management;Intelligent Transportation system;Dynamic Programming","Energy management;Hybrid electric vehicles;Fuel economy;Intelligent transportation systems;Traffic control;Power system modeling;Batteries;Management information systems;Power system management;Dynamic programming","","302","4","36","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the measurement data is multidimensional, current approaches require stacking the dimensions into one highly structured matrix. However, in the conventional subspace estimation step, e.g., via an SVD of the latter matrix, this structure is not exploited. In this paper, we define a measurement tensor and estimate the signal subspace through a higher-order SVD. This allows us to exploit the structure inherent in the measurement data already in the first step of the algorithm which leads to better estimates of the signal subspace. We show how the concepts of forward-backward averaging and the mapping of centro-Hermitian matrices to real-valued matrices of the same size can be extended to tensors. As examples, we develop the $R$-D standard Tensor-ESPRIT and the $R$-D Unitary Tensor-ESPRIT algorithms. However, these new concepts can be applied to any multidimensional subspace-based parameter estimation scheme. Significant improvements of the resulting parameter estimation accuracy are achieved if there is at least one of the $R$ dimensions, which possesses a number of sensors that is larger than the number of sources. This can already be observed in the two-dimensional case.

Pixels located in the edge areas are embedded by a k-bit LSB substitution method with a larger value of k than that of the pixels located in smooth areas. The range of difference values is adaptively divided into lower level, middle level, and higher level. For any pair of consecutive pixels, both pixels are embedded by the k-bit LSB substitution method. However, the value k is adaptive and is decided by the level which the difference value belongs to. In order to remain at the same level where the difference value of two consecutive pixels belongs, before and after embedding, a delicate readjusting phase is used.

According to the fc-anonymity principle, each release of data must be such that each individual is indistinguishable from at least k - 1 other individuals. In this paper we study the problem of anonymity preserving data publishing in moving objects databases. We propose a novel concept of k-anonymity based on co-localization that exploits the inherent uncertainty of the moving object's whereabouts. Due to sampling and positioning systems (e.g., GPS) imprecision, the trajectory of a moving object is no longer a polyline in a three-dimensional space, instead it is a cylindrical volume, where its radius delta represents the possible location imprecision: we know that the trajectory of the moving object is within this cylinder, but we do not know exactly where. If another object moves within the same cylinder they are indistinguishable from each other. This leads to the definition of (k,delta) -anonymity for moving objects databases. We first characterize the (k, delta)-anonymity problem and discuss techniques to solve it. Then we focus on the most promising technique by the point of view of information preservation, namely space translation. We develop a suitable measure of the information distortion introduced by space translation, and we prove that the problem of achieving (k,delta) -anonymity by space translation with minimum distortion is NP-hard. Faced with the hardness of our problem we propose a greedy algorithm based on clustering and enhanced with ad hoc pre-processing and outlier removal techniques. The resulting method, named NWA (Never Walk .Alone), is empirically evaluated in terms of data quality and efficiency. Data quality is assessed both by means of objective measures of information distortion, and by comparing the results of the same spatio-temporal range queries executed on the original database and on the (k, delta)-anonymized one. Experimental results show that for a wide range of values of delta and k, the relative error introduced is kept low, confirming that NWA produces high quality (k, delta)-anonymized data.","2375-026X","978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497446","","Uncertainty;Databases;Publishing;Predictive models;Data privacy;Distortion measurement;Extraterrestrial measurements;Data engineering;Laboratories;Energy consumption","","299","5","34","IEEE","25 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Model adaptation is done by progressively increasing the degrees-of-freedom of the allowed deformations. This improves convergence as well as segmentation accuracy. The heart is first localized in the image using a 3-D implementation of the generalized Hough transform. Pose misalignment is corrected by matching the model to the image making use of a global similarity transformation. The complex initialization of the multicompartment mesh is then addressed by assigning an affine transformation to each anatomical region of the model. Finally, a deformable adaptation is performed to accurately match the boundaries of the patient's anatomy. A mean surface-to-surface error of 0.82 mm was measured in a leave-one-out quantitative validation carried out on 28 images. Moreover, the piecewise affine transformation introduced for mesh initialization and adaptation shows better interphase and interpatient shape variability characterization than commonly used principal component analysis.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2008.918330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4505365","Active shape models;computed tomography;deformable models;Hough transform;model-based segmentation;shape modeling;three-dimensional (3-D) cardiac segmentation;model-based segmentation;three-dimensional cardiac segmentation;deformable models;Hough transform;shape modeling;active shape models;computed tomography","Image segmentation;Heart;Computed tomography;Image processing;Image analysis;Myocardium;Adaptation model;Deformable models;Convergence;Anatomy","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Heart;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Anatomic;Models, Cardiovascular;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","299","84","45","IEEE","30 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is usually difficult to implement the negative coupling structure required for the design of compact canonical folded elliptic or quasi-elliptic cross-coupled bandpass filter on the basis of a single-layer SIW. In this paper, a special planar negative coupling scheme including a magnetic coupling post-wall iris and a balanced microstrip line with a pair of metallic via-holes is studied in detail. Two -band fourth-degree cross-coupled bandpass filters without and with source-load coupling using the negative coupling structures are then proposed and designed. The two novel SIW filters having the same center frequency of 20.5 GHz and respective passband width of 700 and 800 MHz are implemented on a single-layer Rogers RT/Duroid 5880 substrate with thickness of 0.508 mm.

The capability of annotating pictures by computers can lead to breakthroughs in a wide range of applications, including Web image search, online picture-sharing communities, and scientific experiments.

These new techniques serve as the basis for the automatic linguistic indexing of pictures - real time (ALIPR) system of fully automatic and high-speed annotation for online pictures. In particular, the D2-clustering method, in the same spirit as K-Means for vectors, is developed to group objects represented by bags of weighted vectors. Moreover, a generalized mixture modeling technique (kernel smoothing as a special case) for nonvector data is developed using the novel concept of hypothetical local mapping (HLM). ALIPR has been tested by thousands of pictures from an Internet photo-sharing site, unrelated to the source of those pictures used in the training process. Its performance has also been studied at an online demonstration site, where arbitrary users provide pictures of their choices and indicate the correctness of each annotation word.

Because of the implicit algebraic structure of the equation to solve, we called the corresponding solution, the fixed point (FP) estimate. When tau is assumed deterministic and unknown, the FP is the exact maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of the noise covariance structure, while when tau is a positive random variable, the FP is an approximate maximum likelihood (AML). This estimate has been already used for its excellent statistical properties without proofs of its existence and uniqueness. The major contribution of this paper is to fill these gaps. Our derivation is based on some likelihood functions general properties like homogeneity and can be easily adapted to other recursive contexts.

The results from the spectrum measurements taken over 12 weekday periods reveal that a significant amount of spectrum in Singapore has very low occupancy all the time. The occupancy is quantified as the amount of spectrum detected above a certain received power threshold. The outcome of this study suggests that Singapore has a great potential for employing emerging spectrum sharing technology such as the cognitive radio technology to accommodate enormous demands for future wireless services.

In the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system, the transmitter sends noncoherent (possibly orthogonal) broad (possibly omnidirectional) waveforms. These waveforms can be extracted at the receiver by a matched filterbank. The extracted signals can be used to obtain more diversity or to improve the spatial resolution for clutter. This paper focuses on space-time adaptive processing (STAP) for MIMO radar systems which improves the spatial resolution for clutter. With a slight modification, STAP methods developed originally for the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) radar (conventional radar) can also be used in MIMO radar. However, in the MIMO radar, the rank of the jammer-and-clutter subspace becomes very large, especially the jammer subspace. It affects both the complexity and the convergence of the STAP algorithm. In this paper, the clutter space and its rank in the MIMO radar are explored. By using the geometry of the problem rather than data, the clutter subspace can be represented using prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF). A new STAP algorithm is also proposed. It computes the clutter space using the PSWF and utilizes the block-diagonal property of the jammer covariance matrix. Because of fully utilizing the geometry and the structure of the covariance matrix, the method has very good SINR performance and low computational complexity.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.907917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4400830","Clutter subspaces;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar;prolate spheroidal wave function;space–time adaptive processing (STAP)","MIMO;Spaceborne radar;Wave functions;Radar antennas;Jamming;Spatial resolution;Radar clutter;Covariance matrix;Array signal processing;Transmitting antennas","","295","2","37","IEEE","16 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs), it is even more critical than for most technologies because enormous benefits accrue to going smaller, notably higher speed and much less energy consumed per computing function. The consensus is that ICs will continue to be manufactured until at least the ldquo22 nm noderdquo (the linewidth of an equal line-space pattern). Most patterning of ICs takes place on the wafer in two steps: (a) lithography, the patterning of a resist film on top of the functional material; and (b) transferring the resist pattern into the functional material, usually by etching. Here we concentrate on lithography. Optics has continued to be the chosen lithographic route despite its continually forecast demise. A combination of 193-nm radiation, immersion optics, and computer-intensive resolution enhancement technology will probably be used for the 45- and 32-nm nodes. Optical lithography usually requires that we first make a mask and then project the mask pattern onto a resist-coated wafer. Making a qualified mask, although originally dismissed as a ldquosupport technology,rdquo now represents a significant fraction of the total cost of patterning an IC largely because of the measures needed to push resolution so far beyond the normal limit of optical resolution. Thus, although optics has demonstrated features well below 22 nm, it is not clear that optics will be the most economical in this range; nanometer-scale mechanical printing is a strong contender, extreme ultraviolet is still the official front runner, and electron beam lithography, which has demonstrated minimum features less than 10 nm wide, continues to be developed both for mask making and for directly writing on the wafer (also known as ldquomaskless lithographyrdquo). Going from laboratory demonstration to manufacturing technology is enormously expensive ( $1 billion) and for good reason. Just in terms of data rate (mask pattern to resist pattern), today's exposure tools achieve about 10 Tb/s at an allowable error rate of about 1/h; this data rate will double with each generation. In addition, the edge placement precision required will soon be 30 parts per billion. There are so many opportunities for unacceptable performance that making the right decision goes far beyond understanding the underlying physical principles. But the benefits of continuing to be able to manufacture electronics at the 22-nm node and beyond appear to justify the investment, and there is no shortage of ideas on how to accomplish this.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2007.911853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432794","Electron beam lithography;imprint lithography;ion beam lithography;laser beam lithography;lithography;nanofabrication;nanoimprint;nanotechnology;patterning;phase separation;photolithography;self-assembly","Lithography;Optical films;Resists;Electron optics;Integrated circuit technology;Optical materials;Optical computing;Manufacturing;DNA;Semiconductor materials","","293","82","82","IEEE","16 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The development of those applications has been stimulated by the finalization of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which defines the medium access control (MAC) and physical layer for sensor networks. One of the MAC schemes proposed is slotted carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), and this paper analyzes whether this scheme meets the design constraints of those low-power and low-cost sensor networks. The paper provides a detailed analytical evaluation of its performance in a star topology network, for uplink and acknowledged uplink traffic. Both saturated and unsaturated periodic traffic scenarios are considered. The form of the analysis is similar to that of Bianchi for IEEE 802.11 DCF only in the use of a per user Markov model to capture the state of each user at each moment in time. The key assumptions to enable this important simplification and the coupling of the per user Markov models are however different, as a result of the very different designs of the 802.15.4 and 802.11 carrier sensing mechanisms. The performance predicted by the analytical model is very close to that obtained by simulation. Throughput and energy consumption analysis is then performed by using the model for a range of scenarios. Some design guidelines are derived to set the 802.15.4 parameters as function of the network requirements.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2008.060057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4626310","Access protocols;communication standards;communication system performance;Markov processes;wireless PAN","Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Analytical models;Monitoring;Surveillance;Standards development;Media Access Protocol;Physical layer;Collision avoidance","","292","2","12","IEEE","19 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We discuss the intricacy of magneto-nano biosensor design and show that as few as approximately 14 monodisperse 16-nm superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be detected by submicron spin valve sensors at room temperature without resorting to lock-in (narrow band) detection. GMR biosensors and biochips have been successfully applied to the detection of biological events in the form of both protein and DNA assays with great speed, sensitivity, selectivity, and economy. The limit of molecular detection is well below 10 pM in concentration, and the protein or DNA assay time can be under two hours. The technology is highly scalable to deep multiplex detection of biomarkers in a complex disease, and amenable to integration of microfluidics and CMOS electronics for portable applications. On-chip CMOS circuitry makes a sensor density of 0.1-1 million sensors per square centimeter feasible and affordable.

The primary advantage of this framework is to detect outlying sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-detect framework, we develop a trajectory outlier detection algorithm TRAOD. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and detection. For the first phase, we propose a two-level trajectory partitioning strategy that ensures both high quality and high efficiency.

To overcome this demerit many research have been done. The clustering is the one of the representative approaches. In the clustering, the cluster heads gather data from nodes, aggregate it and send the information to the base station. In this way, the sensor nodes can reduce communication overheads that may be generated if each sensor node reports sensed data to the base station independently. LEACH is one of the most famous clustering mechanisms. It elects a cluster head based on probability model. This approach may reduce the network lifetime because LEACH does not consider the distribution of sensor nodes and the energy remains of each node. However, using the location and the energy information in the clustering can generate big overheads. In this paper we introduce CHEF - cluster head election mechanism using fuzzy logic. By using fuzzy logic, collecting and calculating overheads can be reduced and finally the lifetime of the sensor networks can be prolonged. To prove efficiency of CHEF, we simulated CHEF compared with LEACH using the matlab.

The proposed control scheme utilizes fuzzy logic systems to learn the behavior of the unknown plant dynamics. Filtered signals are employed to circumvent algebraic loop problems encountered in the implementation of the usual controllers, and the approximation errors can be efficiently counteracted by employing smooth robust compensators. Most importantly, the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system can be guaranteed, and a priori knowledge of the plant dynamics is no longer required.

Second, CSP has been initially proposed for two-class paradigms. Extensions to multiclass paradigms have been suggested, but are based on heuristics. We address these shortcomings in the framework of information theoretic feature extraction (ITFE). We show that for two-class paradigms, CSP maximizes an approximation of mutual information of extracted EEG/MEG components and class labels. This establishes a link between CSP and the minimal classification error. For multiclass paradigms, we point out that CSP by joint approximate diagonalization (JAD) is equivalent to independent component analysis (ICA), and provide a method to choose those independent components (ICs) that approximately maximize mutual information of ICs and class labels. This eliminates the need for heuristics in multiclass CSP, and allows incorporating prior class probabilities. The proposed method is applied to the dataset IIIa of the third BCI competition, and is shown to increase the mean classification accuracy by 23.4% in comparison to multiclass CSP.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2008.921154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4473042","Brain-computer interfaces;common spatial patterns;information theoretic feature extraction;spatial filtering","Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Spatial filters;Data mining;Magnetic separation;Filtering;Magnetoencephalography;Mutual information;Independent component analysis;Magnetic field measurement","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain Mapping;Electroencephalography;Humans;Magnetoencephalography;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","289","","25","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ABF sharpens an image by increasing the slope of the edges without producing overshoot or undershoot. It is an approach to sharpness enhancement that is fundamentally different from the unsharp mask (USM). This new approach to slope restoration also differs significantly from previous slope restoration algorithms in that the ABF does not involve detection of edges or their orientation, or extraction of edge profiles. In the ABF, the edge slope is enhanced by transforming the histogram via a range filter with adaptive offset and width. The ABF is able to smooth the noise, while enhancing edges and textures in the image. The parameters of the ABF are optimized with a training procedure. ABF restored images are significantly sharper than those restored by the bilateral filter. Compared with an USM based sharpening method-the optimal unsharp mask (OUM), ABF restored edges are as sharp as those rendered by the OUM, but without the halo artifacts that appear in the OUM restored image. In terms of noise removal, ABF also outperforms the bilateral filter and the OUM. We demonstrate that ABF works well for both natural images and text images.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2008.919949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476197","Bilateral filter;de-blurring;noise removal;range filter;sharpness enhancement;slope restoration","Adaptive filters;Image restoration;Degradation;Image edge detection;Histograms;Rendering (computer graphics);Image enhancement;Interpolation;Color;Instruments","Algorithms;Artifacts;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","288","9","52","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing interconnection networks use either oblivious or adaptive routing algorithms to determine the route taken by a packet to its destination. Despite somewhat higher implementation complexity, adaptive routing enjoys better fault tolerance characteristics, increases network throughput, and decreases latency compared to oblivious policies when faced with non-uniform or bursty traffic. However, adaptive routing can hurt performance by disturbing any inherent global load balance through greedy local decisions. To improve load balance in adapting routing, we propose Regional Congestion Awareness (RCA), a lightweight technique to improve global network balance. Instead of relying solely on local congestion information, RCA informs the routing policy of congestion in parts of the network beyond adjacent routers. Our experiments show that RCA matches or exceeds the performance of conventional adaptive routing across all workloads examined, with a 16% average and 71% maximum latency reduction on SPLASH-2 benchmarks running on a 49-core CMP. Compared to a baseline adaptive router, RCA incurs a negligible logic and modest wiring overhead.","2378-203X","978-1-4244-2070-4","10.1109/HPCA.2008.4658640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658640","","Routing;Resource management;Adaptive systems;Switches;System-on-a-chip;Pipelines;Microarchitecture","","287","5","35","IEEE","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two major tasks of PD measurements may be distinguished, (i) PD detection, hence providing evidence and the type of the PD and (ii) the location of the PD. The question ""Where is the PD source?"" is amongst others tremendously important for scheduling and starting maintenance/repair actions cost and time efficiently or to perform a risk analysis. Here the possibility to geometrically localize the flaw, by means of arrival times of acoustic PD signals, gets an extremely interesting option. Precise acoustic arrival times are consequently essential to accurately locate PD in a power transformer. The averaging of acoustic PD signals helps to enhance the acoustic sensitivity. The acoustic detection limit is lowered significantly and the determination of the arrival times is made possible for weaker PD. Supplementary steps, like automatic objective arrival time determination or additional wavelet-based de-noising further improve the overall location accuracy. A new location approach works with pseudo-times and allows for the use of robust direct solvers instead of the previously used iterative algorithms.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2008.4712660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4712660","PD location, electromagnetic (UHF) and acoustic PD measurements, de-noising, wavelet, acoustic averaging, arrival time determination","Acoustic signal detection;Partial discharges;Power transformers;Acoustic measurements;Electromagnetic measurements;Power transformer insulation;Costs;Risk analysis;Acoustic waves;Noise reduction","","287","3","22","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The projection functions of LDA are commonly obtained by maximizing the between-class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within-class covariance. It has been widely used in many fields of information processing, such as machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. However, the computation of LDA involves dense matrices eigendecomposition, which can be computationally expensive in both time and memory. Specifically, LDA has O(mnt + t3) time complexity and requires O(mn + mt + nt) memory, where m is the number of samples, n is the number of features, and t = min(m,n). When both m and n are large, it is infeasible to apply LDA. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for discriminant analysis, called Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework that facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Specifically, SRDA only needs to solve a set of regularized least squares problems, and there is no eigenvector computation involved, which is a huge save of both time and memory. Our theoretical analysis shows that SRDA can be computed with O(mn) time and O(ms) memory, where .s(les n) is the average number of nonzero features in each sample. Extensive experimental results on four real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.190669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358955","Data mining;Feature evaluation and selection;Data mining;Feature evaluation and selection","Large-scale systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Linear discriminant analysis;Data mining;Spectral analysis;Feature extraction;Information processing;Machine learning;Information retrieval;Pattern recognition","","286","","28","IEEE","27 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a novel two-phase approach for detecting abnormal activities based on wireless sensors attached to a human body. Detecting abnormal activities is a particular important task in security monitoring and healthcare applications of sensor networks, among many others. Traditional approaches to this problem suffer from a high false positive rate, particularly when the collected sensor data are biased towards normal data while the abnormal events are rare. Therefore, there is a lack of training data for many traditional data mining methods to be applied. To solve this problem, our approach first employs a one-class support vector machine (SVM) that is trained on commonly available normal activities, which filters out the activities that have a very high probability of being normal. We then derive abnormal activity models from a general normal model via a kernel nonlinear regression (KNLR) to reduce false positive rate in an unsupervised manner. We show that our approach provides a good tradeoff between abnormality detection rate and false alarm rate, and allows abnormal activity models to be automatically derived without the need to explicitly label the abnormal training data, which are scarce. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real data collected from a sensor network that is deployed in a realistic setting.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.1042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358934","Activity Recognition;Outlier Detection;Sensor Networks;Data Mining;Activity Recognition;Outlier Detection;Sensor Networks;Data Mining","Intelligent sensors;Humans;Training data;Support vector machines;Artificial intelligence;Ubiquitous computing;Wireless sensor networks;Communication system security;Data security;Monitoring","","286","7","31","IEEE","27 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This typically requires a multiclass analysis be broken down into a series of binary classifications, following either the one-against-one or one-against-all strategies. However, the binary SVM can be extended for a one-shot multiclass classification needing a single optimization operation. Here, an approach for one-shot multi- class classification of multispectral data was evaluated against approaches based on binary SVM for a set of five-class classifications. The one-shot multiclass classification was more accurate (92.00%) than the approaches based on a series of binary classifications (89.22% and 91.33%). Additionally, the one-shot multi- class SVM had other advantages relative to the binary SVM-based approaches, notably the need to be optimized only once for the parameters C and 7 as opposed to five times for one-against-all and ten times for the one-against-one approach, respectively, and used fewer support vectors, 215 as compared to 243 and 246 for the binary based approaches. Similar trends were also apparent in results of analyses of a data set of larger dimensionality. It was also apparent that the conventional one-against-all strategy could not be guaranteed to yield a complete confusion matrix that can greatly limit the assessment and later use of a classification derived by that method.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2008.915597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4460898","Accuracy;binary and multiclass classification;confusion matrix;image classification;support vector machine (SVM);Accuracy;binary and multiclass classification;confusion matrix;image classification;support vector machine (SVM)","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Remote sensing;Classification tree analysis;Neural networks;Data analysis;Image classification;Decision trees;Councils","","285","","14","IEEE","4 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the major design issues is the support of vertical handoff. Vertical handoff occurs when a mobile terminal switches from one network to another (e.g., from wireless local area network to code-division multiple-access 1x radio transmission technology). The objective of this paper is to determine the conditions under which vertical handoff should be performed. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process with the objective of maximizing the total expected reward per connection. The network resources that are utilized by the connection are captured by a link reward function. A signaling cost is used to model the signaling and processing load incurred on the network when vertical handoff is performed. The value iteration algorithm is used to compute a stationary deterministic policy. For performance evaluation, voice and data applications are considered.

In these systems, setting the data trust level equal to the trust level of the data- providing entity would ignore system salient features, rendering applications ineffective and systems inflexible. This would be even more so if their operation is ephemeral, i.e., characterized by short-lived associations in volatile environments. In this paper, we address this challenge by extending the traditional notion of trust to data-centric trust: trustworthiness attributed to node-reported data per se. We propose a framework for data-centric trust establishment: First, trust in each individual piece of data is computed; then multiple, related but possibly contradictory, data are combined; finally, their validity is inferred by a decision component based on one of several evidence evaluation techniques. We consider and evaluate an instantiation of our framework in vehicular networks as a case study. Our simulation results show that our scheme is highly resilient to attackers and converges stably to the correct decision.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509775","","Ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Vehicles;Logic;Government;Communications Society;Computer networks;Mobile communication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Computational modeling","","285","","27","IEEE","2 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The source broadcasts the data to the relays, some or all of which cooperatively beamform to forward the data to the destination. We generalize the standard approaches for cooperative communications in two key respects: (i) we explicitly model and factor in the cost of acquiring channel state information (CSI), and (ii) we consider more general selection rules for the relays and compute the optimal one among them. In particular, we consider simple relay selection and outage criteria that exploit the inherent diversity of relay networks and satisfy a mandated outage constraint. These criteria include as special cases several relay selection criteria proposed in the literature. We obtain expressions for the total energy consumption for general relay selection and outage criteria for the non-homogeneous case, in which different relay links have different mean channel power gains, and the homogeneous case, in which the relay links statistics are identical. We characterize the structure of the optimal transmission scheme. Numerical results show that the cost of training and feedback of CSI is significant. The optimal strategy is to use a varying subset (and number) of relay nodes to cooperatively beamform at any given time. Depending on the relative location of the relays, the source, and the destination, numerical computations show energy savings of about 16% when an optimal relay selection rule is used. We also study the impact of shadowing correlation on the energy consumption for a cooperative relay network.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2008.06090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600214","Cooperative networks;relay networks;Rayleigh fading;broadcast;beamform;channel state information;energy optimization;outage;virtual branch analysis;optimization","Relays;Energy efficiency;Fading;Energy consumption;Wireless networks;Decoding;Broadcasting;Communication standards;Cost function;Channel state information","","284","","31","IEEE","19 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This new HAP model recognizes two cases - line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) between a HAP and a user at street level. The simulation of the urban environment is based on a statistical approach. Additional shadowing path loss is calculated using the uniform theory of diffraction for NLOS conditions. Normal distribution of the additional shadowing path loss was distinguishable from the simulation results. The shadowing path loss is defined as a function of the elevation angle. The results of the empirical model developed for idealized conditions are verified by measurements taken from a remote-controlled airship in different types of urban environment.

Unlike a standard phased-array, which transmits scaled versions of a single waveform, a waveform diversity-based system offers the flexibility of choosing how the different probing signals are correlated with one another. Recently proposed techniques for waveform diversity-based transmit beampattern design have focused on the optimization of the covariance matrix of the waveforms, as optimizing a performance metric directly with respect to the waveform matrix is a more complicated operation. Given an , obtained in a previous optimization stage or simply pre-specified, the problem becomes that of determining a signal waveform matrix whose covariance matrix is equal or close to , and which also satisfies some practically motivated constraints (such as constant-modulus or low peak-to-average-power ratio constraints).

Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a well-known technique to reduce energy in digital systems, but the effectiveness of DVFS is hampered by slow voltage transitions that occur on the order of tens of microseconds. In addition, the recent trend towards chip-multiprocessors (CMP) executing multi-threaded workloads with heterogeneous behavior motivates the need for per-core DVFS control mechanisms. Voltage regulators that are integrated onto the same chip as the microprocessor core provide the benefit of both nanosecond-scale voltage switching and per-core voltage control. We show that these characteristics provide significant energy-saving opportunities compared to traditional off-chip regulators. However, the implementation of on-chip regulators presents many challenges including regulator efficiency and output voltage transient characteristics, which are significantly impacted by the system-level application of the regulator. In this paper, we describe and model these costs, and perform a comprehensive analysis of a CMP system with on-chip integrated regulators. We conclude that on-chip regulators can significantly improve DVFS effectiveness and lead to overall system energy savings in a CMP, but architects must carefully account for overheads and costs when designing next-generation DVFS systems and algorithms.","2378-203X","978-1-4244-2070-4","10.1109/HPCA.2008.4658633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658633","","Regulators;System-on-a-chip;Voltage control;Program processors;Load modeling;Switches;Inductors","","283","39","39","IEEE","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Without a trusted central authority, defending against sybil attacks is quite challenging. Among the small number of decentralized approaches, our recent SybilGuard protocol [H. Yu et al., 2006] leverages a key insight on social networks to bound the number of sybil nodes accepted. Although its direction is promising, SybilGuard can allow a large number of sybil nodes to be accepted. Furthermore, SybilGuard assumes that social networks are fast mixing, which has never been confirmed in the real world. This paper presents the novel SybilLimit protocol that leverages the same insight as SybilGuard but offers dramatically improved and near-optimal guarantees. The number of sybil nodes accepted is reduced by a factor of ominus(radicn), or around 200 times in our experiments for a million-node system. We further prove that SybilLimit's guarantee is at most a log n factor away from optimal, when considering approaches based on fast-mixing social networks. Finally, based on three large-scale real-world social networks, we provide the first evidence that real-world social networks are indeed fast mixing. This validates the fundamental assumption behind SybilLimit's and SybilGuard's approach.","2375-1207","978-0-7695-3168-7","10.1109/SP.2008.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531141","Sybil attack;sybil identity;SybilLimit;social networks","Social network services;Peer to peer computing;Collaboration;Protocols;Voting;Humans;National security;Privacy;Large-scale systems;Routing","","283","3","42","IEEE","28 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on different selection of redundant switching-states, there are many types of SVM modulated waves, some of which can function equivalently through proper selection of common-mode injections in the case of carrier-based PWM, the others have more freedoms in switching-states' selection than carrier-based PWM. Selection of more switching-states in SVM is propitious to optimize the output voltage, balance the dc power and so on.

A tactile cell consists of two thick PDMS layers with embedded electrodes, an air gap, and a pillar structure. The pillar structure is formed at the center of each tactile cell between the air gap under a large bump. There are four capacitors in a cell to decompose the contact force into normal and shear components. Four capacitors are arranged in a square form. If a normal force is applied on the bump, the PDMS layer on the pillar structure is compressed, and the air gap between the top and bottom electrodes decreases, resulting in the increase in all four capacitances. If a shear force is applied, a torque is induced around the pillar. Therefore, the capacitance of the two capacitors increases, whereas that of the other two decreases. The bump and the pillar structure play a critical role to generate a torque for shear force measurement. The sensor has been realized in an 8 x 8 array of unit sensors, and each unit sensor responds to normal and shear stresses in all three axes, respectively. Measurement of a single sensor shows that the full-scale range of detectable force is about 10 mN, which corresponds to 131 kPa in three directions. The sensitivities of a cell measured with a current setup are 2.5%/mN, 3.0%/mN, and 2.9 %/mN for the x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively. Normal and shear force images are also captured from a 4 x 4 array of the fabricated sensor.

This captures all possible side-channel attacks on S where the amount of information leaked in a given period is bounded, but overall can be arbitrary large. The only other assumption we make on the implementation of S is that only data that is accessed during computation leaks information. The stream-cipher S generates its output in chunks K1, K2, . . . and arbitrary but bounded information leakage is modeled by allowing the adversary to adaptively chose a function fl : {0,1}* rarr {0, 1}lambda before Kl is computed, she then gets fl(taul) where taul is the internal state ofS that is accessed during the computation of Kg. One notion of security we prove for S is that Kg is indistinguishable from random when given K1,..., K1-1,f1(tau1 ),..., fl-1(taul-1) and also the complete internal state of S after Kg has been computed (i.e. S is forward-secure). The construction is based on alternating extraction (used in the intrusion-resilient secret-sharing scheme from FOCS'07). We move this concept to the computational setting by proving a lemma that states that the output of any PRG has high HILLpseudoentropy (i.e. is indistinguishable from some distribution with high min-entropy) even if arbitrary information about the seed is leaked. The amount of leakage lambda that we can tolerate in each step depends on the strength of the underlying PRG, it is at least logarithmic, but can be as large as a constant fraction of the internal state of S if the PRG is exponentially hard.","0272-5428","978-0-7695-3436-7","10.1109/FOCS.2008.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4690963","side-channel attack;leakage-resilient;stream-cipher","Cryptography;Information security;Electromagnetic radiation;Protection;Computer science;Data mining;Distributed computing;Mathematical model;Energy consumption;Fault detection","","281","8","31","IEEE","2 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a CR network, secondary users continuously sense the spectral environment and adapt transmission parameters to opportunistically use the available spectrum. A fundamental problem for CRs is spectrum sensing; secondary users need to reliably detect weak primary signals of possibly different types over a targeted wide frequency band in order to identify spectral holes for opportunistic communications. Conceptually and practically, there is growing awareness that collaboration among several CRs can achieve considerable performance gains. This article provides an overview of the challenges and possible solutions for the design of collaborative wideband sensing in CR networks.

A conceptual model is developed for understanding and investigating the nature, delivery, and exchange of service value and assessing the complexity of a service value network. Three central arguments are presented. First, value in the services economy is driven and determined by the end consumer and delivered through a complex web of direct and indirect relationships between value network actors. Second, the complexity of service value networks not only depends on the number of actors but also on the conditional probabilities that these actors are involved in delivering the service to the consumer. Third, ICT plays a central role in reducing complexity for consumers by providing greater levels of value network integration, information visibility, and means to manage and anticipate change.","0018-8670","","10.1147/sj.471.0053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5386528","","","","280","","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

When estimating the RUL of a test unit, the data from it will be matched to those patterns in the library and the actual life of those matched units will be used as the basis of estimation. This approach is used to tackle the data challenge problem defined by the 2008 PHM Data Challenge Competition, in which, run-to-failure data of an unspecified engineered system are provided and the RUL of a set of test units will be estimated.

However, it remains uncertain whether such techniques will generalize to a large number of popular Web queries and whether the potential improvement to search quality warrants the additional computational cost. In this work, we cast the image-ranking problem into the task of identifying ""authority"" nodes on an inferred visual similarity graph and propose VisualRank to analyze the visual link structures among images. The images found to be ""authorities"" are chosen as those that answer the image-queries well. To understand the performance of such an approach in a real system, we conducted a series of large-scale experiments based on the task of retrieving images for 2,000 of the most popular products queries. Our experimental results show significant improvement, in terms of user satisfaction and relevancy, in comparison to the most recent Google image search results. Maintaining modest computational cost is vital to ensuring that this procedure can be used in practice; we describe the techniques required to make this system practical for large-scale deployment in commercial search engines.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4522561","Image Processing and Computer Vision;Image/video retrieval;Image Processing and Computer Vision;Image/video retrieval","Large-scale systems;Image retrieval;Image analysis;Search engines;Web pages;Computational efficiency;Content based retrieval;Signal processing;Graph theory;Poles and towers","Artificial Intelligence;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Documentation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiology Information Systems;Subtraction Technique","279","47","42","IEEE","16 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"FLEXFIS: A Robust Incremental Learning Approach for Evolving Takagi–Sugeno Fuzzy Models","E. D.

The new data-driven online learning approach includes not only the adaptation of linear parameters appearing in the rule consequents, but also the incremental learning of premise parameters appearing in the membership functions (fuzzy sets), together with a rule learning strategy in sample mode. A modified version of vector quantization is exploited for rule evolution and an incremental learning of the rules' premise parts. The modifications include an automatic generation of new clusters based on the nature, distribution, and quality of new data and an alternative strategy for selecting the winning cluster (rule) in each incremental learning step. Antecedent and consequent learning are connected in a stable manner, meaning that a convergence toward the optimal parameter set in the least-squares sense can be achieved. An evaluation and a comparison to conventional batch methods based on static and dynamic process models are presented for high-dimensional data recorded at engine test benches and at rolling mills. For the latter, the obtained data-driven fuzzy models are even compared with an analytical physical model. Furthermore, a comparison with other evolving fuzzy systems approaches is carried out based on nonlinear dynamic system identification tasks and a three-input nonlinear function approximation example.

The purpose of this work is to show the viability of using a planar electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structure based on a truncated frequency selective surface (FSS) grounded slab to this aim. The goal is to use it in patch antenna arrays, keeping both the element separation smaller than for grating lobes avoidance (assuming broadside case) and the patch antenna size large enough to have a good antenna directivity. To this aim, a multilayer dielectric substrate composed of high and low permittivity layers is convenient. This allows the use of a planar EBG structure made of small elements printed on the high permittivity material and, at the same time, the low permittivity layer helps the bandwidth and the directivity of the antenna to be increased. The EBG structure was designed under these premises and optimized for the particular application via an external optimization algorithm based on evolutionary computation: ant colony optimization (ACO). The mutual coupling reduction has been measured and it is larger than 10 dB with a completely planar structure.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2008.923306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4538163","Ant colony optimization (ACO);electromagnetic band gap (EBG);multilayer substrate;mutual coupling;patch antenna array;periodic structure","Mutual coupling;Patch antennas;Antenna arrays;Periodic structures;Metamaterials;Nonhomogeneous media;Dielectric substrates;Permittivity;Ant colony optimization;Frequency selective surfaces","","279","1","24","IEEE","6 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, the unique formation of the MRAC with the instantaneous and steady-state reactive power completely eliminates the requirement of any flux estimation in the process of computation. Thus, the method is less sensitive to integrator-related problems like drift and saturation (requiring no integration). This also makes the estimation at or near zero speed quite accurate.

For example, let us mention the entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Accurate estimation of these measures requires to adapt to the local sample density, especially if the data are high-dimensional. The k nearest neighbor (kNN) framework has been used to define efficient variable-bandwidth kernel-based estimators with such a locally adaptive property. Unfortunately, these estimators are computationally intensive since they rely on searching neighbors among large sets of d-dimensional vectors. This computational burden can be reduced by pre-structuring the data, e.g. using binary trees as proposed by the approximated nearest neighbor (ANN) library. Yet, the recent opening of graphics processing units (GPU) to general-purpose computation by means of the NVIDIA CUDA API offers the image and video processing community a powerful platform with parallel calculation capabilities. In this paper, we propose a CUDA implementation of the ldquobrute forcerdquo kNN search and we compare its performances to several CPU-based implementations including an equivalent brute force algorithm and ANN.

The propagation through building walls, such as brick and poured concrete in response to point sources near the walls, is simulated by using high-frequency methods. Reciprocity is used to find the responses of point targets behind walls, which are then used to simulate the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging through the walls. The effect of building walls on the target-image distortions is investigated by simulations and measurements. It is shown that by using the idea of match filtering, the effect of the wall can be compensated for, and the point target response can be reconstructed, provided that the wall parameters are known. An optimization method based on minimization of squared error in the SAR image domain within an area confined within the expected point-spread function is used to estimate the wall parameters and sharpen the image simultaneously. A controlled experiment within the laboratory environment is performed to verify the methods presented. It is shown that for an ultrawideband system operating over a frequency band of 1-3 GHz, highly distorted images of two point targets in close proximity of each other behind a wall can be resolved after refocusing.

The problem is to design a sensing policy for channel selection to maximize the average reward, which can be formulated as a multi-arm restless bandit process. In this paper, we study the structure, optimality, and performance of the myopic sensing policy. We show that the myopic sensing policy has a simple robust structure that reduces channel selection to a round-robin procedure and obviates the need for knowing the channel transition probabilities. The optimality of this simple policy is established for the two-channel case and conjectured for the general case based on numerical results. The performance of the myopic sensing policy is analyzed, which, based on the optimality of myopic sensing, characterizes the maximum throughput of a multi-channel opportunistic communication system and its scaling behavior with respect to the number of channels.

In particular, finite-time semistability for a continuum of equilibria of continuous autonomous systems is established. Continuity of the settling-time function as well as Lyapunov and converse Lyapunov theorems for semistability are also developed. In addition, necessary and sufficient conditions for finite-time semistability of homogeneous systems are addressed by exploiting the fact that a homogeneous system is finite-time semistable if and only if it is semistable and has a negative degree of homogeneity. Unlike previous work on homogeneous systems, our results involve homogeneity with respect to semistable dynamics, and require us to adopt a geometric description of homogeneity.

Our approach consists of introducing an auxiliary dynamical system whose output (which is also a unit quaternion) is used in the control law together with the unit quaternion representing the attitude tracking error. Roughly speaking, the necessary damping that would have been achieved by the direct use of the angular velocity can be achieved, in our approach, by the vector part \mathtilde q of the error signal between the output of the auxiliary system and the unit quaternion tracking error. The resulting velocity-free control scheme guarantees almost global asymptotic stability which is as strong as the topology of the motion space can permit. In the regulation case, our control law is a pure quaternion feedback (i.e., consisting of two terms that are vector parts of unit-quaternion), and hence, the control torques are naturally bounded by the control gains. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2008.927789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601498","Attitude tracking;output feedback;rigid body","Output feedback;Quaternions;Torque control;Velocity measurement;Control systems;Attitude control;Error correction;Damping;Angular velocity;Velocity control","","277","","19","IEEE","19 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At present, such storage systems provide no strong evidence that multiple copies of the data are actually stored. Storage servers can collude to make it look like they are storing many copies of the data, whereas in reality they only store a single copy. We address this shortcoming through multiple-replica provable data possession (MR-PDP): A provably-secure scheme that allows a client that stores t replicas of a file in a storage system to verify through a challenge-response protocol that (1) each unique replica can be produced at the time of the challenge and that (2) the storage system uses t times the storage required to store a single replica. MR-PDP extends previous work on data possession proofs for a single copy of a file in a client/server storage system (Ateniese et al., 2007). Using MR-PDP to store t replicas is computationally much more efficient than using a single-replica PDP scheme to store t separate, unrelated files (e.g., by encrypting each file separately prior to storing it). Another advantage of MR-PDP is that it can generate further replicas on demand, at little expense, when some of the existing replicas fail.","1063-6927","978-0-7695-3172-4","10.1109/ICDCS.2008.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595910","","Servers;Cryptography;Availability;Titanium;Protocols;Biological system modeling;Materials","","276","10","29","IEEE","12 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tradeoffs exist between unsupervised statistical methods, which are typically based on principal components analysis (PCA), and supervised ones, which are often based on Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and proponents for each approach exist in the remote sensing community. Recently, a combined approach known as subspace LDA has been proposed, where PCA is employed to recondition ill-posed LDA formulations. The key idea behind this approach is to use a PCA transformation as a preprocessor to discard the null space of rank-deficient scatter matrices, so that LDA can be applied on this reconditioned space. Thus, in theory, the subspace LDA technique benefits from the advantages of both methods. In this letter, we present a theoretical analysis of the effects (often ill effects) of PCA on the discrimination power of the projected subspace. The theoretical analysis is presented from a general pattern classification perspective for two possible scenarios: (1) when PCA is used as a simple dimensionality reduction tool and (2) when it is used to recondition an ill-posed LDA formulation. We also provide experimental evidence of the ineffectiveness of both scenarios for hyperspectral target recognition applications.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2008.2001282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4656486","Dimensionality reduction;feature extraction;hyperspectral;image classification;pattern classification","Principal component analysis;Target recognition;Linear discriminant analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Statistical analysis;Remote sensing;Null space;Scattering;Pattern analysis","","275","","14","IEEE","5 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To deal with this limitation, we propose a transmit diversity based cooperative spectrum sensing method. By regarding multiple CRs as a virtual antenna array, space-time coding and spacefrequency coding are applied into CR networks over flat-fading and frequency-selective fading channels, respectively. Moreover, we propose a relay diversity based cooperative spectrum sensing approach to increase the diversity of detection when some CRs are in heavy shadowing. It is then shown that, when combined with algebraic coding, relay diversity can further improve the cooperative spectrum sensing performance.","1558-2248","","10.1109/T-WC.2008.060857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4712688","Cognitive radio;diversity technique;relay channels;space-frequency coding;space-time coding","Relays;Cognitive radio;Chromium;Fading;Performance analysis;FCC;Cities and towns;Interference;Additive white noise;AWGN","","275","1","17","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine are approximated by a Gaussian radial basis function network based nonlinear input-output mapping. Based on this nonlinear mapping, the wind speed is estimated from the measured generator electrical output power while taking into account the power losses in the WTG and the dynamics of the WTG shaft system. The estimated wind speed is then used to determine the optimal DFIG rotor speed command for maximum wind power extraction. The DFIG speed controller is suitably designed to effectively damp the low-frequency torsional oscillations. The resulting WTG system delivers maximum electrical power to the grid with high efficiency and high reliability without mechanical anemometers. The validity of the proposed control algorithm is verified by simulation studies on a 3.6MW WTG system.

We combine this VST with the filter banks of wavelets, ridgelets and curvelets, leading to multiscale VSTs (MS-VSTs) and nonlinear decomposition schemes. By doing so, the noise-contaminated coefficients of these MS-VST-modified transforms are asymptotically normally distributed with known variances.

This merit provides convenience and flexibility in design and application of multiagent networks. For the fixed topology case, we show that the network is uncontrollable whenever the leader has an unbiased action on every member, regardless of the connectivity of the members themselves.

However, manual alignment increased classification rates a little, which suggests that automatic alignment would be useful when the alignment methods are further improved. We also found that the gender classification methods performed almost equally well with different input image sizes. In any case, the best classification rate was achieved with a support vector machine. A neural network and Adaboost achieved almost as good classification rates as the support vector machine and could be used in applications where classification speed is considered more important than the maximum classification accuracy.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378387","Classifier design and evaluation;Computer vision;Face and gesture recognition;Interactive systems;Vision I/O;Machine learning;Classifier design and evaluation;Computer vision;Face and gesture recognition;Interactive systems;Vision I/O;Machine learning","Face detection;Detectors;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Eyes;Neural networks;Application software;Computer vision;Interactive systems;Machine learning","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Face;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sex Characteristics;Sex Determination (Analysis);Sex Factors;Subtraction Technique","273","3","26","IEEE","21 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From the perspective of robotics design, we need to investigate the influences of these attitudes and emotions on human-robot interaction. This paper reports our empirical study on the relationships between people's attitudes and emotions, and their behavior toward a robot. In particular, we focused on negative attitudes, anxiety, and communication avoidance behavior, which have important implications for robotics design. For this purpose, we used two psychological scales that we had developed: negative attitudes toward robots scale (NARS) and robot anxiety scale (RAS). In the experiment, subjects and a humanoid robot are engaged in simple interactions including scenes of meeting, greeting, self-disclosure, and physical contact. Experimental results indicated that there is a relationship between negative attitudes and emotions, and communication avoidance behavior. A gender effect was also suggested.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2007.914004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4481184","Anxiety and negative attitudes;human--robot interaction;relationships between emotions and behavior","Psychology;Human robot interaction;Educational institutions;Humanoid robots;Intelligent robots;Layout;Educational robots;Psychiatry;Communications technology;Polarization","","273","","28","IEEE","4 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the first version was built in a way to demonstrate effectiveness of variable impedance actuation (VIA), it had limitations in torque capacities, life cycle and implementability in a real robot. VSA-II overcomes the problem of implementability with higher capacities and robustness in design for longer life. The paper discusses design and stiffness behaviour of VSA-II in theory and experiments. A comparison of stiffness characteristics between the two actuator is discussed, highlighting the advantages of the new design. A simple, but effective PD scheme is employed to independently control joint-stiffness and joint-position of a 1-link arm.

The obtention of the compensation current according to each formulation has been established. Next, the behavior of an active power filter (APF) that is implemented with those different control algorithms has been studied. On one hand, a simulation platform with control, APF, and load has been built to test them. Results obtained in an unbalanced and nonsinusoidal three-phase four-wire system have been compared by means of the most adequate indexes. On the other hand, the APF control strategies have been implemented in an experimental platform constituted by a 20-kVA power inverter and a 400-MHz digital signal processing controller board. The final analysis shows that, in general, the five theories present a different behavior, which depends on supply voltage, with respect to distortion. However, all of them widely decrease the waveform distortion. Moreover, a more general compensation objective is possible.

Building upon a multi-view/multi-category object detector, it localizes cars and pedestrians in the input images. The 2D object detections are converted to 3D observations, which are accumulated in a world coordinate frame. Trajectory analysis in a spacetime window yields physically plausible trajectory candidates. Tracking is achieved by performing model selection after every frame. At each time instant, our approach searches for the globally optimal set of spacetime trajectories which provides the best explanation for the current image and all evidence collected so far, while satisfying the constraints that no two objects may occupy the same physical space, nor explain the same image pixels at any time. Successful trajectory hypotheses are then fed back to guide object detection in future frames. The resulting approach can initialize automatically and track a large and varying number of objects from both static and moving cameras.

To achieve this, we propose to minimize Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) which provides a means of assessing the true mean-squared error (MSE) purely from the measured data without need for any knowledge about the noise-free signal. Specifically, we present a novel Monte-Carlo technique which enables the user to calculate SURE for an arbitrary denoising algorithm characterized by some specific parameter setting. Our method is a black-box approach which solely uses the response of the denoising operator to additional input noise and does not ask for any information about its functional form. This, therefore, permits the use of SURE for optimization of a wide variety of denoising algorithms. We justify our claims by presenting experimental results for SURE-based optimization of a series of popular image-denoising algorithms such as total-variation denoising, wavelet soft-thresholding, and Wiener filtering/smoothing splines. In the process, we also compare the performance of these methods. We demonstrate numerically that SURE computed using the new approach accurately predicts the true MSE for all the considered algorithms.

Detecting junctions locally has proved problematic because the image intensity surface is confusing in the neighborhood of a junction. Edge detectors also do not perform well near junctions. Current leading approaches to junction detection, such as the Harris operator, are based on 2D variation in the intensity signal. However, a drawback of this strategy is that it confuses textured regions with junctions. We believe that the right approach to junction detection should take advantage of the contours that are incident at a junction; contours themselves can be detected by processes that use more global approaches. In this paper, we develop a new high-performance contour detector using a combination of local and global cues. This contour detector provides the best performance to date (F=0.70) on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) benchmark. From the resulting contours, we detect and localize candidate junctions, taking into account both contour salience and geometric configuration. We show that improvements in our contour model lead to better junctions. Our contour and junction detectors both provide state of the art performance.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587420","","Detectors;Image edge detection;Semiconductor counters;Computer vision;Brightness;Filters;Shape;Image recognition;Humans;Object detection","","269","","30","IEEE","5 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

RatSLAM builds a map in an online manner, driving loop closure and relocalization through sequences of familiar visual scenes. Visual ambiguity is managed by maintaining multiple competing vehicle pose estimates, while cumulative errors in odometry are corrected after loop closure by a map correction algorithm.

The application of fuel diversity (e.g., generating units with fuel switching capability) is presented as an effective peak shaving strategy for natural gas demand which could hedge price volatilities of natural gas and electric power. The proposed model can be used by a vertically integrated utility for the commitment and dispatch of generating units and the allocation of natural gas for the next day utilization.

Traditionally, however, either only one of the objectives is adopted as the cost function or multiple objectives are aggregated to a scalar cost function. This can be mainly attributed to the fact that most conventional learning algorithms can only deal with a scalar cost function. Over the last decade, efforts on solving machine learning problems using the Pareto-based multiobjective optimization methodology have gained increasing impetus, particularly due to the great success of multiobjective optimization using evolutionary algorithms and other population-based stochastic search methods. It has been shown that Pareto-based multiobjective learning approaches are more powerful compared to learning algorithms with a scalar cost function in addressing various topics of machine learning, such as clustering, feature selection, improvement of generalization ability, knowledge extraction, and ensemble generation. One common benefit of the different multiobjective learning approaches is that a deeper insight into the learning problem can be gained by analyzing the Pareto front composed of multiple Pareto-optimal solutions. This paper provides an overview of the existing research on multiobjective machine learning, focusing on supervised learning. In addition, a number of case studies are provided to illustrate the major benefits of the Pareto-based approach to machine learning, e.g., how to identify interpretable models and models that can generalize on unseen data from the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions. Three approaches to Pareto-based multiobjective ensemble generation are compared and discussed in detail. Finally, potentially interesting topics in multiobjective machine learning are suggested.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.919172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4492360","Ensemble;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;generalization;machine learning;multiobjective learning;multiobjective optimization;neural networks;Pareto optimization","Machine learning;Cost function;Machine learning algorithms;Evolutionary computation;Stochastic processes;Search methods;Clustering algorithms;Power generation;Pareto analysis;Supervised learning","","268","1","94","IEEE","18 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the single-channel scenario, an estimate of the clean speech can be obtained by passing the noisy signal picked up by the microphone through a linear filter/transformation. The core issue, then, is how to find an optimal filter/transformation such that, after the filtering process, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved but the desired speech signal is not noticeably distorted. Most of the existing optimal filters (such as the Wiener filter and subspace transformation) are formulated from the mean-square error (MSE) criterion. However, with the MSE formulation, many desired properties of the optimal noise-reduction filters such as the SNR behavior cannot be seen. In this paper, we present a new criterion based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). We show that in the context of noise reduction the squared PCC (SPCC) has many appealing properties and can be used as an optimization cost function to derive many optimal and suboptimal noise-reduction filters. The clear advantage of using the SPCC over the MSE is that the noise-reduction performance (in terms of the SNR improvement and speech distortion) of the resulting optimal filters can be easily analyzed. This shows that, as far as noise reduction is concerned, the SPCC-based cost function serves as a more natural criterion to optimize as compared to the MSE.

The basic idea of the IA is to collect interval endpoint data for a word from a group of subjects, map each subject's data interval into a prespecified type-1 (T1) person membership function, interpret the latter as an embedded T1 FS of an IT2 FS, and obtain a mathematical model for the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) for the word from these T1 FSs. The IA consists of two parts: the data part and the FS part. In the data part, the interval endpoint data are preprocessed, after which data statistics are computed for the surviving data intervals. In the FS part, the data are used to decide whether the word should be modeled as an interior, left-shoulder, or right-shoulder FOU. Then, the parameters of the respective embedded T1 MFs are determined using the data statistics and uncertainty measures for the T1 FS models.

The technique is specifically intended to deal with some of the drawbacks concerning the use of conventional fuzzy logic (i.e. rule-based) methods in FMEA. In the proposed approach, subjective belief degrees are assigned to the consequent part of the rules to model the incompleteness encountered in establishing the knowledge base. A Bayesian reasoning mechanism is then used to aggregate all relevant rules for assessing and prioritizing potential failure modes. A series of case studies of collision risk between a floating, production, storage, and off loading (FPSO) system and a shuttle tanker caused by technical failure during tandem off loading operation is used to illustrate the application of the proposed model. The reliability of the new approach is tested by using a benchmarking technique (with a well-established fuzzy rule-based evidential reasoning method), and a sensitivity analysis of failure priority values.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2008.928208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4585405","Bayesian reasoning;FMEA;fuzzy rule base;maritime risk analysis","Fuzzy reasoning;Bayesian methods;Fuzzy logic;Failure analysis;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Production systems;Risk analysis;Aggregates;Testing","","268","","30","IEEE","1 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Environmental concerns that arise due to the operation of fossil fuel fired electric generators, transforms the classical problem into multiobjective environmental/economic dispatch (EED). In this paper, a fuzzy clustering-based particle swarm (FCPSO) algorithm has been proposed to solve the highly constrained EED problem involving conflicting objectives. FCPSO uses an external repository to preserve nondominated particles found along the search process. The proposed fuzzy clustering technique, manages the size of the repository within limits without destroying the characteristics of the Pareto front. Niching mechanism has been incorporated to direct the particles towards lesser explored regions of the Pareto front. To avoid entrapment into local optima and enhance the exploratory capability of the particles, a self-adaptive mutation operator has been proposed. In addition, the algorithm incorporates a fuzzy-based feedback mechanism and iteratively uses the information to determine the compromise solution. The algorithm's performance has been examined over the standard IEEE 30 bus six-generator test system, whereby it generated a uniformly distributed Pareto front whose optimality has been authenticated by benchmarking against the epsiv -constraint method. Results also revealed that the proposed approach obtained high-quality solutions and was able to provide a satisfactory compromise solution in almost all the trials, thereby validating the efficacy and applicability of the proposed approach over the real-world multiobjective optimization problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2007.913121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454712","Environmental/economic dispatch (EED);multiobjective optimization;Pareto front;particle swarm","Particle swarm optimization;Clustering algorithms;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Environmental economics;Fuel economy;Iterative algorithms;Constraint optimization;Fossil fuels;Generators","","268","","44","IEEE","22 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So, their detection is necessary for both screening the pathology and follow up (progression measurement). Automating this task, which is currently performed manually, would bring more objectivity and reproducibility. We propose to detect them by locally matching a lesion template in sub- bands of wavelet transformed images. To improve the method performance, we have searched for the best adapted wavelet within the lifting scheme framework. The optimization process is based on a genetic algorithm followed by Powell's direction set descent. Results are evaluated on 120 retinal images analyzed by an expert and the optimal wavelet is compared to different conventional mother wavelets. These images are of three different modalities: there are color photographs, green filtered photographs, and angiographs. Depending on the imaging modality, microaneurysms were detected with a sensitivity of respectively 89.62%, 90.24%, and 93.74% and a positive predictive value of respectively 89.50%, 89.75%, and 91.67%, which is better than previously published methods.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2008.920619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4547597","Diabetic retinopathy;genetic algorithm;microaneurysms;optimal wavelet transform;template matching;diabetic retinopathy;microaneurysms;template matching;optimal wavelet transform;genetic algorithm","Wavelet transforms;Retina;Lesions;Wavelet analysis;Diabetes;Retinopathy;Pathology;Reproducibility of results;Genetic algorithms;Image analysis","Algorithms;Aneurysm;Artificial Intelligence;Diabetic Retinopathy;Fluorescein Angiography;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Retinal Artery;Retinoscopy;Sensitivity and Specificity","267","3","41","IEEE","20 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method provides a new higher-level layer to the traditional surveillance pipeline for anomalous event detection and scene model feedback. Pixel level probability density functions (pdfs) of appearance have been used for background modelling in the past, but modelling pixel level pdfs of object speed and size from the tracks is novel. Each pdf is modelled as a multivariate Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the motion (destination location & transition time) and the size (width & height) parameters of the objects at that location. Output of the tracking module is used to perform unsupervised EM-based learning of every GMM. We have successfully used the proposed scene model to detect local as well as global anomalies in object tracks. We also show the use of this scene model to improve object detection through pixel-level parameter feedback of the minimum object size and background learning rate. Most object path modelling approaches first cluster the tracks into major paths in the scene, which can be a source of error. We avoid this by building local pdfs that capture a variety of tracks which are passing through them.

Therefore in practice, only a limited number of base stations (BSs) can cooperate in order for the overhead to be affordable. The intrinsic problem of which BSs shall cooperate in a realistic scenario has been only partially investigated. In this contribution linear beamforming has been considered for the sum-rate maximisation of the uplink. A novel dynamic greedy algorithm for the formation of the clusters of cooperating BSs is presented for a cellular network incorporating MCP. This approach is chosen to be evaluated under a fair MS scheduling scenario (round-robin). The objective of the clustering algorithm is sum-rate maximisation of the already selected MSs. The proposed cooperation scheme is compared with some fixed cooperation clustering schemes. It is shown that a dynamic clustering approach with a cluster consisting of 2 cells outperforms static coordination schemes with much larger cluster sizes.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-2075-9","10.1109/ICC.2008.757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4533793","","Wireless networks;Clustering algorithms;Radiofrequency interference;Array signal processing;Round robin;Downlink;Channel state information;MIMO;Antenna arrays;Land mobile radio cellular systems","","266","40","15","IEEE","30 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These issues are addressed in this paper by designing different tradeoff schemes during different stages of a search process to obtain an appropriate tradeoff between objective function and constraint violations. In addition, a simple evolutionary strategy (ES) is used as the search engine. By integrating ATM with ES, a generic constrained optimization evolutionary algorithm (ATMES) is derived.

The topology comprises a high-frequency three-winding transformer and three half-bridges, one of which is a boost half-bridge interfacing a power port with a wide operating voltage. The three half-bridges are coupled by the transformer, thereby providing galvanic isolation for all the power ports. The converter is controlled by phase shift, which achieves the primary power flow control, in combination with pulsewidth modulation (PWM). Because of the particular structure of the boost half-bridge, voltage variations at the port can be compensated for by operating the boost half-bridge, together with the other two half-bridges, at an appropriate duty cycle to keep a constant voltage across the half-bridge. The resulting waveforms applied to the transformer windings are asymmetrical due to the automatic volt-seconds balancing of the half-bridges. With the PWM control it is possible to reduce the rms loss and to extend the zero-voltage switching operating range to the entire phase shift region. A fuel cell and supercapacitor generation system is presented as an embodiment of the proposed multiport topology.

An elegant approach to improve the accuracy of BCIs consists in a verification procedure directly based on the presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded right after the occurrence of an error. Several studies show the presence of ErrP in typical choice reaction tasks. However, in the context of a BCI, the central question is: “Are ErrP also elicited when the error is made by the interface during the recognition of the subject's intent?” We have thus explored whether ErrP also follow a feedback indicating incorrect responses of the simulated BCI interface. Five healthy volunteer subjects participated in a new human–robot interaction experiment, which seem to confirm the previously reported presence of a new kind of ErrP. However, in order to exploit these ErrP, we need to detect them in each single trial using a short window following the feedback associated to the response of the BCI. We have achieved an average recognition rate of correct and erroneous single trials of 83.5% and 79.2%, respectively, using a classifier built with data recorded up to three months earlier.

This exploration is performed using a matrix of scatterplots that gives an overview of the possible configurations, thumbnails of the scatterplots, and support for interactive navigation in the multidimensional space. Transitions between scatterplots are performed as animated rotations in 3D space, somewhat akin to rolling dice. Users can iteratively build queries using bounding volumes in the dataset, sculpting the query from different viewpoints to become more and more refined.

To regulate the behavior of PH systems it is natural to adopt a Passivity-Based Control (PBC) perspective, where the control objectives are achieved shaping the energy function and adding dissipation. In this paper we consider the PBC techniques of Control by Interconnection (CbI) and Standard PBC. In CbI the controller is another PH system connected to the plant (through a power-preserving interconnection) to add up their energy functions, while in Standard PBC energy shaping is achieved via static state feedback. In spite of the conceptual appeal of formulating the control problem as the interaction of dynamical systems, the current version of CbI imposes a severe restriction on the plant dissipation structure that stymies its practical application. On the other hand, Standard PBC, which is usually derived from a uninspiring and non-intuitive ldquopassive output generationrdquo viewpoint, is one of the most successful controller design techniques. The main objectives of this paper are: (1) To extend the CbI method to make it more widely applicable-in particular, to overcome the aforementioned dissipation obstacle. (2) To show that various popular variants of Standard PBC can be derived proceeding from a unified perspective. (3) To establish the connections between CbI and Standard PBC proving that the latter is obtained restricting the former to a suitable subset-providing a nice geometric interpretation to Standard PBC-and comparing the size of the set of PH plants for which they are applicable.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2008.2006930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4700845","Hamiltonian systems;interconnection;nonlinear systems;passivity;passivity-based control (PBC);stabilization","Control systems;Shape control;Control system synthesis;Power system interconnection;State feedback;Nonlinear systems;Nonlinear control systems;Mathematics;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Design methodology","","264","","36","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antecedent parts in each fuzzy rule of the SEIT2FNN are interval type-2 fuzzy sets and the fuzzy rules are of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type. The initial rule base in the SEIT2FNN is empty, and the online clustering method is proposed to generate fuzzy rules that flexibly partition the input space. To avoid generating highly overlapping fuzzy sets in each input variable, an efficient fuzzy set reduction method is also proposed. This method independently determines whether a corresponding fuzzy set should be generated in each input variable when a new fuzzy rule is generated. For parameter learning, the consequent part parameters are tuned by the rule-ordered Kalman filter algorithm for high-accuracy learning performance. Detailed learning equations on applying the rule-ordered Kalman filter algorithm to the SEIT2FNN consequent part learning, with rules being generated online, are derived. The antecedent part parameters are learned by gradient descent algorithms. The SEIT2FNN is applied to simulations on nonlinear plant modeling, adaptive noise cancellation, and chaotic signal prediction. Comparisons with other type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems in these examples verify the performance of the SEIT2FNN.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.925907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529083","Evolving system;fuzzy neural networks (FNNs);online fuzzy clustering;structure learning;type-2 fuzzy systems;Type-2 fuzzy systems;evolving system;structure learning;on-line fuzzy clustering;fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy sets;Input variables;Predictive models;Takagi-Sugeno-Kang model;Clustering methods;Nonlinear equations;Noise cancellation;Chaos;Fuzzy systems","","263","","47","IEEE","23 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, two kinds of unknown modeling errors are handled by the adaptive technique.

This results in a compressed version of the original data matrix. The solution of NMF yields a natural parts-based representation for the data. When NMF is applied for data representation, a major disadvantage is that it fails to consider the geometric structure in the data. In this paper, we develop a graph based approach for parts-based data representation in order to overcome this limitation.

In particular, in applications involving mobile sensor networks and multiagent systems, a great new challenge is the development of distributed motion algorithms that guarantee connectivity of the overall network. Motivated by the inherently discrete nature of graphs as combinatorial objects, we address this challenge using a key control decomposition. First, connectivity control of the network structure is performed in the discrete space of graphs and relies on local estimates of the network topology used, along with algebraic graph theory, to verify link deletions with respect to connectivity. Tie breaking, when multiple such link deletions can violate connectivity, is achieved by means of gossip algorithms and distributed market-based control. Second, motion control is performed in the continuous configuration space, where nearest-neighbor potential fields are used to maintain existing links in the network. Integration of the earlier controllers results in a distributed, multiagent, hybrid system, for which we show that the resulting motion always ensures connectivity of the network, while it reconfigures toward certain secondary objectives. Our approach can also account for communication time delays as well as collision avoidance and is illustrated in nontrivial computer simulations.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2008.2006233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696009","Distributed control;dynamic networks;graph connectivity;hybrid systems","Distributed control;Motion control;Sensor systems and applications;Multiagent systems;Network topology;Graph theory;Communication system control;Control systems;Delay effects;Collision avoidance","","261","","33","IEEE","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper brings out a method for designing hybrid PWM techniques involving multiple sequences to reduce line current ripple. The three proposed hybrid PWM techniques (three-zone PWM, five-zone PWM and seven zone PWM) employ three, five and seven different sequences, respectively, in every sector. Each sequence is employed in a spatial region within the sector where it results in the lowest rms current ripple over the given sampling period. The proposed techniques lead to a significant reduction in THD over CSVPWM at high line voltages. The five-zone technique results in the lowest THD among real-time techniques with uniform sampling, while the seven-zone technique is the best among real-time techniques with twin sampling rates. The superior harmonic performance of the proposed techniques over CSVPWM and existing bus-clamping PWM techniques is established theoretically as well as experimentally.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2007.907670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4391042","Harmonic analysis;harmonic distortion;hybrid PWM;induction motor drive;pulsewidth modulation (PWM);PWM inverters;space vector;space vector modulation;spread spectrum;stator flux ripple;switching sequences;Harmonic analysis;harmonic distortion;hybrid PWM;pulse width modulation;PWM inverters;space vector;space vector modulation;spread spectrum;stator flux ripple;switching sequences","Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation inverters;Voltage;Switching frequency;Sampling methods;Harmonic distortion;Switches;Pulse inverters;Pulse generation","","261","2","29","IEEE","4 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The underlying mixing model is linear; i.e., the mixed hyperspectral vectors are modeled by a linear mixture of the endmember signatures weighted by the correspondent abundance fractions. MVSA approaches hyperspectral unmixing by fitting a minimum volume simplex to the hyperspectral data, constraining the abundance fractions to belong to the probability simplex. The resulting optimization problem is solved by implementing a sequence of quadratically constrained subproblems. In a final step, the hard constraint on the abundance fractions is replaced with a hinge type loss function to account for outliers and noise. We illustrate the state-of-the-art performance of the MVSA algorithm in unmixing simulated data sets. We are mainly concerned with the realistic scenario in which the pure pixel assumption (i.e., there exists at least one pure pixel per endmember) is not fulfilled. In these conditions, the MVSA yields much better performance than the pure pixel based algorithms.","2153-7003","978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779330","Hyperspectral unmixing;Minimum volume simplex;Source separation","Algorithm design and analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Vectors;Source separation;Bayesian methods;Telecommunications;Constraint optimization;Fasteners;Layout;Inference algorithms","","260","","18","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The criterion is formulated in the form of a non-convex matrix inequality, of which a feasible solution can be obtained by solving a minimization problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

Data centers call for electric power with high availability, and a possibility to reduce the electric losses and, consequently, the need for cooling. High reliability can be achieved by using local energy sources, and by using a dc power system, the number of conversion steps, and therefore also the losses, can be reduced. The dc microgrid can also supply closely located sensitive ac loads during outages in the ac grid. The proposed dc microgrid can be operated in eight different operation modes described here, resulting in 23 transitions. The control system coordinates the operation of converters, sources, and switches used in the dc microgrid. The control system is tested in the simulation software package PSCAD/EMTDC, and the results of the most interesting transitions are presented. The results show that it is possible to use the proposed dc microgrid to supply sensitive electronic loads and also, during ac-grid outages, supply closely located sensitive ac loads. To reduce the current transients experienced by grid-connected ac/dc converters, fast grid-outage detection and fast switches are required.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2008.2006398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681939","Adaptive control;circuit transient analysis;computer facilities;dc power systems;power conversion;power distribution control;power distribution faults;power electronics","Adaptive control;Power system reliability;PSCAD;Switches;Availability;Cooling;Control systems;Switching converters;Control system synthesis;Software testing","","259","","24","IEEE","18 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This may potentially lead to subsynchronous-resonance (SSR) issues. Although SSR is a well-understood phenomenon that can be mitigated with flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices, scant information is available on the SSR problem in a series-compensated wind farm. This paper reports the potential occurrence and mitigation of SSR caused by an induction-generator (IG) effect as well as torsional interactions, in a series-compensated wind farm. SSR suppression is achieved as an additional advantage of FACTS controllers which may already be installed in the power system for achieving other objectives. In this study, a wind farm employing a self-excited induction generator is connected to the grid through a series-compensated line. A static var compensator (SVC) with a simple voltage regulator is first employed at the IG terminal in addition to the fixed shunt capacitor for dynamic reactive power support. The same SVC is shown to effectively damp SSR when equipped with an SSR damping controller. Also, a thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) that is actually installed to increase the power transfer capability of the transmission line is also shown to damp subsynchronous oscillations when provided with closed-loop current control. While both FACTS controllers-the SVC and TCSC-can effectively mitigate SSR, the performance of TCSC is shown to be superior. Extensive simulations have been carried out using EMTDC/PSCAD to validate the performance of SVC and TCSC in damping SSR.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2008.917699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550616","Flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS);self-excited induction generator (SEIG);series compensation;static VAR compensator (SVC);subsynchronous resonance (SSR);thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC);wind power systems","Resonance;Wind farms;Static VAr compensators;Power capacitors;Thyristors;Flexible AC transmission systems;PSCAD;Damping;Wind energy;Control systems","","259","","21","IEEE","24 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To successfully utilize such an array for high-resolution MIMO radar imaging, constant-modulus transmit signal synthesis and optimal receive filter design play critical roles. We present in this paper a computationally attractive cyclic optimization algorithm for the synthesis of constant-modulus transmit signals with good auto- and cross-correlation properties.

We propose a new method to solve such a problem by detecting multivalued solutions in training data. The data containing multivalued solutions are divided into groups according to derivative information using a neural network forward model such that individual groups do not have the problem of multivalued solutions. Multiple inverse models are built based on divided data groups, and are then combined to form a complete model. A comprehensive modeling methodology is proposed, which includes direct inverse modeling, segmentation, derivative division, and model combining techniques.

In some case randomness is due to the choice of a randomized network communication protocol. In other cases, randomness is simply caused by the potential unpredictability of the environment in which the distributed consensus algorithm is implemented. Conditions ensuring the convergence of these algorithms have already been proposed in the literature. As far as the rate of convergence of such algorithms, two approaches can be proposed. One is based on a mean square analysis, while a second is based on the concept of Lyapunov exponent. In this paper, by some concentration results, we prove that the mean square convergence analysis is the right approach when the number of agents is large. Differently from the existing literature, in this paper we do not stick to average preserving algorithms. Instead, we allow to reach consensus at a point which may differ from the average of the initial states. The advantage of such algorithms is that they do not require bidirectional communication among agents and thus they apply to more general contexts. Moreover, in many important contexts it is possible to prove that the displacement from the initial average tends to zero, when the number of agents goes to infinity.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497789","","Large-scale systems;Convergence;Protocols;Context;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Load management;Iterative algorithms;Bidirectional control;H infinity control","","257","","28","IEEE","25 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution of this game. We first present the formulation of a static game for the case where all secondary users have the current information of the adopted strategies and the payoff of each other. However, this assumption may not be realistic in some cognitive radio systems. Therefore, we consider the case of bounded rationality in which the secondary users gradually and iteratively adjust their strategies based on the observations on their previous strategies.

In this paper, we propose an active learning technique that efficiently updates existing classifiers by using fewer labeled data points than semisupervised methods. Further, unlike semisupervised methods, our proposed technique is well suited for learning or adapting classifiers when there is substantial change in the spectral signatures between labeled and unlabeled data. Thus, our active learning approach is also useful for classifying a series of spatially/temporally related images, wherein the spectral signatures vary across the images. Our interleaved semisupervised active learning method was tested on both single and spatially/temporally related hyperspectral data sets.

There, secondary users need to dynamically and reliably determine spectral holes, and transmit data in these resources without interfering with other parts of the frequency band. To satisfy the first, each SU has to be equipped with a spectrum analyzer. To satisfy the second, it is widely accepted that a multicarrier modulation technique should be adopted. Moreover, to maximize efficiency, it has been recognized that the side-lobes of each subcarrier band must be minimized. Much of the attention in the present literature emphasizes on the use of conventional OFDM, exploiting the fact that fast Fourier transform (FFT) as part of the OFDM modulator can also be used for channel sensing.

"Reduce and Boost: Recovering Arbitrary Sets of Jointly Sparse Vectors","M. Mishali; Y. C.

The vector model has been extended both theoretically and practically to a finite set of sparse vectors sharing a common sparsity pattern. In this paper, we treat a broader framework in which the goal is to recover a possibly infinite set of jointly sparse vectors. Extending existing algorithms to this model is difficult due to the infinite structure of the sparse vector set. Instead, we prove that the entire infinite set of sparse vectors can be recovered by solving a single, reduced-size finite-dimensional problem, corresponding to recovery of a finite set of sparse vectors. We then show that the problem can be further reduced to the basic model of a single sparse vector by randomly combining the measurements. Our approach is exact for both countable and uncountable sets, as it does not rely on discretization or heuristic techniques. To efficiently find the single sparse vector produced by the last reduction step, we suggest an empirical boosting strategy that improves the recovery ability of any given suboptimal method for recovering a sparse vector. Numerical experiments on random data demonstrate that, when applied to infinite sets, our strategy outperforms discretization techniques in terms of both run time and empirical recovery rate. In the finite model, our boosting algorithm has fast run time and much higher recovery rate than known popular methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.927802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4553693","Basis pursuit;compressed sensing;multiple measurement vectors (MMVs);sparse representation;Basis pursuit;compressed sensing;multiple measurement vectors (MMV);sparse representation","Vectors;Compressed sensing;Area measurement;Boosting;Extraterrestrial measurements;Sparse matrices;Image coding;Digital audio players;Transform coding;Wireless communication","","256","4","27","IEEE","27 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article addresses this problem for the locomotion of an amphibious snake robot, and aims at identifying fast swimming and crawling gaits for a variety of environments. Our approach uses a locomotion controller based on the biological concept of central pattern generators (CPGs) together with a gradient-free optimization method, Powell's method. A key aspect of our approach is that the gaits are optimized online, i.e., while moving, rather than as an off-line optimization process. We present various experiments with the real robot and in simulation: swimming, crawling on horizontal ground, and crawling on slopes. For each of these different situations, the optimized gaits are compared with the results of systematic explorations of the parameter space. The main outcomes of the experiments are: 1) optimal gaits are significantly different from one medium to the other; 2) the optimums are usually peaked, i.e., speed rapidly becomes suboptimal when the parameters are moved away from the optimal values; 3) our approach finds optimal gaits in much fewer iterations than the systematic search; and 4) the CPG has no problem dealing with the abrupt parameter changes during the optimization process. The relevance for robotic locomotion control is discussed.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2008.915426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459741","Amphibious snake robot;locomotion control;online optimization;serpentine crawling;swimming","Robot kinematics;Centralized control;Animals;Biomimetics;Optimization methods;Robot control;Mobile robots;Torque control;Biological control systems;Orbital robotics","","254","","47","IEEE","3 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. By combining the weak classifiers for continuous features and the weak classifiers for categorical features into a strong classifier, the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced conversions between continuous and categorical features.

The main objective of the paper is to perform comparative analysis of different approaches to spectral signal representation such as power spectral density (PSD) techniques, atomic decompositions, time-frequency (t-f) energy distributions, continuous and discrete wavelet approaches, from which band power features can be extracted and used in the framework of MI classification. The emphasis is on identifying discriminative properties of the feature sets representing EEG trials recorded during imagination of either left- or right-hand movement. Feature separability is quantified in the offline study using the classification accuracy (CA) rate obtained with linear and nonlinear classifiers. PSD approaches demonstrate the most consistent robustness and effectiveness in extracting the distinctive spectral patterns for accurately discriminating between left and right MI induced EEGs. This observation is based on an analysis of data recorded from eleven subjects over two sessions of BCI experiments.

A key challenge in operating these radios as a network is how to implement an efficient medium access control (MAC) mechanism that can adaptively and efficiently allocate transmission powers and spectrum among CRs according to the surrounding environment. Most existing works address this issue via suboptimal heuristic approaches or centralized solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel joint power/channel allocation scheme that improves the performance through a distributed pricing approach. In this scheme, the spectrum allocation problem is modeled as a noncooperative game, with each CR pair acting as a player. A price-based iterative water-filling (PIWF) algorithm is proposed, which enables CR users to reach a good Nash equilibrium (NE). This PIWF algorithm can be implemented distributively with CRs repeatedly negotiating their best transmission powers and spectrum. Simulation results show that the social optimality of the NE solution is dramatically improved through pricing. Depending on the different orders according to which CRs take actions, we study sequential and parallel versions of the PIWF algorithm. We show that the parallel version converges faster than the sequential version. We then propose a corresponding MAC protocol to implement our resource management schemes. The proposed MAC allows multiple CR pairs to be first involved in an admission phase, then iteratively negotiate their transmission powers and spectrum via control-packet exchanges. Following the negotiation phase, CRs proceed concurrently with their data transmissions. Simulations are used to study the performance of our protocol and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of improving the overall network throughput and reducing the average power consumption.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2007.914877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4453897","Cognitive radio networks (CRNs);iterative water-filling (IWF);medium access control (MAC) protocol design;power/rate control;spectrum management","Radio spectrum management;Cognitive radio;Chromium;Iterative algorithms;Media Access Protocol;Pricing;Channel allocation;Nash equilibrium;Resource management;Data communication","","253","1","34","IEEE","15 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each feature set is modeled by a hypergraph where the complex relations are represented by hyper-edges. A match between the feature sets is then modeled as a hypergraph matching problem. We derive the hyper-graph matching problem in a probabilistic setting represented by a convex optimization. First, we formalize a soft matching criterion that emerges from a probabilistic interpretation of the problem input and output, as opposed to previous methods that treat soft matching as a mere relaxation of the hard matching problem. Second, the model induces an algebraic relation between the hyper-edge weight matrix and the desired vertex-to-vertex probabilistic matching. Third, the model explains some of the graph matching normalization proposed in the past on a heuristic basis such as doubly stochastic normalizations of the edge weights. A key benefit of the model is that the global optimum of the matching criteria can be found via an iterative successive projection algorithm. The algorithm reduces to the well known Sinkhorn [15] row/column matrix normalization procedure in the special case when the two graphs have the same number of vertices and a complete matching is desired. Another benefit of our model is the straight-forward scalability from graphs to hyper-graphs.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587500","","Stochastic processes;Projection algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Scalability;Computer science;Image databases;Image recognition;Optimal matching;Pixel;Object recognition","","252","5","18","IEEE","5 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We formulate several versions of the connectivity constraint and show that the corresponding optimization problems are all NP-hard. For some of these versions we propose two optimization algorithms: (i) a practical heuristic technique which we call DijkstraGC, and (ii) a slow method based on problem decomposition which provides a lower bound on the problem.

This channel generalizes the classical MAC model in that each user also receives channel outputs, and hence may obtain the confidential information sent by the other user from the channel output it receives. However, each user views the other user as a wiretapper or eavesdropper, and wishes to keep its confidential information as secret as possible from the other user. The level of secrecy of the confidential information is measured by the equivocation rate, i.e., the entropy rate of the confidential information conditioned on channel outputs at the wiretapper (the other user). The performance measure is the rate-equivocation tuple that includes the common rate, two private rates, and two equivocation rates as components. The set that includes all achievable rate-equivocation tuples is referred to as the capacity-equivocation region. The case of perfect secrecy is particularly of interest, in which each user's confidential information is perfectly hidden from the other user. The set that includes all achievable rates with perfect secrecy is referred to as the secrecy capacity region. For the MAC with two confidential messages, in which both users have confidential messages for the destination, inner bounds on the capacity-equivocation region, and secrecy capacity region are obtained. It is demonstrated that there is a tradeoff between the two equivocation rates (secrecy levels) achieved for the two confidential messages. For the MAC with one confidential message, in which only one user (user 1) has private (confidential) information for the destination, inner and outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation region are derived. These bounds match partially, and hence the capacity-equivocation region is partially characterized. Furthermore, the outer bound provides a tight converse for the case of perfect secrecy, and hence establishes the secrecy capacity region. A class of degraded MACs with one confidential message is further studied, and the capacity-equivocation region and the secrecy capacity region are established. These results are further explored via two example channels: the binary and Gaussian MACs.

Lower bounds on the cost associated with the optimal switching control strategy are derived from the determination of a feasible solution to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman inequality. An upper bound on the optimal cost associated with a closed-loop stabilizing switching strategy is provided as well. The solution of the output feedback problem is based on the construction of a full-order linear switched filter whose state variable is used by the mechanism for the determination of the switching rule. Throughout, the theoretical results are illustrated by means of academic examples. A realistic practical application related to the optimal control of semiactive suspensions in road vehicles is reported.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2008.919860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4484198","Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs);output feedback control;switched systems","Output feedback;Linear feedback control systems;Control systems;Linear systems;Open loop systems;Stability analysis;Cost function;Optimal control;Vehicle dynamics;Control design","","251","","24","IEEE","8 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This waveform diversity offered by MIMO radar enables superior capabilities compared with a standard phased-array radar. One of the common practices in radar has been range compression. We first address the question of ldquoto compress or not to compressrdquo by considering both the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) and the sufficient statistic for parameter estimation. Next, we consider MIMO radar waveform optimization for parameter estimation for the general case of multiple targets in the presence of spatially colored interference and noise. We optimize the probing signal vector of a MIMO radar system by considering several design criteria, including minimizing the trace, determinant, and the largest eigenvalue of the CRB matrix. We also consider waveform optimization by minimizing the CRB of one of the target angles only or one of the target amplitudes only. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches we consider herein.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.901653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359542","CramÉr–Rao bound (CRB);MIMO radar;space-time adaptive processing (STAP);waveform optimization;CramÉr-Rao bound (CRB);MIMO radar;space-time adaptive processing (STAP);waveform optimization","MIMO;Radar antennas;Parameter estimation;Transmitting antennas;Statistics;Interference;Colored noise;Design optimization;Signal design;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","251","","35","IEEE","18 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In both steps, we make the hypothesis that target statistics are at least approximately known.

The objective function to be minimized is the present value of total installation costs (feeders and substations), of operating and maintaining the network, and of distributed generation. The model takes operational constraints on equipment capacities and voltage limits together into account with logical constraints, aimed at reducing the search space.

Therefore, investigation of techniques for congestion-free wheeling of power is of paramount interest. One of the most practiced and an obvious technique of congestion management is rescheduling the power outputs of generators in the system. However, all generators in the system need not take part in congestion management. Development of sound formulation and appropriate solution technique for this problem is aimed in this paper. Contributions made in the present paper are twofold. Firstly a technique for optimum selection of participating generators has been introduced using generator sensitivities to the power flow on congested lines. Secondly this paper proposes an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) which minimizes the deviations of rescheduled values of generator power outputs from scheduled levels. The PSO algorithm, reported in this paper, handles the binding constraints by a technique different from the traditional penalty function method. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been analyzed on IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems and the 39-bus New England system.

The proposed method can be very useful in many areas, especially in image security and authentication. For instance, when two or more images are spliced together, to create high quality and consistent image forgeries, almost always geometric transformations, such as scaling, rotation, or skewing are needed. These procedures are typically based on a resampling and interpolation step. By having a method capable of detecting the traces of resampling, we can significantly reduce the successful usage of such forgeries. Among other points, the presented method is also very useful in estimation of the geometric transformations factors.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2004.924603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4540058","Digital forgery;image forensics;interpolation;interpolation detection;resampling;resampling detection;tampering detection","Authentication;Interpolation;Forgery;Signal processing;Signal analysis;Security;Digital images;Forensics;Periodic structures;Statistics","","249","","15","IEEE","13 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Light propagation in an underwater environment encounters scattering effect creating dispersion which introduces inter-symbol-interference to the data communication. The attenuation effect further reduces the signal to noise ratio. Both scattering and absorption have adverse effects on underwater data communication. Using a channel model based on radiative transfer theory, we can quantify the scattering effect as a function of distance and bit rate by numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We also investigate the polarization behavior of light in the underwater environment, showing the significance of the cross-polarization component when the light encounters more scattering.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.081202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4686801","underwater communication, radiative transfer, polarization, scattering, wireless optical communication","Wireless communication;Optical fiber communication;Optical scattering;Light scattering;Optical polarization;Data communication;Equations;Optical propagation;Dispersion;Optical attenuators","","249","1","21","IEEE","25 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This categorization method makes it possible to construct trojan models and then lower the cost of testing. Path delays of nominal chips are collected to construct a series of fingerprints, each one representing one aspect of the total characteristics of a genuine design. Chips are validated by comparing their delay parameters to the fingerprints. The comparison of path delays makes small trojan circuits significant from a delay point of view.

Using SPLs seeks to maximize reusable variation and eliminate wasteful generic development of components used only once. Although traditional SPL engineering recognizes that variation points are bound at different stages of development, and possibly also at runtime, it typically binds variation points before delivery of the software. In contrast, DSPL engineers typically aren't concerned with pre-runtime variation points.

The density is controlled by white-space reallocation using partitioning and cut-line shifting during GP and cell sliding during detailed placement.

In order to solve these problems, a novel phase-shift plus pulsewidth modulation (PSP) control ZVS bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed in this paper. By adopting active clamping branch and PSP technology, the converter can realize ZVS for all switches in a wide range of load variation while input or output voltage varies.

We report an automated approach for segmenting (anisotropic) 3-D macular OCT scans into five layers. Each macular OCT dataset consisted of six linear radial scans centered at the fovea. The six surfaces defining the five layers were identified on each 3-D composite image by transforming the segmentation task into that of finding a minimum-cost closed set in a geometric graph constructed from edge/regional information and a priori determined surface smoothness and interaction constraints. The method was applied to the macular OCT scans of 12 patients (24 3-D composite image datasets) with unilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). Using the average of three experts' tracings as a reference standard resulted in an overall mean unsigned border positioning error of 6.1 plusmn 2.9 mum, a result comparable to the interobserver variability (6.9 plusmn 3.3 mum).Our quantitative analysis of the automated segmentation results from AION subject data revealed that the inner retinal layer thickness for the affected eye was 24.1 mum (21%) smaller on average than for the unaffected eye (p < 0.001), supporting the need for segmenting the layers separately.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2008.923966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4494387","Ophthalmology;optical coherence tomography;retina;segmentation;3-D graph search;optical coherence tomography;ophthalmology;retina;segmentation;3-D graph search","Image segmentation;Tomography;Cities and towns;Biomedical optical imaging;Retina;Biomedical imaging;Geometrical optics;Biomedical engineering;Medical diagnostic imaging;Oncology","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Macula Lutea;Macular Degeneration;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, Optical Coherence","247","8","22","IEEE","22 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In evaluating these previous approaches we introduce a new tool in the form of a database of 568 high-quality, indoor and outdoor images, accurately labelled with illuminant, and preserved in their raw form, free of correction or normalisation. This has enabled us to establish several properties experimentally. Firstly automatic selection of grey-world algorithms according to image properties is not nearly so effective as has been thought. Secondly, it is shown that Bayesian illuminant estimation is significantly improved by the improved accuracy of priors for illuminant and reflectance that are obtained from the new dataset.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587765","","Bayesian methods;Layout;Reflectivity;Lighting;Testing;Cameras;Image databases;Object recognition;Image resolution;Yield estimation","","246","19","16","IEEE","5 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Parallelism-Aware Batch Scheduling: Enhancing both Performance and Fairness of Shared DRAM Systems","O. Mutlu; T. Moscibroda","Microsoft Research Limited, USA; Microsoft Research Limited, USA",2008 International Symposium on Computer Architecture,"15 Jul 2008","2008","","","63","74","In a chip-multiprocessor (CMP) system, the DRAM system is shared among cores. In a shared DRAM system, requests from a thread can not only delay requests from other threads by causing bank/bus/row-buffer conflicts but they can also destroy other threadspsilaDRAM-bank-level parallelism. Requests whose latencies would otherwise have been overlapped could effectively become serialized. As are sult both fairness and system throughput degrade, and some thread scan starve for long time periods. This paper proposes a fundamentally new approach to designing a shared DRAM controller that provides quality of service to threads,while also improving system throughput. Our parallelism-aware batch scheduler (PAR-BS) design is based on two key ideas. First, PARBS processes DRAM requests in batches to provide fairness and to avoid starvation of requests. Second, to optimize system throughput,PAR-BS employs a parallelism-aware DRAM scheduling policy that aims to process requests from a thread in parallel in the DRAM banks, thereby reducing the memory-related stall-time experienced by the thread. PAR-BS seamlessly incorporates support for system-level thread priorities and can provide different service levels, including purely opportunistic service, to threads with different priorities.We evaluate the design trade-offs involved in PAR-BS and compare it to four previously proposed DRAM scheduler designs on 4-, 8-, and16-core systems. Our evaluations show that, averaged over 100 4-core workloads, PAR-BS improves fairness by 1.11X and system through put by 8.3% compared to the best previous scheduling technique, Stall-Time Fair Memory (STFM) scheduling. Based on simple request prioritization rules, PAR-BS is also simpler to implement than STFM.","1063-6897","978-0-7695-3174-8","10.1109/ISCA.2008.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4556716","Memory systems;quality of service;multi-core systems;chip multiprocessors;DRAM systems;fairness;memory scheduling;memory-level parallelism","Random access memory;Yarn;Throughput;Interference;Control systems;Scheduling algorithm;Computer architecture;Delay;Degradation;System software","","245","16","44","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method is proposed by combining quantum theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by the state superposition principle and quantum parallelism, a framework of a value-updating algorithm is introduced. The state (action) in traditional RL is identified as the eigen state (eigen action) in QRL. The state (action) set can be represented with a quantum superposition state, and the eigen state (eigen action) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state according to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The probability of the eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is updated in parallel according to rewards. Some related characteristics of QRL such as convergence, optimality, and balancing between exploration and exploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude and can speedup learning through the quantum parallelism. To evaluate the performance and practicability of QRL, several simulated experiments are given, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QRL algorithm for some complex problems.

Constant time means that the computation time of the filtering remains same even if the filter size becomes very large. Our first method takes advantage of the integral histograms to avoid the redundant operations for bilateral filters with box spatial and arbitrary range kernels. For bilateral filters constructed by polynomial range and arbitrary spatial filters, our second method provides a direct formulation by using linear filters of image powers without any approximation. Lastly, we show that Gaussian range and arbitrary spatial bilateral filters can be expressed by Taylor series as linear filter decompositions without any noticeable degradation of filter response. All these methods drastically decrease the computation time by cutting it down constant times (e.g. to 0.06 seconds per 1MB image) while achieving very high PSNRpsilas over 45 dB.

Binary power control (BPC) has the advantage of leading towards simpler or even distributed power control algorithms. For N>2 we propose a strategy based on checking the corners of the domain resulting from the power constraints to perform BPC. We identify scenarios in which binary power allocation can be proven optimal also for arbitrary N.

This paper outlines the loss mechanisms that limit conversion efficiency of the LSC and highlights the role that advanced materials can play. Losses include nonunity fluorescence quantum yield (FQY), reabsorption losses, incomplete utilization of the solar spectrum, and escape cone losses. Long-term photostability is also discussed as it is essential for commercial feasibility of any solar technology. Past and current techniques, designed to reduce these losses, are described and their experimental achievements are discussed.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2008.920282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4519812","Fluorescent;luminescent;photovoltaic (PV);quantum yield;solar concentrator;Fluorescent;luminescent;photovoltaic (PV);quantum yield;solar concentrator","Solar power generation;Luminescence;Fluorescence;Photovoltaic cells;Sheet materials;Photovoltaic systems;Power generation;Energy conversion;Solar energy;Organic materials","","243","15","94","IEEE","14 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the benefits cannot be readily harnessed for interventional procedures due to difficulties that surround the use of high-field (1.5T or greater) MRI. The inability to use conventional mechatronics and the confined physical space makes it extremely challenging to access the patient. We have designed a robotic assistant system that overcomes these difficulties and promises safe and reliable intraprostatic needle placement inside closed high-field MRI scanners. MRI compatibility of the robot has been evaluated under 3T MRI using standard prostate imaging sequences and average SNR loss is limited to 5%. Needle alignment accuracy of the robot under servo pneumatic control is better than 0.94 mm rms per axis. The complete system workflow has been evaluated in phantom studies with accurate visualization and targeting of five out of five 1 cm targets.

We show that all interesting points on the Pareto boundary correspond to transmit strategies where both systems use the maximum available power. We then argue that there is a fundamental need for base station cooperation when performing spectrum sharing with multiple transmit antennas. More precisely, we show that if the systems do not cooperate, there is a unique Nash equilibrium which is inefficient in the sense that the achievable rate is bounded by a constant, regardless of the available transmit power. An extension of this result to the case where the receivers use successive interference cancellation (SIC) is also provided. Next we model the problem of agreeing on beamforming vectors as a non-transferable utility (NTU) cooperative gametheoretic problem, with the two operators as players. Specifically we compute numerically the Nash bargaining solution, which is a likely resolution of the resource conflict assuming that the players are rational. Numerical experiments indicate that selfish but cooperating operators may achieve a performance which is close to the maximum-sum-rate bound.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604732","multiple-input;single-output channel;interference channel;non-cooperative game theory;cooperative game theory","Interference channels;Base stations;Array signal processing;Transmitting antennas;Game theory;Nash equilibrium;Interference cancellation;Silicon carbide;Mobile communication;Councils","","243","2","26","IEEE","22 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our study is based on about one thousand hours of GPS traces involving 44 volunteers in various outdoor settings including two different college campuses, a metropolitan area, a theme park and a state fair. This paper shows that many statistical features of human walks follow truncated power-law, showing evidence of scale-freedom and do not conform to the central limit theorem. These traits are similar to those of Levy walks. It is conjectured that the truncation, which makes the mobility deviate from pure Levy walks, comes from geographical constraints including walk boundary, physical obstructions and traffic. None of commonly used mobility models for mobile networks captures these properties. Based on these findings, we construct a simple Levy walk mobility model which is versatile enough in emulating diverse statistical patterns of human walks observed in our traces. The model is also used to recreate similar power-law inter-contact time distributions observed in previous human mobility studies. Our network simulation indicates that the Levy walk features are important in characterizing the performance of mobile network routing performance.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509740","","Humans;Biological system modeling;Global Positioning System;Gaussian distribution;Animals;Urban areas;Communications Society;Computer science;Birds;Educational institutions","","243","","23","IEEE","2 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is less clear whether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by-side. The paper evaluates the three visualizations for both analysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors.

UPS requires no time synchronization and provides location privacy at underwater vehicles/sensors whose locations need to be determined. To study the performance of UPS, we model the underwater acoustic channel as a modified ultrawideband Saleh-Valenzuela model: The arrival of each path cluster and the paths within each cluster follow double Poisson distributions, and the multipath channel gain follows a Rician distribution. Based on this channel model, we perform both theoretical analysis and simulation study on the position error of UPS under acoustic fading channels.

Along with developing the fundamentals of being able to confidently predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the technology calls for fielded applications as it inches towards maturation. This requires a stringent performance evaluation so that the significance of the concept can be fully exploited. Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end-user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few issues. Instead, the research community has used a variety of metrics based largely on convenience with respect to their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a common ground to compare different efforts. This paper surveys the metrics that are already used for prognostics in a variety of domains including medicine, nuclear, automotive, aerospace, and electronics. It also considers other domains that involve prediction-related tasks, such as weather and finance. Differences and similarities between these domains and health maintenance have been analyzed to help understand what performance evaluation methods may or may not be borrowed. Further, these metrics have been categorized in several ways that may be useful in deciding upon a suitable subset for a specific application. Some important prognostic concepts have been defined using a notational framework that enables interpretation of different metrics coherently. Last, but not the least, a list of metrics has been suggested to assess critical aspects of RUL predictions before they are fielded in real applications.","","978-1-4244-1935-7","10.1109/PHM.2008.4711436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4711436","Prognostics and Health Management;Performance Metrics","NASA;Prognostics and health management;Measurement;Conference management;Certification;Performance evaluation;Testing;Space vehicles;Computer science;Mission critical systems","","242","1","21","IEEE","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eigenfeatures are regularized differently in these three subspaces based on an eigenspectrum model to alleviate problems of instability, overfitting, or poor generalization. This also enables the discriminant evaluation performed in the whole space. Feature extraction or dimensionality reduction occurs only at the final stage after the discriminant assessment. These efforts facilitate a discriminative and a stable low-dimensional feature representation of the face image. Experiments comparing the proposed approach with some other popular subspace methods on the FERET, ORL, AR, and GT databases show that our method consistently outperforms others.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359331","Face recognition;linear discriminant analysis;regularization;feature extraction;subspace methods;Face recognition;linear discriminant analysis;regularization;feature extraction;subspace methods","Face recognition;Linear discriminant analysis;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Null space;Light scattering;Data mining;Image analysis;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Matrix decomposition","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","241","","42","IEEE","21 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These local fragments allow recognition that is robust to within-class variation, pose changes, and articulation. Boosting combines these fragments into a cascaded sliding-window classifier, and mean shift is used to select strong responses as a final set of detection. We show how learning can be performed iteratively on both training and test sets to bootstrap an improved classifier.

Distributed averaging algorithms fail to achieve consensus when deterministic uniform quantization is adopted. We propose a distributed algorithm in which the nodes utilize probabilistically quantized information, i.e., dithered quantization, to communicate with each other. The algorithm we develop is a dynamical system that generates sequences achieving a consensus at one of the quantization values almost surely. In addition, we show that the expected value of the consensus is equal to the average of the original sensor data. We derive an upper bound on the mean-square-error performance of the probabilistically quantized distributed averaging (PQDA). Moreover, we show that the convergence of the PQDA is monotonic by studying the evolution of the minimum-length interval containing the node values. We reveal that the length of this interval is a monotonically nonincreasing function with limit zero. We also demonstrate that all the node values, in the worst case, converge to the final two quantization bins at the same rate as standard unquantized consensus. Finally, we report the results of simulations conducted to evaluate the behavior and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.927071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4542554","Average consensus;distributed algorithms;dithering;probabilistic quantization;sensor networks;Distributed algorithm;average consensus;sensor networks;probabilistic quantization;dithering","Quantization;Signal processing;Bandwidth;Signal processing algorithms;Distributed algorithms;Telecommunication computing;Application software;Concurrent computing;Data compression;Computer networks","","241","","29","IEEE","13 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wireless body area networks consist of wireless sensor nodes attached to the human body to monitor vital signs such as body temperature, activity or heart-rate. The network adopts a master-slave architecture, where the body-worn slave node periodically sends sensor readings to a central master node. Unlike traditional peer-to-peer wireless sensor networks, the nodes in this biomedical WBASN are not deployed in an ad hoc fashion. Joining a network is centrally managed and all communications are single-hop. To reduce energy consumption, all the sensor nodes are in standby or sleep mode until the centrally assigned time slot. Once a node has joined a network, there is no possibility of collision within a cluster as all communication is initiated by the central node and is addressed uniquely to a slave node. To avoid collisions with nearby transmitters, a clear channel assessment algorithm based on standard listen-before-transmit (LBT) is used. To handle time slot overlaps, the novel concept of a wakeup fallback time is introduced. Using single-hop communication and centrally controlled sleep/wakeup times leads to significant energy reductions for this application compared to more ldquoflexiblerdquo network MAC protocols such as 802.11 or Zigbee. As duty cycle is reduced, the overall power consumption approaches the standby power. The protocol is implemented in hardware as part of the Sensiumtrade system-on-chip WBASN ASIC, in a 0.13- mum CMOS process.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2008.2003431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4668460","Hardware MAC;MAC Protocol;wireless body area sensor network;wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks;Energy efficiency;Access protocols;Peer to peer computing;Biosensors;Media Access Protocol;Temperature sensors;Master-slave;Energy consumption;Wireless application protocol","","240","","21","IEEE","18 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we discuss security issues that may pose a serious threat to spectrum sensing.

The state space for a cognitive radio is made up of a variety of learned beliefs and current sensor inputs. By manipulating radio sensor inputs, an adversary can affect the beliefs of a radio, and consequently its behavior. In this paper we focus primarily on PHY-layer issues, describing several classes of attacks and giving specific examples for dynamic spectrum access and adaptive radio scenarios. These attacks demonstrate the capabilities of an attacker who can manipulate the spectral environment when a radio is learning. The most powerful of which is a self-propagating AI virus that could interactively teach radios to become malicious. We then describe some approaches for mitigating the effectiveness of these attacks by instilling some level of ""common sense"" into radio systems, and requiring learned beliefs to expire and be relearned.

These methods use information of the sample distribution of local statistics of the image, such as the local variance, the local mean, and the local mean square value. Accordingly, the dynamic estimation of noise leads to a recursive version of the LMMSE, which shows a good performance in both noise cleaning and feature preservation.

Of the numerous algorithms for this purpose, perturb and observe (P&O) is a standard. A derivative of gradient ascent method used in the optimization theory, this algorithm introduces a tradeoff between tracking and dynamic performance. This algorithm also has a tendency to drift the system away from the MPP as atmospheric conditions change. With continually changing atmospheric conditions, these inadequacies lead to poor utilization of solar arrays. This paper addresses both the issues. A variable-step-length algorithm is proposed to eliminate the tradeoff. The drift is minimized by evaluating the entire trend in a power versus voltage curve.

Unfortunately, on-chip inductors are physically large and have poor series resistances, which result in low-efficiency converters. To mitigate this problem, on-chip magnetic coupling is exploited in the proposed stacked interleaved topology to enable the use of small (2 nH) on-chip inductors in a high-efficiency buck converter. The dramatic decrease in the inductance value is made possible by the unique bridge timing of the stacked design that causes magnetic coupling to boost the converter's efficiency by reducing the current ripple in each inductor. The magnetic coupling is realized by stacking the two inductors on top of one another, which not only lowers the required inductance, but also reduces the chip area consumed by the two inductors. The measured conversion efficiency for the prototype circuit, implemented in a 130-nm CMOS technology, shows more than a 15% efficiency improvement over a linear converter for low output voltages rising to a peak efficiency of 77.9 % for a 0.9 V output. These efficiencies are comparable to converters implemented with higher Q inductors, validating that the proposed techniques enable high-efficiency converters to be realized with small on-chip inductors.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2008.917321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476514","Magnetic coupling;ripple cancellation;switch-mode voltage regulator;synchronous rectification","Inductors;Buck converters;Inductance;CMOS technology;Topology;Bridge circuits;Timing;Coupling circuits;Stacking;Semiconductor device measurement","","238","20","17","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and its extensions were proposed by IETF for IP layer mobility management. However, performance of IPv6-based mobility management schemes is highly dependent on traffic characteristics and user mobility models. Consequently, it is important to assess this performance in-depth through those two factors. The performance of IPv6-based mobility management schemes is usually evaluated through simulations. This paper proposes an analytical framework to evaluate the performance of IPv6-based mobility management protocols. This proposal does not aim to advocate which is better but rather to study the effects of various network parameters on the performance of these protocols to enlighten decision-making. The effect of system parameters, such as subnet residence time, packet arrival rate and wireless link delay, is investigated for performance evaluation with respect to various metrics like signaling overhead cost, handoff latency and packet loss. Numerical results show that there is a trade-off between performance metrics and network parameters.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2008.060725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4472015","","Performance analysis;Mobile radio mobility management;Protocols;Roaming;Next generation networking;Wireless networks;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Proposals;Decision making","","238","","22","IEEE","14 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In comparison to using expensive current sensors, this method precisely determines the load current direction by detecting which anti-parallel diode conducts in a phase-leg. A low-cost diode-conduction detector is developed to measure the operating state of the anti-parallel diode.

The ACSA is a relatively new and powerful swarm intelligence method for solving optimization problems. It is a population-based approach that uses exploration of positive feedback as well as ldquogreedyrdquo search. The ACSA was inspired from the natural behavior of ants in locating food sources and bring them back to their colony by the formation of unique trails. Therefore, through a collection of cooperative agents called ldquoants,rdquo the near-optimal solution to the feeder reconfiguration and capacitor placement problems can be effectively achieved. In addition, the ACSA applies the state transition, local pheromone-updating, and global pheromone-updating rules to facilitate the computation. Through simultaneous operation of population agents, process stagnation can be effectively prevented. Optimization capability can be significantly enhanced. The proposed approach is demonstrated using two example systems from the literature. Computational results show that simultaneously taking into account both feeder reconfiguration and capacitor placement is more effective than considering them separately.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2002169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4652577","Ant colony search algorithm (ACSA);capacitor placement;feeder reconfiguration","Capacitors;Switches;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Simulated annealing;Genetic algorithms;Power system modeling;Particle swarm optimization;Ant colony optimization;Feedback","","237","","37","IEEE","28 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Innovation survey data indicates that some service organizations behave very much like high-technology manufacturing. This is especially true of technology-based, knowledge-intensive business services (T-KIBS). Distinctive innovation patterns are displayed by KIBS based more on professional knowledge and by large network-based service firms, while many smaller service firms conform to a supplier-driven pattern. Only a small segment of service innovation conforms to the typical manufacturing-based model, in which innovation is largely organized and led by formal research and development (R&D) departments and production engineering. Project management and on-the-job innovation are common ways of organizing service innovation. Innovation policy and management have to be much more than R&D policy and R&D management: This is recognized by some national governments and in some business schools, but the full implications of a service-dominant logic are still rarely found.","0018-8670","","10.1147/sj.471.0115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5386538","","","","237","","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

Field spectral measurements were collected over corn and wheat canopies in different intensive field campaigns organized during the growing seasons of 2004 and 2005. They were used to test and evaluate several combined indices for chlorophyll determination using hyperspectral imagery (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager). Several index combinations were investigated using both PROSPECT–SAILH canopy simulated spectra and field-measured reflectances. The relationships between leaf chlorophyll content and combined optical indices have shown similar trends for both PROSPECT–SAILH simulated data and ground-measured data sets, which indicates that both spectral measurements and radiative transfer models hold comparable potential for the quantitative retrieval of crop foliar pigments. The data set used has shown that crop type had a clear influence on the establishment of predictive equations as well as on their validation. In addition to generating different predictive equations, corn and wheat data yielded contrasting agreement between estimated and measured chlorophyll contents even for the same predictive algorithm.

Since the number of radios on any node can be less than the number of available channels, the channel assignment must obey the constraint that the number of different channels assigned to the links incident on any node is at most the number of radio interfaces on that node. The above optimization problem is known to be NP-hard. We design centralized and distributed algorithms for the above channel assignment problem. To evaluate the quality of the solutions obtained by our algorithms, we develop a semidefinite program and a linear program formulation of our optimization problem to obtain lower bounds on overall network interference. Empirical evaluations on randomly generated network graphs show that our algorithms perform close to the above established lower bounds, with the difference diminishing rapidly with increase in number of radios.

Applying CIT to highly-configurable software systems is complicated by the fact that, in many such systems, there are constraints between specific configuration parameters that render certain combinations invalid. Many CIT algorithms lack a mechanism to avoid these. In recent work, automated constraint solving methods have been combined with search-based CIT construction methods to address the constraint problem with promising results. However, these techniques can incur a non-trivial overhead. In this paper, we build upon our previous work to develop a family of greedy CIT sample generation algorithms that exploit calculations made by modern Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers to prune the search space of the CIT problem. We perform a comparative evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of these algorithms on four real-world highly-configurable software systems and on a population of synthetic examples that share the characteristics of those systems. In combination our techniques reduce the cost of CIT in the presence of constraints to 30 percent of the cost of widely-used unconstrained CIT methods without sacrificing the quality of the solutions.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2008.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564473","Testing strategies;Testing tools;Testing strategies;Testing tools","System testing;Software systems;Software testing;Costs;Application software;Logic testing;Logic arrays;Production;Cameras;Computer Society","","236","4","45","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such nano-scale ldquosynapsesrdquo can be combined with CMOS ldquoneuronsrdquo to create neuromorphic hardware several orders of magnitude denser than is possible in conventional CMOS. The key ideas are: (1) to factor out two synaptic state variables to pre- and post-synaptic neurons; and (2) to separate computational communication from learning by time-division multiplexing of pulse-width-modulated signals through synapses. This approach offers the advantages of: better control over power dissipation; fewer constraints on the design of memristive materials used for nanoscale synapses; learning dynamics can be dynamically turned on or off (e.g. by attentional priming mechanisms communicated extra-synaptically); greater control over the precise form and timing of the STDP equations; the ability to implement a variety of other learning laws besides STDP; better circuit diversity since the approach allows different learning laws to be implemented in different areas of a single chip using the same memristive material for all synapses.","2327-8226","978-1-4244-2552-5","10.1109/NANOARCH.2008.4585796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4585796","adaptive systems;analog memories;learning systems;neural network hardware;nonlinear circuits","Nanoscale devices","","235","25","23","IEEE","1 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For an SRSRTask, the system searches the resource services that are qualified for its function requirements and chooses the optimal one to execute it. For an MRSRTask, in addition to the search for all qualified resource services according to each subtask, the system selects one candidate resource service for each subtask. Then the system generates a new composite resource service (CRS) and selects the optimal resource service composite path from all possible paths to execute the task with the given multi-objective (e.g., time minimization, cost minimization, and reliability maximization) and constraints. The above problem is defined as multi-objective MGrid resource service composition and optimal-selection (MO-MRSCOS) problem in this paper. The formulation is presented for an MO-MRSCOS problem to minimize execution time and cost, and maximize the reliability. The basic resource service composite modes (RSCM) for CRS are described, and the principles for translating a complicated RSCM into a simple sequence RSCM are presented for simplifying the resolving process and complexity of MO-MRSCOS. A new MGrid resource service composition and optimal-selection method, based on the principles of particle swarm optimization (PSO), is then proposed. The PSO follows a collaborative population-based search, which models based on the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling.

Multilevel multiphase technology combines the benefits of both technologies, but new modulation techniques must be developed in order to take advantage of multilevel multiphase converters. In this paper, a novel space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) algorithm for multilevel multiphase voltage source converters is presented. This algorithm is the result of the two main contributions of this paper: the demonstration that a multilevel multiphase modulator can be realized from a two-level multiphase modulator, and the development of a new two-level multiphase SVPWM algorithm. The multiphase SVPWM algorithm presented in this paper can be applied to most multilevel topologies; it has low computational complexity and it is suitable for hardware implementations.

Low gain feedback refers to a family of stabilizing state feedback gains that are parameterized in a scalar and go to zero as the scalar decreases to zero. Such feedback gains can be constructed either by an eigenstructure assignment algorithm or through the solution of a parametric algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). The eigenstructure assignment approach leads to feedback gains in the form of a matrix polynomial in the parameter, while the ARE approach requires the solution of an ARE for each value of the parameter. This note proposes an alternative approach to low gain feedback design based on the solution of a parametric Lyapunov equation. Such an approach possesses the advantages of both the eigenstructure assignment approach and the ARE-based approach. It also avoids the possible numerical stiffness in solving a parametric ARE and the structural decomposition of the open loop system that is required by the eigenstructure assignment approach.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2008.921036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4610041","Actuator saturation;global stabilization;low gain feedback;parametric Lyapunov equation;semiglobal stabilization;set invariance","State feedback;Linear systems;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Riccati equations;Hydraulic actuators;Poles and zeros;Performance gain;Robust stability;Optimal control","","234","","20","IEEE","29 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By controlling a large fraction of the nodes in the system, the malicious user is able to ldquoout voterdquo the honest users in collaborative tasks such as Byzantine failure defenses. This paper presents SybilGuard, a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks. Our protocol is based on the ldquosocial networkrdquo among user identities, where an edge between two identities indicates a human-established trust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but few trust relationships. Thus, there is a disproportionately small ldquocutrdquo in the graph between the sybil nodes and the honest nodes. SybilGuard exploits this property to bound the number of identities a malicious user can create.

It focuses on a line EMI filter and its combination with a motor EMI filter, along with their effects on attenuation of conducted emission voltage. When no EMI filter is connected, the motor drive cannot meet the conducted emission limits prescribed by Category 3 in the IEC61800-3 regulations. The reason is that the common-mode voltage generated by a voltage-source pulse width modulation (PWM) inverter causes a common-mode leakage current flowing into the ground wire lead through parasitic capacitors inside the motor. When the line EMI filter is connected, the motor drive can meet Category 3. The motor EMI filter eliminates the common-mode voltage from the motor terminals, thus bringing a drastic reduction to the leakage current. The combination of the two EMI filters can comply with the limits prescribed by Category 2, which are much stricter than those by Category 3.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2007.911878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4399717","Electromagnetic interference (EMI);leakage currents;motor drives;pulsewidth modulation (PWM) inverters","Attenuation;Electromagnetic interference;Filters;Voltage;Pulse width modulation inverters;Motor drives;Leakage current;Pulse generation;Pulse inverters;Wire","","233","","22","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These patterns enable a reliable detection of the corresponding fault as well as a clear interpretation of the physical phenomenon taking place in the machine. The proposed approach is applied to the detection of rotor asymmetries in two alternative ways, i.e., by using the startup current and by using the current during plugging stopping.

Our approach allows the topic modeling framework, specifically the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, to work in an online fashion such that it incrementally builds an up-to-date model (mixture of topics per document and mixture of words per topic) when a new document (or a set of documents) appears. A solution based on the Empirical Bayes method is proposed. The idea is to incrementally update the current model according to the information inferred from the new stream of data with no need to access previous data. The dynamics of the proposed approach also provide an efficient mean to track the topics over time and detect the emerging topics in real time. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using benchmark datasets. In our experiments, the OLDA has discovered interesting patterns by just analyzing a fraction of data at a time. Our tests also prove the ability of OLDA to align the topics across the epochs with which the evolution of the topics over time is captured.

In this way, the controllerlearns to optimize its scheduling policy on the fly to maximizelong-term performance. Our results show that an RL-basedmemory controller improves the performance of a set of parallelapplications run on a 4-core CMP by 19% on average (upto 33%), and it improves DRAM bandwidth utilization by 22%compared to a state-of-the-art controller.","1063-6897","978-0-7695-3174-8","10.1109/ISCA.2008.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4556714","Chip Multiprocessors;Memory Systems;Memory Controller;Machine Learning;Reinforcement Learning","Bandwidth;Job shop scheduling;Random access memory;Dynamic scheduling;Control systems;Delay;Automatic control;Moore's Law;Machine learning;State estimation","","231","19","49","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The antenna system consists of an array of two printed dipoles separated by a distance of a quarter wavelength. Each of the dipoles can be reconfigured in length using PIN diode switches. The switch configuration can be modified in a manner adaptive to changes in the environment. The configuration of switches effects the mutual coupling between the array elements, and subsequently, the radiation pattern of each antenna, leading to different degrees of pattern diversity which can be used to improve link capacity. The PIN diode-based reconfigurable antenna solution is first motivated through a capacity analysis of the antenna in a clustered MIMO channel model. A new definition of spatial correlation coefficient is introduced to include the effects of antenna mismatch and radiation efficiency when quantifying the benefit of pattern diversity. Next, the widespread applicability of the proposed technique is demonstrated, relative to conventional half wavelength printed dipoles, using computational electromagnetic simulation in an outdoor and indoor environment and field measurements in an indoor laboratory environment. It is shown for the 2 times 2 system considered in this paper, that an average improvement of 10% and 8% is achieved in link capacity for a signal to noise ratio (SNR) respectively of 10 dB and 20 dB in an indoor environment compared to a system employing non reconfigurable antenna arrays.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2008.916908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4463909","Antenna measurements;multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems;reconfigurable antennas;spatial correlation","Antenna arrays;MIMO;Dipole antennas;Switches;Communication switching;Indoor environments;Signal to noise ratio;Mutual coupling;Antenna radiation patterns;Diodes","","229","30","37","IEEE","5 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method can synthesize a nonuniform linear array with a reduced number of elements, and can be also used to reduce the number of elements for linear arrays designed by other synthesis techniques. In the proposed method, the desired radiation pattern is first sampled to form a discrete pattern data set. Then we organize the discrete data set in a form of Hankel matrix and perform the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix. By discarding the non-principal singular values, we obtain an optimal lower-rank approximation of the Hankel matrix. The lower-rank matrix actually corresponds to fewer antenna elements. The matrix pencil method is then utilized to reconstruct the excitation and location distributions from the approximated matrix.

Exploiting the inherent variations in the IC manufacturing process, PUFs provide a secure, robust, low cost mechanism to authenticate silicon chips.

Nanocomposites were found to absorb significantly more water than unfilled epoxy. However, the microcomposite absorbed less water than unfilled epoxy: corresponding to the reduced proportion of the epoxy in this composite. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of all the samples were measured by both differential scanning calorimetry and dielectric spectroscopy. The Tg decreased as the water absorption increased and, in all cases, corresponded to a drop of approximately 20 K as the humidity was increased from 0% to 100%. This implied that for all the samples, the amount of water in the resin component of the composites was almost identical. It was concluded that the extra water found in the nanocomposites was located around the surface of the nanoparticles. This was confirmed by measuring the water uptake, and the swelling and density change, as a function of humidity as water was absorbed. The water shell model, originally proposed by Lewis and developed by Tanaka, has been further developed to explain low frequency dielectric spectroscopy results in which percolation of charge carriers through overlapping water shells was shown to occur. This has been discussed in terms of a percolation model. At 100% relative humidity, water is believed to surround the nanoparticles with a thickness of approximately 5 monolayers. A second layer of water is proposed that is dispersed but sufficiently concentrated to be conductive; this may extend for approximately 25 nm. If all the water had existed in a single layer surrounding a nanoparticle, this layer would have been approximately 3 to 4 nm thick at 100%. This ""characteristic thickness"" of water surrounding a given size of nanoparticle appeared to be independent of the concentration of nanoparticles but approximately proportional to water uptake. Filler particles that have surfaces that are functionalized to be hydrophobic considerably reduce the amount of water absorbed in nanocomposites under the same conditions of humidity. Comments are made on the possible effect on electrical aging.","1558-4135","","10.1109/T-DEI.2008.4446741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446741","","Water;Absorption;Nanocomposites;Nanoparticles;Humidity;Dielectric measurements;Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;Epoxy resins;Silicon compounds;Glass","","227","","40","IEEE","7 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It enables operators to address new markets and introduce new high-speed services and disruptive pricing strategies to capture wireline voice minutes and to grow revenues. One of the main design challenges of the femtocell is that the hierarchical architecture and manual cell planning processes used in macrocell networks do not scale to support millions of femtocells. In this paper, a user-deployed femtocell solution based on the base station router (BSR) flat Internet Protocol (IP) cellular architecture is presented that addresses these problems, and several aspects of the proposed solution are discussed. The overall concept and key requirements are presented in detail. The auto-configuration and self-optimization process from purchase by the end user to the integration into an existing macrocellular network is described. Then the theoretical performance of a co-channel femtocell deployment is analyzed and its impact on the macrocell underlay is assessed. Finally, a financial analysis of a femtocellular home base station deployment in a macrocellular network is presented. It is shown that in urban areas, the deployment of publicly accessible home base stations with slightly increased coverage can significantly reduce the operator's annual network costs (up to 70 percent in the investigated scenario) compared to a pure macrocellular network.","1538-7305","","10.1002/bltj.20292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6768783","","","","227","17","","","29 Apr 2014","","","Nokia Bell Labs","Nokia Bell Labs Journal"

Unfortunately, it is often impossible to obtain theoretical or analytical results to compare the performance of algorithms targeting such systems. One possibility is to conduct large numbers of back-to-back experiments on real platforms. While this is possible on tightly-coupled platforms, it is infeasible on modern distributed platforms as experiments are labor-intensive and results typically not reproducible. Consequently, one must resort to simulations, which enable reproducible results and also make it possible to explore wide ranges of platform and application scenarios. In this paper we describe the SimGrid framework, a simulation-based framework for evaluating cluster, grid and P2P algorithms and heuristics. This paper focuses on SimGrid v3, which greatly improves on previous versions thanks to a novel and validated modular simulation engine that achieves higher simulation speed without hindering simulation accuracy. Also, two new user interfaces were added to broaden the targeted research community.

Due to the deviations in the direction of the magnetic field vector between locations, it is not desirable to use magnetic data in calculations that are related to the determination of roll and pitch. This paper presents a geometrically intuitive 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) orientation estimation algorithm with physical meaning [which is called the factored quaternion algorithm (FQA)], which restricts the use of magnetic data to the determination of the rotation about the vertical axis. The algorithm produces a quaternion output to represent the orientation. Through a derivation based on half-angle formulas and due to the use of quaternions, the computational cost of evaluating trigonometric functions is avoided. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has an overall accuracy that is essentially identical to that of the QUEST algorithm and is computationally more efficient. Additionally, magnetic variations cause only azimuth errors in FQA attitude estimation. A singularity avoidance method is introduced, which allows the algorithm to track through all orientations.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2007.911646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4419916","Accelerometers;inertial sensors;magnetic sensors;motion measurement;orientation estimation;quaternions;Accelerometers;inertial sensors;magnetic sensors;motion measurement;orientation estimation;quaternions","Earth;Gravity;Magnetic field measurement;Quaternions;Magnetic sensors;Accelerometers;Magnetometers;Coordinate measuring machines;Computational efficiency;Azimuth","","226","20","21","IEEE","7 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To provide enhanced operation, the RSC is controlled to eliminate the torque oscillations at double supply frequency under unbalanced stator supply. The oscillation of the stator output active power is then cancelled by the active power output from the GSC, to ensure constant active power output from the overall DFIG generation system. To provide the required positive and negative sequence currents control for the RSC and GSC, a current control strategy containing a main controller and an auxiliary controller is analyzed. The main controller is implemented in the positive (dq)+ frame without involving positive/negative sequence decomposition whereas the auxiliary controller is implemented in the negative sequence (dq)- frame with negative sequence current extracted.

Unlike the traditional single-input multiple-output (SIMO) radar which emits coherent waveforms to form a focused beam, the MIMO radar can transmit orthogonal (or incoherent) waveforms. These waveforms can be used to increase the system spatial resolution. The waveforms also affect the range and Doppler resolution. In traditional (SIMO) radars, the ambiguity function of the transmitted pulse characterizes the compromise between range and Doppler resolutions. It is a major tool for studying and analyzing radar signals. Recently, the idea of ambiguity function has been extended to the case of MIMO radar. In this paper, some mathematical properties of the MIMO radar ambiguity function are first derived. These properties provide some insights into the MIMO radar waveform design. Then a new algorithm for designing the orthogonal frequency-hopping waveforms is proposed. This algorithm reduces the sidelobes in the corresponding MIMO radar ambiguity function and makes the energy of the ambiguity function spread evenly in the range and angular dimensions.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.929658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4602540","Ambiguity function;frequency-hopping codes;linear frequency modulation (LFM);MIMO radar;simulated annealing;waveform design;MIMO Radar;Ambiguity Function;Waveform design;Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM);Frequency-Hopping Codes;Simulated Annealing","MIMO;Frequency;Radar cross section;Doppler radar;Transmitting antennas;Spatial resolution;Radar antennas;Data mining;Matched filters;Receiving antennas","","225","","28","IEEE","19 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our approach is motivated by the fact that visually similar skeleton graphs may have completely different topological structures. The proposed comparison of geodesic paths between endpoints of skeleton graphs yields correct matching results in such cases. The skeletons are pruned by contour partitioning with discrete.

Starting from these initial seeds, the performs change detection in the original multitemporal feature space by gradually considering unlabeled patterns in the definition of the decision boundary between changed and unchanged pixels according to a semisupervised learning algorithm. This algorithm models the full complexity of the change-detection problem, which is only partially represented from the seed pixels included in the pseudotraining set.

In the first step we minimize the overlap of the row spaces spanned by the effective channel matrices of different users using a new cost function. In the next step, we optimize the system performance with respect to specific optimization criteria assuming a set of parallel single- user MIMO channels. By combining the closed form solution with Tomlinson-Harashima precoding we reach the maximum sum-rate capacity when the total number of antennas at the user terminals is less or equal to the number of antennas at the base station. By iterating the closed form solution with appropriate power loading we are able to extract the full diversity in the system and reach the maximum sum-rate capacity in case of high multi-user interference.

In addition, new approaches to address these current problems and areas for future research are suggested. Finally, it is concluded that only geophysically referenced methods will enable AUVs to navigate accurately over large areas and that advances in underwater feature recognition are required before these methods can be implemented in operational AUVs.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.919147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4524846","Computational intelliqence;navigation;underwater vehicles;Computational intelliqence;navigation;underwater vehicles","Underwater vehicles;Remotely operated vehicles;Satellite navigation systems;Sea surface;Sensor arrays;Sonar navigation;Mobile robots;Laboratories;Sensor systems and applications;Batteries","","223","","62","IEEE","20 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present an algorithm which uses silhouettes of the object, as well as images obtained under changing illumination conditions. In contrast with previous photometric stereo techniques, ours is not limited to a single viewpoint but produces accurate reconstructions in full 3D. A number of images of the object are obtained from multiple viewpoints, under varying lighting conditions. Starting from the silhouettes, the algorithm recovers camera motion and constructs the object's visual hull. This is then used to recover the illumination and initialise a multi-view photometric stereo scheme to obtain a closed surface reconstruction. There are two main contributions in this paper: Firstly we describe a robust technique to estimate light directions and intensities and secondly, we introduce a novel formulation of photometric stereo which combines multiple viewpoints and hence allows closed surface reconstructions. The algorithm has been implemented as a practical model acquisition system. Here, a quantitative evaluation of the algorithm on synthetic data is presented together with complete reconstructions of challenging real objects. Finally, we show experimentally how even in the case of highly textured objects, this technique can greatly improve on correspondence-based multi-view stereo results.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384496","Shading;Stereo;Shading;Stereo","Photometry;Image reconstruction;Surface reconstruction;Stereo image processing;Stereo vision;Lighting;Shape;Cameras;Porcelain;Robustness","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Lighting;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photogrammetry;Photometry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","222","2","16","IEEE","21 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The geometric approach utilizes geometric properties of the measurement matrix Phi. A notable example is the Restricted Isometry Property, which states that the mapping Phi preserves the Euclidean norm of sparse signals; it is known that random dense matrices satisfy this constraint with high probability. On the other hand, the combinatorial approach utilizes sparse matrices, interpreted as adjacency matrices of sparse (possibly random) graphs, and uses combinatorial techniques to recover an approximation to the signal. In this paper we present a unification of these two approaches. To this end, we extend the notion of Restricted Isometry Property from the Euclidean lscr2 norm to the Manhattan lscr1 norm. Then we show that this new lscr1 -based property is essentially equivalent to the combinatorial notion of expansion of the sparse graph underlying the measurement matrix. At the same time we show that the new property suffices to guarantee correctness of both geometric and combinatorial recovery algorithms. As a result, we obtain new measurement matrix constructions and algorithms for signal recovery which, compared to previous algorithms, are superior in either the number of measurements or computational efficiency of decoders.","","978-1-4244-2925-7","10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797639","","Geometry;Combinatorial mathematics;Sparse matrices;Vectors;Image coding;Signal processing algorithms;Computer networks;Signal processing;Cameras;Approximation error","","222","1","41","IEEE","4 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel framework is developed for automatic behavior profiling and online anomaly sampling/detection without any manual labeling of the training data set. The framework consists of the following key components: 1) A compact and effective behavior representation method is developed based on discrete-scene event detection. The similarity between behavior patterns are measured based on modeling each pattern using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). 2) The natural grouping of behavior patterns is discovered through a novel spectral clustering algorithm with unsupervised model selection and feature selection on the eigenvectors of a normalized affinity matrix. 3) A composite generative behavior model is constructed that is capable of generalizing from a small training set to accommodate variations in unseen normal behavior patterns. 4) A runtime accumulative anomaly measure is introduced to detect abnormal behavior, whereas normal behavior patterns are recognized when sufficient visual evidence has become available based on an online Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) method. This ensures robust and reliable anomaly detection and normal behavior recognition at the shortest possible time. The effectiveness and robustness of our approach is demonstrated through experiments using noisy and sparse data sets collected from both indoor and outdoor surveillance scenarios. In particular, it is shown that a behavior model trained using an unlabeled data set is superior to those trained using the same but labeled data set in detecting anomaly from an unseen video. The experiments also suggest that our online LRT-based behavior recognition approach is advantageous over the commonly used Maximum Likelihood (ML) method in differentiating ambiguities among different behavior classes observed online.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359346","Behaviour profiling;Anomaly Detection;Dynamic Scene Modelling;Spectral clustering;FeatureSelection;Dynamic Bayesian Networks.;Behaviour profiling;Anomaly Detection;Dynamic Scene Modelling;Spectral clustering;FeatureSelection;Dynamic Bayesian Networks.","Surveillance;Robustness;Sampling methods;Labeling;Training data;Event detection;Bayesian methods;Clustering algorithms;Test pattern generators;Runtime","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Video Recording","222","2","34","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The labeling of the unknown sample is done by looking at the local decision region to which it belongs. The method is characterized by resulting global decision boundaries of the piecewise linear type. However, the entire process can be kernelized through the determination of the k -nearest training samples in the transformed feature space by using a distance function simply reformulated on the basis of the adopted kernel.

Due to power and bandwidth limitations, each sensor compresses its data in order to minimize the amount of information that needs to be communicated to the fusion center. In this context, we study the linear decentralized estimation of the source vector, where each sensor linearly encodes its observations and the fusion center also applies a linear mapping to estimate the unknown vector signal based on the received messages. We adopt the mean squared error (MSE) as the performance criterion. When the channels between sensors and the fusion center are orthogonal, it has been shown previously that the complexity of designing the optimal encoding matrices is NP-hard in general. In this paper, we study the optimal linear decentralized estimation when the multiple access channel (MAC) is coherent. For the case when the source and observations are scalars, we derive the optimal power scheduling via convex optimization and show that it admits a simple distributed implementation. Simulations show that the proposed power scheduling improves the MSE performance by a large margin when compared to the uniform power scheduling. We also show that under a finite network power budget, the asymptotic MSE performance (when the total number of sensors is large) critically depends on the multiple access scheme. For the case when the source and observations are vectors, we study the optimal linear decentralized estimation under both bandwidth and power constraints. We show that when the MAC between sensors and the fusion center is noiseless, the resulting problem has a closed-form solution (which is in sharp contrast to the orthogonal MAC case), while in the noisy MAC case, the problem can be efficiently solved by semidefinite programming (SDP).","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.906762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378416","Convex optimization;distributed estimation;energy efficiency;linear source-channel coding;multiple access channel (MAC)","Sensor fusion;Vectors;Bandwidth;Wireless sensor networks;Signal processing;Data compression;Context;Signal mapping;Closed-form solution;Energy efficiency","","221","1","35","IEEE","16 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we review the SoS literature to illustrate the need to create an SoSE management framework based on the demands of constant technological progress in a complex dynamic environment. We conclude from this review that the history and evolution of defining SoS has shown that: (1) SoS can be defined by distinguishing characteristics and (2) SoS can be viewed as a network where the ldquobest practicesrdquo of network management can be applied to SoSE. We use these two theories as a foundation for our objective to create an effective SoSE management framework. To accomplish this, we utilize modified fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) network principles (SoSE management conceptual areas). Furthermore, cited distinguishing characteristics of SoS are also used to present a SoSE management framework.

Such dynamic spectrum access is envisioned to resolve the spectrum scarcity by allowing unlicensed users to opportunistically utilize the white spaces across the licensed spectrum on a non-interfering basis. Cognitive radio networks offer a promising realization of this novel paradigm, thanks to their ability to autonomously identify the white spaces through spectrum sensing. Implementation of such networks, however, requires a model translating the regulatory constraint on the aggregate interference to the system-and device-level design parameters.

For high-degree nets, a net-breaking technique is proposed to reduce the net size until the table can be used. A scheme is also presented to allow users to control the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime. FLUTE is optimal for low-degree nets (up to degree 9 in our current implementation) and is still very accurate for nets up to degree 100. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for very large scale integration applications in which most nets have a degree of 30 or less. We show experimentally that, over 18 industrial circuits in the ISPD98 benchmark suite, FLUTE with default accuracy is more accurate than the Batched 1-Steiner heuristic and is almost as fast as a very efficient implementation of Prim's rectilinear minimum spanning tree algorithm.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2007.907068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358497","Interconnect optimization;rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (RSMT) algorithm;routing;wirelength estimation;wirelength minimization;Rectilinear Steiner Minimal Tree Algorithm;Wirelength Estimation;Wirelength Minimization;Interconnect Optimization;Routing","Table lookup;Steiner trees;Very large scale integration;Algorithm design and analysis;Runtime;Routing;Iterative algorithms;Integrated circuit interconnections;Delay estimation;Space exploration","","221","1","21","IEEE","18 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm performs an adaptive sphericity oriented contrast region growing on the fuzzy connectivity map of the object of interest. This region growing is operated within a volumetric mask which is created by first applying a local adaptive segmentation algorithm that identifies foreground and background regions within a certain window size. The foreground objects are then filled to remove any holes, and a spatial connectivity map is generated to create a 3-D mask. The mask is then enlarged to contain the background while excluding unwanted foreground regions. Apart from generating a confined search volume, the mask is also used to estimate the parameters for the subsequent region growing, as well as for repositioning the seed point in order to ensure reproducibility. The method was run on 815 pulmonary nodules. By using randomly placed seed points, the approach was shown to be fully reproducible. As for acceptability, the segmentation results were visually inspected by a qualified radiologist to search for any gross misssegmentation. 84% of the first results of the segmentation were accepted by the radiologist while for the remaining 16% nodules, alternative segmentation solutions that were provided by the method were selected.

These mismatches are unavoidable in practice and reduce the obtainable image frequency attenuation to the 20-40-dB range in practical receivers. In wideband multichannel receivers, where the overall bandwidths are in the range of several megahertz and the incoming carriers located at each other's mirror frequencies have a high dynamic range, the image attenuation of the analog front-end (FE) alone is clearly insufficient. In this paper, two novel blind low-complexity I/Q imbalance compensation techniques are proposed and analyzed to digitally enhance the analog FE image attenuation in wideband direct-conversion receivers. The proposed algorithms are grounded on the concept of circular or proper complex random signals, and they are, by design, able to handle the often overlooked yet increasingly important case of frequency-dependent I/Q mismatches. The first technique is an iterative one, stemming from adaptive filtering principles, whereas the second one is a moment-estimation-based block method. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated through computer simulations, as well as real-world laboratory signal measurement examples in practical multicarrier receiver cases. Based on the obtained results, the proposed compensation techniques can provide very good compensation performance with low computational resources and are robust in the face of different imbalance levels and dynamics of the received signals, as well as many other crucial practical aspects such as the effects of the communications channel and carrier synchronization.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2007.909269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357467","Adaptive filtering;circular random signals;digital radios;direct-conversion transceivers;I/Q imbalance;mirror-frequency interference;second-order statistics;Adaptive filtering;circular random signals;digital radios;direct-conversion transceivers;I/Q imbalance;mirror-frequency interference;second-order statistics","Wideband;Frequency;Attenuation;Iron;Iterative algorithms;Bandwidth;Mirrors;Dynamic range;Image analysis;Signal design","","219","23","44","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, our learning procedure builds upon recent work on the online learning of kernel-based classifiers. This yields an efficient, scalable algorithm, which can benefit from recent kernels developed for image comparison. The experiments performed over stock photography data show the advantage of our discriminative ranking approach over state-of-the-art alternatives (e.g. our model yields 26.3% average precision over the Corel dataset, which should be compared to 22.0%, for the best alternative model evaluated).

The maximum eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix is used as the test statistic. Since the covariance matrix catches the correlations among the signal samples, the proposed method is better than the energy detection for correlated signals. For iid signals, the method approaches to the energy detection. The random matrix theory is used to analyze the method and set the threshold.

It is a frequency-agile data communication device that is vastly more powerful than recently proposed multi-channel multi-radio (MC-MR) technology. In this paper, we investigate the important problem of multi-hop networking with CR nodes. For such a network, each node has a pool of frequency bands (typically of unequal size) that can be used for communication. The potential difference in the bandwidth among the available frequency bands prompts the need to further divide these bands into sub-bands for optimal spectrum sharing. We characterize the behavior and constraints for such a multi-hop CR network from multiple layers, including modeling of spectrum sharing and sub-band division, scheduling and interference constraints, and flow routing. We develop a mathematical formulation with the objective of minimizing the required network-wide radio spectrum resource for a set of user sessions. Since the formulated model is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard in general, we develop a lower bound for the objective by relaxing the integer variables and using a linearization technique. Subsequently, we design a near-optimal algorithm to solve this MINLP problem. This algorithm is based on a novel sequential fixing procedure, where the integer variables are determined iteratively via a sequence of linear programs. Simulation results show that solutions obtained by this algorithm are very close to the lower bounds obtained via the proposed relaxation, thus suggesting that the solution produced by the algorithm is near-optimal.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413147","","Spread spectrum communication;Cognitive radio;Signal processing algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Chromium;Interference constraints;Signal processing;Radio frequency;Communication switching;Data communication","","219","1","32","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, as |VGS| increases, the critical voltage decreases. We have also found that the stress current does not affect the critical voltage although soft degradation at low voltages takes place at high stress currents.

In order to benefit from both sources of information, several pansharpening methods have been developed to produce a multispectral image at the spatial resolution of the panchromatic band. The aim of this paper is to suggest a novel approach to the pansharpening problem within a Bayesian framework. This Bayesian data fusion (BDF) method relies on statistical relationships between the various spectral bands and the panchromatic band without suffering from restricting modeling hypotheses. Furthermore, it allows the user to weight the spectral and panchromatic information with respect to either visual or quantitative criteria, which leads to adaptable results according to users' needs and study areas. The performance of this approach was compared to existing methods based on markedly different subset images from very high spatial resolution IKONOS images. Results showed that BDF yielded the highest spectral consistency. Furthermore, small details were adequately added to the pansharpened images with little artifact as compared to those created using wavelet-based methods. Finally, the method was fast and easy to implement owing to its straightforward formulation. As it does not have any intrinsic limitations on the type of data to be processed or the number of bands to be merged, it also appears to be very promising for optical/SAR or hyperspectral image fusion.

But often dependencies exist between various pieces of code over which managers may have little knowledge. These dependencies can be construed as a low level graph of the entire system. In this paper, we propose to use network analysis on these dependency graphs. This allows managers to identify central program units that are more likely to face defects. In our evaluation on Windows Server 2003, we found that the recall for models built from network measures is by 10% points higher than for models built from complexity metrics. In addition, network measures could identify 60% of the binaries that the Windows developers considered as critical-twice as many as identified by complexity metrics.","1558-1225","978-1-60558-079-1","10.1145/1368088.1368161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4814164","defect prediction;dependency graph;network analysis;windows server 2003","Quality management;Resource management;Network servers;Quality assurance;Costs;Predictive models;Software engineering;Software measurement;Engineering management;Permission","","218","3","50","","14 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Texture Analysis of Aggressive and Nonaggressive Lung Tumor CE CT Images","O. S. Al-Kadi $^\ast$; D.

The aim is to enhance CT tumor staging prediction accuracy through identifying malignant aggressiveness of lung tumors. As branching of blood vessels can be considered a fractal process, the research examines vascularized tumor regions that exhibit strong fractal characteristics. The analysis is performed after injecting 15 patients with a contrast agent and transforming at least 11 time sequence CE CT images from each patient to the fractal dimension and determining corresponding lacunarity. The fractal texture features were averaged over the tumor region and quantitative classification showed up to 83.3% accuracy in distinction between advanced (aggressive) and early-stage (nonaggressive) malignant tumors. Also, it showed strong correlation with corresponding lung tumor stage and standardized tumor uptake value of fluoro deoxyglucose as determined by positron emission tomography. These results indicate that fractal analysis of time sequence CE CT images of malignant lung tumors could provide additional information about likely tumor aggression that could potentially impact on clinical management decisions in choosing the appropriate treatment procedure.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2008.919735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4463642","Fractal dimension (FD);lacunarity;texture analysis;tumor aggression;Fractal dimension;lacunarity;texture analysis;tumor aggression","Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Lung neoplasms;Computed tomography;Fractals;Image sequence analysis;Cancer;Accuracy;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging","Algorithms;Humans;Lung Neoplasms;Lung Neoplasms;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","218","1","29","IEEE","17 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These problems will grow as wire diameters scale down and the resistance-capacitance product of the interconnect wires increases hyperbolically, which threatens to choke off the computational performance increases of chips that we have come to expect over time. We examine some of the quantitative implications of these trends by analyzing the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. We compare the potential of replacing the global electronic interconnect of future chips with a photonic interconnect and see that there is in principle a four order of magnitude bandwidth-to-power ratio advantage for the latter. This indicates that it could be possible to dramatically improve chip performance without scaling transistors but rather utilize the capability of existing transistors much more efficiently. However, at this time it is not clear if these advantages can be realized.

To circumvent these limitations, the method presented in this paper uses 3 techniques: 1) The ultrasound is not focused during the transmissions of the ultrasound signals; 2) A 13 -bit Barker code is transmitted simultaneously from each transducer element; and 3) The 2-D vector velocity of the blood is estimated using 2-D cross-correlation. A parameter study was performed using the Field II program, and performance of the method was investigated when a virtual blood vessel was scanned by a linear array transducer. An improved parameter set for the method was identified from the parameter study, and a flow rig measurement was performed using the same improved setup as in the simulations. Finally, the common carotid artery of a healthy male was scanned with a scan sequence that satisfies the limits set by the Food and Drug Administration. Vector velocity images were obtained with a frame-rate of 100 Hz where 40 speckle images are used for each vector velocity image. It was found that the blood flow approximately followed the vessel wall, and that maximum velocity was approximately 1 m/s, which is a normal value for a healthy person. To further evaluate the method, the test person was scanned with magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. The volume flow derived from the MR scanning was compared with that from the ultrasound scanning. A deviation of 9% between the 2 volume flow estimates was found.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2008.858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4589187","","Ultrasonic imaging;Color;Focusing;Ultrasonic transducers;Vectors;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging;Fluid flow measurement;Magnetic field measurement;Performance evaluation","Adult;Blood Flow Velocity;Carotid Arteries;Carotid Arteries;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Male;Models, Cardiovascular;Pilot Projects;Rheology;Ultrasonography","218","5","41","IEEE","8 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our study shows that current multi-channel protocols are not suitable for WSNs, because of the small number of available channels and unavoidable time errors found in real networks. With these observations, we propose a novel tree-based multichannel scheme for data collection applications, which allocates channels to disjoint trees and exploits parallel transmissions among trees. In order to minimize interference within trees, we define a new channel assignment problem which is proven NP- complete. Then we propose a greedy channel allocation algorithm which outperforms other schemes in dense networks with a small number of channels.We implement our protocol, called TMCP, in a real testbed. Through both simulation and real experiments, we show that TMCP can significantly improve network throughput and reduce packet losses.

This approach involves the implementation of a fault current limiter (FCL) to locally limit the DG fault current, and thus restore the original relay coordination. The proposed restoration approach is carried out without altering the original relay settings or disconnecting DGs from PDSs during fault. Therefore, it is applicable to both the current practice of disconnecting DGs from PDSs, and the emergent trend of keeping DGs in PDSs during fault. The process of selecting FCL impedance type (inductive or resistive) and its minimum value is illustrated. Three scenarios are discussed: no DG, the implementation of DG with FCL and without FCL. Various simulations are carried out for both single- and multi-DG existence, and different DG and fault locations. The obtained results are reported and discussed.

With such increasing popularity and the availability of low-cost image editing software, the integrity of digital image content can no longer be taken for granted. This paper introduces a new methodology for the forensic analysis of digital camera images. The proposed method is based on the observation that many processing operations, both inside and outside acquisition devices, leave distinct intrinsic traces on digital images, and these intrinsic fingerprints can be identified and employed to verify the integrity of digital data. The intrinsic fingerprints of the various in-camera processing operations can be estimated through a detailed imaging model and its component analysis. Further processing applied to the camera captured image is modelled as a manipulation filter, for which a blind deconvolution technique is applied to obtain a linear time-invariant approximation and to estimate the intrinsic fingerprints associated with these postcamera operations. The absence of camera-imposed fingerprints from a test image indicates that the test image is not a camera output and is possibly generated by other image production processes. Any change or inconsistencies among the estimated camera-imposed fingerprints, or the presence of new types of fingerprints suggest that the image has undergone some kind of processing after the initial capture, such as tampering or steganographic embedding. Through analysis and extensive experimental studies, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework for nonintrusive digital image forensics.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.916010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451097","Component forensics;image-acquisition forensics;intrinsic fingerprints;nonintrusive image forensics;steganalysis;tampering detection","Digital images;Forensics;Fingerprint recognition;Image analysis;Digital cameras;Testing;Application software;Nonlinear filters;Deconvolution;Linear approximation","","216","7","49","IEEE","12 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Tensors (i.e., multi-way arrays) provide a natural representation for such data. Consequently, tensor decompositions such as Tucker become important tools for summarization and analysis. One major challenge is how to deal with high-dimensional, sparse data. In other words, how do we compute decompositions of tensors where most of the entries of the tensor are zero. Specialized techniques are needed for computing the Tucker decompositions for sparse tensors because standard algorithms do not account for the sparsity of the data. As a result, a surprising phenomenon is observed by practitioners: Despite the fact that there is enough memory to store both the input tensors and the factorized output tensors, memory overflows occur during the tensor factorization process. To address this intermediate blowup problem, we propose Memory-Efficient Tucker (MET). Based on the available memory, MET adaptively selects the right execution strategy during the decomposition. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of MET on real tensors. It achieves over 1000X space reduction without sacrificing speed; it also allows us to work with much larger tensors that were too big to handle before.

In this paper, we extend recent optimal minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) designs of relay networks to the corresponding multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) scenarios, whereby the source, relays and destination comprise multiple antennas. We investigate maximum SNR solutions subject to power constraints and zero-forcing (ZF) criteria, as well as approximate MMSE equalizers with specified target SNR and power constraint at the receiver.

Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are required for good results and this becomes slow using k-means. We introduce Extremely Randomized Clustering Forests-ensembles of randomly created clustering trees-and show that they provide more accurate results, much faster training and testing, and good resistance to background clutter. Second, an efficient image classification method is proposed. It combines ERC-Forests and saliency maps very closely with the extraction of image information. For a given image, a classifier builds a saliency map online and uses it to classify the image. We show in several state-of-the-art image classification tasks that this method can speed up the classification process enormously. Finally, we show that the proposed ERC-Forests can also be used very successfully for learning distance between images. The distance computation algorithm consists of learning the characteristic differences between local descriptors sampled from pairs of same or different objects. These differences are vector quantized by ERC-Forests and the similarity measure is computed from this quantization. The similarity measure has been evaluated on four very different datasets and always outperforms the state-of-the-art competitive approaches.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384498","Computer vision;Object recognition;Computer vision;Object recognition","Image classification;Quantization;Image sampling;Image retrieval;Machine learning;Histograms;Classification tree analysis;Student members;Computer Society;Clustering algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","215","20","61","IEEE","16 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several researchers have proposed discontinuous feedback controllers (e.g., variable structure or sliding mode controllers) to reject the residual errors and yield asymptotic results. The research in this paper describes how a recently developed continuous robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback term can be incorporated with a NN-based feedforward term to achieve semi-global asymptotic tracking. To achieve this result, the typical stability analysis for the RISE method is modified to enable the incorporation of the NN-based feedforward terms, and a projection algorithm is developed to guarantee bounded NN weight estimates.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2008.930200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4639460","Adaptive control;asymptotic stability;Lyapunov methods;neural network;nonlinear systems;RISE feedback;robust control","Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Feedback control;Control systems;Sliding mode control;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear systems;Uncertainty","","214","","20","IEEE","7 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While mismatch in these comparators can be compensated for by calibration, noise can irreparably hinder performance and is less straightforward to be accounted for at design time. This paper presents a method to estimate the input referred noise in fully dynamic regenerative comparators leveraging a reference architecture. A time-domain analysis is proposed that accounts for the time varying nature of the circuit exploiting some basic results from the solution of stochastic differential equations. The resulting symbolic expressions allow focusing designers' attention on the most influential noise contributors.

Remarkably, the mechanical impedance behavior is defined in terms of geometrically consistent stiffness. The overall control scheme is based on a two-loop arrangement, where a simple proportional integral derivative inner motion loop is adopted for each manipulator, while an outer loop, using force and moment measurements at the robots wrists, is aimed at imposing the desired impedance behaviors.

Transient stability constrained OPF (TSCOPF) is however a nonlinear optimization problem with both algebraic and differential equations, which is difficult to be solved even for small power systems. This paper develops a robust and efficient method for solving TSCOPF problems based on differential evolution (DE), which is a new branch of evolutionary algorithms with strong ability in searching global optimal solutions of highly nonlinear and nonconvex problems. Due to the flexible properties of DE mechanism, the hybrid method for transient stability assessment, which combines time-domain simulation and transient energy function method, can be employed in DE so that the detailed dynamic models of the system can be incorporated. To reduce the computational burden, several strategies are proposed for the initialization, assessment and selection of solution individuals in evolution process of DE. Numerical tests on the WSCC three-generator, nine-bus system and New England ten-generator, 39-bus system have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, in order to deal with the large-scale system and speed up the computation, DE is parallelized and implemented on a Beowulf PC-cluster.

Routing optimization plays a key role in traffic engineering, finding efficient routes so as to achieve the desired network performance. In this survey we review Internet traffic engineering from the perspective of routing optimization. A taxonomy of routing algorithms in the literature is provided, dating from the advent of the TE concept in the late 1990s.

Very often, multipath fading channels result in the severe AMC performance degradation or induce large classification errors. The negative impacts of multipath fading channels on AMC have been discussed in the existing literature but no solution has ever been proposed so far to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new robust AMC algorithm, which applies higher-order statistics (HOS) in a generic framework for blind channel estimation and pattern recognition. We also derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the fourth-order cumulant estimator when the AMC candidates are BPSK and QPSK over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, and it is a nearly minimum-variance estimator leading to robust AMC features in a wide variety of signal-to-noise ratios. The advantage of our new algorithm is that, by carefully designing the essential features needed for AMC, we do not really have to acquire the complete channel information and therefore it can be feasible without any a priori information in practice. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that our new AMC algorithm can achieve the much better classification accuracy than the existing AMC techniques.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2008.070015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600222","Cognitive radio;automatic modulation classification;Cramer-Rao lower bound","Multipath channels;Fading;Noise robustness;Degradation;Higher order statistics;Blind equalizers;Pattern recognition;Binary phase shift keying;Quadrature phase shift keying;Additive white noise","","212","","22","IEEE","19 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Exploration is typically preferred at the initial stages of the search but is required to gradually give way to exploitation of promising solutions as the search progresses. The diversity of a particle swarm optimization algorithm can be defined, simply, as the degree of dispersion of the particles in the swarm. This dispersion could be defined around some center-point or not. It could also be defined based on the positions of the particles or on their velocities. This paper takes a look at some of the different definitions of swarm diversity with the intention of determining their usefulness in quantifying swarm exploration/exploitation.

These perspectives have led to a better understanding of SPM technology, overcome hurdles that limited the efficacy of SPM, and resulted in new modes of SPM-based interrogation. ThNcAFM, based on systems principles, has made it possible to image with resolution as high as 0.25 Aring in ambient conditions. The orders-of-magnitude improvements achieved in areas such as precision positioning, sample imaging, and sample detection rates emphasize the potential of systems tools in nanotechnology. The concept of using models in online operation has significant potential for SPM. For instance, TF-AFM, which uses models for online operation, resolves competing objectives of high resolution and detection rate by using a design from a systems perspective that makes detection bandwidth independent of the quality factor of the probe and, therefore, independent of resolution. The systems perspective also facilitates the interpretation of data since it provides a precise means for delineating the effects of the inherent dynamics of the interrogation system from the properties of the sample being probed. Devices such as SPMs are sensitive to operating conditions, ambient conditions, and modeling inaccuracies. Modern control theory provides a framework where such challenges can be effectively addressed. This aspect translates to reliable experiments in terms of repeatability, which is crucial in many nanoscience studies.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2007.914688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4472380","","Scanning probe microscopy;Atomic force microscopy;Biological materials;Magnetic materials;Nanobioscience;Nanostructured materials;DNA;Image resolution;Electron microscopy;Atomic measurements","","212","","50","IEEE","21 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

If it is, the triager marks it as duplicate and the bug report is removed from consideration for further work. In the literature, there are approaches exploiting only natural language information to detect duplicate bug reports. In this paper we present a new approach that further involves execution information. In our approach, when a new bug report arrives, its natural language information and execution information are compared with those of the existing bug reports. Then, a small number of existing bug reports are suggested to the triager as the most similar bug reports to the new bug report. Finally, the triager examines the suggested bug reports to determine whether the new bug report duplicates an existing bug report. We calibrated our approach on a subset of the Eclipse bug repository and evaluated our approach on a subset of the Firefox bug repository.

Thermoelectric devices profit from temperature spatial gradients, whereas ferroelectric materials require temporal fluctuation of temperature, thus leading to different applications targets. Ferroelectric materials may harvest perfectly the available thermal energy whatever the materials properties (limited by Carnot conversion efficiency) whereas thermoelectric material's efficiency is limited by materials properties (ZT figure of merit). However, it is shown that the necessary electric fields for Carnot cycles are far beyond the breakdown limit of bulk ferroelectric materials. Thin films may be an excellent solution for rising up to ultra-high electric fields and outstanding efficiency. Different thermodynamic cycles are presented in the paper: principles, advantages, and drawbacks. Using the Carnot cycle, the harvested energy would be independent of materials properties. However, using more realistic cycles, the energy conversion effectiveness remains dependent on the materials properties as discussed in the paper. A particular coupling factor is defined to quantify and check the effectiveness of pyroelectric energy harvesting. It is defined similarly to an electromechanical coupling factor as k2 = p2thetas0/(epsivthetas 33 CE), where p, thetas0, epsivthetas 33, Ce are pyroelectric coefficient, maximum working temperature, dielectric permittivity, and specific heat, respectively. The importance of the electrothermal coupling factor is shown and discussed as an energy harvesting figure of merit. It gives the effectiveness of all techniques of energy harvesting (except the Carnot cycle). It is finally shown that we could reach very high efficiency using lang111rang0.75Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)-0.25PbTiO3 single crystals and synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (almost 50% of Carnot efficiency). Finally, practical implementation key points of pyroelectric energy harvesting are presented showing that the different thermodynamic cycles are feasible and potentially effective, even compared to thermoelectric devices.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2008.680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476363","","Pyroelectricity;Energy conversion;Temperature;Ferroelectric materials;Material properties;Thermoelectric devices;Thermodynamics;Switches;Fluctuations;Thermoelectricity","","210","8","50","IEEE","31 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several approaches, such as the memory and multiple population schemes, have been developed for EAs to address dynamic problems. This paper investigates the application of the memory scheme for population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithms, a class of EAs, for DOPs. A PBIL-specific associative memory scheme, which stores best solutions as well as corresponding environmental information in the memory, is investigated to improve its adaptability in dynamic environments. In this paper, the interactions between the memory scheme and random immigrants, multipopulation, and restart schemes for PBILs in dynamic environments are investigated. In order to better test the performance of memory schemes for PBILs and other EAs in dynamic environments, this paper also proposes a dynamic environment generator that can systematically generate dynamic environments of different difficulty with respect to memory schemes. Using this generator, a series of dynamic environments are generated and experiments are carried out to compare the performance of investigated algorithms.

This eliminates the usual requirement for a closed-loop real-time parameter adaptation, which dramatically reduces the implementation complexity of the system. It is shown that a further reduction in system complexity can be achieved by applying under-sampling theory in the model extraction and utilizing parameter interpolation in the DPD implementation. Experimental results show that by utilizing this technique with only a small number of parameters, nonlinear distortion induced by the PA can be significantly reduced, as evaluated by both adjacent channel power ratio reduction and normalized root mean square error improvement.

We present a mathematically justifiable, computationally simple, sample-eigenvalue-based procedure for estimating the number of high-dimensional signals in white noise using relatively few samples. The main motivation for considering a sample-eigenvalue-based scheme is the computational simplicity and the robustness to eigenvector modelling errors which can adversely impact the performance of estimators that exploit information in the sample eigenvectors. There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sample eigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample-eigenvalue-based detection of weak or closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limited sample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number of identifiable signals which is equal to the number of ldquosignalrdquo eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factor strictly greater than . The fundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are too few samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than the actual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (in an asymptotic sense) when using any sample-eigenvalue-based detection scheme, including the one proposed herein. The analysis reveals why adding more sensors can only exacerbate the situation. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate that the proposed estimator, like Wax and Kailath's MDL-based estimator, consistently estimates the true number of signals in the dimension fixed, large sample size limit and the effective number of identifiable signals, unlike Wax and Kailath's MDL-based estimator, in the large dimension, (relatively) large sample size limit.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.917356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4493413","Detection;random matrices;sample covariance matrix","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Signal detection;White noise;Signal processing;Covariance matrix;Biomedical signal processing;Array signal processing;Wireless communication;Data engineering;Communities","","208","1","56","IEEE","22 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, similar range-only localization techniques in dense cluttered environments typically lack accuracy and reliability due, notably, to dense multipath, line-of-sight (LOS) blockage and excess propagation delays through materials. In particular, range measurements between a receiver and a transmitter are often positively biased. Furthermore, the quality of the range measurement degrades with distance, and the geometric configuration of the beacons also affects the localization accuracy. In this paper we derive a fundamental limit of localization accuracy for an ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) system operating in such environments, which we call the position error bound (PEB). The impact of different ranging estimation errors due to beacons distance and biases on the best positioning accuracy is investigated. The statistical characterization of biases coming from measurement campaigns can easily be incorporated into this analysis. We show that the relative importance of information coming from different beacons varies depending on the propagation conditions, such as whether the beacon is LOS or non-line-of-sight (NLOS). We show, in particular, that any a priori information knowledge on NLOS beacons can significantly improve the localization accuracy, especially in dense cluttered environments. Finally we put forth the concept of localization outage probability and epsi-localization accuracy outage, and use them to characterize the quality of localization throughout the area.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2008.4560210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4560210","","Global Positioning System;Bandwidth;Satellites;Materials reliability;Propagation delay;Particle measurements;Transmitters;Degradation;Estimation error;Robustness","","208","","38","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We conduct an eight-month measurement study to analyze the P2P traffic characteristics that are relevant to caching, such as object popularity, popularity dynamics, and object size. Our study shows that the popularity of P2P objects can be modeled by a Mandelbrot-Zipf distribution, and that several workloads exist in P2P traffic. Guided by our findings, we develop a novel caching algorithm for P2P traffic that is based on object segmentation, and proportional partial admission and eviction of objects. Our trace-based simulations show that with a relatively small cache size, a byte hit rate of up to 35% can be achieved by our algorithm, which is close to the byte hit rate achieved by an off-line optimal algorithm with complete knowledge of future requests. Our results also show that our algorithm achieves a byte hit rate that is at least 40% more, and at most triple, the byte hit rate of the common Web caching algorithms.

The second scenario considers applications requiring good dynamic response and regenerative braking. Finally, the third group considers very high power applications (over 20 MW). The evaluation presented takes into account semiconductor switching and conduction losses, losses in the medium voltage feeding transformer (determined per IEEE Standard C57.18.10-1998), and the losses in ac and dc filters.

For example, in a 600 transmit and 600 receive antennas V-BLAST system with a high spectral efficiency of 450 bps/Hz (using BPSK and rate-3/4 turbo code), our simulation results show that the proposed detector performs to within about 7 dB from capacity. This practical feasibility of the proposed high-performance, low-complexity detector could potentially trigger wide interest in the theory and implementation of large MIMO systems. We also illustrate the applicability of the proposed detector in the low-complexity detection of high-rate, non-orthogonal space-time block codes and large multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) systems. In large MC-CDMA systems with hundreds of users, the proposed detector is shown to achieve near single-user performance at an average per-bit complexity linear in number of users, which is quite appealing for its use in practical CDMA systems.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2008.080406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4481372","","Detectors;MIMO;Multiaccess communication;Receiving antennas;Turbo codes;Multicarrier code division multiple access;Transmitting antennas;AWGN;Fading;Binary phase shift keying","","207","6","33","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Optimal Linear Precoding Strategies for Wideband Noncooperative Systems Based on Game Theory—Part I: Nash Equilibria","G. Scutari; D. P. Palomar; S. Barbarossa","Department INFOCOM, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China; Department INFOCOM, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,"12 Feb 2008","2008","56","3","1230","1249","In this two-part paper, we propose a decentralized strategy, based on a game-theoretic formulation, to find out the optimal precoding/multiplexing matrices for a multipoint-to-multipoint communication system composed of a set of wideband links sharing the same physical resources, i.e., time and bandwidth. We assume, as optimality criterion, the achievement of a Nash equilibrium and consider two alternative optimization problems: 1) the competitive maximization of mutual information on each link, given constraints on the transmit power and on the spectral mask imposed by the radio spectrum regulatory bodies; and 2) the competitive maximization of the transmission rate, using finite order constellations, under the same constraints as above, plus a constraint on the average error probability. In this first part of the paper, we start by showing that the solution set of both noncooperative games is always nonempty and contains only pure strategies. Then, we prove that the optimal precoding/multiplexing scheme for both games leads to a channel diagonalizing structure, so that both matrix-valued problems can be recast in a simpler unified vector power control game, with no performance penalty. Thus, we study this simpler game and derive sufficient conditions ensuring the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Interestingly, although derived under stronger constraints, incorporating for example spectral mask constraints, our uniqueness conditions have broader validity than previously known conditions. Finally, we assess the goodness of the proposed decentralized strategy by comparing its performance with the performance of a Pareto-optimal centralized scheme. To reach the Nash equilibria of the game, in Part II, we propose alternative distributed algorithms, along with their convergence conditions.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.907807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451295","Ad hoc networks;cognitive radio;game theory;linear precoding;mutual information;Nash equilibrium","Wideband;Game theory;Nash equilibrium;Communication systems;Bandwidth;Constraint optimization;Mutual information;Error probability;Power control;Sufficient conditions","","207","3","51","IEEE","12 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The novelty of this system lies in the feed-forward, pulse frequency modulated converter and open-circuit solar voltage method for maximum power point tracking (MPPT), enabling the solar cell to efficiently charge the supercapacitor and power the node. Experimental results show that by its low-complexity MPPT, Everlast can achieve over 89% conversion efficiency with lower power overhead than the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude, while enabling charging a supercapacitor up to 400% faster than direct charging.

This novel approach, termed as the characteristic basis function method (CBFM), is based on utilizing characteristic basis functions (CBFs)-special functions defined on macro domains (blocks)-that include a relatively large number of conventional sub-domains discretized by using triangular or rectangular patches. Use of these basis functions leads to a significant reduction in the number of unknowns, and results in a substantial size reduction of the MoM matrix; this, in turn, enables us to handle the reduced matrix by using a direct solver, without the need to iterate. In addition, the paper shows that the CBFs can be generated by using a sparse representation of the impedance matrix-resulting in lower computational cost-and that, in contrast to the iterative techniques, multiple excitations can be handled with only a small overhead. Another important attribute of the CBFM is that it is readily parallelized. Numerical results that demonstrate the accuracy and time efficiency of the CBFM for several representative scattering problems are included in the paper.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2008.919166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483602","Characteristic basis functions (CBFs);electrically large;electromagnetic scattering;method of moments (MoM);radar cross section (RCS)","Electromagnetic scattering;Matrix decomposition;Sparse matrices;Moment methods;Impedance;Optical scattering;MLFMA;Linear systems;Equations;Computational efficiency","","206","","15","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This low-complexity scheme operates only a few dB away from capacity but requires very accurate channel knowledge at the transmitter. We consider a limited feedback system where each receiver knows its channel perfectly, but the transmitter is only provided with a finite number of channel feedback bits from each receiver. Using a random quantization argument, we quantify the throughput loss due to imperfect channel knowledge as a function of the feedback level. The quality of channel knowledge must improve proportional to the SNR in order to prevent interference-limitations, and we show that scaling the number of feedback bits linearly with the system SNR is sufficient to maintain a bounded rate loss.

A battery model capable of reproducing lithium-ion, nickel-metal hydride, and lead- acid I-V characteristics (with minimal model alterations) is proposed. A battery-testing apparatus was designed to measure the proposed parameters of the battery model for all three battery types and simulate driving schedules with a programmed source and load configuration. A multiple time-constant battery model was used for modeling lithium- ion batteries; verification of time constants in the seconds to minutes and hour ranges has been shown in numerous research articles and a time constant in the millisecond range is verified here with experiments. Lack of significant time constants in the millisecond range is validated through direct testing. A modeled capacity-rate effect within the state-of-charge determination portion of the proposed model is verified experimentally to ensure accurate prediction of battery state of charge after lengthy driving schedules. The battery model was programmed into a Matlab/Simulink environment and used as a power source for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle simulations. Results from simulations of lithium-ion battery packs show that the proposed battery model behaves well with the other subcomponents of the vehicle simulator; accuracy of the model and prediction of battery internal losses depends on the extent of tests performed on the battery used for the simulation.

Sensors closer to a data sink are usually required to forward a large amount of traffic for sensors farther from the data sink. Therefore, these sensors tend to die early, leaving areas of the network completely unmonitored and reducing the functional network lifetime. In our study, we explore possible sensor network deployment strategies that maximize sensor network lifetime by mitigating the problem of the hot spot around the data sink. Strategies such as variable-range transmission power control with optimal traffic distribution, mobile-data-sink deployment, multiple-data-sink deployment, nonuniform initial energy assignment, and intelligent sensor/relay deployment are investigated. We suggest a general model to analyze and evaluate these strategies. In this model, we not only discover how to maximize the network lifetime given certain network constraints but also consider the factor of extra costs involved in more complex deployment strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on the maximum achievable sensor network lifetime for different deployment strategies, and it also provides practical cost-efficient sensor network deployment guidelines.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2007.70784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4385721","wireless sensor networks;data dissemination;linear programming;deployment strategies;wireless sensor networks;data dissemination;linear programming;deployment strategies","Costs;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Traffic control;Intelligent sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Telecommunication traffic;Spread spectrum communication;Power control;Communication system traffic control;Relays","","205","","27","IEEE","22 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This noise could be a fluctuation in the number of free electrons or in their mobility. Many experimental studies have proved that the 1/f noise in homogeneous samples is a fluctuation in the mobility. There is a reliable empirical relation for the power density of the mobility noise. Theoretical models for mobility noise have not had much influence in the discussions. The theoretical position for number fluctuations is quite the opposite. The generally accepted McWhorter model is simple; however, very few experimental studies definitely prove number fluctuations and exclude uncorrelated mobility fluctuations. There is an extensive literature on noise in MOSTs. Submicrometer MOSTs are notorious for their high low-frequency noise. Almost all studies start from the McWhorter generation-recombination (GR) model. The discussion is confused by the many complications of the MOSTs, such as mobility degradation, surface and contacts effects, size of the samples, etc. An additional problem is that the real 1/f noise is often mixed up with other types of low-frequency noise, such as burst and GR noises. A critical discussion is given for the Kirton and Uren model. Analytical expressions are presented for the results of their computer simulations. This explains their surprising discovery that the density of McWhorter states may be ldquosubstantiallyrdquo different from the usual 1/ tau distribution.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2008.2005167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4668577","Burst noise;MOS devices;MOSFET;semiconductor device noise;$\hbox{1}/f$ noise","1f noise;MOSFETs;MOS devices;Semiconductor device measurement","","205","","101","IEEE","7 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that a simple distributed scheduling strategy, maximal scheduling, attains a guaranteed fraction of the maximum throughput region in arbitrary wireless networks. The guaranteed fraction depends on the ldquointerference degreerdquo of the network, which is the maximum number of transmitter-receiver pairs that interfere with any given transmitter-receiver pair in the network and do not interfere with each other. Depending on the nature of communication, the transmission powers and the propagation models, the guaranteed fraction can be lower-bounded by the maximum link degrees in the underlying topology, or even by constants that are independent of the topology. The guarantees are tight in that they cannot be improved any further with maximal scheduling. The results can be generalized to end-to-end multihop sessions. Finally, enhancements to maximal scheduling that can guarantee fairness of rate allocation among different sessions, are discussed.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2007.913537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4439837","Fairness guarantees;maximal scheduling;throughput guarantees;wireless networks","Throughput;Wireless networks;Network topology;Systems engineering and theory;Interference constraints;Radio spectrum management;Processor scheduling;Centralized control;Mobile communication;Communication system control","","204","3","25","IEEE","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This assumption becomes invalid when the load power factor is low or the inductance is small in order to minimize the inductor's size and weight for some applications where volume and weight are crucial. Under these conditions, the inductor current has high ripple or even becomes discontinuous. As a result, the Z-source inverter exhibits new operation modes that have not been discussed before.

The role of the propagation environment (both outdoor and indoor) on EDG is examined, proving that the uniform scenario is a good approximation to many real environments. The tradeoff study between system's performance and number of integrated antenna elements indicates that both diversity and MIMO performance saturate when placing more than five closely spaced elements.

The proposed converter and its control are designed to be compatible with a fuel cell power source, which exhibits 2 : 1 voltage variation as well as a slow transient response. The proposed approach consists of two stages: a three-level boost converter stage cascaded with a current-fed two-inductor boost converter topology, which has a higher voltage gain and provides galvanic isolation from the input source. The function of the front-end boost converter stage is to maintain a constant voltage at the input of the cascaded dc-dc converter to ensure optimal performance characteristics and high efficiency. At the output of the first boost converter, a battery or ultracapacitor energy storage is connected to handle slow transient response of the fuel cell (200 W/min). The robust features of the proposed control system ensure a constant output dc voltage for a variety of load fluctuations, thus limiting the power being delivered by the fuel cell during a load transient. Moreover, the proposed configuration simplifies power management and can interact with the fuel cell controller.

The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall communication budget constraint. We model the network as a Bernoulli random topology and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we show that the topology design with random link failures, link communication costs, and a communication cost constraint is a constrained convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved for large networks by semidefinite programming techniques. Simulations demonstrate that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.920143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4536069","Consensus;convergence;distributed decision;graph;Laplacian;sensor networks;spectral graph theory;topology","Network topology;Convergence;Cost function;Iterative algorithms;Sufficient conditions;Algorithm design and analysis;Distributed algorithms;Distributed computing;Signal processing algorithms;Telecommunication network reliability","","204","","37","IEEE","17 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that for matrices A with a row-span intersecting the positive orthant, if this problem admits a sufficiently sparse solution, it is necessarily unique. The bound on the required sparsity depends on a coherence property of the matrix A. This coherence measure can be improved by applying a conditioning stage on A, thereby strengthening the claimed result. The obtained uniqueness theorem relies on an extended theoretical analysis of the lscr0 - lscr1 equivalence developed here as well, considering a matrix A with arbitrary column norms, and an arbitrary monotone element-wise concave penalty replacing the lscr1-norm objective function. Finally, from a numerical point of view, a greedy algorithm-a variant of the matching pursuit-is presented, such that it is guaranteed to find this sparse solution.

One example is the differential Doppler (DD) method in which the signal of a stationary emitter is intercepted by at least two moving receivers. The frequency difference between the receivers is measured at several locations along their trajectories and the emitter's position is then estimated based on these measurements. This two-step approach is suboptimal since each frequency difference measurement is performed independently, although all measurements correspond to a common emitter position. Instead, a single-step approach based on the maximum likelihood criterion is proposed here for both known and unknown waveforms. The position is determined directly from all the observations by a search in the position space. The method can only be used for narrowband signals, that is, under the assumption that the signal bandwidth must be small compared to the inverse of the propagation time between the receivers. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the DD method for weak signals while both methods converge to the Cramer-Rao bound for strong known signals. Finally, it is shown that in some cases of interest the proposed method inherently selects reliable observations while ignoring unreliable data.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.929655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4602539","Differential Doppler (DD);emitter location;maximum-likelihood estimation;Emitter location;Maximum likelihood estimation;Differential Doppler","Narrowband;Frequency estimation;Frequency measurement;Position measurement;Doppler effect;Receivers;Maximum likelihood estimation;Sonar applications;Sonar measurements;Sonar navigation","","203","1","30","IEEE","19 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The inverter features high reliability, thanks to a circuit topology that obviates aluminum electrolytic capacitors from the circuit. Moreover, all components, including logic and control, have been designed to exhibit high reliability at high temperatures. Three conversion stages form the power topology. First, a full bridge connected to a high-frequency transformer and a full-bridge rectifier amplifies the voltage of the PV panel to approximately 475 V. This stage is controlled by using a phase-shift pulsewidth-modulation controller that permits zero-voltage switching, thereby minimizing losses. Second, a buck converter is connected in series with the rectifier and is controlled by using current mode in order to shape the current injection into a rectified sine wave. Last, a full bridge is operated at line frequency to unfold the current injection. The amplification stage has a proportional compensator that maintains the voltage at the PV terminals constant. The current injection stage has a proportional-derivative compensator that controls the amplitude of the grid current so that the dc-link average voltage is maintained constant. Experimental results show that the peak efficiency of the system is 89%, and the total current harmonic distortion is below 5%. Finally, analyses show a designed lifetime of approximately ten years.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2008.922401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550677","DC–AC power conversion;energy conversion;inverters;photovoltaic (PV) power systems;reliability","Inverters;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Voltage control;Power system reliability;Circuit topology;Bridge circuits;Rectifiers;Zero voltage switching;Shape control","","203","58","23","IEEE","24 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic idea is to apply an MS to obtain an object-oriented representation of hyperspectral data and then use support vector machine to interpret the feature set. In order to employ MS for hyperspectral data effectively, a feature-extraction algorithm, nonnegative matrix factorization, is utilized to reduce the high-dimensional feature space. Furthermore, two bandwidth-selection algorithms are proposed for the MS procedure. One is based on the local structures, and the other exploits separability analysis. Experiments are conducted on two hyperspectral data sets, the DC Mall hyperspectral digital-imagery collection experiment and the Purdue campus hyperspectral mapper images. We evaluate and compare the proposed approach with the well-known commercial software eCognition (object-based analysis approach) and an effective spectral/spatial classifier for hyperspectral data, namely, the derivative of the morphological profile. Experimental results show that the proposed MS-based analysis system is robust and obviously outperforms the other methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2002577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4683346","Bandwidth selection;classification;high spatial resolution;hyperspectral;mean shift (MS)","Image analysis;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Data mining;Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Remote sensing;Neural networks;Urban areas;Support vector machines","","203","","29","IEEE","9 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then extend this HVS-based multihistogram equalization approach to create a general enhancement method that can utilize any combination of enhancement algorithms for an improved performance. Additionally, we propose new quantitative measures of image enhancement, called the logarithmic Michelson contrast measure (AME) and the logarithmic AME by entropy. Many image enhancement methods require selection of operating parameters, which are typically chosen using subjective methods, but these new measures allow for automated selection.

Fabricated joints tend to have three orientations in a cyclic twin relationship, but among the population of solder balls, this orientation triplet appears to be randomly oriented. In thermally cycled joints, solder balls with dominant Sn grains having the particular orientation with the c-axis nearly parallel to the plane of the substrate were observed to fail before neighboring balls with different orientations. This results from the fact that the coefficient of thermal expansion of Sn in the basal plane (along the alpha-axis) is half the value along the c-axis; joints observed to be damaged had the maximum coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between solder and substrate at the joint interface, as well as a tensile stress modes during the hot part of the thermal cycle.

Two concepts of Lyapunov functions are introduced and used to establish uniform Lyapunov stability and uniform global stability. With the help of output functions, an almost bounded output energy condition and an output persistent excitation condition are then proposed and employed to guarantee uniform local and global asymptotic stability. Based on this result, a generalized version of Krasovskii-LaSalle theorem in time-varying switched systems is proposed. For switched systems with persistent dwell-time, the output persistent excitation condition is guaranteed to hold under a zero-state observability condition. It is shown that several existing results in past literature can be covered as special cases using the proposed criteria. Interestingly, as opposed to previous work, the main results of this paper are applicable to the situation where some switching systems are not asymptotically stable at the origin. The robust practical regulation problem of nonholonomic mobile robots is studied as a way of demonstrating the power of the proposed new criteria.

However, in many cases of practical interest the sampled signals actually live in a union of subspaces. Examples include piecewise polynomials, sparse representations, nonuniform splines, signals with unknown spectral support, overlapping echoes with unknown delay and amplitude, and so on. For these signals, traditional sampling schemes based on the single subspace assumption can be either inapplicable or highly inefficient. In this paper, we study a general sampling framework where sampled signals come from a known union of subspaces and the sampling operator is linear. Geometrically, the sampling operator can be viewed as projecting sampled signals into a lower dimensional space, while still preserving all the information. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for invertible and stable sampling operators in this framework and show that these conditions are applicable in many cases. Furthermore, we find the minimum sampling requirements for several classes of signals, which indicates the power of the framework. The results in this paper can serve as a guideline for designing new algorithms for various applications in signal processing and inverse problems.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2007.914346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483755","Linear operators;projections;sampling;shift-invariant spaces;signal representations;stable;union of subspaces","Sampling methods;Signal processing algorithms;Polynomials;Delay;Sufficient conditions;Signal sampling;Guidelines;Signal design;Algorithm design and analysis;Inverse problems","","202","6","36","IEEE","16 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

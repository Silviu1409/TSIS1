"Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features","P. Viola; M. Jones","Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA; Compaq Cambridge Research Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, USA",Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. CVPR 2001,"15 Apr 2003","2001","1","","I","I","This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the ""integral image"" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a ""cascade"" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.","1063-6919","0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.990517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990517","","Object detection;Face detection;Pixel;Detectors;Filters;Machine learning;Image representation;Focusing;Skin;Robustness","","9540","713","17","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our model can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by the gradient. We minimize an energy which can be seen as a particular case of the minimal partition problem. In the level set formulation, the problem becomes a ""mean-curvature flow""-like evolving the active contour, which will stop on the desired boundary. However, the stopping term does not depend on the gradient of the image, as in the classical active contour models, but is instead related to a particular segmentation of the image. We give a numerical algorithm using finite differences. Finally, we present various experimental results and in particular some examples for which the classical snakes methods based on the gradient are not applicable. Also, the initial curve can be anywhere in the image, and interior contours are automatically detected.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.902291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902291","","Active contours;Level set;Object detection;Image segmentation;Finite difference methods;Image edge detection;Partial differential equations;Helium;Two-term control;Mathematics","","7950","148","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Segmentation of brain MR images through a hidden Markov random field model and the expectation-maximization algorithm","Y. Zhang; M. Brady; S. Smith","FMRIB Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, UK; Robotics Research Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK; FMRIB Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, UK",IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,"7 Aug 2002","2001","20","1","45","57","The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. Here, the authors propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. The authors show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, the authors show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.906424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906424","","Hidden Markov models;Image segmentation;Brain modeling;Expectation-maximization algorithms;Mathematical model;Magnetic resonance;Noise level;Stochastic processes;State estimation;Robustness","Algorithms;Brain;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Markov Chains","5557","13","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A common constraint is that the labels should vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions. Both of these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity preserving energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image restoration, stereo and motion. On real data with ground truth, we achieve 98 percent accuracy.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.969114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969114","","Labeling;Image restoration;Stereo vision;Minimization methods;Markov random fields;Energy measurement;Computer vision;Approximation algorithms;Simulated annealing;Motion estimation","","5330","127","47","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors present a complete procedure for the identification and exploitation of stable natural reflectors or permanent scatterers (PSs) starting from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images. When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed. Examples are then shown of small motion measurements, DEM refinement, and APS estimation and removal in the case of a sliding area in Ancona, Italy.

Our method exploits the fact that the set of images of an object in fixed pose, but under all possible illumination conditions, is a convex cone in the space of images. Using a small number of training images of each face taken with different lighting directions, the shape and albedo of the face can be reconstructed. In turn, this reconstruction serves as a generative model that can be used to render (or synthesize) images of the face under novel poses and illumination conditions. The pose space is then sampled and, for each pose, the corresponding illumination cone is approximated by a low-dimensional linear subspace whose basis vectors are estimated using the generative model. Our recognition algorithm assigns to a test image the identity of the closest approximated illumination cone. Test results show that the method performs almost without error, except on the most extreme lighting directions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.927464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=927464","","Lighting;Face recognition;Image reconstruction;Testing;Humans;Shape;Rendering (computer graphics);Vectors;Image recognition;Performance evaluation","","3780","45","76","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our theoretical analysis of the codes is based on the work of Richardson and Urbanke (see ibid., vol.47, no.2, p.599-618, 2000). Assuming that the underlying communication channel is symmetric, we prove that the probability densities at the message nodes of the graph possess a certain symmetry. Using this symmetry property we then show that, under the assumption of no cycles, the message densities always converge as the number of iterations tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove a stability condition which implies an upper bound on the fraction of errors that a belief-propagation decoder can correct when applied to a code induced from a bipartite graph with a given degree distribution. Our codes are found by optimizing the degree structure of the underlying graphs. We develop several strategies to perform this optimization. We also present some simulation results for the codes found which show that the performance of the codes is very close to the asymptotic theoretical bounds.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910578","","Error detection coding","","2449","123","24","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Transmitting at rates below this capacity, a randomly chosen element of the given ensemble will achieve an arbitrarily small target probability of error with a probability that approaches one exponentially fast in the length of the code. (By concatenating with an appropriate outer code one can achieve a probability of error that approaches zero exponentially fast in the length of the code with arbitrarily small loss in rate.) Conversely, transmitting at rates above this capacity the probability of error is bounded away from zero by a strictly positive constant which is independent of the length of the code and of the number of iterations performed. Our results are based on the observation that the concentration of the performance of the decoder around its average performance, as observed by Luby et al. in the case of a binary-symmetric channel and a binary message-passing algorithm, is a general phenomenon. For the particularly important case of belief-propagation decoders, we provide an effective algorithm to determine the corresponding capacity to any desired degree of accuracy. The ideas presented in this paper are broadly applicable and extensions of the general method to low-density parity-check codes over larger alphabets, turbo codes, and other concatenated coding schemes are outlined.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910577","","Error detection coding","","2149","162","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many variants of ICP have been proposed, affecting all phases of the algorithm from the selection and matching of points to the minimization strategy. We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking.","","0-7695-0984-3","10.1109/IM.2001.924423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=924423","","Iterative closest point algorithm;Iterative algorithms;Convergence;Solid modeling;Iterative methods;Geometry;Layout;Minimization methods;Image sampling;Rough surfaces","","2057","84","30","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting from estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem, the paper proves that a solution to the SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. The paper also describes a substantial implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In conclusion, the paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the solution to the SLAM problem including suboptimal map-building algorithms and map management.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.938381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938381","","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Remotely operated vehicles;Mobile robots;Navigation;Uncertainty;Millimeter wave radar;Motion planning;Environmental management;Helium;Mechatronics","","1906","45","26","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents a conceptual framework for addressing infrastructure interdependencies that could serve as the basis for further understanding and scholarship in this important area. We use this framework to explore the challenges and complexities of interdependency. We set the stage for this discussion by explicitly defining the terms infrastructure, infrastructure dependencies, and infrastructure interdependencies and introducing the fundamental concept of infrastructures as complex adaptive systems.

Watson Research Center, USA",Proceedings 42nd IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science,"7 Aug 2002","2001","","","136","145","We propose a novel paradigm for defining security of cryptographic protocols, called universally composable security. The salient property of universally composable definitions of security is that they guarantee security even when a secure protocol is composed of an arbitrary set of protocols, or more generally when the protocol is used as a component of an arbitrary system. This is an essential property for maintaining security of cryptographic protocols in complex and unpredictable environments such as the Internet. In particular, universally composable definitions guarantee security even when an unbounded number of protocol instances are executed concurrently in an adversarially controlled manner, they guarantee non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols, and more. We show how to formulate universally composable definitions of security for practically any cryptographic task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that practically any such definition can be realized using known techniques, as long as only a minority of the participants are corrupted. We then proceed to formulate universally composable definitions of a wide array of cryptographic tasks, including authenticated and secure communication, key-exchange, public-key encryption, signature, commitment, oblivious transfer, zero knowledge and more. We also make initial steps towards studying the realizability of the proposed definitions in various settings.","1552-5244","0-7695-1390-5","10.1109/SFCS.2001.959888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959888","","Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Mathematical model;Computer security;Application software;Radio access networks;Reactive power;Job design;Computer science","","1648","19","61","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of sequential floating forward search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.954607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954607","","Machine intelligence;Intelligent agent;Emotion recognition;Humans;Clustering algorithms;Pattern recognition;Neuroscience;Data analysis;Signal analysis;Physiology","","1576","34","51","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While in the past released information was mostly in tabular and statistical form, many situations call for the release of specific data (microdata). In order to protect the anonymity of the entities (called respondents) to which information refers, data holders often remove or encrypt explicit identifiers such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. Deidentifying data, however, provides no guarantee of anonymity. Released information often contains other data, such as race, birth date, sex, and ZIP code, that can be linked to publicly available information to reidentify respondents and inferring information that was not intended for disclosure. In this paper we address the problem of releasing microdata while safeguarding the anonymity of respondents to which the data refer. The approach is based on the definition of k-anonymity. A table provides k-anonymity if attempts to link explicitly identifying information to its content map the information to at least k entities. We illustrate how k-anonymity can be provided without compromising the integrity (or truthfulness) of the information released by using generalization and suppression techniques. We introduce the concept of minimal generalization that captures the property of the release process not distorting the data more than needed to achieve k-anonymity, and present an algorithm for the computation of such a generalization. We also discuss possible preference policies to choose among different minimal generalizations.","1558-2191","","10.1109/69.971193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=971193","","Protection;Demography;Databases;Joining processes;Statistics;Vehicles;Licenses;Intelligent networks;Computer Society;Cryptography","","1551","16","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The embedding is designed to achieve efficient tradeoffs among the three conflicting goals of maximizing the information-embedding rate, minimizing the distortion between the host signal and composite signal, and maximizing the robustness of the embedding. We introduce new classes of embedding methods, termed quantization index modulation (QIM) and distortion-compensated QIM (DC-QIM), and develop convenient realizations in the form of what we refer to as dither modulation. Using deterministic models to evaluate digital watermarking methods, we show that QIM is ""provably good"" against arbitrary bounded and fully informed attacks, which arise in several copyright applications, and in particular it achieves provably better rate distortion-robustness tradeoffs than currently popular spread-spectrum and low-bit(s) modulation methods. Furthermore, we show that for some important classes of probabilistic models, DC-QIM is optimal (capacity-achieving) and regular QIM is near-optimal. These include both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, which may be good models for hybrid transmission applications such as digital audio broadcasting, and mean-square-error-constrained attack channels that model private-key watermarking applications.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.923725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923725","","Digital audio broadcasting","","1536","105","36","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order for an LSMA-based estimator to produce accurate amounts of material abundance, it generally requires two constraints imposed on the linear mixture model used in LSMA, which are the abundance sum-to-one constraint and the abundance nonnegativity constraint. The first constraint requires the sum of the abundance fractions of materials present in an image pixel to be one and the second imposes a constraint that these abundance fractions be nonnegative. While the first constraint is easy to deal with, the second constraint is difficult to implement since it results in a set of inequalities and can only be solved by numerical methods. Consequently, most LSMA-based methods are unconstrained and produce solutions that do not necessarily reflect the true abundance fractions of materials. In this case, they can only be used for the purposes of material detection, discrimination, and classification, but not for material quantification. The authors present a fully constrained least squares (FCLS) linear spectral mixture analysis method for material quantification. Since no closed form can be derived for this method, an efficient algorithm is developed to yield optimal solutions. In order to further apply the designed algorithm to unknown image scenes, an unsupervised least squares error (LSE)-based method is also proposed to extend the FCLS method in an unsupervised manner.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.911111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911111","","Least squares methods;Spectral analysis;Pixel;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Image analysis;Remote sensing;Layout;Image processing;Algorithm design and analysis","","1491","4","39","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An image is represented by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape, and location. The system classifies images into semantic categories. Potentially, the categorization enhances retrieval by permitting semantically-adaptive searching methods and narrowing down the searching range in a database. A measure for the overall similarity between images is developed using a region-matching scheme that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. The application of SIMPLIcity to several databases has demonstrated that our system performs significantly better and faster than existing ones.

The basic idea is to first estimate local covariance coefficients from a low-resolution image and then use these covariance estimates to adapt the interpolation at a higher resolution based on the geometric duality between the low-resolution covariance and the high-resolution covariance. The edge-directed property of covariance-based adaptation attributes to its capability of tuning the interpolation coefficients to match an arbitrarily oriented step edge. A hybrid approach of switching between bilinear interpolation and covariance-based adaptive interpolation is proposed to reduce the overall computational complexity. Two important applications of the new interpolation algorithm are studied: resolution enhancement of grayscale images and reconstruction of color images from CCD samples. Simulation results demonstrate that our new interpolation algorithm substantially improves the subjective quality of the interpolated images over conventional linear interpolation.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.951537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951537","","Interpolation;Image edge detection;Image resolution;Filtering;Computational complexity;Gray-scale;Image reconstruction;Color;Charge coupled devices;Computational modeling","","1439","32","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f that is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976601750264965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790022","","","","1435","26","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

The construction of such models is difficult using current neuroimaging technology due to the high degree of cortical folding. Even single voxel mis-classifications can result in erroneous connections being created between adjacent banks of a sulcus, resulting in a topologically inaccurate model. These topological defects cause the cortical model to no longer be homeomorphic to a sheet, preventing the accurate inflation, flattening, or spherical morphing of the reconstructed cortex. Surface deformation techniques can guarantee the topological correctness of a model, but are time-consuming and may result in geometrically inaccurate models. In order to address this need the authors have developed a technique for taking a model of the cortex, detecting and fixing the topological defects while leaving that majority of the model intact, resulting in a surface that is both geometrically accurate and topologically correct.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.906426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906426","","Surgery;Solid modeling;Brain modeling;Neuroimaging;Topology;Humans;Cerebral cortex;Surface topography;Spatial resolution;Deformable models","Cerebral Cortex;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging","1413","1","51","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Features such as, e.g., band power or adaptive autoregressive parameters are either extracted in bipolar EEG recordings overlaying sensorimotor areas or from an array of electrodes located over central and neighboring areas. For the classification of the features, linear discrimination analysis and neural networks are used. Characteristic for the Graz BCI is that a classifier is set up in a learning session and updated after one or more sessions with online feedback using the procedure of ""rapid prototyping."" As a result, a discrimination of two brain states (e.g., leftversus right-hand movement imagination) can be reached within only a few days of training.

However, from space, large antennas (several meters) are required to achieve an adequate spatial resolution at L-band. So as to reduce the problem of putting into orbit a large filled antenna, the possibility of using antenna synthesis methods has been investigated. Such a system, relying on a deployable structure, has now proved to be feasible and has led to the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, which is described. The main objective of the SMOS mission is to deliver key variables of the land surfaces (soil moisture fields), and of ocean surfaces (sea surface salinity fields). The SMOS mission is based on a dual polarized L-band radiometer using aperture synthesis (two-dimensional [2D] interferometer) so as to achieve a ground resolution of 50 km at the swath edges coupled with multiangular acquisitions. The radiometer will enable frequent and global coverage of the globe and deliver surface soil moisture fields over land and sea surface salinity over the oceans. The SMOS mission was proposed to the European Space Agency (ESA) in the framework of the Earth Explorer Opportunity Missions. It was selected for a tentative launch in 2005. The goal of this paper is to present the main aspects of the baseline mission and describe how soil moisture will be retrieved from SMOS data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.942551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942551","","Soil moisture;Oceans;SMOS mission;Microwave radiometry;L-band;Surface soil;Sea surface salinity;Frequency estimation;Microwave theory and techniques;Spatial resolution","","1383","","30","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Can one recover, from knowledge of S alone, the precise collection of atoms going to make up S? Because every discrete-time signal can be represented as a superposition of spikes alone, or as a superposition of sinusoids alone, there is no unique way of writing S as a sum of spikes and sinusoids in general. We prove that if S is representable as a highly sparse superposition of atoms from this time-frequency dictionary, then there is only one such highly sparse representation of S, and it can be obtained by solving the convex optimization problem of minimizing the l/sup 1/ norm of the coefficients among all decompositions. Here ""highly sparse"" means that N/sub t/+N/sub w/</spl radic/N/2 where N/sub t/ is the number of time atoms, N/sub w/ is the number of frequency atoms, and N is the length of the discrete-time signal. Underlying this result is a general l/sup 1/ uncertainty principle which says that if two bases are mutually incoherent, no nonzero signal can have a sparse representation in both bases simultaneously. For the above setting, the bases are sinusoids and spikes, and mutual incoherence is measured in terms of the largest inner product between different basis elements. The uncertainty principle holds for a variety of interesting basis pairs, not just sinusoids and spikes. The results have idealized applications to band-limited approximation with gross errors, to error-correcting encryption, and to separation of uncoordinated sources. Related phenomena hold for functions of a real variable, with basis pairs such as sinusoids and wavelets, and for functions of two variables, with basis pairs such as wavelets and ridgelets. In these settings, if a function f is representable by a sufficiently sparse superposition of terms taken from both bases, then there is only one such sparse representation; it may be obtained by minimum l/sup 1/ norm atomic decomposition. The condition ""sufficiently sparse"" becomes a multiscale condition; for example, that the number of wavelets at level j plus the number of sinusoids in the jth dyadic frequency band are together less than a constant times 2/sup j/2/.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.959265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959265","","Signal representations","","1294","31","34","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These techniques were derived from microwave holography techniques that utilize phase and amplitude information recorded over a two-dimensional aperture to reconstruct a focused image of the target. Millimeter-wave imaging is well suited for the detection of concealed weapons or other contraband carried on personnel since millimeter-waves are nonionizing, readily penetrate common clothing material, and are reflected from the human body and any concealed items. In this paper, a wide-bandwidth three-dimensional holographic microwave imaging technique is described. Practical weapon detection systems for airport or other high-throughput applications require high-speed scanning on the order of 3 to 10 s. To achieve this goal, a prototype imaging system utilizing a 27-33 GHz linear sequentially switched array and a high-speed linear scanner has been developed and tested.

Although excellent current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and record high output power densities at microwave frequencies have been achieved, the origin of the 2DEG and the factors limiting the output power and reliability of the devices under high power operation remain uncertain. Drain current collapse has been the major obstacle in the development of reliable high power devices. We show that the cause of current collapse is a charging up of a second virtual gate, physically located in the gate drain access region. Due to the large bias voltages present on the device during a microwave power measurement, surface states in the vicinity of the gate trap electrons, thus acting as a negatively charged virtual gate. The maximum current available from a device during a microwave power measurement is limited by the discharging of this virtual gate. Passivated devices located adjacent to unpassivated devices on the same wafer show almost no current collapse, thus demonstrating that proper surface passivation prevents the formation of the virtual gate. The possible mechanisms by which a surface passivant reduces current collapse and the factors affecting reliability and stability of such a passivant are discussed.","1557-9646","","10.1109/16.906451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906451","","Aluminum compounds","","1220","11","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such prototypic expressions, however, occur rather infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are more often communicated by changes in one or a few discrete facial features. In this paper, we develop an automatic face analysis (AFA) system to analyze facial expressions based on both permanent facial features (brows, eyes, mouth) and transient facial features (deepening of facial furrows) in a nearly frontal-view face image sequence. The AFA system recognizes fine-grained changes in facial expression into action units (AU) of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), instead of a few prototypic expressions. Multistate face and facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling the various facial features, including lips, eyes, brows, cheeks, and furrows. During tracking, detailed parametric descriptions of the facial features are extracted. With these parameters as the inputs, a group of action units (neutral expression, six upper face AU and 10 lower face AU) are recognized whether they occur alone or in combinations. The system has achieved average recognition rates of 96.4 percent (95.4 percent if neutral expressions are excluded) for upper face AU and 96.7 percent (95.6 percent with neutral expressions excluded) for lower face AU. The generalizability of the system has been tested by using independent image databases collected and FACS-coded for ground-truth by different research teams.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.908962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908962","","Face recognition;Facial features;Gold;Prototypes;Image analysis;Image sequence analysis;Eyes;Humans;Mouth;Transient analysis","","1196","27","40","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The physical origins of these limits are primarily in the tunneling currents, which leak through the various barriers in a MOS field-effect transistor (MOSFET) when it becomes very small, and in the thermally generated subthreshold currents. The dependence of these leakages on MOSFET geometry and structure is discussed along with design criteria for minimizing short-channel effects and other issues related to scaling. Scaling limits due to these leakage currents arise from application constraints related to power consumption and circuit functionality. We describe how these constraints work out for some of the most important application classes: dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static random access memory (SRAM), low-power portable devices, and moderate and high-performance CMOS logic. As a summary, we provide a table of our estimates of the scaling limits for various applications and device types.

Instead it tracks spectral minima in each frequency band without any distinction between speech activity and speech pause. By minimizing a conditional mean square estimation error criterion in each time step we derive the optimal smoothing parameter for recursive smoothing of the power spectral density of the noisy speech signal. Based on the optimally smoothed power spectral density estimate and the analysis of the statistics of spectral minima an unbiased noise estimator is developed. The estimator is well suited for real time implementations. Furthermore, to improve the performance in nonstationary noise we introduce a method to speed up the tracking of the spectral minima.

The proof is constructive and carried out by developing a machinery, which combines the theory of homogeneous systems with the idea of adding a power integrator, for the explicit construction of globally stabilizing continuous controllers. We then illustrate, by means of examples, how this machinery can be used to overcome the topological obstruction caused by smooth feedback, and hence resulting in new solutions to a variety of open control problems, including global stabilization of an underactuated unstable two degree of freedom mechanical system.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.935058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935058","","Nonlinear systems;Control systems;State feedback;Machinery;Mechanical systems;Nonlinear control systems;Feedback control;Stability;Control theory;Output feedback","","1117","","17","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finding location without the aid of GPS in each node of an ad hoc network is important in cases where GPS is either not accessible, or not practical to use due to power, form factor or line of sight conditions. Location would also enable routing in sufficiently isotropic large networks, without the use of large routing tables.

This method, which we refer to as JSEG, consists of two independent steps: color quantization and spatial segmentation. In the first step, colors in the image are quantized to several representative classes that can be used to differentiate regions in the image. The image pixels are then replaced by their corresponding color class labels, thus forming a class-map of the image. The focus of this work is on spatial segmentation, where a criterion for ""good"" segmentation using the class-map is proposed. Applying the criterion to local windows in the class-map results in the ""J-image,"" in which high and low values correspond to possible boundaries and interiors of color-texture regions. A region growing method is then used to segment the image based on the multiscale J-images. A similar approach is applied to video sequences. An additional region tracking scheme is embedded into the region growing process to achieve consistent segmentation and tracking results, even for scenes with nonrigid object motion. Experiments show the robustness of the JSEG algorithm on real images and video.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.946985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946985","","Image segmentation;Quantization;Tracking;Layout;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Color;Pixel;Focusing;Robustness;Parameter estimation","","1018","26","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper examines wire and gate delays as technologies migrate from 0.18-/spl mu/m to 0.035-/spl mu/m feature sizes to better understand the magnitude of the the wiring problem. Wires that shorten in length as technologies scale have delays that either track gate delays or grow slowly relative to gate delays. This result is good news since these ""local"" wires dominate chip wiring. Despite this scaling of local wire performance, computer-aided design (CAD) tools must still become move sophisticated in dealing with these wires. Under scaling, the total number of wires grows exponentially, so CAD tools will need to handle an ever-growing percentage of all the wires in order to keep designer workloads constant. Global wires present a more serious problem to designers. These are wires that do not scale in length since they communicate signals across the chip. The delay of these wives will remain constant if repeaters are used meaning that relative to gate delays, their delays scale upwards. These increased delays for global communication will drive architectures toward modular designs with explicit global latency mechanisms.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.920580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920580","","Delay;Wires;Wiring;Design automation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Integrated circuit technology;Paper technology;Hip;Global communication;Repeaters","","1007","19","56","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main difference between the method used in the proposed MPPT system and other techniques used in the past is that the PV array output power is used to directly control the DC/DC converter, thus reducing the complexity of the system. The resulting system has high-efficiency, lower-cost and can be easily modified to handle more energy sources (e.g., wind-generators). The experimental results show that the use of the proposed MPPT control increases the PV output power by as much as 15% compared to the case where the DC/DC converter duty cycle is set such that the PV array produces the maximum power at 1 kW/m/sup 2/ and 25/spl deg/C.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.903988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=903988","","Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Control systems;DC-DC power converters;Power generation;Costs;Microcontrollers;Batteries;Voltage control;Temperature control","","981","93","13","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Four classes of LDPC codes are constructed based on the lines and points of Euclidean and projective geometries over finite fields. Codes of these four classes have good minimum distances and their Tanner (1981) graphs have girth 6. Finite-geometry LDPC codes can be decoded in various ways, ranging from low to high decoding complexity and from reasonably good to very good performance. They perform very well with iterative decoding. Furthermore, they can be put in either cyclic or quasi-cyclic form. Consequently, their encoding can be achieved in linear time and implemented with simple feedback shift registers. This advantage is not shared by other LDPC codes in general and is important in practice. Finite-geometry LDPC codes can be extended and shortened in various ways to obtain other good LDPC codes. Several techniques of extension and shortening are presented. Long extended finite-geometry LDPC codes have been constructed and they achieve a performance only a few tenths of a decibel away from the Shannon theoretical limit with iterative decoding.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.959255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959255","","Error correction coding","","975","78","53","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Other than the destination's position, each node need know only its own position and the position of its one-hop neighbors in order to forward packets. Since it is not necessary to maintain explicit routes, position-based routing does scale well even if the network is highly dynamic. This is a major advantage in a mobile ad hoc network where the topology may change frequently. The main prerequisite for position-based routing is that a sender can obtain the current position of the destination. Therefore, previously proposed location services are discussed in addition to position-based packet forwarding strategies. We provide a qualitative comparison of the approaches in both areas and investigate opportunities for future research.","1558-156X","","10.1109/65.967595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=967595","","Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Floods;National electric code;Europe;Network topology;Taxonomy;Proposals;Network servers","","973","38","37","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A design structure matrix (DSM) provides a simple, compact, and visual representation of a complex system that supports innovative solutions to decomposition and integration problems. The advantages of DSMs vis-a-vis alternative system representation and analysis techniques have led to their increasing use in a variety of contexts, including product development; project planning, project management, systems engineering, and organization design. This paper reviews two types of DSMs, static and time-based DSMs, and four DSM applications: (1) component-based or architecture DSM, useful for modeling system component relationships and facilitating appropriate architectural decomposition strategies; (2) team-based or organization DSM, beneficial for designing integrated organization structures that account for team interactions; (3) activity-based or schedule DSM, advantageous for modeling the information flow among process activities; and (4) parameter-based (or low-level schedule) DSM, effective for integrating low-level design processes based on physical design parameter relationships. A discussion of each application is accompanied by an industrial example. The review leads to conclusions regarding the benefits of DSMs in practice and barriers to their use. The paper also discusses research directions and new DSM applications, both of which may be approached with a perspective on the four types of DSMs and their relationships.","1558-0040","","10.1109/17.946528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946528","","Systems engineering","","935","9","54","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We find the general form of power, BER and data rate adaptation that maximizes spectral efficiency for a large class of modulation techniques and fading distributions. The optimal adaptation of these parameters is to increase the power and data rate and decrease the BER as the channel quality improves. Surprisingly, little spectral efficiency is lost when the power or rate is constrained to be constant.

One application of prioritization techniques involves regression testing, the retesting of software following modifications; in this context, prioritization techniques can take advantage of information gathered about the previous execution of test cases to obtain test case orderings. We describe several techniques for using test execution information to prioritize test cases for regression testing, including: 1) techniques that order test cases based on their total coverage of code components; 2) techniques that order test cases based on their coverage of code components not previously covered; and 3) techniques that order test cases based on their estimated ability to reveal faults in the code components that they cover.

For memoryless binary-input continuous-output additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and sum-product decoders, we use a Gaussian approximation for message densities under density evolution to simplify the analysis of the decoding algorithm. We convert the infinite-dimensional problem of iteratively calculating message densities, which is needed to find the exact threshold, to a one-dimensional problem of updating the means of the Gaussian densities. This simplification not only allows us to calculate the threshold quickly and to understand the behavior of the decoder better, but also makes it easier to design good irregular LDPC codes for AWGN channels. For various regular LDPC codes we have examined, thresholds can be estimated within 0.1 dB of the exact value. For rates between 0.5 and 0.9, codes designed using the Gaussian approximation perform within 0.02 dB of the best performing codes found so far by using density evolution when the maximum variable degree is 10. We show that by using the Gaussian approximation, we can visualize the sum-product decoding algorithm. We also show that the optimization of degree distributions can be understood and done graphically using the visualization.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910580","","Error detection coding","","818","60","31","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, heterogeneous integration of different technologies in one single chip is becoming increasingly desirable, for which planar (two-dimensional) ICs may not be suitable. This paper analyzes the limitations of the existing interconnect technologies and design methodologies and presents a novel three-dimensional (3-D) chip design strategy that exploits the vertical dimension to alleviate the interconnect related problems and to facilitate heterogeneous integration of technologies to realize a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design. A comprehensive analytical treatment of these 3-D ICs has been presented and it has been shown that by simply dividing a planar chip into separate blocks, each occurring a separate physical level interconnected by short and vertical interlayer interconnects (VILICs), significant improvement in performance and reduction in wire-limited chip area can be achieved, without the aid of any other circuit or design innovations. A scheme to optimize the interconnect distribution among different interconnect tiers is presented and the effect of transferring the repeaters to upper Si layers has been quantified in this analysis for a two-layer 3-D chip. Furthermore, one of the major concerns in 3-D ICs arising due to power dissipation problems has been analyzed and an analytical model has been presented to estimate the temperatures of the different active layers. It is demonstrated that advancement in heat sinking technology will be necessary in order to extract maximum performance from these chips. Implications of 3-D device architecture on several design issues have also been discussed with special attention to SoC design strategies. Finally some of the promising technologies for manufacturing 3-D ICs have been outlined.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.929647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=929647","","Chip scale packaging;Integrated circuit interconnections;System-on-a-chip;Very large scale integration;Wire;Integrated circuit technology;Design methodology;Performance analysis;Technological innovation;Repeaters","","814","97","132","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The study of mechanical legged motion has been motivated by its potential use as a means of locomotion in rough terrain, as well as its potential benefits to prothesis development and testing. The paper concentrates on issues related to the automatic control of biped robots. More precisely, its primary goal is to contribute a means to prove asymptotically-stable walking in planar, underactuated biped robot models. Since normal walking can be viewed as a periodic solution of the robot model, the method of Poincare sections is the natural means to study asymptotic stability of a walking cycle. However, due to the complexity of the associated dynamic models, this approach has had limited success. The principal contribution of the present work is to show that the control strategy can be designed in a way that greatly simplifies the application of the method of Poincare to a class of biped models, and, in fact, to reduce the stability assessment problem to the calculation of a continuous map from a subinterval of R to itself. The mapping in question is directly computable from a simulation model. The stability analysis is based on a careful formulation of the robot model as a system with impulse effects and the extension of the method of Poincare sections to this class of models.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.898695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898695","","Legged locomotion;Sliding mode control;Robotics and automation;Robots;Torque control;Asymptotic stability;Biology computing;Control design;Control systems;Oscillators","","774","1","59","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show how to exploit the sparseness of the parity-check matrix to obtain efficient encoders. For the (3,6)-regular LDPC code, for example, the complexity of encoding is essentially quadratic in the block length.

An emerging analysis technique is the Poincare plot, which takes a sequence of intervals and plots each interval against the following interval. The geometry of this plot has been shown to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy subjects in clinical settings. The Poincare plot is a valuable HRV analysis technique due to its ability to display nonlinear aspects of the interval sequence. The problem is, how does one quantitatively characterize the plot to capture useful summary descriptors that are independent of existing HRV measures? Researchers have investigated a number of techniques: converting the two-dimensional plot into various one-dimensional views; the fitting of an ellipse to the plot shape; and measuring the correlation coefficient of the plot. The authors investigate each of these methods in detail and show that they are all measuring linear aspects of the intervals which existing HRV indexes already specify. The fact that these methods appear insensitive to the nonlinear characteristics of the intervals is an important finding because the Poincare plot is primarily a nonlinear technique. Therefore, further work is needed to determine if better methods of characterizing Poincare plot geometry can be found.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.959330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959330","","Geometry;Heart rate variability;Biomedical measurements;Shape measurement;Fluctuations;Statistics;Displays;Failure analysis;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases","Analysis of Variance;Biomedical Engineering;Heart Rate;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Nonlinear Dynamics","743","27","15","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a fully automatic method for identifying the lungs in three-dimensional (3-D) pulmonary X-ray CT images. The method has three main steps. First, the lung region is extracted from the CT images by gray-level thresholding. Then, the left and right lungs are separated by identifying the anterior and posterior junctions by dynamic programming. Finally, a sequence of morphological operations is used to smooth the irregular boundary along the mediastinum in order to obtain results consistent with these obtained by manual analysis, in which only the most central pulmonary arteries are excluded from the lung region. The method has been tested by processing 3-D CT data sets from eight normal subjects, each imaged three times at biweekly intervals with lungs at 90% vital capacity. The authors present results by comparing their automatic method to manually traced borders from two image analysts. Averaged over all volumes, the root mean square difference between the computer and human analysis is 0.8 pixels (0.54 mm).

Unfortunately, developing a deep understanding of these issues has proven to be a challenging task, since it in turn involves solving difficult problems such as mapping the actual topology, characterizing it, and developing models that capture its emergent behavior. Consequently, even though there are a number of topology models, it is an open question as to how representative the generated topologies they generate are of the actual Internet. Our goal is to produce a topology generation framework which improves the state of the art and is based on the design principles of representativeness, inclusiveness, and interoperability. Representativeness leads to synthetic topologies that accurately reflect many aspects of the actual Internet topology (e.g. hierarchical structure, node degree distribution, etc.). Inclusiveness combines the strengths of as many generation models as possible in a single generation tool. Interoperability provides interfaces to widely-used simulation applications such as ns and SSF and visualization tools like otter.

The process underlying this approach can be considered as an interpretation of the Gestaltist's principle of good continuation. No limitations are imposed on the topology of the holes, and all regions of missing data can be simultaneously processed, even if they are surrounded by completely different structures.

After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a ""person"" or a ""nonperson."" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector.

The watermark consists of a pseudorandom sequence which is adaptively added to the largest detail bands. As usual, the watermark is detected by computing the correlation between the watermarked coefficients and the watermarking code, and the detection threshold is chosen in such a way that the knowledge of the watermark energy used in the embedding phase is not needed, thus permitting one to adapt it to the image at hand.

To be able to walk stably in various environments, such as on rough terrain, up and down slopes, or in regions containing obstacles, it is necessary for the robot to adapt to the ground conditions with a foot motion, and maintain its stability with a torso motion. When the ground conditions and stability constraint are satisfied, it is desirable to select a walking pattern that requires small torque and velocity of the joint actuators. We first formulate the constraints of the foot motion parameters. By varying the values of the constraint parameters, we can produce different types of foot motion to adapt to ground conditions. We then propose a method for formulating the problem of the smooth hip motion with the largest stability margin using only two parameters, and derive the hip trajectory by iterative computation.

Principle shortcomings of the concept of mutative strategy parameter control and two levels of derandomization are reviewed. Basic demands on the self-adaptation of arbitrary (normal) mutation distributions are developed. Applying arbitrary, normal mutation distributions is equiv-alent to applying a general, linear problem encoding. The underlying objective of mutative strategy parameter control is roughly to favor previously selected mutation steps in the future. If this objective is pursued rigor-ously, a completely derandomized self-adaptation scheme results, which adapts arbitrary normal mutation distributions. This scheme, called covariance matrix adaptation (CMA), meets the previously stated demands. It can still be considerably improved by cumulation - utilizing an evolution path rather than single search steps.

Mitzenmacher","Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,"7 Aug 2002","2001","12","10","1094","1104","We consider the following natural model: customers arrive as a Poisson stream of rate /spl lambda/n, /spl lambda/<1, at a collection of n servers. Each customer chooses some constant d servers independently and uniformly at random from the n servers and waits for service at the one with the fewest customers. Customers are served according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) protocol and the service time for a customer is exponentially distributed with mean 1. We call this problem the supermarket model. We wish to know how the system behaves and in particular we are interested in the effect that the parameter d has on the expected time a customer spends in the system in equilibrium. Our approach uses a limiting, deterministic model representing the behavior as n/spl rarr//spl infin/ to approximate the behavior of finite systems. The analysis of the deterministic model is interesting in its own right. Along with a theoretical justification of this approach, we provide simulations that demonstrate that the method accurately predicts system behavior, even for relatively small systems. Our analysis provides surprising implications. Having d=2 choices leads to exponential improvements in the expected time a customer spends in the system over d=1, whereas having d=3 choices is only a constant factor better than d=2. We discuss the possible implications for system design.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.963420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963420","","Load management;Queueing analysis;Protocols;Load modeling;Predictive models;System analysis and design;Computer applications;Resource management;H infinity control;Differential equations","","668","10","37","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The channel capacity of the MIMO architecture in independent Rayleigh channels scales linearly as the number of antennas. However, the correlation of a real-world wireless channel may result in a substantial degradation of the MIMO architecture performance. In this letter, we investigate the MIMO channel capacity in correlated channels using the exponential correlation matrix model. We prove that, for this model, an increase in correlation is equivalent to a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For example, r=0.7 is the same as 3-dB decrease in SNR.","1558-2558","","10.1109/4234.951380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951380","","Channel capacity;MIMO;Signal to noise ratio;Receiving antennas;Predictive models;Wireless communication;Rayleigh channels;Degradation;Frequency;Rayleigh scattering","","663","6","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For an exemplary class of stochastic strict-feedback systems with vanishing nonlinearities, where the equilibrium is preserved in the presence of noise, we develop an adaptive stabilization scheme (based on tuning functions) that requires no a priori knowledge of a bound on the covariance.

Integrating computer networks into control systems to replace the traditional point-to-point wiring has enormous advantages, including lower cost, reduced weight and power, simpler installation and maintenance, and higher reliability.

This novel approach is based on the Riesz transform, which is used instead of the Hilbert transform. The combination of a 2-D signal with the Riesz transformed one yields a sophisticated 2-D analytic signal: the monogenic signal. The approach is derived analytically from irrotational and solenoidal vector fields. Based on local amplitude and local phase, an appropriate local signal representation that preserves the split of identity, i.e., the invariance-equivariance property of signal decomposition, is presented. This is one of the central properties of the one-dimensional (1-D) analytic signal that decomposes a signal into structural and energetic information. We show that further properties of the analytic signal concerning symmetry, energy, allpass transfer function, and orthogonality are also preserved, and we compare this with the behavior of other approaches for a 2-D analytic signal. As a central topic of this paper, a geometric phase interpretation that is based on the relation between the 1-D analytic signal and the 2-D monogenic signal established by the Radon (1986) transform is introduced. Possible applications of this relationship are sketched, and references to other applications of the monogenic signal are given.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.969520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969520","","Signal analysis;Signal processing;Band pass filters;Information analysis;Frequency estimation;Image edge detection;Radar signal processing;Image processing;Phase measurement;Information filtering","","651","7","32","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The advantage of the former is that it is simpler to implement as it needs no information on the channel statistics. On the other hand, the MMSEE is expected to have better performance as it exploits prior information about the channel. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are used in the comparisons. At SNR values of practical interest, the two schemes are found to exhibit nearly equal performance, provided that the number of pilot tones is sufficiently greater than the CIRs length. Otherwise, the MMSEE is superior.

In particular, we let a set of deformable contours define the boundaries between regions in an image where we model the data via piecewise smooth functions and employ a gradient flow to evolve these contours. Each gradient step involves solving an optimal estimation problem for the data within each region, connecting curve evolution and the Mumford-Shah functional with the theory of boundary-value stochastic processes. The resulting active contour model offers a tractable implementation of the original Mumford-Shah model (i.e., without resorting to elliptic approximations which have traditionally been favored for greater ease in implementation) to simultaneously segment and smoothly reconstruct the data within a given image in a coupled manner. Various implementations of this algorithm are introduced to increase its speed of convergence. We also outline a hierarchical implementation of this algorithm to handle important image features such as triple points and other multiple junctions. Next, by generalizing the data fidelity term of the original Mumford-Shah functional to incorporate a spatially varying penalty, we extend our method to problems in which data quality varies across the image and to images in which sets of pixel measurements are missing. This more general model leads us to a novel PDE-based approach for simultaneous image magnification, segmentation, and smoothing, thereby extending the traditional applications of the Mumford-Shah functional which only considers simultaneous segmentation and smoothing.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.935033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935033","","Image segmentation;Noise reduction;Smoothing methods;Active contours;Interpolation;Stochastic processes;Image reconstruction;Application software;Computer vision;Image processing","","647","2","52","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This perspective is particularly useful in studying complex nonlinear systems by decomposing them into simpler subsystems that, upon interconnection, add up their energies to determine the full system's behavior. The action of a controller may also be understood in energy terms as another dynamical system. The control problem can then be recast as finding a dynamical system and an interconnection pattern such that the overall energy function takes the desired form. This energy-shaping approach is the essence of passivity-based control (PBC), a controller design technique that is very well known in mechanical systems. Our objectives in the article are threefold. First, to call attention to the fact that PBC does not rely on some particular structural properties of mechanical systems, but hinges on the more fundamental (and universal) property of energy balancing. Second, to identify the physical obstacles that hamper the use of standard PBC in applications other than mechanical systems. In particular, we show that standard PBC is stymied by the presence of unbounded energy dissipation, hence it is applicable only to systems that are stabilizable with passive controllers. Third, to revisit a PBC theory that has been developed to overcome the dissipation obstacle as well as to make the incorporation of process prior knowledge more systematic. These two important features allow us to design energy-based controllers for a wide range of physical systems.","1941-000X","","10.1109/37.915398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915398","","Control systems;Mechanical systems;Nonlinear systems;Mechanical factors;Intelligent control;Performance gain;Lyapunov method;Nonlinear control systems;Fasteners;Energy dissipation","","642","","","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is demonstrated that, while different cooling options can be tailored to the specific needs of individual applications, system considerations always play a paramount role in determining the most suitable cooling scheme. It is also shown that extensive fundamental electronic cooling knowledge has been amassed over the past two decades. Yet there is now a growing need for hardware innovations rather than perturbations to those fundamental studies. An example of these innovations is the cooling of military avionics, where research findings from the electronic cooling literature have made possible the development of a new generation of cooling hardware which promise order of magnitude increases in heat dissipation compared to today's cutting edge avionics cooling schemes.","1557-9972","","10.1109/6144.926375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926375","","Thermal management;Electronics cooling;Coolants;Heat sinks;Temperature;Electronic packaging thermal management;Aerospace electronics;Water heating;Microchannel;Spraying","","634","4","82","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By applying these changes to a given input face, we can change its apparent age, race, or gender. Psychological investigations reveal a limitation with existing methods that's particularly apparent when changing the age of faces. We relate the problem to the loss of facial textures (such as stubble and wrinkles) in the prototypes due to the blending process. We review the existing face prototyping and transformation methods and present a new, wavelet-based method for prototyping and transforming facial textures.","1558-1756","","10.1109/38.946630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946630","","Prototypes;Shape;Facial features;Pixel;Vectors;Color;Laboratories;Eyes;Nose;Mouth","","629","5","13","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Such patterns are very common in medical images. Vessel detection is interesting for the computation of parameters related to blood flow. Its tree-like geometry makes it a usable feature for registration between images that can be of a different nature. In order to define vessel-like patterns, segmentation is performed with respect to a precise model. We define a vessel as a bright pattern, piece-wise connected, and locally linear, mathematical morphology is very well adapted to this description, however other patterns fit such a morphological description. In order to differentiate vessels from analogous background patterns, a cross-curvature evaluation is performed. They are separated out as they have a specific Gaussian-like profile whose curvature varies smoothly along the vessel. The detection algorithm that derives directly from this modeling is based on four steps: (1) noise reduction; (2) linear pattern with Gaussian-like profile improvement; (3) cross-curvature evaluation; (4) linear filtering. We present its theoretical background and illustrate it on real images of various natures, then evaluate its robustness and its accuracy with respect to noise.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.931095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931095","","Morphology;Image segmentation;Working environment noise;Biomedical imaging;Blood flow;Geometry;Performance evaluation;Gaussian processes;Detection algorithms;Noise reduction","","625","7","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On-demand routing in particular, is widely developed in bandwidth constrained mobile wireless ad hoc networks because of its effectiveness and efficiency. Most proposed on-demand routing protocols however, build and rely on a single route for each data session. Whenever there is a link disconnection on the active route, the routing protocol must perform a route recovery process. In QoS routing for wired networks, multiple path routing is popularly used. Multiple routes are however, constructed using link-state or distance vector algorithms which are not well-suited for ad hoc networks. We propose an on-demand routing scheme called split multipath routing (SMR) that establishes and utilizes multiple routes of maximally disjoint paths. Providing multiple routes helps minimizing route recovery process and control message overhead. Our protocol uses a per-packet allocation scheme to distribute data packets into multiple paths of active sessions. This traffic distribution efficiently utilizes available network resources and prevents nodes of the route from being congested in heavily loaded traffic situations. We evaluate the performance of our scheme using extensive simulation.","","0-7803-7097-1","10.1109/ICC.2001.937262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937262","","Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Mobile communication;Telecommunication traffic;Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Traffic control;Packet radio networks;Wireless networks","","595","3","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results using only nighttime data are presented at this time due to the greater stability of nighttime surface temperature estimation. The methodology uses a radiative transfer model to solve for surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth simultaneously using a nonlinear iterative optimization procedure. It assumes known constant values for the scattering albedo and roughness, and that vegetation optical depth for H-polarization is the same as for V-polarization. Surface temperature is derived by a procedure using high frequency V-polarized brightness temperatures.

This paper studies an efficient ICI cancellation method termed ICI self-cancellation scheme. The scheme works in two very simple steps. At the transmitter side, one data symbol is modulated onto a group of adjacent subcarriers with a group of weighting coefficients. The weighting coefficients are designed so that the ICI caused by the channel frequency errors can be minimized. At the receiver side, by linearly combining the received signals on these subcarriers with proposed coefficients, the residual ICI contained in the received signals can then be further reduced. The carrier-to-interference power ratio (CIR) can be increased by 15 and 30 dB when the group size is two or three, respectively, for a channel with a constant frequency offset. Although the redundant modulation causes a reduction in bandwidth efficiency, it can be compensated, for example, by using larger signal alphabet sizes. Simulations show that OFDM systems using the proposed ICI self-cancellation scheme perform much better than standard systems while having the same bandwidth efficiency in multipath mobile radio channels with large Doppler frequencies.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.935159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935159","","Mobile communication;OFDM modulation;Laboratories;Radiofrequency interference;Frequency division multiplexing;Land mobile radio;Bandwidth;Communication systems;Phase shift keying;Radio transmitters","","577","18","15","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An alternative to expecting programmers to fully annotate code with invariants is to automatically infer likely invariants from the program itself. This research focuses on dynamic techniques for discovering invariants from execution traces. This article reports three results. First, it describes techniques for dynamically discovering invariants, along with an implementation, named Daikon, that embodies these techniques. Second, it reports on the application of Daikon to two sets of target programs. In programs from Gries's work (1981) on program derivation, the system rediscovered predefined invariants. In a C program lacking explicit invariants, the system discovered invariants that assisted a software evolution task. These experiments demonstrate that, at least for small programs, invariant inference is both accurate and useful. Third, it analyzes scalability issues, such as invariant detection runtime and accuracy, as functions of test suites and program points instrumented.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.908957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908957","","Programming profession;Testing;Instruments;Application software;Runtime;Detectors;Computer Society;Scalability;Formal specifications;Pattern analysis","","568","14","88","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The protocol is based on the link state algorithm and it is proactive (or table-driven) in nature. It employs periodic exchange of messages to maintain topology information of the network at each node. OLSR is an optimization over a pure link state protocol as it compacts the size of information sent in the messages, and furthermore, reduces the number of retransmissions to flood these messages in an entire network.

To be useful, traces must be organized according to some modeling framework. Indeed, several such frameworks have been proposed, mostly based on theoretical considerations or analysis of other literature. This paper, in contrast, follows an empirical approach. Focus groups and interviews conducted in 26 major software development organizations demonstrate a wide range of traceability practices with distinct low-end and high-end users of traceability. From these observations, reference models comprising the most important kinds of traceability links for various development tasks have been synthesized. The resulting models have been validated in case studies and are incorporated in a number of traceability tools. A detailed case study on the use of the models is presented. Four kinds of traceability link types are identified and critical issues that must be resolved for implementing each type and potential solutions are discussed.

"Designing fuzzy inference systems from data: An interpretability-oriented review","S. Guillaume","CEMA GREF, Montpellier, France",IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,"7 Aug 2002","2001","9","3","426","443","Fuzzy inference systems (FIS) are widely used for process simulation or control. They can be designed either from expert knowledge or from data. For complex systems, FIS based on expert knowledge only may suffer from a loss of accuracy. This is the main incentive for using fuzzy rules inferred from data. Designing a FIS from data can be decomposed into two main phases: automatic rule generation and system optimization. Rule generation leads to a basic system with a given space partitioning and the corresponding set of rules. System optimization can be done at various levels. Variable selection can be an overall selection or it can be managed rule by rule. Rule base optimization aims to select the most useful rules and to optimize rule conclusions. Space partitioning can be improved by adding or removing fuzzy sets and by tuning membership function parameters. Structure optimization is of a major importance: selecting variables, reducing the rule base and optimizing the number of fuzzy sets. Over the years, many methods have become available for designing FIS from data. Their efficiency is usually characterized by a numerical performance index. However, for human-computer cooperation another criterion is needed: the rule interpretability. An implicit assumption states that fuzzy rules are by nature easy to be interpreted. This could be wrong when dealing with complex multivariable systems or when the generated partitioning is meaningless for experts. The paper analyzes the main methods for automatic rule generation and structure optimization. They are grouped into several families and compared according to the rule interpretability criterion. For this purpose, three conditions for a set of rules to be interpretable are defined.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.928739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928739","","Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy logic;Hybrid intelligent systems;Process control;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy control;Expert systems;Design optimization;Input variables;Performance analysis","","552","3","66","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique is used to compare stationary and synchronous frame PI regulators on a common basis to better understand the advantages of a synchronous frame regulator. A new form of stationary frame resonant regulator is then derived which achieves zero steady-state error without requiring the complex transformations of a synchronous frame regulator.

These methods rely on the assumption that the received signals are simple delayed versions of the source signal. The good interference suppression attained under this assumption is severely impaired in complicated acoustic environments, where arbitrary TFs may be encountered. In this paper, we consider the arbitrary TF case. We propose a GSC solution, which is adapted to the general TF case. We derive a suboptimal algorithm that can be implemented by estimating the TFs ratios, instead of estimating the TFs. The TF ratios are estimated by exploiting the nonstationarity characteristics of the desired signal. The algorithm is applied to the problem of speech enhancement in a reverberating room.

The method is based on two recent results on scale space: (1) Interest points can be adapted to scale and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. For indexing, the image is characterized by a set of scale invariant points; the scale associated with each point allows the computation of a scale invariant descriptor. Our descriptors are, in addition, invariant to image rotation, of affine illumination changes and robust to small perspective deformations. Experimental results for indexing show an excellent performance up to a scale factor of 4 for a database with more than 5000 images.","","0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937561","","Indexing;Robustness;Detectors;Laplace equations;Lighting;Image databases;Layout;Filters","","546","23","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The optimization technique is demonstrated through a design example, leading to a 2.4-GHz fully integrated, LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) implemented using 0.35-/spl mu/m MOS transistors.

The nonsinusoidal changes of flux originate from driving these devices by nonsinusoidal voltages and currents at different switching frequencies. A detailed examination of a dynamic hysteresis model shows that the physical origin of losses in magnetic material is the average rate of remagnetization rather than the remagnetization frequency. This principle leads to a modification of the most common calculation rule for magnetic core losses, i.e., to the ""modified Steinmetz equation"" (MSE). In the MSE, the remagnetization frequency is replaced by an equivalent frequency which is calculated from the average remagnetization rate. This approach allows, for the first time, the calculation of the losses in the time domain for arbitrary waveforms of flux while using the available set of parameters of the classical Steinmetz equation. DC premagnetization of the material, having a substantial influence on the losses, can also be included. Extensive measurements verify the MSE presented in this paper.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.936396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=936396","","Ferrimagnetic materials;Magnetic materials;Magnetic losses;Equations;Inductors;Transformers;Power electronics;Switching frequency;Magnetic hysteresis;Magnetic cores","","544","1","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors present a thin-film, polyimide-based, multichannel intracortical Bio-MEMS interface manufactured with standard planar photo-lithographic CMOS-compatible techniques on 4-in silicon wafers. The use of polyimide provides a mechanically flexible substrate which can be manipulated into unique three-dimensional designs. Polyimide also provides an ideal surface for the selective attachment of various important bioactive species onto the device in order to encourage favorable long-term reactions at the tissue-electrode interface. Structures have an integrated polyimide cable providing efficient contact points for a high-density connector. This report details in vivo and in vitro device characterization of the biological, electrical and mechanical properties of these arrays.

Each pixel individually measures the amplitude, offset and phase of the received radiation. The theoretical resolution limit of this TOF range camera is derived, which depends on the square root of the detected background radiation and the inverse of the modulation amplitude. Actual measurements of 3-D sequences acquired at 10 range images per second show excellent agreement between our theory and the observed results.

The existing multilevel inverters such as diode-clamped and capacitor-clamped multilevel inverters can be derived from the generalized inverter topology. Moreover, the generalized multilevel inverter topology provides a true multilevel structure that can balance each DC voltage level automatically without any assistance from other circuits, thus, in principle, providing a complete and true multilevel topology that embraces the existing multilevel inverters.

Fundamental to the success of this method is the use of a wavelet-based feature set, reduced in dimension by principal components analysis. Further, it is shown that four channels of myoelectric data greatly improve the classification accuracy, as compared to one or two channels. It is demonstrated that exceptionally accurate performance is possible using the steady-state myoelectric signal. Exploiting these successes, a robust online classifier is constructed, which produces class decisions on a continuous stream of data.

One of the major challenges in devising such networks lies in the constrained energy and computational resources available to sensor nodes. These constraints must be taken into account at all levels of the system hierarchy. The deployment of sensor nodes is the first step in establishing a sensor network. Since sensor networks contain a large number of sensor nodes, the nodes must be deployed in clusters, where the location of each particular node cannot be fully guaranteed a priori. Therefore, the number of nodes that must be deployed in order to completely cover the whole monitored area is often higher than if a deterministic procedure were used. In networks with stochastically placed nodes, activating only the necessary number of sensor nodes at any particular moment can save energy. We introduce a heuristic that selects mutually exclusive sets of sensor nodes, where the members of each of those sets together completely cover the monitored area. The intervals of activity are the same for all sets, and only one of the sets is active at any time. The experimental results demonstrate that by using only a subset of sensor nodes at each moment, we achieve a significant energy savings while fully preserving coverage.","","0-7803-7097-1","10.1109/ICC.2001.936985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=936985","","Wireless sensor networks;Remote monitoring;Energy consumption;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Computer networks;Circuits;Transceivers;Batteries","","526","1","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997), proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state estimation. This was extended to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der Merwe et al., (2000). The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of (OL/sup 3/)/sup l/ for general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameter estimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an O(L/sup 2/) implementation. This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF) which is also O(L/sup 3/) for general state estimation and O(L/sup 2/) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L/sup 3/)).

For example, in Finland, more than 30% of the first pulse data of laser scanning reflect directly from the ground without any interaction with the canopy. By increasing the number of pulses, it is possible to have samples from each individual tree and also from the gaps between the trees. Basically, this means that several laser pulses can be recorded per m/sup 2/. This allows detailed investigation of forest areas and the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) tree height model. Tree height model can be calculated from the digital terrain and crown models both obtained with the laser scanner data. By analyzing the 3D tree height model by using image vision methods, e.g., segmentation, it is possible to locate individual trees, estimate individual tree heights, crown area, and, by using that data, to derive the stem diameter, number of stems, basal area, and stem volume. The advantage of the method is the capability to measure directly physical dimensions from the trees and use that information to calculate the needed stand attributes. This paper demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to accurately estimate standwise forest attributes, especially stem volume (biomass), using high-pulse-rate laser scanners to provide data, from which individual trees can be detected and characteristics of trees such as height, location, and crown dimensions can be determined. That information can be applied to provide estimates for larger areas (stands). Using the new method, the following standard errors were demonstrated for mean height, basal area and stem volume: 1.8 m (9.9%), 2.0 m/sup 2//ha (10.2%), and 18.5 m/sup 3//ha (10.5%), respectively.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.921414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=921414","","Laser modes;Remote sensing;Optical pulses;Biomass;Satellites;Laser radar;Data analysis;Image analysis;Image segmentation;Laser theory","","513","6","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main idea is to think of the image intensity as a 'stream function for a two-dimensional incompressible flow. The Laplacian of the image intensity plays the role of the vorticity of the fluid; it is transported into the region to be inpainted by a vector field defined by the stream function. The resulting algorithm is designed to continue isophotes while matching gradient vectors at the boundary of the inpainting region. The method is directly based on the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics, which has the immediate advantage of well-developed theoretical and numerical results.

Eel generators make use of the regular trail of traveling vortices behind a bluff body to strain the piezoelectric elements; the resulting undulating motion resembles that of a natural eel swimming. Internal batteries are used to store the surplus energy generated by the Eel for later use by a small, unattended sensor or robot. Because of the properties of commercially available piezoelectric polymers, Eels will be relatively inexpensive and are easily scaleable in size and have the capacity to generate from milli-watts to many watts depending on system size and flow velocity of the local environment. A practical Eel structure has been developed that uses the commercially available piezoelectric polymer, PVDF. Future Eels may use more efficient electrostrictive polymer. Every aspect of the system from the interactions between the hydrodynamics of the water flow and structural elements of the Eel, through the mechanical energy input to the piezoelectric material, and finally the electric power output delivered through an optimized resonant circuit has been modeled and tested. The complete Eel system, complete with a generation and storage system, has been demonstrated in a wave tank. Future work on the Eel will focus on developing and then deploying a small, lightweight, one-watt power generation unit, initially in an estuary and then subsequently in the ocean. Such Eels will have the ability to recharge batteries or capacitors of a distributed robotic group, or remote sensor array, thus extending the mission life indefinitely in regions containing flowing water.","1558-1691","","10.1109/48.972090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=972090","","Oceans;Rivers;Polymers;Batteries;Robot sensing systems;Circuit testing;Sensor arrays;Capacitive sensors;Electrostriction;Hydrodynamics","","512","4","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the high-wind-speed regions, the wind turbine is controlled to maintain the aerodynamic power produced by the wind turbine. Two methods to adjust the aerodynamic power were investigated: pitch control and generator load control, both of which are employed to regulate the operation of the wind turbine.

This method works instantly, without relying on changes of weather conditions. We present experimental results of complete dehazing in far from ideal conditions for polarization filtering.

For example, simple rotation, scaling, and/or translation (RST) of an image can prevent blind detection of a public watermark. In this paper, we propose a watermarking algorithm that is robust to RST distortions. The watermark is embedded into a one-dimensional (1-D) signal obtained by taking the Fourier transform of the image, resampling the Fourier magnitudes into log-polar coordinates, and then summing a function of those magnitudes along the log-radius axis. Rotation of the image results in a cyclical shift of the extracted signal. Scaling of the image results in amplification of the extracted signal, and translation of the image has no effect on the extracted signal. We can therefore compensate for rotation with a simple search, and compensate for scaling by using the correlation coefficient as the detection measure. False positive results on a database of 10 000 images are reported. Robustness results on a database of 2000 images are described. It is shown that the watermark is robust to rotation, scale, and translation.

Dynamic power management (DPM) is an effective tool in reducing system power consumption without significantly degrading performance. The basic idea is to shut down devices when not needed and wake them up when necessary. DPM, in general, is not a trivial problem. If the energy and performance overheads in sleep-state transition were negligible, then a simple greedy algorithm that makes the system enter the deepest sleep state when idling would be perfect. However, in reality, sleep-state transitioning has the overhead of storing processor state and turning off power. Waking up also takes a finite amount of time. Therefore, implementing the correct policy for sleep-state transitioning is critical for DPM success. It is argued that power-aware methodology uses an embedded microoperating system to reduce node energy consumption by exploiting both sleep state and active power management.","1558-1918","","10.1109/54.914626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914626","","Energy management;Intelligent networks;Wireless sensor networks;Power system management;Voltage control;Frequency;Power system modeling;Computer network management;Energy consumption;Central Processing Unit","","487","8","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We propose use of the post-processing SNRs (signal to noise ratios) of the multiplexed streams whereby the antenna subset that induces the largest minimum SNR is chosen.

Based on assumptions of plastic contact over wafer-abrasive and pad-abrasive interfaces, the normal distribution of abrasive size and an assumed periodic roughness of pad surface, a novel model is developed for material removal in CMP. The basic model is MRR=/spl rho//sub w/NVol/sub removed/, where /spl rho//sub w/ is the density of wafer N the number of active abrasives, and Vol/sub removed/ the volume of material removed by a single abrasive. The model proposed integrates process parameters including pressure and velocity and other important input parameters including the wafer hardness, pad hardness, pad roughness, abrasive size, and abrasive geometry into the same formulation to predict the material removal rate (MRR). An interface between the chemical effect and mechanical effect has been constructed through a fitting parameter H/sub w/ a ""dynamical"" hardness value of the wafer surface, in the model. It reflects the influences of chemicals on the mechanical material removal. The fluid effect in the current model is attributed to the number of active abrasives. It is found that the nonlinear down pressure dependence of material removal rate is related to a probability density function of the abrasive size and the elastic deformation of the pad. Compared with experimental results, the model accurately predicts MRR. With further verification of the model, a better understanding of the fundamental mechanism involved in material removal in the CMP process, particularly different roles played by the consumables and their interactions, can be obtained.","1558-2345","","10.1109/66.920723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920723","","Abrasives;Semiconductor device modeling;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Predictive models;Surface fitting;Chemical processes;Plastics;Gaussian distribution;Solid modeling","","486","5","42","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following a thorough singular value and eigenvalue analysis of the system dynamic interactions, five control sites consisting of four generators and one synchronous condenser are chosen to implement new power system stabilizers with a supplementary input from remote phasor measuring units, geographically spread over nine electrically coherent areas. Since the remote feedback loops are built on top of an existing decentralized control system, this design approach results in a decentralized/hierarchical control architecture with significant advantages in terms of reliability and operational flexibility. A systematic control and measurement pairing yielded four dominant natural loops, each associated with a significant open-loop inter-area oscillatory mode at 0.06, 0.4, 0.7 and 0.95 Hz respectively. These PSSs have a speed sensitive local loop operating in the usual way, and a wide-area measurement based global loop which involves a single differential frequency signal between two suitably selected areas. The tuning and coordination technique for these advanced multiple input signals PSSs is described. Their impacts on the system is assessed using both small-signal analysis and nonlinear simulations in a transient stability program. Wide-area stabilizing controllers have a significant potential in improving the dynamic performance of the Hydro-Quebec's existing power system.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.910791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910791","","Wide area measurements;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Control systems;Power system analysis computing;Open loop systems;Power system simulation;Power system transients;Frequency synchronization;Voltage","","482","2","37","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Roadmaps are employed as decision aids to improve coordination of activities and resources in increasingly complex and uncertain environments. Specific uses of roadmaps include: S&T management including strategy, planning, executing, reviewing, and transitioning; S&T marketing; enhancing communications among researchers, technologists, product managers, suppliers, users, and other stakeholders; identifying gaps and opportunities in S&T programs; and identifying obstacles to rapid and low-cost product development. S&T managers also use roadmaps to help identify those S&T areas that have high potential promise, and to accelerate the transfer of the S&T to eventual products. However, there has been little attention paid to the practice of roadmapping in the published literature. This paper is a first attempt to bring some common definition to roadmapping practices and display the underlying unity of seemingly fragmented roadmap approaches. The paper begins with generic roadmap definitions, including a taxonomy of roadmaps that attempts to better classify and unify the broad spectrum of roadmap objectives and uses. Characteristics of retrospective and prospective roadmaps are then identified and analyzed, as well as summary characteristics of bibliometric-based S&T mapping techniques. The roadmap construction process, including fundamental principles for constructing high-quality roadmaps, is presented in detail.","1558-0040","","10.1109/17.922473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922473","","Research and development management","","479","","6","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Allocating such partitions in the order in which the jobs arrive (FCFS scheduling) is fair and predictable, but suffers from severe fragmentation, leading to low utilization. This situation led to the development of the EASY scheduler which uses aggressive backfilling: Small jobs are moved ahead to fill in holes in the schedule, provided they do not delay the first job in the queue. We compare this approach with a more conservative approach in which small jobs move ahead only if they do not delay any job in the queue and show that the relative performance of the two schemes depends on the workload. For workloads typical on SP2 systems, the aggressive approach is indeed better, but, for other workloads, both algorithms are similar. In addition, we study the sensitivity of backfilling to the accuracy of the runtime estimates provided by the users and find a very surprising result. Backfilling actually works better when users overestimate the runtime by a substantial factor.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.932708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932708","","Runtime;Processor scheduling;Delay;Supercomputers;Measurement;Helium;Dynamic scheduling;Production;Laboratories","","479","7","27","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All packets belonging to the same flow obey a predefined rule and are processed in a similar manner by the router. For example, all packets with the same source and destination IP addresses may be defined to form a flow. Packet classification is needed for non-best-effort services, such as firewalls and quality of service; services that require the capability to distinguish and isolate traffic in different flows for suitable processing. In general, packet classification on multiple fields is a difficult problem. Hence, researchers have proposed a variety of algorithms which, broadly speaking, can be categorized as basic search algorithms, geometric algorithms, heuristic algorithms, or hardware-specific search algorithms. In this tutorial we describe algorithms that are representative of each category, and discuss which type of algorithm might be suitable for different applications.","1558-156X","","10.1109/65.912717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=912717","","Classification algorithms;Telecommunication traffic;Heuristic algorithms;Random access memory;Data structures;Routing;Software algorithms;Internet;Quality of service;Customer service","","472","87","15","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Interdomain routing in the Internet is coordinated by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The BGP allows each autonomous system (AS) to choose its own administrative policy in selecting routes and propagating reachability information to others. These routing policies are constrained by the contractual commercial agreements between administrative domains. For example, an AS sets its policy so that it does not provide transit services between its providers. Such policies imply that AS relationships are an important aspect of the Internet structure. We propose an augmented AS graph representation that classifies AS relationships into customer-provider, peering, and sibling relationships. We classify the types of routes that can appear in BGP routing tables based on the relationships between the ASs in the path and present heuristic algorithms that infer AS relationships from BGP routing tables. The algorithms are tested on publicly available BGP routing tables. We verify our inference results with AT&T internal information on its relationship with neighboring ASs. As much as 99.1% of our inference results are confirmed by the AT&T internal information. We also verify our inferred sibling relationships with the information acquired from the WHOIS lookup service. More than half of our inferred sibling-to-sibling relationships are confirmed by the WHOIS lookup service. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no publicly available information about AS relationships and this is the first attempt in understanding and inferring AS relationships in the Internet. We show evidence that some routing table entries stem from router misconfigurations.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.974527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974527","","Routing protocols;IP networks;Web and internet services;Inference algorithms;Educational institutions;Intelligent networks;Heuristic algorithms;Testing;Helium;Commercialization","","463","14","26","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While knowledge of the channel at the transmitter would produce similar benefits for wireless communications as well, the generation of reliable channel feedback is complicated by the rapid time variations of the channel for mobile applications. The purpose of this paper is to provide an information-theoretic perspective on optimum transmitter strategies, and the gains obtained by employing them, for systems with transmit antenna arrays and imperfect channel feedback. The spatial channel, given the feedback, is modeled as a complex Gaussian random vector. Two extreme cases are considered: mean feedback, in which the channel side information resides in the mean of the distribution, with the covariance modeled as white, and covariance feedback, in which the channel is assumed to be varying too rapidly to track its mean, so that the mean is set to zero, and the information regarding the relative geometry of the propagation paths is captured by a nonwhite covariance matrix. In both cases, the optimum transmission strategies, maximizing the information transfer rate, are determined as a solution to simple numerical optimization problems.

In these applications, one of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is clustering, which means the locality between objects in the multidimensional space being preserved in the linear space. It is widely believed that the Hilbert space-filling curve achieves the best clustering (Abel and Mark, 1990; Jagadish, 1990). We analyze the clustering property of the Hilbert space-filling curve by deriving closed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the asymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize previous work. They agree with the empirical results that the number of clusters depends on the hypersurface area of the query region and not on its hypervolume. We also show that the Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z curve. From a practical point of view, the formulas given provide a simple measure that can be used to predict the required disk access behaviors and, hence, the total access time.","1558-2191","","10.1109/69.908985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908985","","Hilbert space;Multidimensional systems;Image coding;Image databases;Geographic Information Systems;Moon;Shape;Time measurement;Fractals;Helium","","458","12","28","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although many authors assert that communities of practice create organizational value, there has been relatively little systematic study of the linkage between community outcomes and the underlying social mechanisms that are at work. To build an understanding of how communities of practice create organizational value, we suggest thinking of a community as an engine for the development of social capital. We argue that the social capital resident in communities of practice leads to behavioral changes, which in turn positively influence business performance. We identify four specific performance outcomes associated with the communities of practice we studied and link these outcomes to the basic dimensions of social capital. These dimensions include connections among practitioners who may or may not be co-located, relationships that build a sense of trust and mutual obligation, and a common language and context that can be shared by community members. Our conclusions are based on a study of seven organizations where communities of practice are acknowledged to be creating value.","0018-8670","","10.1147/sj.404.0831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5386944","","","","457","","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

Histogram equalization is the most popular algorithm for contrast enhancement due to its effectiveness and simplicity. It can be classified into two branches according to the transformation function used: global or local. Global histogram equalization is simple and fast, but its contrast-enhancement power is relatively low. Local histogram equalization, on the other hand, can enhance overall contrast more effectively, but the complexity of computation required is very high due to its fully overlapped sub-blocks. In this paper, a low-pass filter-type mask is used to get a nonoverlapped sub-block histogram-equalization function to produce the high contrast associated with local histogram equalization but with the simplicity of global histogram equalization. This mask also eliminates the blocking effect of nonoverlapped sub-block histogram-equalization. The low-pass filter-type mask is realized by partially overlapped sub-block histogram-equalization (POSHE). With the proposed method, since the sub-blocks are much less overlapped, the computation overhead is reduced by a factor of about 100 compared to that of local histogram equalization while still achieving high contrast. The proposed algorithm can be used for commercial purposes where high efficiency is required, such as camcorders, closed-circuit cameras, etc.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.915354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915354","","Histograms;Pixel;Low pass filters;Video equipment;Cameras;Image processing;Dynamic range;Image edge detection;Hardware;Image coding","","453","25","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rendering problem is defined as follows: Given a single input image of an object and a sample of images with varying illumination conditions of other objects of the same general class, re-render the input image to simulate new illumination conditions. The class-based recognition problem is similarly defined: Given a single image of an object in a database of images of other objects, some of them multiply sampled under varying illumination, identify (match) any novel image of that object under varying illumination with the single image of that object in the database. We focus on Lambertian surface classes and, in particular, the class of human faces. The key result in our approach is based on a definition of an illumination invariant signature image which enables an analytic generation of the image space with varying illumination. We show that a small database of objects-in our experiments as few as two objects-is sufficient for generating the image space with varying illumination of any new object of the class from a single input image of that object. In many cases, the recognition results outperform by far conventional methods and the re-rendering is of remarkable quality considering the size of the database of example images and the mild preprocess required for making the algorithm work.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.908964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908964","","Image recognition;Lighting;Rendering (computer graphics);Image databases;Image generation;Image analysis;Humans;Face;Photometry;Layout","","450","35","27","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network generalization capabilities of the stochastic network maintain a squared error within 10 percent of that of a floating-point implementation for a wide range of noise levels.

This approach produces a consistent set of transformations that have less pairwise registration error, i.e., better correspondence, than traditional methods that estimate the forward and reverse transformations independently. The transformations are estimated iteratively and are restricted to preserve topology by constraining them to obey the laws of continuum mechanics. The transformations are parameterized by a Fourier series to diagonalize the covariance structure imposed by the continuum mechanics constraints and to provide a computationally efficient numerical implementation. Results using a linear elastic material constraint are presented using both magnetic resonance and X-ray computed tomography image data.

An important feature of the proposed technique is the ability to exploit the time-selective channel as a provider of time diversity. This enables us to achieve performance superior to any other structure without increasing bandwidth or incorporating redundancy, in order to reduce the complexity of the estimator, we apply the theory of optimal low rank approximation to a minimum mean squared error channel estimator and present a theoretical calculation of mean squared error and simulations to confirm that the estimator is robust to changes in channel characteristics.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.939860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=939860","","Channel estimation;Signal detection;Time domain analysis;Frequency estimation;Fading;Time-varying channels;Interchannel interference;Bandwidth;Redundancy;Robustness","","436","11","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Power-aware metrics, where transmission power depends on distance between nodes and corresponding shortest power algorithms were also proposed. We define a power-cost metric based on the combination of both node's lifetime and distance-based power metrics. We investigate some properties of power adjusted transmissions and show that, if additional nodes can be placed at desired locations between two nodes at distance d, the transmission power can be made linear in d as opposed to d/sup /spl alpha// dependence for /spl alpha/ /spl ges/ 2. This provides basis for power, cost, and power-cost localized routing algorithms where nodes make routing decisions solely on the basis, of location of their neighbors and destination. The power-aware routing algorithm attempts to minimize the total power needed to route a message between a source and a destination. The cost-aware routing algorithm is aimed at extending the battery's worst-case lifetime at each node. The combined power-cost localized routing algorithm attempts to minimize the total power needed and to avoid nodes with a short battery's remaining lifetime.

A natural graphical model of such a realization has leaf edges representing symbols, ordinary edges representing states, and vertices representing local constraints. Such a graph can be decoded by any version of the sum-product algorithm. Any state realization of a code can be put into normal form without essential change in the corresponding graph or in its decoding complexity. Group or linear codes are generated by group or linear state realizations. On a cycle-free graph, there exists a well-defined minimal canonical realization, and the sum-product algorithm is exact. However, the cut-set bound shows that graphs with cycles may have a superior performance-complexity tradeoff, although the sum-product algorithm is then inexact and iterative, and minimal realizations are not well-defined. Efficient cyclic and cycle-free realizations of Reed-Muller (RM) codes are given as examples. The dual of a normal group realization, appropriately defined, generates the dual group code. The dual realization has the same graph topology as the primal realization, replaces symbol and state variables by their character groups, and replaces primal local constraints by their duals. This fundamental result has many applications, including to dual state spaces, dual minimal trellises, duals to Tanner (1981) graphs, dual input/output (I/O) systems, and dual kernel and image representations. Finally a group code may be decoded using the dual graph, with appropriate Fourier transforms of the inputs and outputs; this can simplify decoding of high-rate codes.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.910573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910573","","Dual codes","","427","20","50","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather, we examine tactics that go beyond communication technologies, tactics aimed at reducing intensive collaboration, national and organizational cultural differences, and temporal distance.","1937-4194","","10.1109/52.914734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=914734","","Programming;Collaborative software;Communication system control;International collaboration;Collaborative work;Software testing;Virtual groups;Project management;Technology management;Cultural differences","","426","","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

If simplified by the proposed method, all the remaining procedures necessary for the three-level SVPWM are done like conventional two-level inverter and the execution time is greatly reduced. The DC-link neutral-point potential control algorithms are implemented more easily. The proposed method can be applied to the multi-level inverters above three-level.

The EEG was recorded continuously during the procedure and patients' anesthesia states were assessed according to the responsiveness component of the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score. An OAA/S score of zero or one was considered asleep and two or greater was considered awake. Complexity of the EEG was quantitatively estimated by the measure C(n), whose performance in discriminating awake and asleep states was analyzed by statistics for different anesthetic techniques and different patient populations. Compared with other measures, such as approximate entropy, spectral entropy, and median frequency, C(n) not only demonstrates better performance (93% accuracy) across all of the patients, but also is an easier algorithm to implement for real-time use.

Our methods involve the evaluation of value functions at a finite set, consisting of ""representative"" elements of the state space. We show that with an arbitrary choice of this set, the approximation error can grow exponentially with the time horizon (time to expiration). On the other hand, if representative states are chosen by simulating the state process using the underlying risk-neutral probability distribution, then the approximation error remains bounded.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.935083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935083","","Pricing;Contracts;State-space methods;Dynamic programming;Approximation error;Uncertainty;Infinite horizon;Analytical models;Probability distribution;Bonding","","414","1","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Advances in hardware and methods for fast spatio-temporal cardiac imaging are extending the frontiers of clinical diagnosis and research on cardiovascular diseases. In the last few years, many approaches have been proposed to analyze images and extract parameters of cardiac shape and function from a variety of cardiac imaging modalities. In particular, techniques based on spatio-temporal geometric models have received considerable attention. This paper surveys the literature of two decades of research on cardiac modeling. The contribution of the paper is three-fold: (1) to serve as a tutorial of the field for both clinicians and technologists, (2) to provide an extensive account of modeling techniques in a comprehensive and systematic manner, and (3) to critically review these approaches in terms of their performance and degree of clinical evaluation with respect to the final goal of cardiac functional analysis. From this review it is concluded that whereas 3-D model-based approaches have the capability to improve the diagnostic value of cardiac images, issues as robustness, 3-D interaction, computational complexity and clinical validation still require significant attention.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.906421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906421","","Functional analysis;Heart;Biomedical imaging;Hardware;Clinical diagnosis;Cardiovascular diseases;Image analysis;Shape;Solid modeling;Paper technology","Diagnostic Imaging;Heart;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Cardiovascular","412","26","227","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If the correct key is specified in the watermark extraction procedure, then an output image is returned showing a proper watermark, indicating the image is authentic and has not been changed since the insertion of the watermark. Any modification would be reflected in a corresponding error in the watermark. If the key is incorrect, or if the image was not watermarked, or if the watermarked image is cropped, the watermark extraction algorithm will return an image that resembles random noise. Since it requires a user key during both the insertion and the extraction procedures, it is not possible for an unauthorized user to insert a new watermark or alter the existing watermark so that the resulting image will pass the test.

It is called this because it includes angular information at both link ends, e.g., at the base station and at the mobile station. We show that this angular information can be obtained with synchronized antenna arrays at both link ends. In wideband high-resolution measurements, we use a switched linear array at the receiver and a virtual-cross array at the transmitter. We evaluate the raw measurement data with a technique that alternately used estimation and beamforming, and that relied on ESPRIT (estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques) to obtain superresolution in both angular domains and in the delay domain. In sample microcellular scenarios (open and closed courtyard, line-of-sight and obstructed line-of-sight), up to 50 individual propagation paths are determined. The major multipath components are matched precisely to the physical environment by geometrical considerations. Up to three reflection/scattering points per propagation path are identified and localized, lending insight into the multipath spreading properties in a microcell. The extracted multipath parameters allow unambiguous scatterer identification and channel characterization, independently of a specific antenna, its configuration (single/array), and its pattern. The measurement results demonstrate a considerable amount of power being carried via multiply reflected components, thus suggesting revisiting the popular single-bounce propagation models. It turns out that the wideband double-directional evaluation is a most complete method for separating multipath components. Due to its excellent spatial resolution, the double-directional concept provides accurate estimates of the channel's multipath-richness, which is the important parameter for the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels.","1558-4143","","10.1109/74.951559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951559","","Antenna measurements;Delay estimation;Antenna arrays;Wideband;Linear antenna arrays;Spatial resolution;MIMO;Land mobile radio;Base stations;Radio transmitters","","411","4","36","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Obtaining such an estimate is a central part of solving the color constancy problem. Thus, the work presented will have applications in fields such as color-based object recognition and digital photography. Rather than attempting to recover a single estimate of the illuminant, we instead set out to recover a measure of the likelihood that each of a set of possible illuminants was the scene illuminant. We begin by determining which image colors can occur (and how these colors are distributed) under each of a set of possible lights. We discuss how, for a given camera, we can obtain this knowledge. We then correlate this information with the colors in a particular image to obtain a measure of the likelihood that each of the possible lights was the scene illuminant. Finally, we use this likelihood information to choose a single light as an estimate of the scene illuminant. Computation is expressed and performed in a generic correlation framework which we develop. We propose a new probabilistic instantiation of this correlation framework and show that it delivers very good color constancy on both synthetic and real images. We further show that the proposed framework is rich enough to allow many existing algorithms to be expressed within it: the gray-world and gamut-mapping algorithms are presented in this framework and we also explore the relationship of these algorithms to other probabilistic and neural network approaches to color constancy.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.969113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969113","","Layout;Lighting;Object recognition;Digital photography;Cameras;Reflectivity;Particle measurements;Neural networks;Shape;Light sources","","409","32","24","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the system, several channel ADCs operate at interleaved sampling times as if they were effectively a single ADC operating at a much higher sampling rate. However, mismatches such as offset, gain mismatches among channel ADCs as well as timing skew of the clocks distributed to them degrade S/N of the ADC system as a whole. This paper analyzes the channel mismatch effects in the time-interleaved ADC system. Previous analysis showed the effect for each mismatch individually, however in this paper we derive explicit formulas for the mismatch effects when all of offset, gain and timing mismatches exist together. We have clarified that the gain and timing mismatch effects interact with each other but the offset mismatch effect is independent from them, and this can be seen clearly in frequency domain. We also discuss the bandwidth mismatch effect. The derived formulas can be used for calibration algorithms to compensate for the channel mismatch effects.","1558-1268","","10.1109/81.915383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915383","","Sampling methods;Timing;Clocks;Calibration;Degradation;Bandwidth;Instruments;Large scale integration;Circuit testing;Circuit noise","","400","16","11","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Illumination and geometrical invariant properties are derived from the reflectance model. Invariance and discriminative power of the color invariants is experimentally investigated, showing the invariants to be successful in discounting shadow, illumination, highlights, and noise. Extensive experiments show the different invariants to be highly discriminative, while maintaining invariance properties. The presented framework for color measurement is well-founded in the physics of color as well as in measurement science.

We propose a novel switching-based median filter with incorporation of fuzzy-set concept, called the noise adaptive soft-switching median (NASM) filter, to achieve much improved filtering performance in terms of effectiveness in removing impulse noise while preserving signal details and robustness in combating noise density variations. The proposed NASM filter consists of two stages. A soft-switching noise-detection scheme is developed to classify each pixel to be uncorrupted pixel, isolated impulse noise, nonisolated impulse noise or image object's edge pixel. ""No filtering"" (or identity filter), standard median (SM) filter or our developed fuzzy weighted median (FWM) filter will then be employed according to the respective characteristic type identified.

Specifically, based on the directional information, a node grows it transmission power until it finds a neighbor node in every direction. The resulting network topology increases the network lifetime by reducing the transmission power and reduces traffic interference by having low node degrees. Moreover, we show that the routes in the multihop network are efficient in power consumption. We give an approximation scheme in which the power consumption of each route can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal by carefully choosing the parameters.

The iCAR system can efficiently balance traffic loads between cells by using ad hoc relaying stations (ARS) to relay traffic from one cell to another dynamically. This not only increases the system's capacity cost effectively, but also reduces the transmission power for mobile hosts and extends system coverage. We compare the performance of the iCAR system with conventional cellular systems in terms of the call blocking/dropping probability, throughput, and signaling overhead via analysis and simulation.

We observe that a wide variety of design objectives and constraints have a special form, i.e., they are posynomial functions of the design variables. As a result, the amplifier design problem can be expressed as a special form of optimization problem called geometric programming, for which very efficient global optimization methods have been developed. As a consequence we can efficiently determine globally optimal amplifier designs or globally optimal tradeoffs among competing performance measures such as power, open-loop gain, and bandwidth. Our method, therefore, yields completely automated sizing of (globally) optimal CMOS amplifiers, directly from specifications.

The system was designed to detect in real-time the following gait phases: stance, heel-off, swing, and heel-strike. The gait phase detection system employed a gyroscope to measure the angular velocity of the foot and three force sensitive resistors to assess the forces exerted by the foot on the shoe sole during walking. A rule-based detection algorithm, which was running on a portable microprocessor board, processed the sensor signals. In the presented experimental study ten able bodied subjects and six subjects with impaired gait tested the device in both indoor and outdoor environments (0-25/spl deg/C). The subjects were asked to walk on flat and irregular surfaces, to step over small obstacles, to walk on inclined surfaces, and to ascend and descend stairs. Despite the significant variation in the individual walking styles the system achieved an overall detection reliability above 99% for both subject groups for the tasks involving walking on flat, irregular, and inclined surfaces. In the case of stair climbing and descending tasks the success rate of the system was above 99% for the able body subjects and above 96% for the subjects with impaired gait. The experiments also showed that the gait phase detection system, unlike other similar devices, was insensitive to perturbations caused by nonwalking activities such as weight shifting between legs during standing, feet sliding, sitting down, and standing up.","1558-0210","","10.1109/7333.928571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928571","","Phase detection;Legged locomotion;Force measurement;Foot;Control systems;Real time systems;Gyroscopes;Velocity measurement;Phase measurement;Angular velocity","Adult;Algorithms;Automation;Biomechanics;Electromyography;Female;Gait;Humans;Male;Microcomputers;Middle Aged;Muscle, Skeletal","387","6","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fundamental limits are derived from the basic axioms of electromagnetic, communication, and thermodynamic theories, which immutably restrict interconnect performance, energy dissipation, and noise reduction. At the material level, the conductor resistivity increases substantially in sub-50-nm technology due to scattering mechanisms that are controlled by quantum mechanical phenomena and structural/morphological effects. At the device and circuit level, interconnect scaling significantly increases interconnect crosstalk and latency. Reverse scaling of global interconnects causes inductance to influence on-chip interconnect transients such that even with ideal return paths, mutual inductance increases crosstalk by up to 60% over that predicted by conventional RC models. At the system level, the number of metal levels explodes for highly connected 2-D logic megacells that double in size every two years such that by 2014 the number is significantly larger than ITRS projections. This result emphasizes that changes in design, technology, and architecture are needed to cope with the onslaught of wiring demands. One potential solution is 3-D integration of transistors, which is expected to significantly improve interconnect performance. Increasing the number of active layers, including the use of separate layers for repeaters, and optimizing the wiring network, yields an improvement in interconnect performance of up to 145% at the 50-nm node.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.915376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915376","","Integrated circuit interconnections;Conducting materials;Crosstalk;Inductance;Wiring;Thermodynamics;Energy dissipation;Noise reduction;Conductivity;Electromagnetic scattering","","386","143","52","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Model-integrated computing (MIC), an approach to model-based engineering that helps compose domain-specific design environments rapidly and cost effectively, is particularly relevant for specialized computer-based systems domains-perhaps even single projects.

Its goal is different from that of image watermarking, which embeds into the image a signature surviving most manipulations. Most existing methods for image authentication treat all types of manipulation equally (i.e., as unacceptable). However, some practical applications demand techniques that can distinguish acceptable manipulations (e.g., compression) from malicious ones. In this paper, we present an effective technique for image authentication which can prevent malicious manipulations but allow JPEG lossy compression. The authentication signature is based on the invariance of the relationships between discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients at the same position in separate blocks of an image. These relationships are preserved when DCT coefficients are quantized in JPEG compression. Our proposed method can distinguish malicious manipulations from JPEG lossy compression regardless of the compression ratio or the number of compression iterations. We describe adaptive methods with probabilistic guarantee to handle distortions introduced by various acceptable manipulations such as integer rounding, image filtering, image enhancement, or scaling-recaling. We also present theoretical and experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.905982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905982","","Robustness;Authentication;Transform coding;Image coding;Watermarking;Cryptography;Discrete cosine transforms;Digital signatures;Filtering;Digital images","","385","18","28","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thanks to the closed-loop operation, full compensation of the desired harmonics is achieved even in the presence of a significant delay in the current control. Thanks to the selective approach, active filter interactions with possible dynamic components of the load are minimized. Moreover, the complexity of the synchronous frame controllers is overcome using equivalent stationary frame controllers.

The answer to this question is valuable for two main reasons. First, it allows calibration of real world data-gathering protocols and an understanding of factors that prevent these protocols from approaching fundamental limits. Secondly, the dependence of lifetime on factors like the region of observation, the source behavior within that region, basestation location, number of nodes, radio path loss characteristics, efficiency of node electronics and the energy available on a node, is exposed. This allows architects of sensor networks to focus on factors that have the greatest potential impact on network lifetime. By employing a combination of theory and extensive simulations of constructed networks, we show that in all data gathering scenarios presented, there exist networks which achieve lifetimes equal to or >95% of the derived bounds. Hence, depending on the scenario, our bounds are either tight or near-tight.","","0-7803-7097-1","10.1109/ICC.2001.937346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937346","","Sensor phenomena and characterization;Intelligent sensors;Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Acoustic sensors;Protocols;Force sensors;Upper bound;Calibration;Micromechanical devices","","379","","12","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each fuzzy IF-THEN rule in our classification system has antecedent linguistic values and a single consequent class. We use a fuzzy reasoning method based on a single winner rule in the classification phase. The winner rule for a new pattern is the fuzzy IF-THEN rule that has the maximum compatibility grade with the new pattern. When we use fuzzy IF-THEN rules with certainty grades, the winner is determined as the rule with the maximum product of the compatibility grade and the certainty grade. In this paper, the effect of rule weights is illustrated by drawing classification boundaries using fuzzy IF-THEN rules with/without certainty grades. It is also shown that certainty grades play an important role when a fuzzy rule-based classification system is a mixture of general rules and specific rules. Through computer simulations, we show that comprehensible fuzzy rule-based systems with high classification performance can be designed without modifying the membership functions of antecedent linguistic values when we use fuzzy IF-THEN rules with certainty grades.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.940964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940964","","Fuzzy systems;Knowledge based systems;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy reasoning;Pattern classification;Fuzzy control;Control systems;Computer simulation;Helium;Application software","","378","2","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, all I/Q processing receiver structures, such as the low-IF receiver, face a common problem of matching the amplitudes and phases of the I and Q branches. In practice, imbalances are unavoidable in the analog front-end, which results in finite and usually insufficient rejection of the image frequency band. This causes the image signal to appear as interference on top of the desired signal. We carry out general signal analysis of an imbalanced I/Q processing receiver and propose novel methods for I/Q imbalance compensation using baseband digital signal processing. A simple structure for compensation is derived, based on a traditional adaptive interference canceller. Improved image rejection can also be obtained by using more advanced blind source separation techniques. Theoretical analysis of the performance of the proposed imbalance compensation structures is presented. In addition, some simulation results are provided in order to further evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. The results indicate that the I/Q imbalance can be effectively compensated during the normal operation of the receiver even in the rapidly changing case, as long as a linear system model for the imbalance is valid.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.950789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950789","","Signal processing;Face;Frequency;Signal analysis;Baseband;Digital signal processing;Interference cancellation;Blind source separation;Performance analysis;Linear systems","","376","69","27","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EFuNNs evolve their structure and parameter values through incremental, hybrid supervised/unsupervised, online learning. They can accommodate new input data, including new features, new classes, etc., through local element tuning. New connections and new neurons are created during the operation of the system. EFuNNs can learn spatial-temporal sequences in an adaptive way through one pass learning and automatically adapt their parameter values as they operate. Fuzzy or crisp rules can be inserted and extracted at any time of the EFuNN operation. The characteristics of EFuNNs are illustrated on several case study data sets for time series prediction and spoken word classification. Their performance is compared with traditional connectionist methods and systems. The applicability of EFuNNs as general purpose online learning machines, what concerns systems that learn from large databases, life-long learning systems, and online adaptive systems in different areas of engineering are discussed.","1941-0492","","10.1109/3477.969494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969494","","Fuzzy neural networks;Adaptive systems;Buildings;Hybrid intelligent systems;Intelligent networks;Intelligent structures;Neurons;Data mining;Machine learning;Databases","","373","1","3","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a wide range of problems including robust analysis and synthesis, multichannel H/sub 2/ stateand output-feedback syntheses, the approach leads to potentially less conservative linear matrix inequality (LMI) characterizations. This comes from the fact that the technical restriction of using a single Lyapunov function is to some extent ruled out in this new approach. Moreover, the approach offers new potentials for problems that cannot be handled using earlier techniques. An important instance is the eigenstructure assignment problem blended with Lyapunov-type constraints which is given a simple and tractable formulation.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.975496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975496","","Control system synthesis;Lyapunov method;Robust control;Linear matrix inequalities;Control systems;Riccati equations;Uncertainty;Robustness;Software tools;Automatic control","","367","","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Optimal routing tries to maximize the duration over which the sensing task can be performed, but requires future knowledge. As this is unrealistic, we derive a practical guideline based on the energy histogram and develop a spectrum of new techniques to enhance the routing in sensor networks. Our first approach aggregates packet streams in a robust way, resulting in energy reductions of a factor 2 to 3. Second, we argue that a more uniform resource utilization can be obtained by shaping the traffic flow. Several techniques, which rely only on localized metrics are proposed and evaluated.

However, if even a very small part of photovoltaic module (PV module) is prevented from receiving light, the generation power of the PV module is decreased disproportionately. This greater than expected decrease occurs because PV modules which do not receive adequate light cannot operate on the normal operating point, but rather operate as loads. As a result, the total power from the PV modules is decreased if even only a small part of the PV modules are shaded. In the present paper, a novel circuit, referred to as the generation control circuit (GCC), which enables maximum power to be obtained from all of the PV modules even if some of the modules are prevented from receiving light. The proposed circuit enables the individual PV modules to operate effectively at the maximum power point tracking, irrespective of the series connected PV module system. In addition, the total generated power is shown experimentally to increase for the experimental set-up used in the present study.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.923760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923760","","Circuits;Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Power generation;Power generation economics;Inverters;Lighting control;Costs;Voltage;Choppers","","363","74","4","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a partitioned approach to visual servo control that overcomes this problem. In particular, we decouple the x-axis rotational and translational components of the control from the remaining degrees of freedom. Then, to guarantee that all features remain in the image throughout the entire trajectory, we incorporate a potential function that repels feature points from the boundary of the image plane.

The algorithm exploits nonholonomic constraints that govern the motion of a vehicle on a surface to obtain velocity observation measurements which aid in the estimation of the alignment of the IMU as well as the forward velocity of the vehicle. It is shown that this can be achieved without any external sensing provided that certain observability conditions are met. A theoretical analysis is provided together with a comparison of experimental results between a nonlinear implementation of the algorithm and an IMU/GPS navigation system. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm. The real time implementation is also addressed through a multiple observation inertial aiding algorithm based on the information filter. The results show that the use of these constraints and vehicle speed guarantees the observability of the velocity and the attitude of the inertial unit, and hence bounds the errors associated with these states. The strategies proposed provides a tighter navigation loop which can sustain outages of GPS for a greater amount of time as compared to when the inertial unit is used with standard integration algorithms.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.964672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=964672","","Measurement units;Observability;Global Positioning System;Navigation;Land vehicles;Motion measurement;Velocity measurement;Motion estimation;Algorithm design and analysis;Information filters","","361","8","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To show the impact of the synchronization algorithms-which are most critical in OFDM-on system performance and complexity we consider the design of a complete receiver consisting of symbol synchronization, carrier/sampling clock synchronization and channel estimation. The performance of the algorithms is analyzed and a qualitative estimate of the resulting complexity is given. This allows one to draw conclusions concerning the achievable system performance under realistic complexity assumptions.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.917759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=917759","","Computer aided software engineering;Frequency synchronization;OFDM;Algorithm design and analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Digital video broadcasting;Performance analysis;Signal to noise ratio;System performance;TV receivers","","357","60","7","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We calculate a correction to the rational approximation of Y which enforces the PD-criterion to be satisfied. The correction is minimal with respect to the fitting error. The method is based on linearization and constrained minimization by quadratic programming.

It turns out that the domination redesign control law applies, achieving global practical stability and, under an additional assumption, global asymptotic stability. This additional assumption is satisfied in the practically important case when the quadratic part of a CLRF is itself a CLRF for the Jacobian linearization of the system. The CLRF based domination redesign possesses robustness to input unmodeled dynamics including an infinite gain margin.

For portable power a fuel cell coupled with a fuel container can offer a higher energy storage density and more convenience than conventional battery systems. In transportation applications, fuel cells offer higher efficiency and better part-load performance than conventional engines.

Self-assembly is accomplished using photolithographically defined part and substrate binding sites that are complementary shapes of hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers. The patterned substrate is passed through a film of hydrophobic adhesive on water, causing the adhesive to selectively coat the binding sites. Next, the microscopic parts, fabricated from silicon-on-insulator wafers and ranging in size from 150/spl times/150/spl times/15 /spl mu/m/sup 3/ to 400/spl times/400/spl times/50 /spl mu/m/sup 3/, are directed toward the substrate surface under water using a pipette. Once the hydrophobic pattern on a part comes into contact with an adhesive-coated substrate binding site, shape matching occurs spontaneously due to interfacial free energy minimization. In water, capillary forces of the adhesive hold the parts in place with an alignment precision of less than 0.2 /spl mu/m. Permanent bonding of the parts onto quartz and silicon is accomplished by activating the adhesive with heat or ultraviolet light. The resulting rotational misalignment is within /spl sim/0.3/spl deg/. Using square sites, 98-part arrays have been assembled in less than 1 min with 100% yield.

An emerging style that is receiving increasing attention is based on the notion of event. In an event-based architecture, distributed software components interact by generating and consuming events. An event is the occurrence of some state change in a component of a software system, made visible to the external world. The occurrence of an event in a component is asynchronously notified to any other component that has declared some interest in it. This paradigm (usually called ""publish/subscribe"", from the names of the two basic operations that regulate the communication) holds the promise of supporting a flexible and effective interaction among highly reconfigurable, distributed software components. In the past two years, we have developed an object-oriented infrastructure called JEDI (Java event-based distributed infrastructure). JEDI supports the development and operation of event-based systems and has been used to implement a significant example of distributed system, namely, the OPSS workflow management system (WFMS). The paper illustrates the main features of JEDI and how we have used them to implement OPSS. Moreover, the paper provides an initial evaluation of our experiences in using the event-based architectural style and a classification of some of the event-based infrastructures presented in the literature.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.950318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950318","","Middleware;Runtime;Computer architecture;Software systems;Java;Workflow management software;Software architecture;Broadcasting;Computer networks;Distributed computing","","345","6","61","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experiments using spatial, polarization, and pattern diversity were conducted for both line-of-sight (LOS) and obstructed outdoor and indoor multipath channels that experienced Ricean fading. Antenna separation, polarization, and pattern were varied independently to the extent possible. Envelope correlation, power imbalance, and diversity gain were calculated from the measurements. Diversity performance is measured by diversity gain, which is the difference in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the output of a diversity combiner and the signal on a single branch, measured at a given probability level. Diversity gain increases with decreasing envelope correlation between the antenna diversity branches. However, diversity gain decreases as the power imbalance between diversity branches increases because a branch that has a weak signal has only a small contribution to the combined signal. Diversity gain values of 7-9 dB at the 99% reliability level were achieved in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels for all diversity configurations even with very small antenna spacings. The use of polarization diversity reduced polarization mismatches, improving SNR by up to 12 dB even in LOS channels.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.947018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=947018","","Polarization;Diversity methods;Antennas and propagation;Antenna measurements;Gain measurement;Directive antennas;Base stations;Fading;Receiving antennas;Telephone sets","","345","42","30","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We focus on a slightly, easier problem: given a sequence of T images where the reflectance is constant and the illumination changes, can we recover T illumination images and a single reflectance image? We show that this problem is still imposed and suggest approaching it as a maximum-likelihood estimation problem. Following recent work on the statistics of natural images, we use a prior that assumes that illumination images will give rise to sparse filter outputs. We show that this leads to a simple, novel algorithm for recovering reflectance images.

The estimated rain rate is compared with that obtained from more traditional methods and the calculated characteristic size is compared with the measured values. The calculated K/sub DP/ based on the retrieved Gamma DSD is also compared with measurements.

The hidden Markov tree (HMT) model captures the key features of the joint probability density of the wavelet coefficients of real-world data. One potential drawback to the HMT framework is the need for computationally expensive iterative training to fit an HMT model to a given data set (e.g., using the expectation-maximization algorithm). We greatly simplify the HMT model by exploiting the inherent self-similarity of real-world images. The simplified model specifies the HMT parameters with just nine meta-parameters (independent of the size of the image and the number of wavelet scales). We also introduce a Bayesian universal HMT (uHMT) that fixes these nine parameters. The uHMT requires no training of any kind, while extremely simple, we show using a series of image estimation/denoising experiments that these new models retain nearly all of the key image structure modeled by the full HMT. Finally, we propose a fast shift-invariant HMT estimation algorithm that outperforms other wavelet-based estimators in the current literature, both visually and in mean square error.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.931100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931100","","Hidden Markov models;Bayesian methods;Wavelet transforms;Image edge detection;Image processing;Wavelet coefficients;Markov random fields;Image resolution;Signal processing;Probability","","343","2","36","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, we design detectors relying on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and on a two-step GLRT-based design procedure. Remarkably, both criteria lead to receivers ensuring the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property with respect to the unknown quantities. A thorough performance assessment of the proposed detection strategies, together with the evaluation of their processing cost, highlights that the two-step design procedure is to be preferred with respect to the plain GLRT.

Twenty clinical cases involving a total of 557 sectional images were used in this study. 71 nodules out of 98 were correctly detected by the authors' scheme (i.e., a detection rate of about 72%), with the number of false positives at approximately 1.1/sectional image. The authors' present results show that their scheme can be regarded as a technique for CAD systems to detect nodules in helical CT pulmonary images.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.932744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932744","","Computed tomography;Lungs;Cancer;Pattern matching;Computer aided diagnosis;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;X-ray detection;X-ray detectors;X-ray imaging","Algorithms;False Positive Reactions;Humans;Lung Neoplasms;Lung Neoplasms;Normal Distribution;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reference Values;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","340","8","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ZRP proactively maintains routing information for a local neighborhood (routing zone), while reactively acquiring routes to destinations beyond the routing zone. This hybrid routing approach can be more efficient than traditional routing schemes. However, without proper query control techniques, the ZRP cannot provide the expected reduction in the control traffic. Our proposed query control schemes exploit the structure of the routing zone to provide enhanced detection and prevention of overlapping queries. These techniques can be applied to single- or multiple-channel ad hoc networks to improve both the delay and control traffic performance of ZRP. Our query control mechanisms allow ZRP to provide routes to all accessible network nodes, with less control traffic than purely proactive link state or purely reactive route discovery, and with less delay than conventional flood searching.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.944341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=944341","","Routing protocols;Ad hoc networks;Network topology;Communication system traffic control;Convergence;Energy consumption;Mobile communication;Relays;Spread spectrum communication;Robustness","","339","7","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work proposes PCMA, a power controlled multiple access wireless MAC protocol within the collision avoidance framework. PCMA generalizes the transmit-or-defer ""on/off"" collision avoidance model of current protocols to a more flexible ""variable bounded power"" collision suppression model. The algorithm is provisioned for ad hoc networks and does not require the presence of base stations to manage transmission power (i.e. it is decentralized). The advantage of implementing a power controlled protocol in an ad-hoc network is that source-destination pairs can be more tightly packed into the network allowing a greater number of simultaneous transmissions (spectral reuse). Our initial simulation results show that the PCMA can improve the throughput performance of the non-power controlled IEEE 802.11 by a factor of 2 with potential for additional scalability as source-destination pairs become more localized, thus providing a compelling reason for migrating to a new power controlled multiple access wireless MAC protocol standard.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916704","","Access protocols;Collision avoidance;Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Ad hoc networks;Power control;Transmitters;Base stations;Energy management;Throughput","","339","22","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motivated by this model, we introduce a microarchitecture for a speculative virtual-channel router that significantly reduces its router latency to that of a brown hole router. Simulations using our pipelined model give results that differ considerably from the commonly assumed 'unit-latency' model which is unreasonably optimistic. Using realistic pipeline models, we compare wormhole and virtual-channel flow control.

We derive the ergodic capacity region of an M-user fading broadcast channel for code division (CD), time division (TD), and frequency division (FD), assuming that both the transmitter and the receivers have perfect channel side information (CSI). It is shown that by allowing dynamic resource allocation, TD, FD, and CD without successive decoding have the same ergodic capacity region, while optimal CD has a larger region. Optimal resource allocation policies are obtained for these different spectrum-sharing techniques. A simple suboptimal policy is also proposed for TD and CD without successive decoding that results in a rate region quite close to the ergodic capacity region. Numerical results are provided for different fading broadcast channels.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.915665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915665","","Information rates","","336","2","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These systems often rely on point-based registration to determine the transformation and many such systems use attached fiducial markers to establish accurate fiducial points for the registration, the points being established by some fiducial localization process. Accuracy is important to these systems, as is knowledge of the level of that accuracy. An advantage of marker-based systems, particularly those in which the markers are bone-implanted, is that registration error depends only on the fiducial localization and is, thus, to a large extent independent of the particular object being registered. Thus, it should be possible to predict the clinical accuracy of marker-based systems on the basis of experimental measurements made with phantoms or previous patients. For most registration tasks, the most important error measure is target registration error (TRE), which is the distance after registration between corresponding points not used in calculating the registration transform. Here, the authors derive an approximation to the distribution of TRE; this is an extension of previous work that gave the expected squared value of TRE. They show the distribution of the squared magnitude of TRE and that of the component of TRE in an arbitrary direction. Using numerical simulations, the authors show that their theoretical results are a close match to the simulated ones.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.952729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952729","","Neurosurgery;Surgery;Image registration;Hip;Anatomy;Accuracy;Imaging phantoms;Numerical simulation;Helium;Medical services","Diagnostic Imaging;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","333","6","28","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some experiments showing the good performance of our algorithms and evidencing an interesting feature of our methods are presented: their ability to achieve a kind of super-efficiency. The paper concludes with a discussion contrasting separating methods for non-Gaussian and nonstationary models and emphasizing that, as a matter of fact, ""what makes the algorithms work"" is-strictly speaking-not the nonstationarity itself but rather the property that each realization of the source signals has a time-varying envelope.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.942614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942614","","Source separation;Mutual information;Vectors;Covariance matrix;Independent component analysis;Image reconstruction;Laboratories;Computational modeling;Particle measurements;Blind source separation","","333","1","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach relies on: 1) the calculation of Shannon entropy (SE) of the distribution of patterns lasting three beats; 2) the calculation of a regularity index based on an entropy rate (i.e., the conditional entropy); 3) the classification of frequent deterministic patterns (FDPs) lasting three beats. A redundancy reduction criterion is proposed to group FDPs in four categories according to the number and type or of heart period changes: a) no variation (0V); b) one variation (1V); and c) two like variations (2LV); 4) two unlike variations (2UV). The authors found that: 1) the SE decreased during tilt due to the increased percentage of missing patterns; 2) the regularity index increased during tilt and CR10 as patterns followed each other according to a more repetitive scheme; and 3) during CR10, SE and regularity index were not redundant as the regularity index significantly decreased while SE remained unchanged. Concerning pattern analysis the authors found that: a) at rest mainly three classes (0V, 1V, and 2LV) were detected; b) 0V patterns were more likely during tilt; c) 1V and 2LV patterns were more frequent during CR10; and d) 2UV patterns were more likely during CR20.

The max-product ""belief propagation"" algorithm is a local-message-passing algorithm on this graph that is known to converge to a unique fixed point when the graph is a tree. Furthermore, when the graph is a tree, the assignment based on the fixed point yields the most probable values of the unobserved variables given the observed ones. Good empirical performance has been obtained by running the max-product algorithm (or the equivalent min-sum algorithm) on graphs with loops, for applications including the decoding of ""turbo"" codes. Except for two simple graphs (cycle codes and single-loop graphs) there has been little theoretical understanding of the max-product algorithm on graphs with loops. Here we prove a result on the fixed points of max-product on a graph with arbitrary topology and with arbitrary probability distributions (discrete- or continuous-valued nodes). We show that the assignment based on a fixed point is a ""neighborhood maximum"" of the posterior probability: the posterior probability of the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be greater than all other assignments in a particular large region around that assignment. The region includes all assignments that differ from the max-product assignment in any subset of nodes that form no more than a single loop in the graph. In some graphs, this neighborhood is exponentially large.

The algorithm prevents beam hardening artifacts by incorporating a polychromatic acquisition model. The continuous spectrum of the X-ray tube is modeled as a number of discrete energies. The energy dependence of the attenuation is taken into account by decomposing the linear attenuation coefficient into a photoelectric component and a Compton scatter component. The relative weight of these components is constrained based on prior material assumptions. Excellent results are obtained for simulations and for phantom measurements. Beam-hardening artifacts are effectively eliminated. The relation with existing algorithms is discussed. The results confirm that improving the acquisition model assumed by the reconstruction algorithm results in reduced artifacts.

We show reduction of as much as 33% in the rate of clusterhead changes owing to the use of the proposed technique. In a MANET that uses scalable cluster-based services, network performance metrics such as throughput and delay are tightly coupled with the frequency of cluster reorganization. Therefore, we believe that using MOBIC can result in a more stable configuration, and thus yield better performance.","","0-7695-1080-9","10.1109/CDCS.2001.918738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918738","","Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Bandwidth;Measurement;Throughput;Frequency;Base stations","","328","1","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ICCV 2001,"7 Aug 2002","2001","2","","34","41 vol.2","Blob trackers have become increasingly powerful in recent years largely due to the adoption of statistical appearance models which allow effective background subtraction and robust tracking of deforming foreground objects. It has been standard, however, to treat background and foreground modelling as separate processes-background subtraction is followed by blob detection and tracking-which prevents a principled computation of image likelihoods. This paper presents two theoretical advances which address this limitation and lead to a robust multiple-person tracking system suitable for single-camera real-time surveillance applications. The first innovation is a multi-blob likelihood function which assigns directly comparable likelihoods to hypotheses containing different numbers of objects. This likelihood function has a rigorous mathematical basis: it is adapted from the theory of Bayesian correlation, but uses the assumption of a static camera to create a more specific background model while retaining a unified approach to background and foreground modelling. Second we introduce a Bayesian filter for tracking multiple objects when the number of objects present is unknown and varies over time. We show how a particle filter can be used to perform joint inference on both the number of objects present and their configurations. Finally we demonstrate that our system runs comfortably in real time on a modest workstation when the number of blobs in the scene is small.","","0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937594","","Bayesian methods;Robustness;Real time systems;Mathematical model;Deformable models;Power system modeling;Surveillance;Technological innovation;Cameras;Filters","","325","11","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This invariably results in a waterfall development process that produces artificially frozen requirements documents for use in the next step in the development life cycle. Alternatively, this process creates systems with constrained architectures that restrict users and handicap developers by resisting inevitable and desirable changes in requirements. The spiral life-cycle model addresses many drawbacks of a waterfall model by providing an incremental development process, in which developers repeatedly evaluate changing project risks to manage unstable requirements and funding. An even finer-grain spiral life cycle reflects both the realities and necessities of modern software development. Such a life cycle acknowledges the need to develop software architectures that are stable, yet adaptable, in the presence of changing requirements. The cornerstone of this process is that developers craft a system's requirements and its architecture concurrently, and interleave their development.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.910904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910904","","Weaving;Computer architecture;Software systems;Software architecture;Buildings;Software development management;Software maintenance;Software design;Pattern analysis;Reverse engineering","","324","","","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We study three such aspects which impact routing: network elements which are reconfigurable, but in constrained ways; transmission impairments which may make some routes unusable; and diversity. We conclude that if emerging optical technology is to be maximally exploited, heterogeneous technologies with dissimilar routing constraints are likely. Four alternative architectures for dealing with this eventuality are identified and some trade-offs between centralizing or distributing some aspects of routing are discussed.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.900635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=900635","","Optical receivers;Optical fiber networks;Optical control;Bandwidth;Multiprotocol label switching;Optical interconnections;WDM networks;Internet;Routing protocols;Scalability","","324","3","7","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

First, a siphon-based characterization for the liveness of Petri nets (PNs) modeling C/D-RAS is developed, and subsequently, this characterization facilitates the development of a polynomial-complexity deadlock avoidance policy (DAP) that is appropriate for the considered RAS class. The resulting policy is characterized as C/D-RUN. The last part of the paper exploits the aforementioned siphon-based characterization of C/D-RAS liveness, in order to develop a sufficiency condition for C/D-RAS liveness that takes the convenient form of a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation. The availability of this MIP formulation subsequently allows the ""automatic"" correctness verification of any tentative C/D-RAS DAP for which the controlled system behavior remains in the class of PNs modeling C/D-RAS, and the effective flexibility enhancement of the aforementioned C/D-RUN DAP implementations. Finally, we notice that, in addition to extending and complementing the current theory on deadlock-free sequential resource allocation to the most powerful class of C/D-RAS, the presented results also (i) nontrivially generalize important concepts and techniques of ordinary PN structural analysis to the broader class of nonordinary PNs, while (ii) from a practical standpoint, they can find direct application in the (work-) flow management of modern production, service and/or transportation environments.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.956052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=956052","","System recovery;Resource management;Digital audio players;Routing;Petri nets;Polynomials;Linear programming;Control system synthesis;Power system modeling;Energy management","","323","","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is now clear that not all three phase induction motors are capable of generating such harmonics in the line current. Recent research has shown that the presence of these harmonics is primarily dependent on the number of rotor slots and the number of fundamental pole pairs of the machine. While the number of fundamental pole pairs of a three phase induction motor usually is within one to four (higher pole pairs are generally avoided due to increased magnetizing current), the number of rotor slots can vary widely. The present paper investigates this phenomenon further and obtains a hitherto nebulous theoretical basis for the experimentally verified results. Detailed coupled magnetic circuit simulation results are presented for a four pole, three phase induction motor with 44, 43, and 42 rotor slots under healthy, static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity conditions. The simulation is flexible enough to accommodate other pole numbers also. These simulations are helpful in quantifying the predicted harmonics under different combinations of load, pole pair numbers, rotor slots and eccentricity conditions, thus making the problem easier for drive designers or diagnostic tools' developers. Data from three different induction machines, namely, a 4 pole, 44 bar, 3 hp, a 4 pole, 28 bar, 3 hp and a 2 pole, 39 bar, 100 hp motor have been used to verify the results experimentally. The simulation and the experimental results clearly validate the theoretical findings put forward in this paper.","1558-0059","","10.1109/60.937205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937205","","Rotors;Induction motors;Circuit simulation;Fault detection;Phase detection;Phase estimation;Induction generators;Coupling circuits;Magnetic circuits;Predictive models","","316","1","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It spreads each signal in a balanced way over the transmitter antenna elements to provide maximal path diversity at the receiver. In doing so, no extra spreading codes, transmit power or channel information are required at the transmitter and only minimal extra hardware complexity at both sides of the link. Both our analysis and simulation results show significant performance gains over conventional single-antenna systems and other open-loop transmit diversity techniques. Our approach is a practical way to increase the bit rate and/or improve the quality and range in the downlink of either mobile or fixed CDMA systems.

"Genomic signal processing","D. Anastassiou",NA,IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,"7 Aug 2002","2001","18","4","8","20","Genomics is a highly cross-disciplinary field that creates paradigm shifts in such diverse areas as medicine and agriculture. It is believed that many significant scientific and technological endeavors in the 21st century will be related to the processing and interpretation of the vast information that is currently revealed from sequencing the genomes of many living organisms, including humans. Genomic information is digital in a very real sense; it is represented in the form of sequences of which each element can be one out of a finite number of entities. Such sequences, like DNA and proteins, have been mathematically represented by character strings, in which each character is a letter of an alphabet. In the case of DNA, the alphabet is size 4 and consists of the letters A, T, C and G; in the case of proteins, the size of the corresponding alphabet is 20. As the list of references shows, biomolecular sequence analysis has already been a major research topic among computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians. The main reason that the field of signal processing does not yet have significant impact in the field is because it deals with numerical sequences rather than character strings. However, if we properly map a character string into, one or more numerical sequences, then digital signal processing (DSP) provides a set of novel and useful tools for solving highly relevant problems. For example, in the form of local texture, color spectrograms visually provide significant information about biomolecular sequences which facilitates understanding of local nature, structure, and function. Furthermore, both the magnitude and the phase of properly defined Fourier transforms can be used to predict important features like the location and certain properties of protein coding regions in DNA.

The fuzzy PID controller is a discrete-time version of the conventional PID controller, which preserves the same linear structure of the proportional, integral, and derivative parts but has constant coefficient yet self-tuned control gains. Fuzzy logic is employed only for the design; the resulting controller does not need to execute any fuzzy rule base, and is actually a conventional PID controller with analytical formulae. The main improvement is in endowing the classical controller with a certain adaptive control capability. The constant PID control gains are optimized by using the multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA), thereby yielding an optimal fuzzy PID controller. Computer simulations are shown to demonstrate its improvement over the fuzzy PID controller without MOGA optimization.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.937407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937407","","Fuzzy control;Three-term control;Optimal control;Pi control;Proportional control;PD control;Fuzzy logic;Adaptive control;Genetic algorithms;Computer simulation","","313","","24","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

According to our data, the model is fully applicable from 0 to 2 THz while including lines up to 10 THz. Its primary goal is to simulate the millimeter/submillimeter region accessible from the ground (frequencies up to /spl sim/2 THz at most, with a few windows between 1 and 2 THz accessible only under exceptional conditions at very dry sites). Line-by-line calculations of the absorption are performed using a line database generated from the latest available spectroscopic constants for all relevant atmospheric species. The collisional line widths are obtained from published laboratory data. The excess of absorption in the longwave range that cannot be explained by the line spectrum is modeled by introducing two different continuum-like terms based on FTS measurements between 170 and 1100 GHz: collision-induced absorption of the dry atmosphere due to transient dipoles in symmetric molecules (N/sub 2/ and O/sub 2/) and continuum-like water vapor opacity. All H/sub 2/O lines up to 10 THz are included in order to correctly account for the entire H/sub 2/O far-wing opacity below 2 THz for a given line-shape. Hence, this contribution does not need to be part of a pseudocontinuum term below that frequency cutoff (still necessary, as shown in this paper) in contrast to other models used to date. Phase delays near H/sub 2/O and O/sub 2/ resonances are also important for ground-based astronomy since they affect interferometric phase. The frequency-dependent dispersive phase delay function is formally related to the absorption line shape via the Kramers-Kronig dispersion theory, and this relation has been used for modeling those delays. Precise calculations of phase delays are essential for the future Atacama large millimeter array (ALMA) project. A software package called atmospheric transmission at microwaves (ATM) has been developed to provide the radioastronomy and aeronomy communities with an updated tool to compute the atmospheric spectrum in clear-sky conditions for various scientific applications. We use this model to provide detailed simulations of atmospheric transmission and phase dispersion for several sites suitable for submillimeter astronomy.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.982447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982447","","Atmospheric modeling;Delay;Absorption;Atmospheric measurements;Frequency;Astronomy;Dispersion;Phased arrays;Microwave propagation;Microwave measurements","","311","","63","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most reported single-stage PFC rectifiers cascade a boost-type converter with a forward or a flyback DC-DC converter so that input current shaping, isolation, and fast output voltage regulation are performed in one single stage. The cost and performance of single-stage PFC converters depend greatly on how its input current shaper (ICS) and the DC-DC converter are integrated together. For the cascade connected single-stage PFC rectifiers, the energy storage capacitor is found in either series or parallel path of energy flow. The second group appears to represent the main stream. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the second group. It is found that many of these topologies can be implemented by combining a two-terminal or three-terminal boost ICS cell with DC-DC converter along with an energy storage capacitor in between. A general rule is observed that translates a three-terminal ICS cell to a two-terminal ICS cell using an additional winding from the transformer and vice verse. According to the translation rule, many of the reported single-stage PFC topologies can be viewed as electrically equivalent to one another. Several new PFC converters were derived from some existing topologies using the translation rule.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.923768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923768","","Topology;Reactive power;Rectifiers;Costs;Voltage control;Energy storage;Capacitors;Power factor correction;Power system harmonics;Power harmonic filters","","309","3","48","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose the design criteria that utilize a large Hamming distance inherited in a low-rate code and a new labeling technique designed specifically for fading channels. This results in a large coding gain over noniterative coded modulation and performance close to that of ""turbo"" coded modulation with less complexity. We also show that BICM-ID designed for fading channels usually has a very good performance over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel while the converse is difficult to achieve. When combined with signal space diversity, diversity order can be improved to twice the diversity order of conventional BICM-ID; therefore, the code complexity can further be reduced while maintaining the same level of performance. Specifically, with the bandwidth efficiency of 2 bits/s/Hz over Rayleigh fading channels, a bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -6/ can be achieved with 16-QAM, a four-state rate 1/2 code at E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of about seven dB.

The lifetime of a bubble depends on properties of the bubble shell, the gas core, and the acoustic waveform impinging on the bubble. Three mechanisms of microbubble destruction are considered: fragmentation, acoustically driven diffusion, and static diffusion. Fragmentation is responsible for rapid destruction of contrast agents on a time scale of microseconds. The primary characteristics of fragmentation are a very large expansion and subsequent contraction, resulting in instability of the bubble. Optical studies using a novel pulsed-laser optical system show the expansion and contraction of ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles with the ratio of maximum diameter to minimum diameter greater than 10. Fragmentation is dependent on the transmission pressure, occurring in over 55% of bubbles insonified with a peak negative transmission pressure of 2.4 MPa and in less than 10% of bubbles insonified with a peak negative transmission pressure of 0.8 MPa. The echo received from a bubble decorrelates significantly within two pulses when the bubble is fragmented, creating an opportunity for rapid detection of bubbles via a decorrelation-based analysis. Preliminary findings with a mouse tumor model verify the occurrence of fragmentation in vivo. A much slower mechanism of bubble destruction is diffusion, which is driven by both a concentration gradient between the concentration of gas in the bubble compared with the concentration of gas in the liquid, as well as convective effects of motion of the gas-liquid interface. The rate of diffusion increases during insonation, because of acoustically driven diffusion, producing changes in diameter on the time scale of the acoustic pulse length, thus, on the order of microseconds. Gas bubbles diffuse while they are not being insonified, termed static diffusion.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.896136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896136","","Ultrasonic imaging;Acoustic pulses;Decorrelation;Blood vessels;Acoustic signal detection;Drug delivery;Acoustic waves;Optical pulses;Mice;Neoplasms","Animals;Blood Vessels;Contrast Media;Contrast Media;Humans;Male;Mice;Mice, Nude;Phospholipids;Phospholipids;Prostatic Neoplasms;Prostatic Neoplasms;Tumor Cells, Cultured;Ultrasonography;Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays","306","5","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the bulk of the power dissipated is dynamic switching power leakage power is also beginning to be a concern. Chipmakers expect that in future chip generations, leakage's proportion of total chip power will increase significantly. This paper examines methods for reducing leakage power within the cache memories of the CPU. Because caches comprise much of a CPU chip's area and transistor counts, they are reasonable targets for attacking leakage. We discuss policies and implementations for reducing cache leakage by invalidating and ""turning off"" cache lines when they hold data not likely to be reused. In particular our approach is targeted at the generational nature of cache line usage. That is, cache lines typically have a flurry of frequent use when first brought into the cache, and then have a period of ""dead time"" before they are evicted. By devising effective, low-power ways of deducing dead time, our results show that in many cases we can reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 4/spl times/ in SPEC2000 applications without impacting performance. Because our decay-based techniques have notions of competitive on-line algorithms at their roots, their energy usage can be theoretically bounded at within a factor of two of the optimal oracle-based policy. We also examine adaptive decay-based policies that make energy-minimizing policy choices on a per-application basis by choosing appropriate decay intervals individually, for each cache line. Our proposed adaptive policies effectively reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 5/spl times/ for the SPEC2000 with only negligible degradations in performance.","1063-6897","0-7695-1162-7","10.1109/ISCA.2001.937453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937453","","Power generation;Power dissipation;Turning;Central Processing Unit;Leakage current;Circuits and systems;Cache memory;Thermal degradation;Pressing;Energy management","","306","28","36","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The weight vectors of the vector-extended version of the Borgiotti-Kaplan beamformer are then projected onto the signal subspace of the measurement covariance matrix to obtain the final form of the proposed beamformer's weight vectors.

The authors also applied the proposed beam former to two sets of auditory-evoked MEG data, and the results clearly demonstrated the method's capability of reconstructing spatio-temporal activities of neural sources.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.930901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930901","","Image reconstruction;Sensor arrays;Magnetoencephalography;Biomedical signal processing;Signal resolution;Adaptive arrays;Radar signal processing;Covariance matrix;Spatial resolution;Signal to noise ratio","Brain Mapping;Evoked Potentials, Auditory;Magnetoencephalography;Models, Neurological;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","304","6","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At AT&T Laboratories Cambridge, we have built a system that uses sensors to update a model of the real world. We designed the model's terms (object positions, descriptions and state, and so forth) to be immediately familiar to users. Thus, the model describes the world much as users themselves would. We can use this model to write programs that react to changes in the environment according to the user's preferences. We call this sentient computing because the applications appear to share the user's perception of the environment. Treating the current state of the environment as common ground between computers and users provides new ways of interacting with information systems. A sentient computing system doesn't need to be intelligent or capable of forming new concepts about the world, it only needs to act as though its perceptions duplicate the user's. In earlier work, we described a prototype of this system and stated our intention to deploy it on a large scale. We have now installed an enhanced version throughout an office building. Over the past year, approximately 50 staff members have used the system daily with a set of trial applications.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.940013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940013","","Sensor systems;Computer networks;Computer network management;Environmental management;Mobile computing;Laboratories;Computer applications;Application software;Information systems;Prototypes","","301","11","12","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is shown that this problem can be rewritten as a linear program with mixed integer/linear constraints that account for the collision avoidance. A key benefit of this approach is that the path optimization can be readily solved using the CPLEX optimization software with an AMPL/Matlab interface. An example is worked out to show that the framework of mixed integer/linear programming is well suited for path planning and collision avoidance problems. Implementation issues are also considered.

In this paper we propose Basic Block Distribution Analysis as an automated approach for finding these small portions of the program to simulate that are representative of the entire program's execution. This approach is based upon using profiles of a program's code structure (basic blocks) to uniquely identify different phases of execution in the program. We show that the periodicity of the basic block frequency profile reflects the periodicity of detailed simulation across several different architectural metrics (e.g., IPC, branch miss rate, cache miss rate, value misprediction, address misprediction, and reorder buffer occupancy). Since basic block frequencies can be collected using very fast profiling tools, our approach provides a practical technique for finding the periodicity and simulation points in applications.","1089-796X","0-7695-1363-8","10.1109/PACT.2001.953283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=953283","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Fingerprint recognition;Application software;Computer simulation;Pipelines;Frequency estimation;Delay estimation;Timing;Computer science","","300","11","13","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The technique is generally applicable to classes E, C, and F as well as PAs with harmonic reactances not corresponding to those of established classes. The analysis shows that the maximum achievable efficiency depends not upon the class of operation, but upon the number of harmonics employed. For any set of harmonic reactances, the same maximum efficiency can be achieved by proper adjustment of the waveforms and the fundamental-frequency load reactance.

Wireless nodes have the unique capability of transmission at different power levels. As the transmission power is varied, a tradeoff exists between the number of hops from source to destination and the overall bandwidth available to individual nodes. Because both battery life and channel bandwidth are limited resources in mobile networks, it is important to ascertain the effects different transmission powers have on the overall performance of the network. This paper explores the nature of this transmission power tradeoff in mobile networks to determine the optimum node density for delivering the maximum number of data packets.

"Simultaneous linear estimation of multiple view geometry and lens distortion","A. W.

CVPR 2001,"15 Apr 2003","2001","1","","I","I","A problem in uncalibrated stereo reconstruction is that cameras which deviate from the pinhole model have to be pre-calibrated in order to correct for nonlinear lens distortion. If they are not, and point correspondence is attempted using the uncorrected images, the matching constraints provided by the fundamental matrix must be set so loose that point matching is significantly hampered. This paper shows how linear estimation of the fundamental matrix from two-view point correspondences may be augmented to include one term of radial lens distortion. This is achieved by (1) changing from the standard radial-lens model to another which (as we show) has equivalent power, but which takes a simpler form in homogeneous coordinates, and (2) expressing fundamental matrix estimation as a quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP), for which efficient algorithms are well known. I derive the new estimator, and compare its performance against bundle-adjusted calibration-grid data. The new estimator is fast enough to be included in a RANSAC-based matching loop, and we show cases of matching being rendered possible by its use. I show how the same lens can be calibrated in a natural scene where the lack of straight lines precludes most previous techniques. The modification when the multi-view relation is a planar homography or trifocal tensor is described.","1063-6919","0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.990465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990465","","Geometry;Lenses;Nonlinear distortion;Transmission line matrix methods;Stereo image processing;Image reconstruction;Cameras;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Layout;Tensile stress","","290","11","20","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Latency-insensitive designs are synchronous distributed systems and are realized by composing functional modules that exchange data on communication channels according to an appropriate protocol. The protocol works on the assumption that the modules are stallable, a weak condition to ask them to obey. The goal of the protocol is to guarantee that latency-insensitive designs composed of functionally correct modules behave correctly independently of the channel latencies. This allows us to increase the robustness of a design implementation because any delay variations of a channel can be ""recovered"" by changing the channel latency while the overall system functionality remains unaffected. As a consequence, an important application of the proposed theory is represented by the latency-insensitive methodology to design large digital integrated circuits by using deep submicrometer technologies.","1937-4151","","10.1109/43.945302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=945302","","Protocols;Design methodology;Clocks;Integrated circuit technology;Integrated circuit interconnections;Communication channels;Application specific integrated circuits;Integrated circuit synthesis;Delay estimation;Assembly systems","","290","35","44","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The extension is important for clinical applications since landmark extraction is always prone to error. The authors' approach is based on a minimizing functional and can cope with isotropic as well as anisotropic landmark errors. In particular, in the latter case it is possible to include different types of landmarks, e.g., unique point landmarks as well as arbitrary edge points. Also, the scheme is general with respect to the image dimension and the order of smoothness of the underlying functional. Optimal affine transformations as well as interpolating thin-plate splines are special cases of this scheme. To localize landmarks the authors use a semi-automatic approach which is based on three-dimensional (3-D) differential operators.

Techniques for detecting or assessing the presence of stress could help improve the robustness of speech recognition systems. Although some acoustic variables derived from linear speech production theory have been investigated as indicators of stress, they are not always consistent. Three new features derived from the nonlinear Teager (1980) energy operator (TEO) are investigated for stress classification. It is believed that the TEO based features are better able to reflect the nonlinear airflow structure of speech production under adverse stressful conditions. The features proposed include TEO-decomposed FM variation (TEO-FM-Var), normalized TEO autocorrelation envelope area (TEO-Auto-Env), and critical band based TEO autocorrelation envelope area (TEO-CB-Auto-Env). The proposed features are evaluated for the task of stress classification using simulated and actual stressed speech and it is shown that the TEO-CB-Auto-Env feature outperforms traditional pitch and mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) substantially. Performance for TEO based features are maintained in both text-dependent and text-independent models, while performance of traditional features degrades in text-independent models. Overall neutral versus stress classification rates are also shown to be more consistent across different stress styles.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.905995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905995","","Stress;Speech recognition;Speech processing;Robustness;Speech analysis;Laboratories;Autocorrelation;Acoustic noise;Working environment noise;Multitasking","","287","4","57","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that for the symmetric DG device, ""volume inversion"" only occurs under subthreshold conditions, with a slightly negative impact on performance. Comparisons under the same off-state conditions show that the on-state inversion charge density of an asymmetric DG with one channel is only slightly less than that of a symmetric DG with two channels, if the silicon film is thin.

Light weight, small size and high power density are the result of using only switches and capacitors in the power stage of these converters. Thus, they serve as ideal power supplies for mobile electronic systems (e.g. cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and so forth). Switched-capacitor (SC) converters, with their large voltage conversion ratio, promise to be a response to such challenges of the 21st century as high-efficiency converters with low EMI emissions and the ability to realize steep step-down of the voltage (to 3 V or even a smaller supply voltage for integrated circuits) or steep step-up of the voltage for automotive industry or Internet services in the telecom industry.

Once established, these positions are propagated to more distant nodes, allowing the entire network to create an accurate map of itself. Major obstacles include overcoming inaccuracies in range measurements as great as /spl plusmn/50%, as well as the development of initial guesses for node locations in clusters with few or no anchor nodes.

To support this demand economically, transport networks are evolving to provide a reconfigurable optical layer which, with optical cross-connects, will realize a high-bandwidth flexible core. As well as providing large capacity, this new layer will be required to support new services such as rapid provisioning of an end-to-end connection under customer control. The first phase of network evolution, therefore, will provide a circuit-switched optical layer characterized by high capacity and fast circuit provisioning. In the longer term, it is currently envisaged that the bandwidth efficiency associated with optical packet switching (a transport technology that matches the bursty nature of multimedia traffic) will be required to ensure economic use of network resources. This article considers possible network application scenarios for optical packet switching. In particular, it focuses on the concept of an optical packet router as an edge network device, functioning as an interface between the electronic and optical domains. In this application it can provide a scalable and efficient IP traffic aggregator that may provide greater flexibility and efficiency than an electronic terabit router with reduced cost. The discussion considers the main technical issues relating to the concept and its implementation.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.910600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910600","","Optical packet switching;Optical fiber networks;Circuits;Optical devices;IP networks;Web and internet services;Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Costs","","284","23","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The kinematic properties of cobots differ markedly from those of robots. Most significantly, cobots have only one mechanical degree of freedom, regardless of their taskspace dimensionality. The instantaneous direction of motion associated with this single degree of freedom is actively servo-controlled, or steered, within the higher dimensional taskspace. This paper explains the kinematics of cobots and the continuously variable transmissions (CVT) that are essential to them. Powered cobots are introduced, made possible by a parallel interconnection of the CVT. We discuss the relation of cobots to conventionally actuated robots and to nonholonomic robots.

Drawing on the earlier work of Goodman and Mandayam (see IEEE Personal Commun. Mag., vol.7, p.48-54, 2000), we formulate the QoS of a data user via a utility function measured in bits per Joule. We consider distributed power control, modeled as a noncooperative game, where users maximize their utilities in a multicell system. Base station assignment based on received signal strength as well as received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are considered jointly with power control. Our results indicate that for both assignment schemes, such a procedure results in an inefficient operating point (Nash equilibrium) for the entire system. We introduce pricing of transmit power as a mechanism for influencing data user behavior and our results show that the distributed power control based on maximizing the net utility (utility minus the price) results in improving the Pareto efficiency of the resulting operating point. Variations of pricing based on global and local loading in cells are considered as a means of improving the efficiency of wireless data networks. Finally, we discuss the improvement in utilities through a centralized scheme where each base station (BS) calculates the best SIR to be targeted by the terminals it is assigned.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.957304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=957304","","Pricing;Power control;Intelligent networks;Base stations;Resource management;Multiaccess communication;Interference;Data systems;Power system modeling;Nash equilibrium","","282","2","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most hard real-time systems could miss some deadlines provided that it happens in a known and predictable way. Also, adding predictability on the pattern of missed deadlines for soft and firm real-time systems is desirable, for instance, to guarantee levels of quality of service. We introduce the concept of weakly hard real-time systems to model real-time systems that can tolerate a clearly specified degree of missed deadlines. For this purpose, we define four temporal constraints based on determining a maximum number of deadlines that can be missed during a window of time (a given number of invocations). This paper provides the theoretical analysis of the properties and relationships of these constraints. It also shows the exact conditions under which a constraint is harder to satisfy than another constraint.

Distinction is made between strategies where maintenance consists of replacement by a new (or ""good as new"") component and where it is represented by a less costly activity resulting in a limited improvement of the component's condition. Methods are also divided into categories where maintenance is performed at fixed intervals and where it is carried out as needed. A further distinction is made between heuristic methods and those based on mathematical models; the models themselves can be deterministic or probabilistic. From a review of present maintenance policies in electric utilities, it is concluded that maintenance at fixed intervals is the most frequently used approach, often augmented by additional corrections. Newer ""as needed""-type methods, such as reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), are increasingly considered for application in North America, but methods based on mathematical models are hardly ever used or even considered. Yet only mathematical approaches where component deterioration and condition improvement by maintenance are quantitatively linked can determine the effect of maintenance on reliability. Although more complex, probabilistic models have advantages over deterministic ones: they are capable of describing actual processes more realistically, and also facilitate optimization for maximal reliability or minimal costs.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.962408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962408","","Maintenance;Power system reliability;Mathematical model;Power industry;Power system modeling;North America;Cost function;Frequency;System performance;Degradation","","280","","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The need to build forecasting models is eliminated, and better trading performance is obtained. The direct reinforcement approach differs from dynamic programming and reinforcement algorithms such as TD-learning and Q-learning, which attempt to estimate a value function for the control problem. We find that the RRL direct reinforcement framework enables a simpler problem representation, avoids Bellman's curse of dimensionality and offers compelling advantages in efficiency. We demonstrate how direct reinforcement can be used to optimize risk-adjusted investment returns (including the differential Sharpe ratio), while accounting for the effects of transaction costs. In extensive simulation work using real financial data, we find that our approach based on RRL produces better trading strategies than systems utilizing Q-learning (a value function method).

Our method can be applied to pulse shaping OFDM systems with arbitrary time-frequency guard regions, OFDM based on offset quadrature amplitude modulation, and biorthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems. We furthermore propose the use of different subcarrier transmit powers (subcarrier weighting) and periodic transmitter precoding to achieve a carrier frequency acquisition range of the entire bandwidth of the OFDM signal, and a symbol timing acquisition range of arbitrary length. Finally, we provide simulation results demonstrating the performance of the new estimator.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.930629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930629","","Frequency estimation;Timing;OFDM;Frequency division multiplexing;Frequency synchronization;Wireless sensor networks;Statistics;Pulse shaping methods;Time frequency analysis;Quadrature amplitude modulation","","280","4","24","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, it is now accepted that natural or asymmetrical regular sampled PWM with a third harmonic injected or a space-vector centered reference waveform gives the best harmonic performance, with discontinuous modulation having some advantages for higher modulation ratios. This paper uses a general analytical solution for carrier-based PWM to mathematically identify the harmonic cancellation that occurs in various PWM implementations and converter topologies. This solution provides a formal justification for the superiority of natural and asymmetrical regular sampling techniques in eliminating half of their sideband harmonics simply by virtue of their phase leg switching. Then, the use of fundamental reference phase shifting between phase legs to create single- and three-phase 1-1 output voltages is reviewed, and the harmonic cancellation that occurs is identified. One significant result from this analysis is the realization that an odd/triplen carrier/fundamental ratio has no intrinsic harmonic benefit, contrary to the generally accepted wisdom. Finally, opportunities for harmonic elimination in multilevel cascaded inverter systems by carrier phase shifting are investigated, and the optimum phase shift is identified.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.913724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913724","","Pulse width modulation;Pulse width modulation inverters;Pulse width modulation converters;Leg;Topology;Voltage;Switches;Space vector pulse width modulation;Harmonic analysis;Industry Applications Society","","279","2","7","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In distance, progress, and direction-based approaches'(reported in the literature), when node A wants to send or forward message m to destination node D, it forwards m to its neighbor C which is closest to D (has best progress toward D, whose direction is closest to the direction of D, respectively) among all neighbors of A. The same procedure is repeated until D, if possible, is eventually reached. The algorithms are referred to as GEDIR, MFR, and DIR when a common failure criterion is introduced: The algorithm stops if the best choice for the current node is the node from which the message came. We propose 2-hop GEDIR, DIR, and MFR methods in which node A selects the best candidate node C among its 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors according to the corresponding criterion and forwards m to its best 1-hop neighbor among joint neighbors of A and C. We then propose flooding GEDIR and MFR and hybrid single-path/flooding GEDIR and MFR methods which are the first localized algorithms (other than full flooding) to guarantee the message delivery (in a collision-free environment). We show that the directional routing methods are not loop-free, while the GEDIR and MFR-based methods are inherently loop free. The simulation experiments, with static random graphs, show that GEDIR and MFR have similar success rates, which is low for low degree graphs and high for high degree ones. When successful, their hop counts are near the performance of the shortest path algorithm. Hybrid single-path/flooding GEDIR and MFR methods have low communication overheads. The results are also confirmed by experiments with moving nodes and MAC layer.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.963415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963415","","Floods;Wireless sensor networks;Routing protocols;Global Positioning System;Communication system control;Wireless networks;Distributed algorithms;Broadcasting;Remote monitoring;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration","","278","","39","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This autonomy refers to the extent to which the virtual agents are independent of user intervention and also the amount of information needed to simulate crowds. Thus, depending on the complexity of the simulation, simple behaviors can be sufficient to simulate crowds. Otherwise, more complicated behavioral rules can be necessary and, in this case, it can be included in the simulation data in order to improve the realism of the animation. We present three different ways for controlling crowd behaviors: by using innate and scripted behaviors; by defining behavioral rules, using events and reactions; and by providing an external control to guide crowd behaviors in real time. The two main contributions of our approach are: the possibility of increasing the complexity of group/agent behaviors according to the problem to be simulated and the hierarchical structure based on groups to compose a crowd.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.928167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928167","","Humans;Animation;Application software;Computational modeling;Virtual environment;Autonomous agents;Collaboration;Discrete event simulation","","278","15","28","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The research has demonstrated that linear active noise control (ANC) systems can be successfully applied to reduce the broadband noise and narrowband noise, specifically, such linear ANC systems are very efficient in reduction of low-frequency noise. However, in some situations, the noise that comes from a dynamic system may he a nonlinear and deterministic noise process rather than a stochastic, white, or tonal noise process, and the primary noise at the canceling point may exhibit nonlinear distortion. Furthermore, the secondary path estimate in the ANC system, which denotes the transfer function between the secondary source (secondary speaker) and the error microphone, may have nonminimum phase, and hence, the causality constraint is violated. If such situations exist, the linear ANC system will suffer performance degradation. An implementation of a Volterra filtered-X LMS (VFXLMS) algorithm based on a multichannel structure is described for feedforward active noise control. Numerical simulation results show that the developed algorithm achieves performance improvement over the standard filtered-X LMS algorithm for the following two situations: (1) the reference noise is a nonlinear noise process, and at the same time, the secondary path estimate is of nonminimum phase; (2) the primary path exhibits the nonlinear behavior. In addition, the developed VFXLMS algorithm can also be employed as an alternative in the case where the standard filtered-X LMS algorithm does not perform well.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.934136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934136","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Active filters;Adaptive filters;Active noise reduction;Low-frequency noise;Noise cancellation;Least squares approximation;Phase estimation;Standards development","","275","2","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we introduce a randomized tracking algorithm adapted from an existing probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) that is resistant to clutter and follows agile motion. The algorithm is applied to three different tracking modalities-homogeneous regions, textured regions, and snakes-and extensibly defined for straightforward inclusion of other methods. Second, we add the capacity to track multiple objects by adapting to vision a joint PDAF which oversees correspondence choices between same-modality trackers and image features. We then derive a related technique that allows mixed tracker modalities and handles object overlaps robustly. Finally, we represent complex objects as conjunctions of cues that are diverse both geometrically (e.g., parts) and qualitatively (e.g., attributes). Rigid and hinge constraints between part trackers and multiple descriptive attributes for individual parts render the whole object more distinctive, reducing susceptibility to mistracking.

We demonstrate a strong size confounding effect and question the results of previous object-oriented metrics validation studies. We first investigated whether there is a confounding effect of class size in validation studies of object-oriented metrics and show that, based on previous work, there is reason to believe that such an effect exists. We then describe a detailed empirical methodology for identifying those effects. Finally, we perform a study on a large C++ telecommunications framework to examine if size is really a confounder. This study considered the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics and a subset of the Lorenz and Kidd metrics. The dependent variable was the incidence of a fault attributable to a field failure (fault-proneness of a class). Our findings indicate that, before controlling for size, the results are very similar to previous studies.

The complex signal is built from a real signal by adding its Hilbert transform-which is a phase-shifted version of the signal-as an imaginary part to the signal. Since its introduction, the complex signal has become an important tool in signal processing, with applications, for example, in narrowband communication. Different approaches to an n-D analytic or complex signal have been proposed in the past. We review these approaches and propose the hypercomplex signal as a novel extension of the complex signal to n-D. This extension leads to a new definition of local phase, which reveals information on the intrinsic dimensionality of the signal.

Analytical and finite element models of device performance are presented along with measured results of devices fabricated using electroplated Ni and p/sup ++/ Si as structural materials. A maskless process extension for incorporating thermal and electrical isolation is described. Nickel devices with 410-/spl mu/m-long, 6-/spl mu/m-wide, and 3-/spl mu/m-thick beams demonstrate 10 /spl mu/m static displacements at 79 mW input power; silicon devices with 800-/spl mu/m-long, 13.9-/spl mu/m-wide, and 3.7-/spl mu/m-thick beams demonstrate 5 /spl mu/m displacement at 180 mW input power. Cascaded silicon devices using three beams of similar dimensions offer comparable displacement with 50-60% savings in power consumption. The peak output forces generated are estimated to be in the range from 1 to 10 mN for the single beam devices and from 0.1 to 1 mN for the cascaded devices.

The contributions of the various components of the fields, namely, static, induction, and radiation for the electric field, and induction and radiation for the magnetic field are illustrated and discussed. It is shown in particular that the presence of a tower tends, in general, to increase substantially the electric and magnetic field peaks and their derivatives. This increase is mainly caused by the presence of two oppositely propagating current wavefronts originating from the tower top and by the very high propagation velocity of current pulses within the tower, and depends essentially on the wavefront steepness of the channel-base current. Because of the last factor, the increase of the field magnitudes is found to be significantly higher for subsequent return strokes, which are characterized by much faster risetimes compared to first return strokes. The presented results are consistent with experimental observations of current in lightning strokes to the Toronto CN Tower and of the associated electric and magnetic fields measured 2 km away. These findings partially explain the fact that subsequent return strokes characterized by lower current peaks but higher front steepnesses and return stroke speeds may result in higher field peaks. The results obtained have important implications in electromagnetic (EM) compatibility. It is found that lightning strokes to tall metallic objects lead to increased EM field disturbances. Also, subsequent return strokes are to be considered an even more important source of EM interference than first return strokes. Indeed, EM fields from subsequent strokes are characterized by faster fronts and additionally, they may reach greater peaks than first strokes. Lastly, findings of this study emphasize the difficulty of extracting reliable lightning return stroke current information from remote EM field measurements using oversimplified formulae.","1558-187X","","10.1109/15.942607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942607","","Electromagnetic compatibility","","273","","46","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A discontinuous projection based adaptive robust controller (ARC) is first constructed. The controller theoretically guarantees a prescribed transient performance and final tracking accuracy in general, while achieving asymptotic tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties. A desired compensation ARC scheme is then presented, in which the regressor is calculated using the reference trajectory information only. The resulting controller has several implementation advantages such as less online computation time, reduced effect of measurement noise, a separation of robust control design from parameter adaptation, and a faster adaptation rate. Both schemes are implemented and compared on an epoxy core linear motor. Extensive comparative experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the achievable control performance of the two ARC designs.","1941-014X","","10.1109/3516.974858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974858","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Robust control;Motion control;Friction;Uncertainty;Control systems;Transmission line discontinuities;Noise measurement;Time measurement","","272","","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique uses a dual-output electrooptic sampling transducer to achieve both high linearity and 60-dB suppression of laser amplitude noise. The bandwidth of the technique is extended by optically distributing the post-sampling pulses to an array of time-interleaved electronic quantizers. We report on the performance of a 505-MS/s (megasample per second) optically sampled ADC that includes high-extinction LiNbO/sub 3/ 1-to-8 optical time-division demultiplexers. Initial characterization of the 505-MS/s system reveals a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 51 dB (8.2 bits) and a spur-free dynamic range of 61 dB. The performance of the present system is limited by electronic quantizer noise, photodiode saturation, and preliminary calibration procedures. None of these fundamentally limit this sampling approach, which should enable multigigahertz converters with 12-b resolution.

There are two types of filter choices: orthogonal and biorthogonal. Orthogonal filters have the property that there are energy or norm preserving. Nevertheless, modern wavelet coders use biorthogonal filters which do not preserve energy. Reasons for these specific design choices are explained. Another purpose of this article is to compare and contrast ""early"" wavelet coding with ""modern"" wavelet coding. This article compares the techniques of the modern wavelet coders to the subband coding techniques so that the reader can appreciate how different modern wavelet coding is from early wavelet coding. It discusses basic properties of the wavelet transform which are pertinent to image compression. It builds on the background material in generic transform coding given, shows that boundary effects motivate the use of biorthogonal wavelets, and introduces the symmetric wavelet transform.

Each MARG sensor contains a three-axis magnetometer, a three-axis angular rate sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer. The filter represents rotations using quaternions rather than Euler angles, which eliminates the long-standing problem of singularities associated with attitude estimation. A process model for rigid body angular motions and angular rate measurements is defined. The process model converts angular rates into quaternion rates, which are integrated to obtain quaternions. The Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is utilized to find the best quaternion that relates the measured accelerations and earth magnetic field in the body coordinate frame to calculated values in the earth coordinate frame. The best quaternion is used as part of the measurements for the Kalman filter. As a result of this approach, the measurement equations of the Kalman filter become linear, and the computational requirements are significantly reduced, making it possible to estimate orientation in real time. Extensive testing of the filter with synthetic data and actual sensor data proved it to be satisfactory. Test cases included the presence of large initial errors as well as high noise levels. In all cases the filter was able to converge and accurately track rotational motions.","","0-7803-6612-3","10.1109/IROS.2001.976367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976367","","Quaternions;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic sensors;Filters;Magnetic separation;Earth;Testing;Gravity;Magnetometers;Accelerometers","","269","23","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper gives an ""orthogonal"" decomposition of such a system based on information geometry. A typical example is the decomposition of stochastic dependency among a number of random variables. In general, they have a complex structure of dependencies. Pairwise dependency is easily represented by correlation, but it is more difficult to measure effects of pure triplewise or higher order interactions (dependencies) among these variables. Stochastic dependency is decomposed quantitatively into an ""orthogonal"" sum of pairwise, triplewise, and further higher order dependencies. This gives a new invariant decomposition of joint entropy. This problem is important for extracting intrinsic interactions in firing patterns of an ensemble of neurons and for estimating its functional connections. The orthogonal decomposition is given in a wide class of hierarchical structures including both exponential and mixture families. As an example, we decompose the dependency in a higher order Markov chain into a sum of those in various lower order Markov chains.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.930911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930911","","Probability","","267","1","38","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One way of generating electricity from renewable sources is to use wind turbines. A tendency to erect more and more wind turbines can be observed. As a result of this, in the near future wind turbines may start to influence the behaviour of electrical power systems. Therefore, adequate models to study the impact of wind turbines on electrical power system behaviour are needed. In this paper, a dynamic model of an important contemporary wind turbine concept is presented, namely a doubly fed (wound rotor) induction generator with a voltage source converter feeding the rotor. This wind turbine concept is equipped with rotor speed, pitch angle and terminal voltage controllers. After derivation of the model, the wind turbine response to two measured wind sequences is simulated.","","0-7803-7173-9","10.1109/PESS.2001.970114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=970114","","Wind turbines;Induction generators;Power system modeling;Power generation;Wind energy generation;Rotors;Power system dynamics;Voltage control;Energy conversion;Power systems","","267","1","10","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach is based on the parameterization of an effective roughness parameter as a function of surface characteristics: surface roughness (standard deviation of height and correlation length) and the surface soil moisture. The parameterizations that are developed are independent of incidence angle and polarization and are valid over a large range in surface roughness conditions, representative of most of typical agricultural bare fields, from very smooth (rolled field after sowing) to very rough surfaces (deeply plowed soil).

Pixel Devices International, Sunnyvale, CA, USA",IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits,"7 Aug 2002","2001","36","1","92","101","Temporal noise sets the fundamental limit on image sensor performance, especially under low illumination and in video applications. In a CCD image sensor, temporal noise is primarily due to the photodetector shot noise and the output amplifier thermal and 1/f noise. CMOS image sensors suffer from higher noise than CCDs due to the additional pixel and column amplifier transistor thermal and 1/f noise. Noise analysis is further complicated by the time-varying circuit models, the fact that the reset transistor operates in subthreshold during reset, and the nonlinearity of the charge to voltage conversion, which is becoming more pronounced as CMOS technology scales. The paper presents a detailed and rigorous analysis of temporal noise due to thermal and shot noise sources in CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) that takes into consideration these complicating factors. Performing time-domain analysis, instead of the more traditional frequency-domain analysis, we find that the reset noise power due to thermal noise is at most half of its commonly quoted kT/C value. This result is corroborated by several published experimental data including data presented in this paper. The lower reset noise, however, comes at the expense of image lag. We find that alternative reset methods such as overdriving the reset transistor gate or using a pMOS transistor can alleviate lag, but at the expense of doubling the reset noise power. We propose a new reset method that alleviates lag without increasing reset noise.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.896233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896233","","Active noise reduction;Photodiodes;Circuit noise;CMOS image sensors;CMOS technology;Image sensors;Lighting;Charge-coupled image sensors;Photodetectors;Pixel","","266","19","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this scheme, a thick region encompassing the entire colonic wall is extracted from an isotropic volume reconstructed from the CT images in CT colonography. Polyp candidates are detected by first computing of 3-D geometric features that characterize polyps, folds, and colonic walls at each voxel in the extracted colon, and then segmenting of connected components corresponding to suspicious regions by hysteresis thresholding based on these geometric features. We apply fuzzy clustering to these connected components to obtain the polyp candidates. False-positive (FP) detections are then reduced by computation of several 3-D volumetric features characterizing the internal structures of the polyp candidates, followed by the application of discriminant analysis to the feature space generated by these volumetric features. The locations of the polyps detected by our computerized method were compared to the gold standard of conventional colonoscopy. The performance was evaluated based on 43 clinical cases, including 12 polyps determined by colonoscopy. Our computerized scheme was shown to have the potential to detect polyps in CT colonography with a clinically acceptable high sensitivity and a low FP rate.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.974921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974921","","Computer aided diagnosis;Colonic polyps;Computed tomography;Gold;Virtual colonoscopy;Standards development;Data mining;Image reconstruction;Colonography;Colon","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Colonic Polyps;Colonography, Computed Tomographic;Colonography, Computed Tomographic;Colonography, Computed Tomographic;Databases, Factual;Diagnosis, Differential;False Positive Reactions;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;ROC Curve;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Retrospective Studies;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","266","39","46","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the BGP permits ASs to have conflicting policies that can lead to routing instability. This paper proposes a set of guidelines for an AS to follow in setting its routing policies, without requiring coordination with other ASs. Our approach exploits the Internet's hierarchical structure and the commercial relationships between ASs to impose a partial order on the set of routes to each destination. The guidelines conform to conventional traffic-engineering practices of ISPs, and provide each AS with significant flexibility in selecting its local policies. Furthermore, the guidelines ensure route convergence even under changes in the topology and routing policies. Drawing on a formal model of BGP, we prove that following our proposed policy guidelines guarantees route convergence. We also describe how our methodology can be applied to new types of relationships between ASs, how to verify the hierarchical AS relationships, and how to realize our policy guidelines. Our approach has significant practical value since it preserves the ability of each AS to apply complex local policies without divulging its BGP configurations to others.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.974523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974523","","Convergence;Guidelines;Routing protocols;Access protocols;Web and internet services;Educational institutions;Network topology;Traffic control;Helium;Degradation","","265","5","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Shifts in user behavior, changes in routing policies, and failures of network elements can result in significant (and sudden) fluctuations in load. We present a model of traffic demands to support traffic engineering and performance debugging of large Internet service provider networks. By defining a traffic demand as a volume of load originating from an ingress link and destined to a set of egress links, we can capture and predict how routing affects the traffic traveling between domains. To infer the traffic demands, we propose a measurement methodology that combines flow-level measurements collected at all ingress links with reachability information about all egress links. We discuss how to cope with situations where practical considerations limit the amount and quality of the necessary data. Specifically, we show how to infer interdomain traffic demands using measurements collected at a smaller number of edge links-the peering links connecting to neighboring providers. We report on our experiences in deriving the traffic demands in the AT&T IP Backbone, by collecting, validating, and joining very large and diverse sets of usage, configuration, and routing data over extended periods of time. The paper concludes with a preliminary analysis of the observed dynamics of the traffic demands and a discussion of the practical implications for traffic engineering.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.929850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=929850","","Telecommunication traffic;IP networks;Traffic control;Spine;Routing;Fluctuations;Web and internet services;Debugging;Delay effects;Throughput","","265","10","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effect is of great interest because it can be applied for multiplying the repetition rate of an arbitrary periodic pulse train without distorting the individual pulse features and essentially without loss of energy. In this way, pulse sequences in the terahertz regime can be generated from typical mode-locked pulse streams (with a few gigahertz repetition rates). The Talbot-based repetition-rate-multiplication technique can be implemented by using a linearly chirped fiber grating (LCFG) as the dispersive medium. As compared with other alternatives, an LCFG can be designed to provide the required bandwidth and dispersion characteristics in significantly more compact forms. Here, by using a signal-theory-based approach, we carry out a general theoretical analysis of the temporal self-imaging phenomenon and derive analytical expressions for all cases of interest (integer and fractional self-imaging effects). We also show how to design a LCFG for implementing the repetition-rate-multiplication technique and discuss the impact of nonidealities in the grating's response on the multiplication process. Results of our study are relevant from both a physical and a practical perspective.","1558-4542","","10.1109/2944.974245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974245","","Talbot effect;Optical fiber dispersion;Optical propagation;Optical pulses;Time domain analysis;Signal analysis;Gratings;Equations;Diffraction;Telecommunications","","259","","48","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is chiefly because of their mathematical simplicity: polygonal models lend themselves to simple, regular rendering algorithms that embed well in hardware, which has in turn led to widely available polygon rendering accelerators for every platform. Unfortunately, the complexity of these models, which is measured by the number of polygons, seems to grow faster than the ability of our graphics hardware to render them interactively. Put another way, the number of polygons we want always seems to exceed the number of polygons we can afford. Polygonal simplification techniques offer one solution for developers grappling with complex models. These methods simplify the polygonal geometry of small, distant, or otherwise unimportant portions of the model, seeking to reduce the rendering cost without a significant loss in the scene's visual content. The article surveys polygonal simplification algorithms, identifies the issues in picking an algorithm, relates the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, and describes several published algorithms.","1558-1756","","10.1109/38.920624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920624","","Solid modeling;Layout;Geometry;Isosurfaces;Games;Data visualization;Rendering (computer graphics);Costs;Computer graphics;Computational modeling","","259","6","33","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Over the past several years, different algorithms for the detection of full-pixel or subpixel targets with known spectral signature have been developed. The authors take a closer and more in-depth look at the class of subpixel target detection algorithms that explore the linear mixing model (LMM) to characterize the targets and the interfering background. Sensor noise is modeled as a Gaussian random vector with uncorrelated components of equal variance. The paper makes three key contributions. First, it provides a complete and self-contained theoretical derivation of a subpixel target detector using the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) approach and the LMM. Some other widely used algorithms are obtained as byproducts. The performance of the resulting detector, under the postulated model, is discussed in great detail to illustrate the effects of the various operational factors. Second, it introduces a systematic approach to investigate how well the adopted model characterizes the data, and how robust the detection algorithm is to model-data mismatches. Finally, it compares the derived algorithms with regard to two desirable properties: capacity to operate in constant false alarm rate mode and ability to increase the separation between target and background.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.934072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934072","","Object detection;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Detectors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Gaussian noise;Vectors;Automatic testing;Robustness;Detection algorithms","","259","6","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, while the accuracy of land cover target identification has been improved using fuzzy classification, it remains for robust techniques that provide better spatial representation of land cover to be developed. Such techniques could provide more accurate land cover metrics for determining social or environmental policy, for example. The use of a Hopfield neural network to map the spatial distribution of classes more reliably using prior information of pixel composition determined from fuzzy classification was investigated. An approach was adopted that used the output from a fuzzy classification to constrain a Hopfield neural network formulated as an energy minimization tool. The network converges to a minimum of an energy function, defined as a goal and several constraints. Extracting the spatial distribution of target class components within each pixel was, therefore, formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem with an optimal solution determined by the minimum of the energy function. This energy minimum represents a ""best guess"" map of the spatial distribution of class components in each pixel. The technique was applied to both synthetic and simulated Landsat TM imagery, and the resultant maps provided an accurate and improved representation of the land covers studied, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) for Landsat imagery of the order of 0.09 pixels in the new fine resolution image recorded.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.917895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=917895","","Image resolution;Hopfield neural networks;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Pixel;Satellites;Image sensors;Remote monitoring;Robustness;Fuzzy neural networks","","257","2","32","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes a multipath adaptive traffic engineering mechanism, called MATE, which is targeted for switched networks such as multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) networks. The main goal of MATE is to avoid network congestion by adaptively balancing the load among multiple paths based on measurement and analysis of path congestion. MATE adopts a minimalist approach in that intermediate nodes are not required to perform traffic engineering or measurements besides normal packet forwarding. Moreover MATE does not impose any particular scheduling, buffer management, or a priori traffic characterization on the nodes. This paper presents an analytical model, derives a class of MATE algorithms, and proves their convergence. Several practical design techniques to implement MATE are described.

Measurement results show that for an oversampling ratio of 100, the modulator achieves a dynamic range of 88 dB, a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 87 dB and a peak signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio of 85 dB in a signal bandwidth of 25 kHz.","1558-173X","","10.1109/4.910473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910473","","Delta modulation;Digital modulation;Switches;CMOS technology;Energy consumption;Switching circuits;Linearity;Circuit topology;Dielectric measurements;Dynamic range","","257","12","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Truthful mechanisms for one-parameter agents","A. Archer; E.

The goal of the mechanisms we consider is to allocate loads placed on the agents, and an agent's secret data is the cost she incurs per unit load. We give an exact characterization for the algorithms that can be used to design truthful mechanisms for such load balancing problems using appropriate side payments. We use our characterization to design polynomial time truthful mechanisms for several problems in combinatorial optimization to which the celebrated VCG mechanism does not apply. For scheduling related parallel machines (Q/spl par/C/sub max/), we give a 3-approximation mechanism based on randomized rounding of the optimal fractional solution. This problem is NP-complete, and the standard approximation algorithms (greedy load-balancing or the PTAS) cannot be used in truthful mechanisms. We show our mechanism to be frugal, in that the total payment needed is only a logarithmic factor more than the actual costs incurred by the machines, unless one machine dominates the total processing power. We also give truthful mechanisms for maximum flow, Q/spl par//spl Sigma/C/sub j/ (scheduling related machines to minimize the sum of completion times), optimizing an affine function over a fixed set, and special cases of uncapacitated facility location. In addition, for Q/spl par//spl Sigma/w/sub j/C/sub j/ (minimizing the weighted sum of completion times), we prove a lower bound of 2//spl radic/3 for the best approximation ratio achievable by truthful mechanism.","1552-5244","0-7695-1390-5","10.1109/SFCS.2001.959924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959924","","Cost accounting;Computer science;Game theory;Algorithm design and analysis;Load management;Polynomials;Design optimization;Approximation algorithms;Power generation economics;Operations research","","257","","31","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes techniques for meeting MDC objectives in the framework of standard transform-based image coding through the design of pairwise correlating transforms. The correlation introduced by the transform helps to reduce the distortion when only a single description is received, but it also increases the bit rate beyond that prescribed by the rate-distortion function of the source. We analyze the relation between the redundancy (i.e., the extra bit rate) and the single description distortion using this transform-based framework.

A challenging aspect of this problem is to find a suitable shape signature that can be constructed and compared quickly, while still discriminating between similar and dissimilar shapes. In this paper, we propose and analyze a method for computing shape signatures for arbitrary (possibly degenerate) 3D polygonal models. The key idea is to represent the signature of an object as a shape distribution sampled from a shape function measuring the global geometric properties of an object. The primary motivation for this approach is to reduce the shape matching problem to the comparison of probability distributions, which is simpler than traditional shape matching methods that require pose registration, feature correspondence or model fitting. We find that the dissimilarities between sampled distributions of simple shape functions (e.g. the distance between two random points on a surface) provide a robust method for discriminating between classes of objects (e.g. cars versus airplanes) in a moderately sized database, despite the presence of arbitrary translations, rotations, scales, reflections, tessellations, simplifications and model degeneracies. They can be evaluated quickly, and thus the proposed method could be applied as a pre-classifier in an object recognition system or in an interactive content-based retrieval application.","","0-7695-0853-7","10.1109/SMA.2001.923386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923386","","Shape measurement;Biological system modeling;Application software;Computer vision;Computer graphics;Biology computing;Probability distribution;Surface fitting;Robustness;Airplanes","","255","26","61","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The increasing influence of interconnect parasitics on crosstalk noise and R(L)C delay as well as electromigration and power dissipation concerns have stimulated the introduction of low-resistivity copper and low-permittivity (k) dielectrics to provide performance and reliability enhancement.

Each solution of the feature selection problem is represented as a binary string that indicates which features are selected and which are disregarded. In turn, each binary string corresponds to a point of a multidimensional binary space. Given a criterion function to evaluate the effectiveness of a selected solution, the proposed strategy is based on the search for constrained local extremes of such a function in the above-defined binary space. In particular, two different algorithms are presented that explore the space of solutions in different ways. These algorithms are compared with the classical sequential forward selection and sequential forward floating selection suboptimal techniques, using hyperspectral remote sensing images (acquired by the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer [AVIRIS] sensor) as a data set.

Since the HMT is particularly well suited to images containing singularities (edges and ridges), it provides a good classifier for distinguishing between textures. Utilizing the inherent tree structure of the wavelet HMT and its fast training and likelihood computation algorithms, we perform texture classification at a range of different scales. We then fuse these multiscale classifications using a Bayesian probabilistic graph to obtain reliable final segmentations. Since HMTseg works on the wavelet transform of the image, it can directly segment wavelet-compressed images without the need for decompression into the space domain. We demonstrate the performance of HMTseg with synthetic, aerial photo, and document image segmentations.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.941855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=941855","","Image segmentation;Hidden Markov models;Tree graphs;Wavelet transforms;Wavelet domain;Image texture;Tree data structures;Classification tree analysis;Fuses;Bayesian methods","","254","6","37","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the present experiment, a model of postural control was used to examine the impact of an abnormal distribution of body fat in the abdominal area upon postural stability. Obese and lightweight humanoids were destabilized by imposing a small initial angular speed from a neutral standing position. To avoid a loss of stability yielding a stepping reaction or a fall, an ankle torque is necessary to counteract the perturbation. Three torque parameters-ankle torque onset, time to peak torque, and muscular ankle torque-were entered in a program to simulate the intrinsic variability of the human postural control system. A loss of stability was detected when the center of pressure exceeded stability margins. The most striking observation is the nonlinear increase of torque needed to stabilize the humanoid when the motor response was chararterized by delayed temporal parameters. The effect was more pronounced when an anterior position of the center of mass was included in the simulations. This suggests that, when submitted to daily postural stresses and perturbations, obese persons (particularly those with an abnormal distribution of body fat in the abdominal area) may be at higher risk of falling than lightweight individuals.","1558-0210","","10.1109/7333.928572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928572","","Mathematical model;Abdomen;Stability;Hip;Biological system modeling;Humans;Torque control;Control system synthesis;Delay;Stress","Abdomen;Accidental Falls;Adipose Tissue;Models, Theoretical;Obesity;Posture;Risk Assessment;Torque","252","2","40","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Load-balancing deals with partitioning a program into smaller tasks that can be executed concurrently and mapping each of these tasks to a computational resource such as a processor (e.g., in a multiprocessor system) or a computer (e.g., in a computer network). By developing strategies that can map these tasks to processors in a way that balances out the load, the total processing time will be reduced with improved processor utilization. Most of the research on load-balancing focused on static scenarios that, in most of the cases, employ heuristic methods. However, genetic algorithms have gained immense popularity over the last few years as a robust and easily adaptable search technique. The work proposed here investigates how a genetic algorithm can be employed to solve the dynamic load-balancing problem. A dynamic load-balancing algorithm is developed whereby optimal or near-optimal task allocations can ""evolve"" during the operation of the parallel computing system. The algorithm considers other load-balancing issues such as threshold policies, information exchange criteria, and interprocessor communication. The effects of these and other issues on the success of the genetic-based load-balancing algorithm as compared with the first-fit heuristic are outlined.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.954620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954620","","Genetic algorithms;Processor scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Scheduling algorithm;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Parallel processing;Distributed computing;Multiprocessing systems;Robustness","","251","6","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A novel multistage hybrid appearance model methodology is presented in which a hybrid active shape model/active appearance model (AAM) stage helps avoid local minima of the matching function. This yields an overall more favorable matching result. An automated initialization method is introduced making the approach fully automated. The authors' method was trained in a set of 102 MR images and tested in a separate set of 60 images. In all testing cases, the matching resulted in a visually plausible and accurate mapping of the model to the image data. Average signed border positioning errors did not exceed 0.3 mm in any of the three determined contours-left-ventricular (LV) epicardium, LV and right-ventricular (RV) endocardium. The area measurements derived from the three contours correlated well with the independent standard (r=0.96, 0.96, 0.90), with slopes and intercepts of the regression lines close to one and zero, respectively.

Because of a delay constraint, the transmission of a codeword is assumed to span a finite (and typically small) number M of independent channel realizations; therefore, the relevant performance limits are the information outage probability and the ""delay-limited"" (or ""nonergodic"") capacity. We derive the coding scheme that minimizes the information outage probability. This scheme can be interpreted as the concatenation of an optimal code for the AWGN channel without fading to an optimal beamformer. For this optimal scheme, we evaluate minimum-outage probability and delay-limited capacity. Among other results, we prove that, for the fairly general class of regular fading channels, the asymptotic delay-limited capacity slope, expressed in bits per second per hertz (b/s/Hz) per decibel of transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), is proportional to min (t,r) and independent of the number of fading blocks M. Since M is a measure of the time diversity (induced by interleaving) or of the frequency diversity of the system, this result shows that, if channel-state information is available also to the transmitter, very high rates with asymptotically small error probabilities are achievable without the need of deep interleaving or high-frequency diversity. Moreover, for a large number of antennas, delay-limited capacity approaches ergodic capacity.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.923715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=923715","","Antenna arrays","","248","4","40","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the path capacity is often not the global mode, and so it cannot be estimated using standard statistical procedures. The effect of the size of the probing packets is also investigated, showing that the conventional wisdom of using maximum sized packet pairs is not optimal. We then study the dispersion of long packet trains. Increasing the length of the packet train reduces the measurement variance, but the estimates converge to a value, referred to as the asymptotic dispersion rate (ADR), that is lower than the capacity. We derive the effect of the cross traffic in the dispersion of long packet trains, showing that the ADR is not the available bandwidth in the path, as was assumed in previous work.

This makes it practicable for only a few independent power suppliers to service a given geographic region and in this imperfect market each power supplier can increase its own profit through strategic bidding. The profit of each supplier is influenced to varying extents by differences in the degree of imperfection of knowledge of rival suppliers. A new framework to build bidding strategies for power suppliers in an electricity market is presented in this paper. It is assumed that each supplier bids a linear supply function, and that the system is dispatched to minimize customer payments. Each supplier chooses the coefficients in the linear supply function to maximize benefits, subject to expectations about how rival suppliers will bid. A stochastic optimization formulation is developed and two methods proposed for describing and solving this problem. A numerical example serves to illustrate the essential features of the approach and the results are used to investigate the potential market power.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.910776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910776","","Electricity supply industry;Costs;Power supplies;Power generation;Oligopoly;Stochastic processes;Power markets;Production;Investments;Propagation losses","","247","","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With SILK, designers can quickly sketch an interface using an electronic pad and stylus, and SILK recognizes widgets and other interface elements as the designer draws them. Unlike paper-based sketching, however, designers can exercise these elements in their sketchy state. For example, a sketched scroll-bar is likely to contain an elevator or thumbnail, the small rectangle a user drags with a mouse. In a paper sketch, the elevator would just sit there, but in a SILK sketch, designers can drag it up and down, which lets them test component or widget behavior. SILK also supports the creation of storyboards-the arrangement of sketches to show how design elements behave, such as how a dialog box appears when the user activates a button. Storyboards are important because they give designers a way to show colleagues, customers, or end users early on how an interface will behave.","1558-0814","","10.1109/2.910894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910894","","Humans;Testing;Mice;Computer interfaces;Elevators;Prototypes;Text recognition;Writing;Usability;Liquid crystal displays","","246","16","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Using these new non-black-box techniques, we obtain several results that were previously proven to be impossible to obtain using black-box simulators. Specifically, assuming the existence of collision resistent hash functions, we construct a new zero-knowledge argument system for NP that satisfies the following properties: 1. This system has a constant number of rounds with negligible soundness error. 2. It remains zero knowledge even when composed concurrently n times, where n is the security parameter. Simultaneously obtaining 1 and 2 has been recently proven to be impossible to achieve using black-box simulators. 3. It is an Arthur-Merlin (public coins) protocol. Simultaneously obtaining 1 and 3 was known to be impossible to achieve with a black-box simulator. 4. It has a simulator that runs in strict polynomial time, rather than in expected polynomial time.

Using a continuous perturbation of the width of the coupled lines following a sinusoidal law, the wave impedance is modulated so that the harmonic passband of the filter is rejected while the desired passband response is maintained virtually unaltered. This strip-width perturbation does not require the filter parameters to be recalculated and, this way, the classical design methodology for coupled-line microstrip filters can still be used. At the same time, the fabrication of the resulting filter layout does not involve more difficulties than those for typical coupled-line microstrip filters. To test this novel technique, 3rd-order Butterworth bandpass filters have been designed at 2.5 GHz, with a 10% fractional bandwidth and different values of the perturbation amplitude. It is shown that for a 47.5 % sinusoidal variation of the nominal strip width, a harmonic rejection of more than 40 dB is achieved in measurement while the passband at 2.5 GHz is almost unaltered.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.942571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942571","","Microstrip filters;Band pass filters;Passband;Power harmonic filters;Impedance;Design methodology;Fabrication;Testing;Bandwidth;Strips","","242","","11","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The decision of whether to cluster a training image into an existing view representation or to treat it as a new view is based on the geometric accuracy of the match to previous model views. A new probabilistic model is developed to reduce the false positive matches that would otherwise arise due to loosened geometric constraints on matching 3D and non-rigid models.

The Internet community strongly fears that the current evolution could lead to congestion collapse and starvation of TCP traffic. For this reason, TCP-friendly protocols are being developed that behave fairly with respect to coexistent TCP flows.

We assume each node knows its geographical position and the position of the node to which it wants to send a packet. Initially, the nodes know only their neighbors. But over time they discover other nodes in the network. The routing table at a node S is a list <(p/sub i/,S/sub i/)>, where p/sub i/ is a geographical position and S/sub i/ is a neighbor of node S. When node S receives a packet for a node D at position pos(D), it finds the p/sub i/ in its routing table which is closest to pos(D) and forwards the packet to the neighbor S/sub i/. We prove the correctness of the algorithm and show that our algorithm naturally aggregates the nodes so that the routing tables remain small. We show that the mean routing table size is O(L~logn), where L~ is the average number of hops between two nodes and n is the number of nodes in the network.

A natural way for learning sequences is to use a finite-state automaton (FSA). However previous research indicates that FSA-learning is computationally expensive, that it cannot be completely automated or that the space usage of the FSA may be excessive. We present a new approach that overcomes these difficulties. Our approach builds a compact FSA in a fully automatic and efficient manner, without requiring access to source code for programs. The space requirements for the FSA is low - of the order of a few kilobytes for typical programs. The FSA uses only a constant time per system call during the learning as well as the detection period. This factor leads to low overheads for intrusion detection. Unlike many of the previous techniques, our FSA-technique can capture both short term and long term temporal relationships among system calls, and thus perform more accurate detection. This enables our approach to generalize and predict future behaviors from past behaviors. As a result, the training periods needed for our FSA based approach are shorter. Moreover false positives are reduced without increasing the likelihood of missing attacks. This paper describes our FSA based technique and presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the technique.","1081-6011","0-7695-1046-9","10.1109/SECPRI.2001.924295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=924295","","Intrusion detection;Learning automata","","235","30","30","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, the conventional range Doppler (RD) ISAR technique does not work properly when target motions generate terms higher than the first order in the phase of the received signal relative to each scatterer. This effect typically happens when at least one of these situations occur: (1) very high resolution images are required; (2) the target maneuvers; and (3) the target undergoes significant angular motions (roll, pitch, and yaw). A novel ISAR technique, named range instantaneous Doppler (RID), has been proposed for the reconstruction of very high resolution images of maneuvering targets. In this paper, we analytically show that the RID technique works properly when high-resolution ISAR images are required of maneuvering and/or rolling, pitching, and yawing targets; we also quantify the performance improvement of the RID technique with respect to the RD technique. The problem is tackled from an analytical point of view. First, we define a new model of the ISAR received signal that is valid for maneuvering targets, then we derive and compare the analytical expression of the point spread function (PSF) for the two techniques. Furthermore, we perform a statistical analysis to evaluate the improvement of the RID technique versus the RD technique in terms of spatial resolution. Finally, we prove the effectiveness of the RID technique by simulating the imaging process for two different targets: (1) a ship that undergoes roll, pitch and yaw motions and (2) a fast maneuvering airplane.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.974573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974573","","High-resolution imaging;Image resolution;Signal resolution;Inverse synthetic aperture radar;Signal generators;Radar scattering;Image reconstruction;Image analysis;Performance analysis;Signal analysis","","234","1","15","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The long-term goal in the design of underwater acoustic networks is to provide for a self-configuring network of distributed nodes with network links that automatically adapt to the environment through selection of the optimum system parameters.

The DEW algorithm embeds label bits by selectively discarding high frequency discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in certain image regions. The performance of the proposed watermarking algorithm is evaluated by the robustness of the watermark, the size of the watermark, and the visual degradation the watermark introduces. These performance factors are controlled by three parameters, namely the maximal coarseness of the quantizer used in pre-encoding, the number of DCT blocks used to embed a single watermark bit, and the lowest DCT coefficient that we permit to be discarded. We follow a rigorous approach to optimizing the performance and choosing the correct parameter settings by developing a statistical model for the watermarking algorithm. Using this model, we can derive the probability that a label bit cannot be embedded. The resulting model can be used, for instance, for maximizing the robustness against re-encoding and for selecting adequate error correcting codes for the label bit string.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.892451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892451","","Watermarking;Discrete cosine transforms;Streaming media;Transform coding;Robustness;Frequency;Protection;Degradation;Image coding;Intellectual property","","232","11","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the inherently stable LC characteristics of on-chip VLSI interconnect, the clock distribution network becomes a low-impedance distributed oscillator. The RTWO operates by creating a rotating traveling wave within a closed-loop differential transmission line. Distributed CMOS inverters serve as both transmission-line amplifiers and latches to power the oscillation and ensure rotational lock. Load capacitance is absorbed into the transmission-line constants whereby energy is recirculated giving an adiabatic quality. Unusually for an LC oscillator, multiphase (360/spl deg/) square waves are produced directly. RTWO structures are compact and can be wired together to form rotary oscillator arrays (ROAs) to distribute a phase-locked clock over a large chip. The principle is scalable to very high clock frequencies. Issues related to interconnect and field coupling dominate the design process for RTWOs. Taking precautions to avoid unwanted signal couplings, the rise and fall times of 20 ps, suggested by simulation, may be realized at low power consumption. Experimental results of the 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS test chip with 950-MHz and 3.4-GHz rings are presented, indicating 5,5-ps jitter and 34-dB power supply rejection ratio (PSRR).

Accurate estimation of the ultrasonic echo pattern is essential in determining the object/propagation path properties. In this study, we model ultrasonic backscattered echoes in terms of superimposed Gaussian echoes corrupted by noise. Each Gaussian echo in the model is a nonlinear function of a set of parameters: echo bandwidth, arrival time, center frequency, amplitude, and phase. These parameters are sensitive to the echo shape and can be linked to the physical properties of reflectors and frequency characteristics of the propagation path. We address the estimation of these parameters using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle, assuming that all of the parameters describing the shape of the echo are unknown but deterministic. In cases for which noise is characterized as white Gaussian, the MLE problem simplifies to a least squares (LS) estimation problem. The iterative LS optimization algorithms when applied to superimposed echoes suffer from the problem of convergence and exponential growth in computation as the number of echoes increases. In this investigation, we have developed expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithms to estimate ultrasonic signals in terms of Gaussian echoes. The EM algorithms translate the complicated superimposed echoes estimation into isolated echo estimations, providing computational versatility. The algorithm outperforms the LS methods in terms of independence to the initial guess and convergence to the optimal solution, and it resolves closely spaced overlapping echoes.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.920713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920713","","Shape;Maximum likelihood estimation;Iterative algorithms;Gaussian noise;Noise shaping;Frequency;Microstructure;Bandwidth;Parameter estimation;Least squares approximation","","232","","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper concentrates on the protection of a distribution system in the light of developments in distributed generation (DG). The conventional distribution system is radial in nature, characterized by a single source feeding a network of down-stream feeders. The protection system has traditionally been designed assuming the system to be radial. After connecting DG, part of the system may no longer be radial, which means the coordination might not hold. The effect of DG on coordination will depend on size, type and placement of DG. This paper explores the effect of DG on protective device coordination such as fuse-fuse, fuse-recloser and relay-relay. In each case, depending on size and placement of DG, there are some margins in which the coordination may hold and certain cases, where no margin is available.

It has been shown that full transmitter diversity, where the constellation is a set of unitary matrices whose differences have nonzero determinant, is a desirable property for good performance. We use the powerful theory of fixed-point-free groups and their representations to design high-rate constellations with full diversity. Furthermore, we thereby classify all full-diversity constellations that form a group, for all rates and numbers of transmitter antennas. The group structure makes the constellations especially suitable for differential modulation and low-complexity decoding algorithms. The classification also reveals that the number of different group structures with full diversity is very limited when the number of transmitter antennas is large and odd. We, therefore, also consider extensions of the constellation designs to nongroups. We conclude by showing that many of our designed constellations perform excellently on both simulated and real wireless channels.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.945251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=945251","","Transmitting antennas","","232","3","32","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The speed bottleneck in the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm is in the iterative computation of discrepancies followed by the updating of the error-locator polynomial. This bottleneck is eliminated via a series of algorithmic transformations that result in a fully systolic architecture in which a single array of processors computes both the error-locator and the error-evaluator polynomials. In contrast to conventional Berlekamp-Massey architectures in which the critical path passes through two multipliers and 1+[log/sub 2/,(t+1)] adders, the critical path in the proposed architecture passes through only one multiplier and one adder, which is comparable to the critical path in architectures based on the extended Euclidean algorithm. More interestingly, the proposed architecture requires approximately 25% fewer multipliers and a simpler control structure than the architectures based on the popular extended Euclidean algorithm. For block-interleaved Reed-Solomon codes, embedding the interleaver memory into the decoder results in a further reduction of the critical path delay to just one XOR gate and one multiplexer, leading to speed-ups of as much as an order of magnitude over conventional architectures.","1557-9999","","10.1109/92.953498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=953498","","Reed-Solomon codes;Computer architecture;Delay;Iterative decoding;Iterative algorithms;Polynomials;Very large scale integration;Galois fields;Multiplexing;Uninterruptible power systems","","231","31","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is the generalization of the Fourier transform. Many fractional operations, such as fractional convolution, fractional correlation, and the fractional Hilbert transform, are defined from it. In fact, the FRFT can be further generalized into the linear canonical transform (LCT), and we can also use the LCT to define several canonical operations. In this paper, we discuss the relations between the operations described above and some important time-frequency distributions (TFDs), such as the Wigner distribution function (WDF), the ambiguity function (AF), the signal correlation function, and the spectrum correlation function. First, we systematically review the previous works in brief. Then, some new relations are derived and listed in tables. Then, we use these relations to analyze the applications of the FRPT/LCT to fractional/canonical filter design, fractional/canonical Hilbert transform, beam shaping, and then we analyze the phase-amplitude problems of the FRFT/LCT. For phase-amplitude problems, we find, as with the original Fourier transform, that in most cases, the phase is more important than the amplitude for the FRFT/LCT. We also use the WDF to explain why fractional/canonical convolution can be used for space-variant pattern recognition.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.934134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934134","","Time frequency analysis;Fourier transforms;Convolution;Distribution functions;Filters;Signal processing;Pattern recognition;Hilbert space;Helium;Signal analysis","","230","","34","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After each iteration of turbo decoding, the channel estimates are refined using information fed back from the decoder. Both hard-decision and soft-decision feedback are considered and compared with three baseline turbo-coded systems: (1) a BPSK system that has perfect channel estimates; (2) a system that uses differential phase shift keying and hence needs no estimates; and (3) a system that performs channel estimation using pilot symbols but has no feedback path from decoder to estimator. Performance can be further improved by borrowing channel estimates from the previously decoded frame. Simulation results show the influence of pilot symbol spacing, estimation filter size and type, and fade rate.

On the other hand, perceptually uniform spaces, such as L*a*b*, as well as approximately-uniform color spaces, such as HSV, exist, in which measured color differences are proportional to the human perception of such differences. This paper compares RGB with L*a*b* and HSV in terms of their effectiveness in color texture analysis. There has been a limited but increasing amount of work on the color aspects of textured images. The results have shown that incorporating color into a texture analysis and recognition scheme can be very important and beneficial. The presented methodology uses a family of Gabor filters specially tuned to measure specific orientations and sizes within each color texture. Effectiveness is measured by the classification performance of each color space, as well as by classifier-independent measures. Experimental results are obtained with a variety of color texture Images.

The technique is based on the observation that the extrinsic information from constituent maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoders is well approximated by Gaussian random variables when the inputs to the decoders are Gaussian. The independent Gaussian model implies the existence of an iterative decoder threshold that statistically characterizes the convergence of the iterative decoder. Specifically, the iterative decoder converges to zero probability of error as the number of iterations increases if and only if the channel E/sub b//N/sub 0/ exceeds the threshold. Despite the idealization of the model and the simplicity of the analysis technique, the predicted threshold values are in excellent agreement with the waterfall regions observed experimentally in the literature when the codeword lengths are large. Examples are given for parallel concatenated convolutional codes, serially concatenated convolutional codes, and the generalized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes of Gallager and Cheng-McEliece (1996).

It is hypothesized that the conscious sense of presence reflects these two components as spatial presence and involvement. This prediction was confirmed in two studies (N = 246 and N = 296) assessing self-reports of presence and immersion experiences. Additionally, judgments of “realness” were observed as a third presence component. A second-order factor analysis showed a distinction between presence, immersion, and interaction factors.

Several studies and much anecdotal evidence point to “software aging” as a common phenomenon, in which the state of a software system degrades with time. Exhaustion of system resources, data corruption, and numerical error accumulation are the primary symptoms of this degradation, which may eventually lead to performance degradation of the software, crash/hang failure, or other undesirable effects. “Software rejuvenation” is a proactive technique intended to reduce the probability of future unplanned outages due to aging. The basic idea is to pause or halt the running software, refresh its internal state, and resume or restart it. Software rejuvenation can be performed by relying on a variety of indicators of aging, or on the time elapsed since the last rejuvenation. In response to the strong desire of customers to be provided with advance notice of unplanned outages, our group has developed techniques that dete ct the occurrence of software aging due to resource exhaustion, estimate the time remaining until the exhaustion reaches a critical level, and automatically perform proactive software rejuvenation of an application, process group, or entire operating system, depending on the pervasiveness of the resource exhaustion and our ability to pinpoint the source. This technology has been incorporated into the IBM Director for xSeries servers. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of different rejuvenation policies on the availability of cluster systems, we have developed analytical models based on stochastic reward nets (SRNs). For time-based rejuvenation policies, we determined the optimal rejuvenation interval based on system availability and cost. We also analyzed a rejuvenation policy based on prediction, and showed that it can further increase system availability and reduce downtime cost. These models are very general and can capture a multitude of cluster system characteristics, failure behavior, and performabil ity measures, which we are just beginning to explore.","0018-8646","","10.1147/rd.452.0311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5389090","","","","224","5","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

The utilization of these energy sources can significantly reduce the system fuel costs but can also have considerable impact on the system reliability. A realistic cost/reliability analysis requires evaluation models that can recognize the highly erratic nature of these energy sources while maintaining the chronology and interdependence of the random variables inherent in them.

Hence, there is an interest in resolution enhancement and image reconstruction. This paper discusses a general theory and techniques for image reconstruction and creating enhanced resolution images from irregularly sampled data. Using irregular sampling theory, we consider how the frequency content in aperture function-attenuated sidelobes can be recovered from oversampled data using reconstruction techniques, thus taking advantage of the high frequency content of measurements made with nonideal aperture filters. We show that with minor modification, the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) is functionally equivalent to Grochenig's (1992) irregular sampling reconstruction algorithm. Using simple Monte Carlo simulations, we compare and contrast the performance of additive ART, multiplicative ART, and the scatterometer image reconstruction (SIR) (a derivative of multiplicative ART) algorithms with and without noise. The reconstruction theory and techniques have applications with a variety of sensors and can enable enhanced resolution image production from many nonimaging sensors.

However, little attention has been given to the development of placement strategies for Web server replicas to further improve CDN performance. We explore the problem of Web server replica placement in detail. We develop several placement algorithms that use workload information, such as client latency and request rates, to make informed placement decisions. We then evaluate the placement algorithms using both synthetic and real network topologies, as well as Web server traces, and show that the placement of Web replicas is crucial to CDN performance.

Such a model is the starting point for several analyses, which can help in the assessment of the static site structure. Moreover, it drives Web application testing, in that it can be exploited to define white-box testing criteria and to semi-automatically generate the associated test cases. The proposed techniques were applied to several real-world Web applications. The results suggest that automatic support for verification and validation activities can be extremely beneficial.

One of them is how to determine a feasible path that satisfies a set of constraints while maintaining high utilization of network resources. The latter objective implies the need to impose an additional optimality requirement on the feasibility problem. This can be done through a primary cost function (e.g., administrative weight, hop count) according to which the selected feasible path is optimal. In general, multi-constrained path selection, with or without optimization, is an NP-complete problem that cannot be exactly solved in polynomial-time. Heuristics and approximation algorithms with polynomial and pseudo-polynomial-time complexities are often used to deal with this problem. However, existing solutions suffer either from excessive computational complexities that cannot be used for online network operation or from low performance. Moreover, they only deal with special cases of the problem (e.g., two constraints without optimization, one constraint with optimization, etc.). For the feasibility problem under multiple constraints, some researchers have proposed a nonlinear cost function whose minimization provides a continuous spectrum of solutions ranging from a generalized linear approximation (GLA) to an asymptotically exact solution. We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for the most general form of the problem. We first formalize the theoretical properties of the above nonlinear cost function. We then introduce our heuristic algorithm (H MCOP), which attempts to minimize both the nonlinear cost function (for the feasibility part) and the primary cost function (for the optimality part). We prove that H MCOP guarantees at least the performance of GLA and often improves upon it. H MCOP has the same order of complexity as Dijkstra's algorithm. Using extensive simulations on random graphs with correlated and uncorrelated link weights, we show that under the same level of computational complexity, H MCOP outperforms its (less general) contenders in its success rate in finding feasible paths and in the cost of such paths.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916274","","Cost function;Heuristic algorithms;Polynomials;Computational complexity;Constraint optimization;Quality of service;NP-complete problem;Approximation algorithms;Linear approximation;Computational modeling","","221","","51","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on this, we design a simple statistical distance measure between video sequences (possibly of different lengths) based on their behavioral content. This measure is non-parametric and can thus handle a wide range of dynamic events. We use this measure for isolating and clustering events within long continuous video sequences. This is done without prior knowledge of the types of events, their models, or their temporal extent. An outcome of such a clustering process is a temporal segmentation of long video sequences into event-consistent sub-sequences, and their grouping into event-consistent clusters. Our event representation and associated distance measure can also be used for event-based indexing into long video sequences, even when only one short example-clip is available. However, when multiple example-clips of the same event are available (either as a result of the clustering process, or given manually), these can be used to refine the event representation, the associated distance measure, and accordingly the quality of the detection and clustering process.","1063-6919","0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.990935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990935","","Video sequences;Motion pictures;Length measurement;Dynamic range;Indexing;Information analysis;Parametric statistics;Stochastic processes;Computer science;Event detection","","220","34","26","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, counter to intuition, significant evolution of linguistic behavior is observed. From an initially unstructured communication system (a protolanguage), a fully compositional syntactic meaning-string mapping emerges. Furthermore, given a nonuniform frequency distribution over a meaning space and a production mechanism that prefers short strings, a realistic distribution of string lengths and patterns of stable irregularity emerges, suggesting that the ILM is a good model for the evolution of some of the fundamental features of human language.","1941-0026","","10.1109/4235.918430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918430","","Evolution (biology);Biological system modeling;Humans;Natural languages;Signal mapping;Biology computing;Computational modeling;Induction generators;Signal generators;Counting circuits","","220","","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nodes are not trusted, they may join the system at any time and may silently leave the system without warning. Yet, the system is able to provide strong assurances, efficient storage access, load balancing and scalability. Among the most interesting aspects of PAST's design are (1) the Pastry location and routing scheme, which reliably and efficiently routes client requests among the PAST nodes, has good network locality properties and automatically resolves node failures and node additions; (2) the use of randomization to ensure diversity in the set of nodes that store a file's replicas and to provide load balancing; and (3) the optional use of smartcards, which are held by each PAST user and issued by a third party called a broker The smartcards support a quota system that balances supply and demand of storage in the system.","","0-7695-1040-X","10.1109/HOTOS.2001.990064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990064","","Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Internet;Scalability;Routing;Load management;Secure storage;Availability;Security;Supply and demand","","220","18","17","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are several advantages of the proposed CDMA architecture compared to conventional CDMA systems pertinent to current 2G and 3G standards. First of all, it can achieve a spreading efficiency (SE) very close to one (the SE is defined as the amount of information bit(s) conveyed by each chip); whereas SEs of conventional CDMA systems equal 1/N, where N denotes the length of spreading codes. Second, it offers MAI-free operation in both upand downlink transmissions in an MAI-AWGN channel, which can significantly reduce the co-channel interference responsible for capacity decline of a CDMA system. Third, the proposed CDMA architecture is able to offer a high bandwidth efficiency due to the use of its unique spreading modulation scheme and orthogonal carriers. Lastly, the proposed CDMA architecture is particularly suited to multirate signal transmission due to the use of an offset stacked spreading modulation scheme, which simplifies the rate-matching algorithm relevant to multimedia services and facilitates asymmetric traffic in up- and downlink transmissions for IP-based applications. Based on the above characteristics and the obtained results, it is concluded that the proposed CDMA architecture has a great potential for applications in future wideband mobile communications beyond 3G, which is expected to offer a very high data rate in hostile mobile channels.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.956124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=956124","","Multiaccess communication;Downlink;Digital modulation;Modulation coding;Signal design;Signal detection;Interchannel interference;Bandwidth;Wideband;3G mobile communication","","219","17","10","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We show that using the compositional approach an equally efficient algorithm (the inverse compositional algorithm) can be derived that can be applied to any set of warps which form a group. While most warps used in computer vision form groups, there are a certain warps that do not. Perhaps most notable is the set of piecewise affine warps used in flexible appearance models (FAMs).

In copy deterrence, a content owner (seller) inserts a unique watermark into a copy of the content before it is sold to a buyer. If the buyer sells unauthorized copies of the watermarked content, then these copies can be traced to the unlawful reseller (original buyer) using a watermark detection algorithm. One problem with such an approach is that the original buyer whose watermark has been found on unauthorized copies can claim that the unauthorized copy was created or caused (for example, by a security breach) by the original seller. In this paper, we propose an interactive buyer-seller protocol for invisible watermarking in which the seller does not get to know the exact watermarked copy that the buyer receives. Hence the seller cannot create copies of the original content containing the buyer's watermark. In cases where the seller finds an unauthorized copy, the seller can identify the buyer from a watermark in the unauthorized copy and furthermore the seller can prove this fact to a third party using a dispute resolution protocol. This prevents the buyer from claiming that an unauthorized copy may have originated from the seller.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.913598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913598","","Watermarking;Protocols;Protection;Hardware;Detection algorithms;Fingerprint recognition;DVD;Security;Data mining;Terminology","","216","","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The regulation of the fundamental output voltage, as well as that of some low-order harmonics, is achieved using a synchronous-frame controller for each selected frequency in addition to a conventional control. The conventional part conserves good dynamic performance under load changes, while rotating-frame controllers allow a slow, but very precise compensation of the residual errors within the assumption that the harmonics produced by distorting load are slowly varying. Moreover, motivated by a fixed-point implementation, a set of refinements and modifications of the original scheme is proposed, allowing a reduction of signal processing requirements and a new control algorithm structure less sensitive to quantization and rounding errors. This solution is particularly effective for high-power fully digitally controlled ACPSs, where the voltage loop bandwidth is usually not large enough to provide regulation at harmonic frequencies. The proposed control scheme has been implemented using a fixed-point single-chip digital signal processor (ADMC401 by Analog Devices). Experimental results on a 3-kVA three-phase converter prototype show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1939-9367","","10.1109/28.924769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=924769","","Power system harmonics;Voltage control;Frequency;Signal processing algorithms;Power supplies;Error correction;Harmonic distortion;Quantization;Roundoff errors;Digital control","","216","","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is unlike most previous work, which used a random number of a sequence of bits as a watermark and where the watermark can only be detected by comparing an experimental threshold value to determine whether a sequence of random signals is the watermark. The proposed approach embeds a watermark with visual recognizable patterns, such as binary, gray, or color image in images by modifying the frequency part of the images. In the proposed approach, an original image is decomposed into wavelet coefficients. Then, multi-energy watermarking scheme based on the qualified significant wavelet tree (QSWT) is used to achieve the robustness of the watermarking. Unlike other watermarking techniques that use a single casting energy, QSWT adopts adaptive casting energy in different resolutions. The performance of the proposed watermarking is robust to a variety of signal distortions, such as JPEG, image cropping, sharpening, median filtering, and incorporating attacks.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.954550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=954550","","Watermarking;Wavelet transforms;Energy resolution;Signal resolution;Robustness;Casting;Accreditation;Pattern recognition;Image recognition;Color","","216","4","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One difficulty to thwart these attacks is to trace the source of the attacks because they often use incorrect, or spoofed IP source addresses to disguise the true origin. In this paper, we present two new schemes, the advanced marking scheme and the authenticated marking scheme, which allow the victim to trace-back the approximate origin of spoofed IP packets. Our techniques feature low network and router overhead, and support incremental deployment. In contrast to previous work, our techniques have significantly higher precision (lower false positive rate) and fewer computation overhead for the victim to reconstruct the attack paths under large scale distributed denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore the authenticated marking scheme provides efficient authentication of routers' markings such that even a compromised router cannot forge or tamper markings from other uncompromised routers.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916279","","Computer crime;Internet;Distributed computing;Computer science;Computer security;Large-scale systems;Authentication;Usability;US Government agencies;Contracts","","216","22","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These binDCT families are derived from Chen's (1977) and Loeffler's (1989) plane rotation-based factorizations of the DCT matrix, respectively, and the design approach can also be applied to a DCT of arbitrary size. Two design approaches are presented. In the first method, an optimization program is defined, and the multiplierless transform is obtained by approximating its solution with dyadic values. In the second method, a general lifting-based scaled DCT structure is obtained, and the analytical values of all lifting parameters are derived, enabling dyadic approximations with different accuracies. Therefore, the binDCT can be tuned to cover the gap between the Walsh-Hadamard transform and the DCT. The corresponding two-dimensional (2-D) binDCT allows a 16-bit implementation, enables lossless compression, and maintains satisfactory compatibility with the floating-point DCT. The performance of the binDCT in JPEG, H.263+, and lossless compression is also demonstrated.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.969511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969511","","Discrete cosine transforms;Discrete transforms;Two dimensional displays;Software algorithms;Hardware;Quantization;Optimization methods;Performance loss;Transform coding;Helium","","216","32","52","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Optimum signature sequences minimize the total squared correlation (TSC); they form a set of orthogonal sequences, if the number of users is less than or equal to the processing gain, and a set of Welch (1994) bound equality (WBE) sequences, otherwise. We present an algorithm where users update their transmitter signature sequences sequentially, in a distributed fashion, by using available receiver measurements. We show that each update decreases the TSC of the set, and produces better signature sequence sets progressively. We prove that the algorithm converges to a set of orthogonal signature sequences when the number of users is less than or equal to the processing gain. We observe and conjecture that the algorithm converges to a WBE set when the number of users is greater than the processing gain. At each step, the algorithm replaces one signature sequence from the set with the normalized minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receiver corresponding to that signature sequence. Since the MMSE filter can be obtained by a distributed algorithm for each user, the proposed algorithm is amenable to distributed implementation.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.930932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930932","","Code division multiaccess","","216","3","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Justification for the design is provided by considering the mutual coupling using the reaction principle and finite-dimensional time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Experimental results are also presented for a design that operates in the 2100-2200 MHz band for possible application in forthcoming third-generation wireless systems.

This paper describes a novel triggerless data acquisition method, which is being developed for the Gamma Recoil Electron Alpha Tagging (GREAT) spectrometer, that overcomes this limitation by virtually eliminating dead time. Our solution is a total data readout (TDR) method where all channels run independently and are associated in software to reconstruct events. The TDR method allows all the data from both target position and focal plane to be collected with practically no dead-time losses. Each data word is associated with a timestamp generated from a global 100-MHz clock. Events are then reconstructed in real time in the event builder using temporal and spatial associations defined by the physics of the experiment.","1558-1578","","10.1109/23.940120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940120","","Gamma ray detection;Gamma ray detectors;Spectroscopy;Electrons;Physics;Gamma rays;Tagging;Particle separators;Sensor arrays;Data acquisition","","214","","7","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An aggregated similarity measure is applied to search for redundancy in the rule base description. As a result, we propose an iterative fuzzy identification technique starting with data-based fuzzy clustering with an overestimated number of local models. The GA is then applied to find redundancy among the local models with a criterion based on maximal accuracy and maximal set similarity. After the reduction steps, the GA is applied with another criterion searching for minimal set similarity and maximal accuracy. This results in an automatic identification scheme with fuzzy clustering, rule base simplification and constrained genetic optimization with low-human intervention.

Unfortunately, the technique has been restricted to constant-force, isometric contractions because of limitations in the processing methods used to obtain spectral estimates. A novel approach is proposed for calculating spectral parameters from the surface myoelectric signal during cyclic dynamic contractions. The procedure was developed using Cohen class time-frequency transforms to define the instantaneous median and mean frequency during cyclic dynamic contractions. Changes in muscle length, force, and electrode position contribute to the nonstationarity of the surface myoelectric signal. These factors, unrelated to localized fatigue, can be constrained and isolated for cyclic dynamic contractions, where they are assumed to be constant for identical phases of each cycle. Estimation errors for the instantaneous median and mean frequency are calculated from synthesized signals. It is shown that the instantaneous median frequency is affected by an error slightly lower than that related to the instantaneous mean frequency. In addition, the authors present a sample application to surface myoelectric signals recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle during repetitive abduction/adduction of the index finger against resistance. Results indicate that the variability of the instantaneous median frequency is related to the repeatability of the biomechanics of the exercise.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.930899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930899","","Time frequency analysis;Muscles;Fatigue;Surface resistance;Electrodes;Estimation error;Frequency estimation;Frequency synthesizers;Signal synthesis;Fingers","Electromyography;Exercise;Finger Joint;Humans;Models, Biological;Muscle Contraction;Range of Motion, Articular;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Weight-Bearing","212","","40","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Earlier control results deal with the two problems separately, or employ a switching strategy of two different kinds of controllers, which causes a discontinuity of system behavior. We design in this paper a global controller to coordinate the transient stabilizer and voltage regulator. The designed controller is smooth and robust with respect to different transient faults.

The approximate model is verified by experimental measurements. We view the evolution of these density functions through an iterative decoder as a nonlinear dynamical system with feedback. Iterative decoding of turbo codes and of serially concatenated codes is analyzed by examining whether a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the extrinsic information keeps growing with iterations. We define a ""noise figure"" for the iterative decoder, such that the turbo decoder will converge to the correct codeword if the noise figure is bounded by a number below zero dB. By decomposing the code's noise figure into individual curves of output SNR versus input SNR corresponding to the individual constituent codes, we gain many new insights into the performance of the iterative decoder for different constituents. Many mysteries of turbo codes are explained based on this analysis. For example, we show why certain codes converge better with iterative decoding than more powerful codes which are only suitable for maximum likelihood decoding. The roles of systematic bits and of recursive convolutional codes as constituents of turbo codes are crystallized. The analysis is generalized to serial concatenations of mixtures of complementary outer and inner constituent codes. Design examples are given to optimize mixture codes to achieve low iterative decoding thresholds on the signal-to-noise ratio of the channel.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.924873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=924873","","Iterative decoding;Maximum likelihood decoding;Signal to noise ratio;Turbo codes;Density functional theory;Noise figure;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Feedback;Concatenated codes;Information analysis","","211","9","28","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a new congestion control scheme called TCP-Peach is introduced for satellite networks. TCP-Peach is composed of two new algorithms, namely Sudden Start and Rapid Recovery, as well as the two traditional TCP algorithms, Congestion Avoidance and Fast Retransmit. The new algorithms are based on the novel concept of using dummy segments to probe the availability of network resources without carrying any new information to the sender. Dummy segments are treated as low-priority segments and accordingly they do not effect the delivery of actual data traffic. Simulation experiments show that TCP-Peach outperforms other TCP schemes for satellite networks in terms of goodput. It also provides a fair share of network resources.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.929853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=929853","","Satellites;TCPIP;Protocols;Throughput;Propagation delay;Error analysis;Probes;Availability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","","210","8","39","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, with increased benefit has come increased risk. As they have grown more complex to handle a variety of demands, these infrastructures have become more interdependent. This strong interdependence means that an action in one part of one infrastructure network can rapidly create global effects by cascading throughout the same network and even into other networks. Moreover, interdependence is only one of several characteristics that challenge the control and reliable operation of these networks. These characteristics, in turn, present unique challenges in modeling, prediction, simulation, cause-and-effect relationships, analysis, optimization, and control. Deregulation and economic factors and policies and human performance also affect these networks. The Complex Interactive Networks/Systems Initiative (GIN/SI) is a joint program by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the US Department of Defense (DOD) that is addressing many of these issues. The goal of the 5-year, $30 million effort, which is part of the Government-Industry Collaborative University Research (GICUR) program, is to develop new tools and techniques that will enable large national infrastructures to self-heal in response to threats, material failures, and other destabilizers. Of particular interest is how to model enterprises at the appropriate level of complexity in critical infrastructure systems.","1558-4151","","10.1109/67.893351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=893351","","Power generation economics;Economic forecasting;Predictive models;Telecommunication network reliability;Transportation;Power system modeling;Analytical models;Power system economics;Humans;US Department of Defense","","210","9","6","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In ad hoc networks, since mobile hosts move freely, disconnections occur frequently, and this causes frequent network division.

We propose three replica allocation methods to improve data accessibility by replicating data items on mobile hosts. In these three methods, we take into account the access frequency from mobile hosts to each data item and the status of the network connection.

A new deterministic maximum likelihood (ML) DOA estimator is derived. Its implementation is based on an iterative procedure which includes a stepwise concentration of the log-likelihood (LL) function with respect to the signal and noise nuisance parameters and requires only a few iterations to converge. New closed-form expressions for the deterministic and stochastic direction estimation Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived for the considered nonuniform model. Our expressions can be viewed as an extension of the well-known results by Stoica and Nehorai (1989, 1990) and Weiss and Friedlander (1993) to a more general noise model than the commonly used uniform one. In addition, these expressions extend the results obtained by Matveyev et al. (see Circuits, Syst., Signal Process., vol.18, p.479-87, 1999) to the multiple source case. Comparisons with the above-mentioned earlier results help to discover several interesting properties of DOA estimation in the nonuniform noise case. To compare the estimation performance of the proposed ML technique with the results of our CRB analysis and with the performance of conventional ""uniform"" ML, simulation results are presented. Additionally, we test our technique using experimental seismic array data. Our simulations and experimental results both validate essential performance improvements achieved by means of the approach proposed.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.928686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928686","","Maximum likelihood estimation;Direction of arrival estimation;Circuit noise;White noise;Covariance matrix;Closed-form solution;Stochastic resonance;Signal processing;Performance analysis;Analytical models","","210","","31","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We provide strong support for the conjecture that this minimal entropy is additive, namely, that the minimum entropy can be achieved when product states are transmitted. Explicitly, we prove that for a tensor product of two unital stochastic maps on qubit states, using an entanglement that involves only states which emerge with minimal entropy cannot decrease the entropy below the minimum achievable using product states. We give a separate argument, based on the geometry of the image of the set of density matrices under stochastic maps, which suggests that the minimal entropy conjecture holds for nonunital as well as for unital maps. We also show that the maximal norm of the output states is multiplicative for most product maps on n-qubit states, including all those for which at least one map is unital. For the class of unital channels on C/sup 2/, we show that additivity of minimal entropy implies that the Holevo (see IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol.44, p.269-73, 1998 and Russian Math. Surv., p.1295-1331, 1999) capacity of the channel is additive over two inputs, achievable with orthogonal states, and equal to the Shannon capacity.

The feature descriptor consists of the representative colors and their percentages in the region. A similarity measure similar to the quadratic color histogram distance measure is defined for this descriptor. The representative colors can be indexed in the three-dimensional (3-D) color space thus avoiding the high-dimensional indexing problems associated with the traditional color histogram. For similarity retrieval, each representative color in the query image or region is used independently to find regions containing that color. The matches from all of the query colors are then combined to obtain the final retrievals. An efficient indexing scheme for fast retrieval is presented. Experimental results show that this compact descriptor is effective and compares favorably with the traditional color histogram in terms of overall computational complexity.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.892450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892450","","Image retrieval;Histograms;Indexing;Information retrieval;Image databases;Computational complexity;Curve fitting;Helium;Spatial databases;Visual databases","","209","6","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There were several technologies that had to be developed before FBAR technology became viable for rf filters. First, a process is needed that can make the resonators manufacturable, robust and repeatable. Second, maximizing the coupling coefficient, k/sub t//sup 2/ and the Q of the resonator (k/sub t//sup 2/ Q product) is necessary. Another technology needed is a method to eliminate ripple (or ""suck out"") associated with lateral mode excitation. Lastly, a method is needed for maintaining a uniform thickness (for frequency control and a means to target frequency to within +-0.03%). If one overcomes these sets of hurdles, the rewards are high. The Quality factor, Q, inherent in these structures is impressive (over 2500) and the intrinsic k/sub t//sup 2/ has been inferred to be close to the theoretical maximum of 6.5%. The k/sub t//sup 2/ Q product (Figure of Merit for FBAR filters) have been as high as 100 for our devices. These two properties can be combined in a filter to achieve low pass band insertion loss and extremely sharp skirts. One intrinsic advantage of FBAR over SAW technology is the ability to handle input power in excess of 4 Watts. Resistance to Electrical Static Discharge (ESD) is another desirable property of FBAR devices. Finally, FBAR technology is intrinsically a ""low temperature"" process technology-compatible with semiconductor technology. This implies future integration of FBARs with semiconductor circuits.","","0-7803-7177-1","10.1109/ULTSYM.2001.991846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991846","","Transistors;Acoustic waves;Film bulk acoustic resonators;Surface acoustic waves;Band pass filters;Ceramics;Resonator filters;Manufacturing processes;Robustness;Frequency control","","208","13","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Benchmarks are used to evaluate the performance of different watermarking algorithms. For image watermarking, the Stirmark package is the most popular benchmark, and the best current algorithms perform well against it. However, results obtained by the Stirmark benchmark have to be handled carefully since Stirmark does not properly model the watermarking process and consequently is limited in its potential for impairing sophisticated image watermarking schemes. In this context, the goal of this article is threefold. First, we give an overview of the current attacking methods. Second, we describe attacks exploiting knowledge about the statistics of the original data and the embedded watermark. We propose a stochastic formulation of estimation-based attacks. Such attacks consist of two main stages: watermark estimation, exploitation of the estimated watermark to trick watermark detection or create ownership ambiguity. The full strength of estimation-based attacks can be achieved by introducing additional noise, where the attacker tries to combine the estimated watermark and the additive noise to impair watermark communication as much as possible while fulfilling a quality constraint on the attacked data. With a sophisticated quality constraint it is also possible to exploit human perception: the human auditory system in case of audio watermarks and the human visual system in case of image and video watermarks. Third, we discuss the current status of image watermarking benchmarks. We present Petitcolas'(see Electronic Imaging '99: Security and Watermarking of Multimedia Content, SPIE Proc., vol.3657, San Jose, CA, 1999) Stirmark benchmarking tool. Next, we consider the benchmark proposed by the University of Geneva Vision Group that contains more deliberate attacks. Finally, we summarize the current work of the European Certimark project, whose goal is to accelerate efforts from a number of research groups and companies in order to produce an improved ensemble of benchmarking tools.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.940053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940053","","Watermarking;Humans;Additive noise;Protection;Packaging;Statistics;Stochastic resonance;Auditory system;Visual system;Security","","208","4","13","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

While our proposal is generally applicable to distributed wireless access schemes, we design, implement, and evaluate our framework within the context of existing wireless technology. Service differentiation is based on the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) originally designed to support best-effort data services. We analyze the delay experienced by a mobile host implementing the IEEE 802.11 DCF and derive a closed-form formula. We then extend the DCF to provide service differentiation for delay-sensitive and best-effort traffic based on the results from the analysis. Two distributed estimation algorithms are proposed. These algorithms are evaluated using simulation, analysis, and experimentation. A virtual MAC (VMAC) algorithm passively monitors the radio channel and estimates locally achievable service levels. The VMAC estimates key MAC level statistics related to service quality such as delay, delay variation, packet collision, and packet loss. We show the efficiency of the VMAC algorithm through simulation and consider significantly overlapping cells and highly bursty traffic mixes. In addition, we implement and evaluate the VMAC in an experimental differentiated services wireless testbed. A virtual source (VS) algorithm utilizes the VMAC to estimate application-level service quality. The VS allows application parameters to be tuned in response to dynamic channel conditions based on ""virtual delay curves."" We demonstrate through simulation that when these distributed victual algorithms are applied to the admission control of the radio channel then a globally stable state can be maintained without the need for complex centralized radio resource management.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.957321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=957321","","Delay estimation;Admission control;Traffic control;Monitoring;Proposals;Analytical models;Algorithm design and analysis;Statistical distributions;Road accidents;Testing","","207","22","26","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We further discuss three architectures into which autonomous chaotic oscillators can be decomposed.

We show that similar stabilization results may be achieved using unconstrained finite horizon optimal control. The key idea is to approximate the tail of the infinite horizon cost-to-go using, as terminal cost, an appropriate control Lyapunov function. Roughly speaking, the terminal control Lyapunov function (CLF) should provide an (incremental) upper bound on the cost. In this fashion, important stability characteristics may be retained without the use of terminal constraints such as those employed by a number of other researchers. The absence of constraints allows a significant speedup in computation. Furthermore, it is shown that in order to guarantee stability, it suffices to satisfy an improvement property, thereby relaxing the requirement that truly optimal trajectories be found. We provide a complete analysis of the stability and region of attraction/operation properties of receding horizon control strategies that utilize finite horizon approximations in the proposed class. It is shown that the guaranteed region of operation contains that of the CLF controller and may be made as large as desired by increasing the optimization horizon (restricted, of course, to the infinite horizon domain). Moreover, it is easily seen that both CLF and infinite-horizon optimal control approaches are limiting cases of our receding horizon strategy. The key results are illustrated using a familiar example, the inverted pendulum, where significant improvements in guaranteed region of operation and cost are noted.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.920800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920800","","Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Optimal control;Infinite horizon;Cost function;Lyapunov method;Stability;Tail;Upper bound","","207","1","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A novel model-based correction method is proposed, based on the assumption that an image corrupted by intensity inhomogeneity contains more information than the corresponding uncorrupted image. The image degradation process is described by a linear model, consisting of a multiplicative and an additive component which are modeled by a combination of smoothly varying basis functions. The degraded image is corrected by the inverse of the image degradation model. The parameters of this model are optimized such that the information of the corrected image is minimized while the global intensity statistic is preserved. The method was quantitatively evaluated and compared to other methods on a number of simulated and real MR images and proved to be effective, reliable, and computationally attractive. The method can be widely applied to different types of MR images because it solely uses the information that is naturally present in an image, without making assumptions on its spatial and intensity distribution. Besides, the method requires no preprocessing, parameter setting, nor user interaction. Consequently, the proposed method may be a valuable tool in MR image analysis.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.974934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974934","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Degradation;Image analysis;Nonuniform electric fields;Radio frequency;Filtering;Magnetic resonance;Image segmentation;Coils;In vitro","Brain Neoplasms;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Feedback;Humans;Image Enhancement;Linear Models;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Meningeal Neoplasms;Meningioma;Models, Neurological;Reproducibility of Results;Retrospective Studies","206","6","37","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to active techniques, however, the array in passive phase conjugation needs only receive. The procedure begins with a source transmitting a single probe pulse. After waiting for the multipathed arrivals to clear, the source then transmits the data stream. At each element in the distant receiving array, the received probe is cross-correlated with the received data stream. This cross-correlation is done in parallel at each array element and the results are summed across the array to achieve the final communication signal suitable for demodulation. As the ocean changes, it becomes necessary to break up the data stream and insert new probe pulses. Results from an experiment conducted in Puget Sound near Seattle are reported.

The parametric representation of speech using HNM provides a straightforward way of smoothing discontinuities of acoustic units around concatenation points.

This variability is caused by geometrical as well as by physiological factors. In this study, the relative contribution of the geometrical factors is estimated. In addition a method aimed at correcting for these factors is described. First, a measure (RV) for quantifying the overall variability is presented, and for healthy individuals its value is estimated as 0.52. Next, based on a simulation study using the individual (heart-lung-torso) geometry of 25 subjects, the variability caused by geometrical factors is estimated as 0.40, indicating that in healthy subjects the RV for healthy individuals resulting from electrophysiology is of the order of 0.33. In an evaluation of the correction procedure, applied to realistic, simulated body surface potentials, it is shown that RV caused by geometrical factors can be reduced from 0.40 to 0.06. When applying the correction procedure to measured ECG data no reduction of the RV value could be demonstrated. These results indicate that the involved procedure of the inverse computation of a cardiac equivalent source, at the present time, is of insufficient quality to cash in on the substantial reduction of RV values from 0.52 down to 0.33 that might be obtainable.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.918594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918594","","Electrocardiography;Heart;Cardiology;Electrodes;Solid modeling;Geometry;Hospitals;Medical diagnostic imaging;Biomedical measurements;Ribs","Body Surface Potential Mapping;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","204","6","35","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The filter can be applied to mixed data types, which is demonstrated using a combination of ERS and JERS satellite data, and confirms the filter performance predicted by the theory. Tests indicate that a simplified form of the filter, which neglects correlation between images, gives an ENL only slightly less than optimal, while being much easier to implement. Exact analysis of the effect of estimating filter weights shows that the linear increase in ENL with the number of images predicted for the ideal filter does not occur. In practice, the ENL is affected by the window size used to estimate the weights and saturates as the number of images increases. An efficient recursive form of the filter is described, which is most naturally applied to multitemporal data for the practically important case where the current image is uncorrelated with previous images in a data sequence.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.964973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=964973","","Speckle;Nonlinear filters;Radiometry;Filtering theory;Satellite broadcasting;Forestry;Synthetic aperture radar;Testing;Image analysis;Data mining","","204","","10","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We call such time series ""ARIMA time series"". We propose the use of the linear predictive coding (LPC) cepstrum for clustering ARIMA time series, by using the Euclidean distance between the LPC cepstra of two time series as their dissimilarity measure. We demonstrate that LPC cepstral coefficients have the desired features for accurate clustering and efficient indexing of ARIMA time series. For example, just a few LPC cepstral coefficients are sufficient in order to discriminate between time series that are modeled by different ARIMA models. In fact, this approach requires fewer coefficients than traditional approaches, such as DFT (discrete Fourier transform) and DWT (discrete wavelet transform). The proposed distance measure can be used for measuring the similarity between different ARIMA models as well. We cluster ARIMA time series using the ""partition around medoids"" method with various similarity measures. We present experimental results demonstrating that, using the proposed measure, we achieve significantly better clusterings of ARIMA time series data as compared to clusterings obtained by using other traditional similarity measures, such as DFT, DWT, PCA (principal component analysis), etc. Experiments were performed both on simulated and real data.","","0-7695-1119-8","10.1109/ICDM.2001.989529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989529","","Linear predictive coding;Time measurement;Discrete Fourier transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Cepstral analysis;Principal component analysis;Cepstrum;Euclidean distance;Indexing;Fourier transforms","","203","21","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some advocate observation in the operating room, while others promote animal and simulated models or a combination of surgery-related tasks. A crucial process in surgical education is to evaluate the level of surgical skills. For laparoscopic surgery, skill evaluation is traditionally performed subjectively by experts grading a video of a procedure performed by a student. By its nature, this process uses fuzzy criteria. The objective of the current study was to develop and assess a skill scale using Markov models (MMs). Ten surgeons [five novice surgeons (NS); five expert surgeons (ES)] performed a cholecystectomy and Nissen fundoplication in a porcine model. An instrumented laparoscopic grasper equipped with a three-axis force/torque (F/T) sensor was used to measure the forces/torques at the hand/tool interface synchronized with a video of the tool operative maneuvers. A synthesis of frame-by-frame video analysis and a vector quantization algorithm, allowed to define F/T signatures associated with 14 different types of tool/tissue interactions. The magnitude of F/T applied by NS and ES were significantly different (p<0.05) and varied based on the task being performed. High F/T magnitudes were applied by NS compared with ES while performing tissue manipulation and vice versa in tasks involved tissue dissection. From each step of the surgical procedures, two MMs were developed representing the performance of three surgeons out of the five in the ES and NS groups. The data obtained by the remaining two surgeons in each group were used for evaluating the performance scale. The final result was a surgical performance index which represented a ratio of statistical similarity between the examined surgeon's MM and the MM of NS and ES. The difference between the performance index value, for a surgeon under study, and the NS/ES boundary, indicated the level of expertise in the surgeon's own group. Preliminary data suggest that a performance index based on MM and F/T signatures provides an objective means of distinguishing NS from ES. In addition, this methodology can be further applied to evaluate haptic virtual reality surgical simulators for improving realism in surgical education.","1558-2531","","10.1109/10.918597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918597","","Minimally invasive surgery;Torque;Surges;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Force measurement;Animals;Instruments;Laparoscopes;Force sensors","Algorithms;Animals;Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic;Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic;Computer Simulation;Computer-Assisted Instruction;Internship and Residency;Laparoscopy;Markov Chains;Surgery;Swine;User-Computer Interface;Video Recording","203","25","48","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This deliberate introduction of input-dependent errors leads to degradation in the algorithmic performance, which is compensated for via algorithmic noise-tolerance (ANT) schemes. The resulting setup that comprises of the DSP architecture operating at subcritical voltage and the error control scheme is referred to as soft DSP. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is enhanced when arithmetic units with a higher ""delay imbalance"" are employed. A prediction-based error-control scheme is proposed to enhance the performance of the filtering algorithm in the presence of errors due to soft computations. For a frequency selective filter, it is shown that the proposed scheme provides 60-81% reduction in energy dissipation for filter bandwidths up to 0.5 /spl pi/ (where 2 /spl pi/ corresponds to the sampling frequency f/sub s/) over that achieved via conventional architecture and voltage scaling, with a maximum of 0.5-dB degradation in the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR/sub o/). It is also shown that the proposed algorithmic noise-tolerance schemes can also be used to improve the performance of DSP algorithms in presence of bit-error rates of up to 10/sup -3/ due to deep submicron (DSM) noise.","1557-9999","","10.1109/92.974895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974895","","Digital signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Voltage;Degradation;Frequency;Filters;Signal to noise ratio;Delay;Throughput;Error correction","","200","5","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Studying laser waveforms for such plant canopies is needed for the advanced retrieval of three-dimensional (3D) canopy structure parameters from the vegetation canopy lidar (VCL) mission. For discontinuous plant canopies, a hybrid geometric optical and radiative transfer (GORT) model describing the effects of 3D canopy structure parameters of discrete canopies on the radiation environment has been modified for use with lidar. The GORT model is first used to describe the canopy lidar waveforms as a function of canopy structure parameters and then validated using scanning lidar imager of canopies by echo recovery (SLICER) data collected in conifer forests in central Canada during the boreal ecosystem-atmosphere study (BOREAS). Model simulations show that the clumping in natural vegetation, such as leaves clustering into tree crowns causes larger gap probability and smaller waveforms for discontinuous plant canopies than for horizontally homogeneous plant canopies. Ignoring the clumping effect can result in significantly lower values for the estimated foliage amount in the profile and in turn lower estimated biomass. Because of clumping, only the gap probability and apparent vertical projected foliage profile can be directly retrieved from the canopy lidar data. The retrieval is sensitive to the ratio of the volume backscattering coefficients of the vegetation and background, and this ratio depends on canopy architecture as well as foliage spectral characteristics.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.951085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951085","","Laser radar;Vegetation mapping;Laser modes;Biomedical optical imaging;Geometrical optics;Optical sensors;Solid modeling;Biomass;Information retrieval;Backscatter","","200","","5","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our predictor achieves increased accuracy by making use of long branch histories, which are possible becasue the hardware resources for our method scale linearly with the history length. By contrast, other purely dynamic schemes require exponential resources. We describe our design and evaluate it with respect to two well known predictors. We show that for a 4K byte hardware budget our method improves misprediction rates for the SPEC 2000 benchmarks by 10.1% over the gshare predictor.

Algorithms that both reduce the dimensionality of the data sets and handle highly correlated bands are required to exploit the information in these data sets effectively. the authors propose a set of best-bases feature extraction algorithms that are simple, fast, and highly effective for classification of hyperspectral data. These techniques intelligently combine subsets of adjacent bands into a smaller number of features. Both top-down and bottom-up algorithms are proposed. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the bands into two (not necessarily equal) sets of bands and then replaces each final set of bands by its mean value. The bottom-up algorithm builds an agglomerative tree by merging highly correlated adjacent bands and projecting them onto their Fisher direction, yielding high discrimination among classes. Both these algorithms are used in a pairwise classifier framework where the original C-class problem is divided into a set of (/sub 2//sup C/) two-class problems. The new algorithms (1) find variable length bases localized in wavelength, (2) favor grouping highly correlated adjacent bands that, when merged either by taking their mean or Fisher linear projection, yield maximum discrimination, and (3) seek orthogonal bases for each of the (/sub 2//sup C/) two-class problems into which a C-class problem can be decomposed. Experiments on an AVIRIS data set for a 12-class problem show significant improvements in classification accuracies while using a much smaller number of features.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.934070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934070","","Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Partitioning algorithms;Data mining;Merging;Space technology;Pattern classification;Narrowband","","198","1","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lastly, we discuss directions for providing some level of security.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.925685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=925685","","Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Global Positioning System;Large-scale systems;Application specific integrated circuits;Wire;Legged locomotion;Ad hoc networks;Petroleum","","198","13","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

One major approach for energy conservation is to route a communication session along the routes which requires the lowest total energy consumption. This optimization problem is referred to as minimum-energy routing. While minimum-energy unicast routing can be solved in polynomial time by shortest-path algorithms, it remains open whether minimum-energy broadcast routing can be solved in polynomial time, despite the NP-hardness of its general graph version. Previously three greedy heuristics were proposed in Wieselthier et al. (2000): MST (minimum spanning tree), SPT (shortest-path tree), and BIP (broadcasting incremental power). They have been evaluated through simulations in Wieselthier et al.], but little is known about their analytical performance. The main contribution of this paper is the quantitative characterization of their performances in terms of approximation ratios. By exploring geometric structures of Euclidean MSTs, we have been able to prove that the approximation ratio of MST is between 6 and 12, and the approximation ratio of BIP is between /sup 13///sub 3/ and 12. On the other hand, the approximation ratio of SPT is shown to be at least /sup n///sub 2/, where n is the number of receiving nodes. To our best knowledge, these are the first analytical results for minimum-energy broadcasting.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916310","","Broadcasting;Routing;Wireless networks;Energy conservation;Polynomials;Tree graphs;Batteries;Energy consumption;Unicast;Analytical models","","198","","8","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A simple computational procedure is presented which significantly reduces the network training and evaluation time. Storage space is also reduced by allowing for a nonuniform grid of points about which the RBFs are centered. The network output is shown to be continuous and have a continuous first derivative. When the network is used to approximate a nonlinear dynamic system, the resulting system is bounded-input bounded-output stable. For the special case of a linear system, the RBF network representation is exact on the domain over which it is defined, and it is optimal in terms of the number of distinct storage parameters required.

With the availability of differential phase measurements (/spl Phi//sub dp/) with a dual-polarized radar, it is now possible to improve and stabilize attenuation-correction schemes over earlier schemes which did not use /spl Phi//sub dp/. The recent introduction of constraint-based correction schemes using /spl Phi//sub dp/ constitute an important advance. In this paper, a self-consistent, constraint-based algorithm is proposed and evaluated which extends the previous approaches in several important respects. Radar data collected by the C-POL radar during the South China Sea Monsoon Experiment (SCSMEX) are used to illustrate the correction scheme. The corrected radar data are then compared against disdrometer-based scattering simulations, the disdrometer data being acquired during SCSMEX. A new algorithm is used to retrieve the median volume diameter from the corrected Z/sub h/, corrected Z/sub dr/, and K/sub dp/ radar measurements which is relatively immune to the precise drop axis ratio versus drop diameter relation. Histograms of the radar-retrieved D/sub 0/ compared against D/sub 0/ from disdrometer data are in remarkable good agreement lending further validity to the proposed attenuation-correction scheme, as well as to confidence in the use of C-band radar for the remote measurement of rain microphysics.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.951081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951081","","Reflectivity;Rain;Attenuation;Radar measurements;Frequency;Sea measurements;Meteorological radar;Polarization;Radar scattering;Meteorology","","197","2","30","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Realistic vehicle following designs must also address parametric uncertainties such as mass of the vehicle, aerodynamic drag, and tire drag. The mass of the vehicle varies with the number of passengers. At small intervehicular separations, aerodynamic drag force changes significantly with the distance to be maintained. We address the problem of stability of a vehicle string in the presence of parametric uncertainty and present a Lyapunov-based decentralized adaptive control algorithm to compensate for such parametric variations.

Similar to the fine granularity scalable (PGS) video coding in MPEG-4, the PFGS framework has all the features of FGS, such as fine granularity bit-rate scalability, channel adaptation, and error recovery. On the other hand, different from the PGS coding, the PFGS framework uses multiple layers of references with increasing quality to make motion prediction more accurate for improved video-coding efficiency. However, using multiple layers of references with different quality also introduces several issues. First, extra frame buffers are needed for storing the multiple reconstructed reference layers. This would increase the memory cost and computational complexity of the PFGS scheme. Based on the basic framework, a simplified and efficient PFGS framework is further proposed. The simplified PPGS framework needs only one extra frame buffer with almost the same coding efficiency as in the original framework. Second, there might be undesirable increase and fluctuation of the coefficients to be coded when switching from a low-quality reference to a high-quality one, which could partially offset the advantage of using a high-quality reference. A further improved PFGS scheme can eliminate the fluctuation of enhancement-layer coefficients when switching references by always using only one high-quality prediction reference for all enhancement layers. Experimental results show that the PFGS framework can improve the coding efficiency up to more than 1 dB over the FGS scheme in terms of average PSNR, yet still keeps all the original properties, such as fine granularity, bandwidth adaptation, and error recovery. A simple simulation of transmitting the PFGS video over a wireless channel further confirms the error robustness of the PFGS scheme, although the advantages of PFGS have not been fully exploited.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.911159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911159","","Video coding;Fluctuations;MPEG 4 Standard;Scalability;Buffer storage;Computational efficiency;Computational complexity;PSNR;Bandwidth;Robustness","","194","43","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The error sources include the sea surface temperature, sea surface roughness, atmospheric gases, ionospheric Faraday rotation, and solar and Galactic emission sources. It is shown that the brightness temperature effects of a few kelvin can be expected for most of these error sources. The key correction requirements for accurate salinity measurements are the knowledge accuracy of 0.5/spl deg/C for the sea surface temperature (SST), 10 mbar for the surface air pressure, 2/spl deg/C for the surface air temperature, 0.20 accuracy for the Faraday rotation, and surface roughness equivalent to 0.3 m s/sup -1/ for the surface wind speed. We suggest the use of several data products for corrections, including the AMSR-type instruments for SST and liquid cloud water, the AMSU-type product for air temperature, the scatterometer products or numerical weather analysis for the air pressure, coincidental radar observations with 0.2 dB precision for surface roughness, and on-board polarimetric radiometer channel for Faraday rotation. The most significant sky radiation is from the Sun. A careful design of the antenna is necessary to minimize the leakage of solar radiation or reflection into the antenna sidelobes. The narrow-band radiation from Galactic hydrogen clouds with a bandwidth of less than 1 MHz is also significant, but can be corrected with a radio sky survey or minimized with a notched (band-rejection) filter centered at 1.421 GHz. The other planetary and Galactic radio sources can also be flagged with a small data loss.

This enables the microstrip line to be realized with very high impedance of over 150 /spl Omega/. By employing the DGS to the unequal Wilkinson topology, 4:1 power dividing ratio can be obtained easily without any problem in realization, while it has been impractical to fabricate a 4:1 divider using the conventional microstrip line because of very thin conductor width and extremely low aspect ratio (W/H). As an example, a 4:1 divider has been designed and measured at 1.5 GHz in order to show the validity of the proposed DGS and unequal divider.

Fuzzy entropy is employed to evaluate the information of pattern distribution in the pattern space. With this information, we can partition the pattern space into nonoverlapping decision regions for pattern classification. Since the decision regions do not overlap, both the complexity and computational load of the classifier are reduced and thus the training time and classification time are extremely short. Although the decision regions are partitioned into nonoverlapping subspaces, we can achieve good classification performance since the decision regions can be correctly determined via our proposed fuzzy entropy measure. In addition, we also investigate the use of fuzzy entropy to select relevant features. The feature selection procedure not only reduces the dimensionality of a problem but also discards noise-corrupted, redundant and unimportant features. Finally, we apply the proposed classifier to the Iris database and Wisconsin breast cancer database to evaluate the classification performance.

Our model representation is based on two layers. The first one consists of ""generic"" descriptors which represent sets of similar rotational invariant feature vectors. Rotation invariance allows to group similar, but rotated patterns and makes the method robust to model deformations. The second layer is the joint probability on the frequencies of the ""generic"" descriptors over neighborhoods. This probability is multi-modal and is represented by a set of ""spatial-frequency"" clusters. It adds a statistical spatial constraint which is rotationally invariant. Our two-layer representation is novel; it allows to efficiently capture ""texture-like"" visual structure. The selection of distinctive structure determines characteristic model features (common to the positive and rare in the negative examples) and increases the performance of the model.

In computer vision applications, outliers typically occur within a sample (image) due to pixels that are corrupted by noise, alignment errors, or occlusion. We review previous approaches for making PCA robust to outliers and present a new method that uses an intra-sample outlier process to account for pixel outliers. We develop the theory of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and describe a robust M-estimation algorithm for learning linear multi-variate representations of high dimensional data such as images.

This penalty is data dependent and is based on the sup-norm of the so-called Rademacher process indexed by the underlying class of functions (sets). The standard complexity penalties, used in learning problems and based on the VC-dimensions of the classes, are conservative upper bounds (in a probabilistic sense, uniformly over the set of all underlying distributions) for the penalty we suggest. Thus, for a particular distribution of training examples, one can expect better performance of learning algorithms with the data-driven Rademacher penalties. We obtain oracle inequalities for the theoretical risk of estimators, obtained by structural minimization of the empirical risk with Rademacher penalties. The inequalities imply some form of optimality of the empirical risk minimizers. We also suggest an iterative approach to structural risk minimization with Rademacher penalties, in which the hierarchy of classes is not given in advance, but is determined in the data-driven iterative process of risk minimization. We prove probabilistic oracle inequalities for the theoretical risk of the estimators based on this approach as well.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.930926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930926","","Minimization methods","","191","","39","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While there has been considerable research on the topic of routing in such networks, the topic of topology creation has not received due attention. This is because almost all ad hoc networks to date have been built on top of a single channel, broadcast based wireless media, such as 802.11 or IR LANs. For such networks the distance relationship between the nodes implicitly (and uniquely) determines the topology of the ad hoc network. Bluetooth is a promising new wireless technology, which enables portable devices to form short-range wireless ad hoc networks and is based on a frequency hopping physical layer. This fact implies that hosts are not able to communicate unless they have previously discovered each other by synchronizing their frequency hopping patterns. Thus, even if all nodes are within direct communication range of each other, only those nodes which are synchronized with the transmitter can hear the transmission. To support any-to-any communication, nodes must be synchronized so that the pairs of nodes (which can communicate with each other) together form a connected graph. Using Bluetooth as an example, this paper first provides deeper insights into the issue to link establishment in frequency hopping wireless systems. It then introduces the Bluetooth topology construction protocol (BTCP), an asynchronous distributed protocol for constructing scatternets which starts with nodes that have no knowledge of their surroundings and terminates with the formation of a connected network satisfying all connectivity constraints posed by the Bluetooth technology. To the best of our knowledge, the work presented in this paper is the first attempt at building Bluetooth scatternets using distributed logic and is quite ""practical"" in the sense that it can be implemented using the communication primitives offered by the Bluetooth 1.0 specifications.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916654","","Bluetooth;Network topology;Spread spectrum communication;Frequency synchronization;Mobile ad hoc networks;Ad hoc networks;Protocols;Personal area networks;Routing;Broadcasting","","190","11","10","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The highest and the lowest values of the frequency and the amplitude of power supply voltage leading to a glow discharge have been found dependent on the gas flow and the nature of the surface in contact with the discharge. These boundary values have been related to the criteria necessary for initiating a Townsend breakdown rather than a streamer breakdown commonly observed under such conditions. This implies: (1) that the seed electron density just before the breakdown is high enough to allow the development of numerous small avalanches under a low field avoiding the formation of only one large avalanche mechanism at the origin of the streamer formation; and (2) to let the time for ions issued from the first avalanches to reach the cathode before the electrical field becomes large enough to induce the formation of large avalanches. Practically, the transition from a Townsend breakdown to a streamer breakdown is analyzed from electrical measurements data coupled to the visual aspect of the discharge. Without any gas flow, the obtaining of an atmospheric pressure glow discharge (APGD) is mainly limited by the species etched from the surface in contact with the gas. Indeed, these species can be quenchers of the nitrogen metastable molecules, which are the species at the origin of the formation of seed electrons via the Penning effect. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a laminar gas flow. However, this type of gas flow through the discharge induces a depletion of N/sub 2/ metastables and, consequently, influences the electron density at the entrance of the discharge, leading to a tendency on this part of the discharge to transit to a streamer-like one.","1939-9375","","10.1109/27.928953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928953","","Fluid flow;Electric breakdown;Electrons;Nitrogen;Electric variables measurement;Glow discharges;Surface discharges;Contacts;Metastasis;Dielectrics","","190","","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we study the reduced fading margin property of UWB signals. To evaluate the fading margin, we compare the performance of UWB signals in an environment with only additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) versus the performance of UWB signals in a dense multipath environment with AWGN. The assumption here is that the presence of multipath causes a small increase in the signal-to-noise ratio required to achieve reasonable levels of bit error rate. A numerical example confirms this assumption, more specifically, the example shows that to achieve a bit error rate equal to 10/sup -5/, we require about 13.5 dB in the AWGN case and about 15 dB in the multipath case, resulting in a fading margin of just 1.5 dB. This small fading margin can be understood by the ability of the UWB signal to resolve the dense multipath.","1939-9359","","10.1109/25.917932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=917932","","Ultra wideband technology;Gaussian noise;AWGN;Fading;Bit error rate;Bandwidth;Frequency;Additive white noise;Signal to noise ratio;Signal resolution","","190","4","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first step of the proposed algorithm implements a linear and space-invariant azimuth filtering that is carried out via a deramping-based technique representing a simplified version of the SPECAN approach. This operation allows the authors to perform a bulk azimuth raw data compression and to achieve a pixel spacing smaller than (or equal to) the expected azimuth resolution of the fully focused image. Thus, the azimuth spectral folding phenomenon, typically affecting the spotlight data, is overcome, and the space-variant characteristics of the stripmap system transfer function are preserved. Accordingly, the residual and precise focusing of the SAR data is achieved by applying a conventional stripmap processing procedure requiring a minor modification and implemented in the frequency domain. The extension of the proposed technique to the case of high bandwidth transmitted chirp signals is also discussed. Experiments carried out on real and simulated data confirm the validity of the presented approach, which is mainly focused on spaceborne systems.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.951090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951090","","Azimuth;Focusing;Filtering algorithms;Nonlinear filters;Data compression;Pixel;Image resolution;Transfer functions;Frequency domain analysis;Bandwidth","","190","2","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The spatial and temporal records were transformed to the wavenumber-frequency domain, resulting in a three-dimensional (3-D) image power spectrum. In the spectrum, the signal energy of the waves is localized on a shell defined by the dispersion relation of surface waves. The sum of the sensor's velocity and the near-surface current profile deforms the dispersion shell due to the Doppler-frequency shift. An iterative least-squares fitting technique and an error-estimation model was implemented. To improve the method's accuracy, spectral wave energy found in higher harmonics of the dispersion shell and aliasing effects are taken into account. The most important nonlinear mechanism leading to higher harmonics is explained as resulting from wave shadowing due to the low grazing angles typical for ground- or ship-based radars. The improved method is examined analytically and is tested with Monte Carlo simulations. The variation of the shape of the measured or simulated 3-D image spectra, especially the peak wavenumber, the directional spread, and the main travel direction, controls the behavior and accuracy of the technique. A comparison of velocities acquired by nautical radar and independent Doppler log current measurements is presented. The technique's accuracy, its limits, and its adaptability are discussed.

The problem is motivated by the following key observation: in many channel coding schemes, the energy required to transmit a packet can be significantly reduced by lowering the transmission power and transmitting the packet over a longer period of time. However, information is often time-critical or delay-sensitive and transmission times cannot be made arbitrarily long. We therefore consider packet transmission schedules that minimize energy subject to a deadline or a delay constraint. Specifically, we obtain an optimal offline schedule for a node operating under a deadline constraint. An inspection of the form of this schedule naturally leads us to an online schedule which is shown, through simulations, to be energy-efficient. Finally, we relax the deadline constraint and provide an exact probabilistic analysis of our offline scheduling algorithm. We then devise a lazy online algorithm that varies transmission times according to backlog and show that it is more energy efficient than a deterministic schedule that guarantees stability for the same range of arrival rates.","0743-166X","0-7803-7016-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2001.916721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916721","","Energy efficiency;Scheduling algorithm;Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;Power control;Delay;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Interference;Information systems","","189","6","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, good performance has been obtained by using these same rules on graphs with loops, a method we refer to as loopy belief propagation. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of “Turbo codes,” whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theoretical understanding of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges, it gives the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks with a single loop. These results motivate using the powerful belief propagation algorithm in a broader class of networks and help clarify the empirical performance results.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976601750541769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6789575","","","","189","1","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

A restricted version of dataflow, termed synchronous dataflow (SDF), that offers strong compile-time predictability properties, but has limited expressive power, has been studied extensively in the DSP context. Many extensions to synchronous dataflow have been proposed to increase its expressivity while maintaining its compile-time predictability properties as much as possible. We proposed a parameterized dataflow framework that can be applied as a meta-modeling technique to significantly improve the expressive power of any dataflow model that possesses a well-defined concept of a graph iteration, Indeed, the parameterized dataflow framework is compatible with many of the existing dataflow models for DSP including SDF, cyclo-static dataflow, scalable synchronous dataflow, and Boolean dataflow. In this paper, we develop precise, formal semantics for parameterized synchronous dataflow (PSDF)-the application of our parameterized modeling framework to SDF-that allows data-dependent, dynamic DSP systems to be modeled in a natural and intuitive fashion. Through our development of PSDF, we demonstrate that desirable properties of a DSP modeling environment such as dynamic reconfigurability and design reuse emerge as inherent characteristics of our parameterized framework. An example of a speech compression application is used to illustrate the efficacy of the PSDF approach and its amenability to efficient software synthesis techniques. In addition, we illustrate the generality of our parameterized framework by discussing its application to cyclo-static dataflow, which is a popular alternative to the SDF model.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.950795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=950795","","Digital signal processing;Power system modeling;Application software;Signal design;Metamodeling;Speech synthesis;Hardware;Microarchitecture;Computer architecture;Digital filters","","188","7","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm uses the concept of aggregated costs and provides an efficient method to find the optimal multiplier based on Lagrange relaxation. This method is proven to be polynomial and it is also efficient in practice. The benefit of this method is that it also gives a lower bound on the theoretical optimal solution along with the result. The difference between the lower bound and the cost of the found path is very small proving the good quality of the result. Moreover, by further relaxing the optimality of paths, an easy way is provided to control the trade-off between the running time of the algorithm and the quality of the found paths. We present a comprehensive numerical evaluation of the algorithm, by comparing it to a wide range of QoS routing algorithms proposed in the literature.

We define a validity index, S Dbw, based on well-defined clustering criteria enabling the selection of optimal input parameter values for a clustering algorithm that result in the best partitioning of a data set.

With the accurate estimation of the R-Q function, a frame-level rate control algorithm is proposed for DCT video coding. The proposed algorithm outperforms the TMN8 rate control algorithm by providing more accurate and robust rate regulation and better picture quality. Based on the estimated R-D functions, an encoder-based rate-shape-smoothing algorithm is proposed. With this smoothing algorithm, the output bit stream of the encoder has both a smoothed rate shape and a consistent picture quality, which are highly desirable in practical video coding and transmission.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.937431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937431","","Discrete cosine transforms;Video coding;Bit rate;Quantization;Helium;Communication system control;Transform coding;Computational complexity;Smoothing methods;Rate distortion theory","","186","17","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal is to find a controller (if one exists) such that the closed loop is mean square stable for a given packet loss rate. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition is developed for the existence of a stabilizing dynamic output feedback controller. This LMI condition is used to study the effect of communication losses on a vehicle following problem.

The method extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method, FP-growth, constructs a class distribution-associated FP-tree, and mines large databases efficiently. Moreover, it applies a CR-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rules efficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on confidence, correlation and database coverage. The classification is performed based on a weighted /spl chi//sup 2/ analysis using multiple strong association rules.

Based on a digital implementation, the coherent demodulation scheme is presented. Pilot channel estimation error, due to multiple access and multipath interference, is studied. The system performance is evaluated by means of the bit error rate (BER). The analysis shows that the error of channel estimation significantly degrades system performance and can be effectively suppressed by low pass filters (LPFs). A discussion on the envelope variation of complex spread signals is also included, which illustrates that the complex spread signal has a more stable envelope than the dual-channel spread signal.

Shape encodes the feature geometry of a face while texture provides a normalized shape-free image. The dimensionalities of the shape and the texture spaces are first reduced using principal component analysis, constrained by the EFM for enhanced generalization. The corresponding reduced shape and texture features are then combined through a normalization procedure to form the integrated features that are processed by the EFM for face recognition. Experimental results, using 600 face images corresponding to 200 subjects of varying illumination and facial expressions, show that (1) the integrated shape and texture features carry the most discriminating information followed in order by textures, masked images, and shape images, and (2) the new coding and face recognition method, EFC, performs the best among the eigenfaces method using L/sub 1/ or L/sub 2/ distance measure, and the Mahalanobis distance classifiers using a common covariance matrix for all classes or a pooled within-class covariance matrix.

The methods are evaluated on real data collected by a GPR mounted on a moving vehicle at three different geographical locations. A large library of digital GPR signatures of both landmines and clutter/background was constructed and used for training. Simple, but effective, observation vector representations are constructed to naturally model the time-varying signatures produced by the interaction of the GPR and the landmines as the vehicle moves. The number and definition of the states of the HMMs are based on qualitative signature models. The model parameters are optimized using the Baum-Welch algorithm.

To evaluate our parameters, we derive an expected confusion metric (related to mutual information), as opposed to reporting a percent correct with a limited database. This metric predicts how well a given feature vector will filter identity in a large population. We test the utility of a variety of body and stride parameters recovered in different viewing conditions on a database consisting of 15 to 20 subjects walking at both an angled and frontal-parallel view with respect to the camera, both indoors and out.

The DCT being a linear unitary transform is distributive over matrix multiplication. This fact has been used for downsampling video frames in the DCT domain. However, this involves matrix multiplication with the DCT of the downsampling matrix. This multiplication can be costly enough to trade off any gains obtained by operating directly in the compressed domain. We propose an algorithm for downsampling and also upsampling in the compressed domain which is computationally much faster, produces visually sharper images, and gives significant improvements in PSNR (typically 4-dB better compared to bilinear interpolation). Specifically the downsampling method requires 1.25 multiplications and 1.25 additions per pixel of original image compared to 4.00 multiplications and 4.75 additions required by the method of Chang et al. (1995). Moreover, the downsampling and upsampling schemes combined together preserve all the low-frequency DCT coefficients of the original image. This implies tremendous savings for coding the difference between the original frame (unsampled image) and its prediction (the upsampled image). This is desirable for many applications based on scalable encoding of video. The method presented can also be used with transforms other than DCT, such as Hadamard or Fourier.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.915353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=915353","","Image coding;Video compression;Discrete cosine transforms;Signal resolution;Image databases;HDTV;TV;Signal processing algorithms;PSNR;Interpolation","","184","32","17","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors incorporate models of respiratory mechanics into the current 4D MCAT and into the next generation spline-based MCAT phantoms. In order to simulate respiratory motion in the current MCAT phantom, the geometric solids for the diaphragm, heart, ribs, and lungs were altered through manipulation of parameters defining them. Affine transformations were applied to the control points defining the same respiratory structures in the spline-based MCAT phantom to simulate respiratory motion. The Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces for the lungs and body outline were constructed in such a way as to be linked to the surrounding ribs. Expansion and contraction of the thoracic cage then coincided with expansion and contraction of the lungs and body. The changes both phantoms underwent were spline-interpolated over time to create time continuous 4D respiratory models. The authors then used the geometry-based and spline-based MCAT phantoms in an initial simulation study of the effects of respiratory motion on myocardial SPECT. The simulated reconstructed images demonstrated distinct artifacts in the inferior region of the myocardium. It is concluded that both respiratory models can be effective tools for researching effects of respiratory motion.","1558-1578","","10.1109/23.910837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910837","","Spline;Imaging phantoms;Myocardium;Lungs;Computed tomography;Solid modeling;Ribs;Computational modeling;Heart;Motion control","","184","2","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, does the Pareto based selection strategy always succeed in finding the Pareto optimal solutions? This paper shows a very simple example that can cause serious trouble for the Pareto based MOEAs. In such an instance, various solutions, which are apart from the true Pareto-optimums, are left as hardly-dominated solutions. We define such solutions as dominance resistant solutions (DRSs), and show a class of problems which produces DRSs easily. To cope with this difficulty we propose the /spl alpha/-domination strategy that relaxes the domination introducing a weak trade-off among objectives. With the /spl alpha/-domination strategy, the DRSs are effectively purged from the population.","","0-7803-6657-3","10.1109/CEC.2001.934293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=934293","","Cities and towns;Psychology;Evolutionary computation;Testing;Sorting;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations","","184","1","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous studies showed that layer processing conditions strongly influence the thermal conductivity, but the effects of grain size and dopant concentration were not investigated in detail. The current study provides thermal conductivity measurements for low-pressure chemical-vapor deposition (LPCVD) polysilicon layers of thickness near 1 /spl mu/m doped with boron and phosphorus at concentrations between 2.0/spl times/10/sup 18/ cm/sup -3/ and 4.1/spl times/10/sup 19/ cm/sup -3/ for temperatures from 20 K to 320 K. The data show strongly reduced thermal conductivity values at all temperatures compared to similarly doped single-crystal silicon layers, which indicates that grain boundary scattering dominates the thermal resistance. A thermal conductivity model based on the Boltzmann transport equation reveals that phonon transmission through the grains is high, which accounts for the large phonon mean free paths at low temperatures. Algebraic expressions relating thermal conductivity to grain size and dopant concentration are provided for room temperature. The present results are important for the design of MEMS devices in which heat transfer in polysilicon is important.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.946782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946782","","Thermal conductivity;Thermal resistance;Temperature;Grain size;Phonons;Atomic layer deposition;Atomic measurements;Conductivity measurement;Chemicals;Boron","","183","19","35","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The PARIS concept uses signals of opportunity such as the signals from the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), which are reflected off the ocean surface to perform mesoscale ocean altimetry. Essentially, the relative delay between the direct and the reflected signals received from a Low Earth Orbit satellite provides information about sea surface height. The paper describes an original experiment on sea surface altimetry using GPS-reflected signals. The objective of the experiment was to demonstrate the potential of the PARIS concept. This experiment is the first one ever published on performing sea surface height estimations using reflected navigation signals in a controlled environment. The key result of the experiment is the demonstration of a root mean squared (RMS) height accuracy within 5 s of 1% of the used code chip (3 m for C/A code). Direct extrapolation of this experimental result to the 10-times higher chip rate P-code signal allows us to predict a height error of 30 cm in 5 s, provided adequate models are used to take into account systematic effects.

It is easier to hide explosives than to find them. Many approaches have been proposed and executed for the remote detection of explosives, contraband materials, weapons of mass destruction, currency, etc. Most detection technologies suffer from a common problem: the features they look for, such as discontinuities in electrical conductivity, are not unique properties of the target but are contained, to some degree, in the more benign surroundings. Such a degeneracy leads to ""clutter"" in the response. For example, resolving the false alarms generated by this clutter can determine the rate of advance of a conventional electromagnetic metal detector employed as a landmine detector. One approach that provides a ""unique"" signature is nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) (the technique is also called QR, to avoid confusion with strictly nuclear techniques).

For this reason, we would like to control the characteristics of such data sets in order to systematically explore the relationship between accuracy, choice of prediction system, and data set characteristic. It would also be useful to have a large validation data set. Our solution is to simulate data allowing both control and the possibility of large (1000) validation cases. The authors compare four prediction techniques: regression, rule induction, nearest neighbor (a form of case-based reasoning), and neural nets. The results suggest that there are significant differences depending upon the characteristics of the data set. Consequently, researchers should consider prediction context when evaluating competing prediction systems.

In the more complex cases, we observed significantly different results depending upon the particular training set that has been sampled from the underlying data set.

This project should enable biomolecular simulations that are orders of magnitude larger than current technology permits. Major areas of investigation include: how to most effectively utilize this novel platform to meet our scientific goals, how to make such massively parallel machines more usable, and how to achieve performance targets, with reasonable cost, through novel machine architectures.

The author reviews some of the technical particularities of these systems linked to (1) the system, such as the pulse scheduling, the orbital geometry, and the required pointing and positioning, and (2) the image quality, such as the ambiguity level, the required clock stability, the effect of varying baselines at various scales, focusing to higher resolution, and geometric limitations, mainly the behavior of the coherent combinations over terrain with high slopes. The author illustrates three applications of the concept in cooperation with the radar onboard the Japanese ALOS satellite, the ASAR instrument onboard the European ENVISAT, and as a study-case for defense applications of the concept.

These physical methods use system-based controls to verify the identity of a person or process, explicitly enabling or restricting the ability to use, change, or view a computer resource. However, these strategies are inadequate for the increased flexibility that distributed networks such as the Internet and pervasive computing environments require because such systems lack central control and their users are not all predetermined. Mobile users expect to access locally hosted resources and services anytime and anywhere, leading to serious security risks and access control problems. We propose a solution based on trust management that involves developing a security policy, assigning credentials to entities, verifying that the credentials fulfill the policy, delegating trust to third parties, and reasoning about users' access rights.

Binomial algorithms generalize TCP-style additive-increase by increasing inversely proportional to a power k of the current window (for TCP, k=0); they generalize TCP-style multiplicative decrease by decreasing proportional to a power l of the current window (for TCP, l=1). We show that there are an infinite number of deployable TCP-compatible binomial algorithms, those which satisfy k+1=1, and that all binomial algorithms converge to fairness under a synchronized-feedback assumption provided k+l>0; k, l/spl ges/0. Our simulation results show that binomial algorithms interact well with TCP across a RED gateway.

Initial attempts used spatial derivatives of tissue velocity (Doppler) signals. Here, an alternate method is proposed based on two-dimensional phase-sensitive speckle tracking applied to very high frame rate, real-time images. This processing can produce high resolution maps of the time derivative of the strain magnitude (i.e., square root of the strain intensity). Such images complement traditional tissue velocity images (TVI), providing a more complete description of cardiac mechanics. To test the proposed approach, SRI were both simulated and measured on a thick-walled, cylindrical, tissue-equivalent phantom modeling cardiac deformations. Real-time ultrasound images were captured during periodic phantom deformation, where the period was matched to the data capture rate of a commercial scanner mimicking high frame rate imaging of the heart. Simulation results show that SRI with spatial resolution between 1 and 2 mm are possible with an array system operating at 5 MHz. Moreover, these images are virtually free of angle-dependent artifacts present in TVI and simple strain rate maps derived from these images. Measured results clearly show that phantom regions of low deformation, which are difficult to identify on tissue velocity-derived SRI, are readily apparent with SRI generated from two-dimensional phase-sensitive speckle tracking.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.935730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935730","","Capacitive sensors;Speckle;Imaging phantoms;Heart;Spatial resolution;TV interference;Deformable models;Ultrasonic imaging;Myocardium;Signal resolution","Biomedical Engineering;Computer Simulation;Echocardiography, Doppler;Echocardiography, Doppler;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Myocardial Contraction;Phantoms, Imaging","180","3","36","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically we assume a channel matrix with i.i.d. rows and correlated columns, a common model for downlink transmission. We determine the optimal transmit precoding strategy to maximize the Shannon capacity of such a system.

The first method estimates the mutual information rate between the input random process and the output random process, provided that both processes are stationary and ergodic. When the inputs are iid equiprobable, this rate is known as the Symmetric Information Rate (SIR). The second method estimates the achievable information rate of an explicit coding system which interleaves m independent codes onto the channel and employs multistage decoding. For practical values of m, numerical results show that this system nearly achieves the SIR.

The conventional complex two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transform (FT) is used to implement these quaternion operations very efficiently. With these algorithms, we only need two complex 2-D FTs to implement a QFT, six complex 2-D FTs to implement a one-side QCV or a quaternion correlation and 12 complex 2-D FTs to implement a two-side QCV, and the efficiency of these quaternion operations is much improved. Meanwhile, we also discuss two additional topics. The first one is about how to use QFT and QCV for quaternion linear time-invariant (QLTI) system analysis. This topic is important for quaternion filter design and color image processing. Besides, we also develop the spectrum-product QCV. It is an improvement of the conventional form of QCV. For any arbitrary input functions, it always corresponds to the product operation in the frequency domain. It is very useful for quaternion filter design.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.960426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=960426","","Quaternions;Fourier transforms;Convolution;Color;Filters;Image analysis;Algebra;Two dimensional displays;Frequency domain analysis;Helium","","179","","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Major problems that limit the success of current FES systems are the nonlinearity of the target system and the rapid change of muscle properties due to fatigue. In this study, four different strategies, including an adaptive algorithm, to control the movement of the freely swinging shank were developed on the basis of computer simulations and experimentally evaluated on two subjects with paraplegia due to a complete thoracic spinal cord injury. After developing a nonlinear, physiologically based model describing the dynamic behavior of the knee joint and muscles, an open-loop approach, a closed-loop approach, and a combination of both were tested. In order to automate the individual adjustments cited, we further evaluated the performance of an adaptive feedforward controller. The two parameters chosen for the adaptation were the threshold pulse width and the scaling factor for adjusting the active moment produced by the stimulated muscle to the fitness of the muscle. These parameters have been chosen because of their significant time variability. The first three controllers with fixed parameters yielded satisfactory result. An additional improvement was achieved by applying the adaptive algorithm that could cope with problems due to muscle fatigue, thus permitting on-line identification of critical parameters of the plant. Although the present study is limited to a simplified experimental setup, its applicability to more complex and functional movements can be expected.","1558-0210","","10.1109/7333.948452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=948452","","Muscles;Fatigue;Adaptive algorithm;Open loop systems;Neuromuscular stimulation;Computer simulation;Spinal cord injury;Knee;Testing;Programmable control","Biomechanics;Computer Simulation;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Humans;Isometric Contraction;Knee Joint;Knee Joint;Motor Neurons;Muscle Fatigue;Muscle, Skeletal;Paraplegia;Paraplegia;Prosthesis Design;Range of Motion, Articular;Spinal Cord Injuries;Spinal Cord Injuries","179","","36","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A series of perceptual experiments, where human users rated the realism of various parameter combinations, were performed to further enhance the realism of the vibration display for impact events.

In the absence of an explicit statistical model, a method is studied for reliably estimating mutual information from image data. The validity of the model-based and data-driven approaches is assessed on representative real-world photographic images. Our results are consistent with empirical observations that coding schemes exploiting inter- and intrascale dependencies alone perform very well, whereas taking both into account does not significantly improve coding performance.

This framework is applied to the design of an obstacle avoidance and path planning system for underwater vehicles based on a multi-beam forward looking sonar sensor. The real-time data flow (acoustic images) at the input of the system is first segmented and relevant features are extracted. We also take advantage of the real-time data stream to track the obstacles in following frames to obtain their dynamic characteristics. This allows us to optimize the preprocessing phases in segmenting only the relevant part of the images. Once the static (size and shape) as well as dynamic characteristics (velocity, acceleration,...) of the obstacles have been computed, we create a representation of the vehicle's workspace based on these features. This representation uses constructive solid geometry (CSG) to create a convex set of obstacles defining the workspace. The tracking takes also into account obstacles which are no longer in the field of view of the sonar in the path planning phase. A well-proven nonlinear search (sequential quadratic programming) is then employed, where obstacles are expressed as constraints in the search space. This approach is less affected by local minima than classical methods using potential fields. The proposed system is not only capable of obstacle avoidance but also of path planning in complex environments which include fast moving obstacles. Results obtained on real sonar data are shown and discussed. Possible applications to sonar servoing and real-time motion estimation are also discussed.","1558-1691","","10.1109/48.922790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922790","","Underwater vehicles;Path planning;Image segmentation;Underwater tracking;Motion estimation;Sonar applications;Vehicle dynamics;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Acoustic sensors","","178","","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first point out that the information on the rate bounds can be exploited by considering an augmented system described by an implicit model. We then develop a tool, called the quadratic separator, for stability analysis of uncertain implicit systems. Using this tool, a sufficient stability condition is obtained for the original linear parameter-varying system.

Compared to the existing WLS method, since the discretization-free method does not need parameter discretizations in deriving the objective error function, the closed-form solution is optimal in the sense that the filter design accuracy is not affected by the sampling grid densities, and higher design accuracy can be guaranteed. Furthermore, since the discretization-free method does not need to sum up all the squared errors at a great number of discrete points when evaluating the objective error function, the computational complexity can be reduced considerably.","1558-125X","","10.1109/82.943337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=943337","","Finite impulse response filter;Digital filters;Sampling methods;Frequency response;Lagrangian functions;Closed-form solution;Interpolation;Digital signal processing;Process design;Computational complexity","","178","","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A reduced-rank filter resides in a lower dimensional space, relative to the full-rank filter, which enables faster convergence and tracking. We evaluate the large system output signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) as a function of filter rank D for the multistage Wiener filter (MSWF) presented by Goldstein and Reed. The large system limit is defined by letting the number of users K and the number of dimensions N tend to infinity with K/N fixed. For the case where all users are received with the same power, the reduced-rank SINR converges to the full-rank SINR as a continued fraction. An important conclusion from this analysis is that the rank D needed to achieve a desired output SINR does not scale with system size. Numerical results show that D=8 is sufficient to achieve near-full-rank performance even under heavy loads (K/N=1). We also evaluate the large system output SINR for other reduced-rank methods, namely, principal components and cross-spectral, which are based on an eigendecomposition of the input covariance matrix, and partial despreading. For those methods, the large system limit lets D/spl rarr//spl infin/ with D/N fixed.

Current TEQ design methods such as the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE), maximum shortening SNR (MSSNR), and maximum geometric SNR (MGSNR) do not directly maximize bit rate. We develop two TEQ design methods to maximize the bit rate. First, we partition an equalized multicarrier channel into its equivalent signal, noise, and ISI paths to develop a new subchannel SNR definition. Then, we derive a nonlinear function of TEQ taps that measures the bit rate, which the proposed maximum bit rate (MBR) method optimizes. We also propose a minimum-ISI method that generalizes the MSSNR method by weighting the ISI in the frequency domain to obtain higher performance. The minimum-ISI method is amenable to real-time implementation on a fixed-point digital signal processor. Based on simulations using eight different carrier-serving-area loop channels, (1) the proposed methods yield higher bit rates than MMSE, MGSNR, and MSSNR methods; (2) the proposed methods give three-tap TEQs with higher bit rates than 17-tap MMSE, MGSNR, and MSSNR TEQs; (3) the proposed MBR method achieves the channel capacity (as computed by the matched filter bound using the proposed subchannel SNR model) with a five-tap TEQ; and (4) the proposed minimum-ISI method achieves the bit rate of the optimal MBR method.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.969519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969519","","Transceivers;Bit rate;Intersymbol interference;Signal to noise ratio;Design methodology;Time domain analysis;Equalizers;Optimization methods;Frequency domain analysis;Digital signal processors","","177","23","26","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Crosstalk between adjacent wires on the bus may create a significant portion of this delay. Placing a shield wire between each signal wire alleviates the crosstalk problem but doubles the area used by the bus, an unacceptable consequence when the bus is routed using scarce top-level metal resources. Instead, we propose to employ data encoding to eliminate crosstalk delay within a bus. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of the theory behind ""self-shielding codes"", and gives the fundamental theoretical limits on the performance of codes with and without memory. Specifically, we find that a 32-bit bus can be encoded with 40 wires using a code with memory or 46 wires with a memoryless code, in comparison to the 63 wires required with simple shielding.","1092-3152","0-7803-7247-6","10.1109/ICCAD.2001.968598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968598","","Encoding;Crosstalk;Wires;Propagation delay;Capacitance;Logic;Delay effects;Geometry;Clocks;Performance analysis","","176","4","6","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We look at some specific image based steganography techniques and show that an observer can indeed distinguish between images carrying a hidden message and images which do not carry a message. We derive a closed form expression of the probability of detection and false alarm in terms of the number of bits that are hidden. This leads us to the notion of steganographic capacity, that is, how many bits can we hide in a message without causing statistically significant modifications? Our results are able to provide an upper bound on the this capacity. Our ongoing work relates to adaptive steganographic techniques that take explicit steps to foil the detection mechanisms.

This algorithm decomposes noisy speech into its components along the axes of a KLT-based vector space of clean speech. It is observed that the noise energy is disparately distributed along each eigenvector. These energies are obtained from noise samples gathered from silence intervals between speech samples. To obtain these silence intervals, we proposed an efficient voice activity detector based on outputs of the principle component eigenfilter; the greatest eigenvalue of speech KLT. Enhancement is performed by modifying each KLT component due to its noise and clean speech energies. The objective is to minimize the produced distortion when residual noise power is limited to a specific level. At the end, the inverse KLT is performed and an estimation of the clean signal is synthesized. Our listening tests indicated that 71% of our subjects preferred the enhanced speech by the above method over former methods of enhancement of speech degraded by computer generated white Gaussian noise. Our method was preferred by 80% of our subjects when we processed real samples of noisy speech gathered from various environments.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.902276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902276","","Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Speech enhancement;Degradation;Interference;Detectors;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Noise level;Signal synthesis;Speech synthesis;Testing","","175","2","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Features based on flow orientation in adaptive ribbons of pixels across the margins of masses are proposed to classify the regions detected as true mass regions or false-positives (FPs). The methods yielded a mass versus normal tissue classification accuracy represented as an area (A/sub z/) of 0.87 under the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) curve with a dataset of 56 images including 30 benign disease, 13 malignant disease, and 13 normal cases selected from the mini Mammographic Image Analysis Society database.

Malignant tumor versus normal tissue classification resulted in a higher A/sub z/ value of 0.9 under the ROC curve using only the 13 malignant and 13 normal cases with a sensitivity of 85% at 2.45 FPs/image. The mass detection algorithm could detect all the 13 malignant tumors successfully, but achieved a success rate of only 63% (19/30) in detecting the benign masses. The mass regions that were successfully segmented were further classified as benign or malignant disease by computing five texture features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GCMs) and using the features in a logistic regression method.

For the ML receiver we propose to pick the subset whose output constellation has the largest minimum Euclidean distance. For the linear receiver we propose use of the post-processing SNRs (signal to noise ratios) of the multiplexed streams whereby the antenna subset that induces the largest minimum SNR is chosen.

The lenses are made out of low-cost low-permittivity Rexolite material. The single-beam lens achieves a directivity of 25.9 dB, a front-to-back ratio of 30 dB, and an axial ratio of 0.5 dB is maintained within the main lobe. The measured impedance bandwidth is 12.5% within a SWR/spl les/1.8:1. The single-beam antenna is well suited for broad-band wireless point-to-point links. On the other hand, the multiple-beam lens launches 31 beams with a minimum 3-dB overlapping level among adjacent beams. The coverage of the lens antenna system has been optimized through the utilization of a hexagonal patch arrangement leading to a scan coverage of 45.4/spl deg/ with a maximum loss in directivity of 1.8 dB due to multiple reflections. The multiple-beam lens antenna is suitable for indoor point-to-multipoint wireless communications such as a broad-band local area network or as a switched beam smart antenna. During the proposed design process, some fundamental issues pertaining to substrate lens antennas are discussed and clarified. This includes the depolarization properties of the lenses, the effect of multiple internal reflections on the far-field patterns and the directivity, the nature of the far-field patterns, the estimation of the lens system F/B ratio, and the off-axis characteristics of ellipsoidal lenses.","1557-9670","","10.1109/22.910546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910546","","Lenses;Wireless communication;Optical design;Optical reflection;Polarization;Optical materials;Antenna measurements;Impedance measurement;Bandwidth;Reflector antennas","","174","30","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our first contribution is a method for dealing with objects that move between different views of a dynamic scene. If such moving objects are left in, they will appear blurry and ""ghosted"". Treating such regions as nodes in a graph, we use a vertex cover algorithm to selectively remove all but one instance of each object. Our second contribution is a method for continuously adjusting exposure across multiple images in order to eliminate visible shifts in brightness or hue. We compute exposure corrections on a block-by block basis, then smoothly interpolate the parameters using a spline to get spatially continuous exposure adjustment.

We argue that traffic measurement should make it possible to obtain the spatial flow of traffic through the domain, i.e., the paths followed by packets between any ingress and egress point of the domain. Most resource allocation and capacity planning tasks can benefit from such information. Also, traffic measurements should be obtained without a routing model and without knowledge of network state. This allows the traffic measurement process to he resilient to network failures and state uncertainty. We propose a method that allows the direct inference of traffic flows through a domain by observing the trajectories of a subset of all packets traversing the network. The key advantages of the method are that (1) it does not rely on routing state; (2) its implementation cost is small; and (3) the measurement reporting traffic is modest and can be controlled precisely. The key idea of the method is to sample packets based on a hash function computed over the packet content. Using the same hash function will yield the same sample set of packets in the entire domain, and enables us to reconstruct packet trajectories.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.929851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=929851","","Sampling methods;Communication system traffic control;Traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Routing;Communication networks;Fluid flow measurement;Resource management;Capacity planning;Costs","","174","11","33","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The nonhomogeneous environment may consist of nonstationary clutter and could include blinking jammers. The D/sup 3/ approach is applied to data collected by an antenna array utilizing space and in time (Doppler) diversity. Conventional STAP generally utilizes statistical methodologies based on estimating a covariance matrix of the interference using data from secondary range cells. As the results are derived from ensemble averages, one filter (optimum in a probabilistic sense) is obtained for the operational environment, assumed to be wide sense stationary. However for highly transient and inhomogeneous environments the conventional statistical methodology is difficult to apply. Hence, the D/sup 3/ method is presented as it analyzes the data in space and time over each range cell separately. The D/sup 3/ method is deterministic in approach. From an operational standpoint, an optimum method could be a combination of these two diverse methodologies. This paper represents several new D/sup 3/ approaches. One is based on the computation of a generalized eigenvalue for the signal strength and the others are based on the solution of a set of block Hankel matrix equations. Since the matrix of the system of equations to be solved has a block Hankel structure, the conjugate gradient method and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be utilized for efficient solution of the adaptive problem. Illustrative examples presented in this paper use measured data from the multichannel airborne radar measurements (MCARM) database to detect a Sabreliner in the presence of urban, land, and sea clutter. An added advantage for the D/sup 3/ method in solving real-life problems is that simultaneously many realizations can be obtained for the same solution for the signal of interest (SOI). The degree of variability amongst the different results can provide a confidence level of the processed results. The D/sup 3/ method may also be used for mobile communications.","1558-2221","","10.1109/8.910535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910535","","Clutter;Statistical analysis;Equations;Sea measurements;Signal processing;Jamming;Antenna arrays;Covariance matrix;Interference;Filters","","173","","17","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform.

Unlike circuit-switched paths which exhibit failover on the order of milliseconds, our experimental measurements show that interdomain routers in the packet-switched Internet may take tens of minutes to reach a consistent view of the network topology after a fault. These delays stem from temporary routing table fluctuations formed during the operation of the border gateway protocol (BGP) path selection process on the Internet backbone routers. During these periods of delayed convergence, we show that end-to-end Internet paths will experience intermittent loss of connectivity, as well as increased packet loss and latency. We present a two-year study of Internet routing convergence through the experimental instrumentation of key portions of the Internet infrastructure, including both passive data collection and fault-injection machines at major Internet exchange points. Based on data from the injection and measurement of several hundred thousand interdomain routing faults, we describe several unexpected properties of convergence and show that the measured upper bound on Internet interdomain routing convergence delay is an order of magnitude slower than previously thought. Our analysis also shows that the upper theoretic computational bound on the number of router states and control messages exchanged during the process of BGP convergence is factorial with respect to the number of autonomous systems in the Internet. Finally, we demonstrate that much of the observed convergence delay stems from specific router vendor implementation decisions and ambiguity in the BGP specification.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.929852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=929852","","Delay;Internet;Convergence;Circuit faults;IP networks;Network topology;Fluctuations;Routing protocols;Spine;Instruments","","173","9","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two major design issues are addressed: one is to minimize motion artifact and the other is to minimize the consumption of battery power. An efficient double ring design is developed to lower the influence of external force, acceleration, and ambient light, and to hold the sensor gently and securely on the skin, so that the circulation at the finger may not be obstructed. Total power consumption is analyzed in relation to characteristics of individual components, sampling rate, and CPU clock speed. Optimal operating conditions are obtained for minimizing the power budget.

With the growing complexity come challenges in testing the correctness of a GUI and its underlying software. We present a new technique to automatically generate test cases for GUIs that exploits planning, a well-developed and used technique in artificial intelligence. Given a set of operators, an initial state, and a goal state, a planner produces a sequence of the operators that will transform the initial state to the goal state. Our test case generation technique enables efficient application of planning by first creating a hierarchical model of a GUI based on its structure. The GUI model consists of hierarchical planning operators representing the possible events in the GUI. The test designer defines the preconditions and effects of the hierarchical operators, which are input into a plan-generation system. The test designer also creates scenarios that represent typical initial and goal states for a GUI user. The planner then generates plans representing sequences of GUI interactions that a user might employ to reach the goal state from the initial state. We implemented our test case generation system, called Planning Assisted Tester for Graphical User Interface Systems (PATHS) and experimentally evaluated its practicality and effectiveness.

OCT is a relatively new imaging modality giving cross-sectional images that are qualitatively similar to ultrasound. However, the axial resolution with OCT is much higher, on the order of 10 /spl mu/m. Objective, quantitative measures of retinal thickness may be made from OCT images. Knowledge of retinal thickness is important in the evaluation and treatment of many ocular diseases. The boundary-detection system presented here uses a one-dimensional edge-detection kernel to yield edge primitives. These edge primitives are rated, selected, and organized to form a coherent boundary structure by use of a Markov model of retinal boundaries as detected by OCT. Qualitatively, the boundaries detected by the automated system generally agreed extremely well with the true retinal structure for the vast majority of OCT images. Only one of the 1450 evaluation images caused the algorithm to fail. A quantitative evaluation of the retinal boundaries was performed as well, using the clinical application of automatic retinal thickness determination. Retinal thickness measurements derived from the algorithm's results were compared with thickness measurements from manually corrected boundaries for 1450 test images. The algorithm's thickness measurements over a 1-mm region near the fovea differed from the corrected thickness measurements by less than 10 /spl mu/m for 74% of the images and by less than 25 /spl mu/m (10% of normal retinal thickness) for 98.4% of the images. These errors are near the machine's resolution limit and still well below clinical significance. Current, standard clinical practice involves a qualitative, visual assessment of retinal thickness. A robust, quantitatively accurate system such as the authors' can be expected to improve patient care.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.952728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952728","","Retina;Thickness measurement;Coherence;Tomography;Image edge detection;Ultrasonic imaging;High-resolution imaging;Optical imaging;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Diseases","Algorithms;Humans;Markov Chains;Optics;Retina;Tomography","172","140","34","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The pull-in phenomenon of a general electrostatic actuator with a single input is represented by an algebraic equation referred to as the pull-in equation. This equation directly yields the pull-in parameters, namely, the pull-in voltage or pull-in charge and the pull-in displacement. The model presented here permits the analysis of a wide range of cases, including nonlinear mechanical effects as well as various nonlinear, nonideal, and parasitic electrical effects. In some of the cases, an analytic solution is derived, which provides physical insight into how the pull-in parameters depend upon the design and properties of the actuator. The pull-in equation can also yield rapid numerical solutions, allowing interactive and optimal design. The model is then utilized to analyze analytically the case of a Duffing spring, previously analyzed numerically by Hung and Senturia, and captures the variations of the pull-in parameters in the continuum between a perfectly linear spring and a cubic spring. Several other case studies are described and analyzed using the pull-in equation, including parallel-plate and tilted-plate (torsion) actuators taking into account the fringing field capacitance, feedback and parasitic capacitance, trapped charges, an external force, and large displacements.","1941-0158","","10.1109/84.967384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=967384","","Electrostatic actuators;Voltage;Nonlinear equations;Springs;Parasitic capacitance;Force feedback;Micromechanical devices;Electrostatic analysis;Medical services;Conductors","","172","1","43","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we address a more general problem, that of carrying out TAM design and wrapper optimization in conjunction. We present an efficient algorithm to construct wrappers that reduce the testing time for cores. Our wrapper design algorithm improves on earlier approaches by also reducing the TAM width required to achieve these lower testing times. We present new mathematical models for TAM optimization that use the core testing time values calculated by our wrapper design algorithm.

The second consists of the users of design for environment (DfE) tools and procedures. Typically, these people consist of product designers and design engineers. The authors study these two groups through in-depth interviews with managers and engineers in a sample of ten firms drawn from the ""best-in-class"" environmental leaders.

To overcome some of the many obstacles preventing effective integration of environmental criteria into the design process, they conclude with a process map that proposes the following steps: (1) enlisting support of a corporate champion; (2) defining environmental goals; (3) selecting a pilot project; (4) setting product launch goals and evaluation system; (5) enlisting support of team members; (6) providing DfE tools and training; (7) monitoring the project; and (8) celebrating successes.","1558-0040","","10.1109/17.922478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922478","","Product development","","171","","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples of such algorithms include the adaptive matched filter (AMF), the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and the adaptive coherence estimator (ACE). Each of these algorithms results in a tradeoff between detection performance for matched signals and rejection performance for mismatch signals. This paper introduces a new detection algorithm we call the adaptive beamformer orthogonal rejection test (ABORT). Our test decides if an observation contains a multidimensional signal belonging to one subspace or if it contains a multidimensional signal belonging to an orthogonal subspace when unknown complex Gaussian noise is present. In our analysis, we use a statistical hypothesis testing framework to develop a generalized likelihood ratio decision rule. We evaluate the performance of this decision rule in both the matched and mismatched signal cases. Our results show that for constant power complex Gaussian noise, if the signal is matched to the steering vector, ABORT, GLRT, and AMF give approximately equivalent probability of detection, higher than that of ACE, which trades detection probability for an extra invariance to scale mismatch between training and test data. Of these four tests, ACE is most selective and, therefore, least tolerant of mismatch, whereas AMF is most tolerant of mismatch and, therefore, least selective, ABORT and GLRT offer compromises between these extremes, with ABORT more like ACE and with GLRT more like AMF.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.905870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905870","","Testing;Signal processing algorithms;Detection algorithms;Signal detection;Gaussian noise;Interference;Matched filters;Coherence;Multidimensional systems;Adaptive signal processing","","171","","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We focus on generating decompositions based upon the planar line sweep. After a general overview of the coverage problem, we describe how our assumptions lead to the optimality criterion of minimizing the sum of subregion altitudes (which are measured relative to the sweep direction assigned to that subregion). For a line-sweep decomposition, the sweep direction is the same for all subregions. We describe how to find the optimal sweep direction for convex polygonal worlds. We then introduce the minimal sum of altitudes (MSA) decomposition in which we may assign a different sweep direction to each subregion. This decomposition is better for generating an optimal coverage path.

Computationally, the algorithm is a simple, noninvasive, recursive procedure that avoids any form of explicit autocorrelation matrix inversion, decomposition, or diagonalization. Theoretical analysis reveals basic properties of the algorithm and establishes formal convergence. When the input autocorrelation matrix is replaced by a conventional sample-average (positive definite) estimate, the algorithm effectively generates a sequence of MVDR filter estimators; the bias converges rapidly to zero and the covariance trace rises slowly and asymptotically to the covariance trace of the familiar sample-matrix-inversion (SMI) estimator. In fact, formal convergence of the estimator sequence to the SMI estimate is established. However, for short data records, it is the early, nonasymptotic elements of the generated sequence of estimators that offer favorable bias covariance balance and are seen to outperform in mean-square estimation error, constraint-LMS, RLS-type, orthogonal multistage decomposition, as well as plain and diagonally loaded SMI estimates.

In the latter crops, backscattering increases with an increase in the biomass, especially at L-band. This behavior is typical of media in which scattering is dominant, whereas on ""narrow leaf"" plants, the trend is flat or decreasing, denoting a major contribution of absorption.

"A multicarrier system based on the fractional Fourier transform for time-frequency-selective channels","M. Martone","WJ Communications, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Communications,"7 Aug 2002","2001","49","6","1011","1020","Traditional multicarrier techniques perform a frequency-domain decomposition of a channel characterized by frequency-selective distortion in a plurality of subchannels that are affected by frequency flat distortion. The distortion in each independent subchannel can then be easily compensated by simple gain and phase adjustments. Typically, digital Fourier transform schemes make the implementation of the multicarrier system feasible and attractive with respect to single-carrier systems. However, when the channel is time-frequency-selective, as it usually happens in the rapidly fading wireless channel, this traditional methodology fails. Since the channel frequency response is rapidly time-varying, the optimal transmission/reception methodology should be able to process nonstationary signals. In other words, the subchannel carrier frequencies should be time-varying and ideally decompose the frequency distortion of the channel perfectly at any instant in time. However, this ideally optimal approach presents significant challenges both in terms of conceptual and computational complexity. The idea disclosed in this work is that a nonstationary approach can be approximated using signal bases that are especially suited for the analysis/synthesis of nonstationary signals. We propose in fact the use of a multicarrier system that employs orthogonal signal bases of the chirp type that in practice correspond to the fractional Fourier transform signal basis. The significance of the methodology relies on the important practical consideration that analysis/synthesis methods of the fractional Fourier type can be implemented with a complexity that is equivalent to the traditional fast Fourier transform.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.930631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=930631","","Fourier transforms;Signal synthesis;Phase distortion;Fading;Frequency response;Signal processing;Computational complexity;Signal analysis;Chirp;Fast Fourier transforms","","168","3","17","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The selection of optimum thresholds has remained a challenge over decades. Besides being a segmentation tool on its own, often it is also a step in many advanced image segmentation techniques in spaces other than the image space. We introduce a thresholding method that accounts for both intensity-based class uncertainty-a histogram-based property-and region homogeneity-an image morphology-based property. A scale-based formulation is used for region homogeneity computation. At any threshold, intensity-based class uncertainty is computed by fitting a Gaussian to the intensity distribution of each of the two regions segmented at that threshold. The theory of the optimum thresholding method is based on the postulate that objects manifest themselves with fuzzy boundaries in any digital image acquired by an imaging device. The main idea here is to select that threshold at which pixels with high class uncertainty accumulate mostly around object boundaries. To achieve this, a threshold energy criterion is formulated using class-uncertainty and region homogeneity such that, at any image location, a high energy is created when both class uncertainty and region homogeneity are high or both are low. Finally, the method selects that threshold which corresponds to the minimum overall energy. The method has been compared to a maximum segmented image information method. Superiority of the proposed method was observed both qualitatively on clinical medical images as well as quantitatively on 250 realistic phantom images generated by adding different degrees of blurring, noise, and background variation to real objects segmented from clinical images.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.935844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935844","","Uncertainty;Image segmentation;Image converters;Distributed computing;Digital images;Biomedical imaging;Imaging phantoms;Image generation;Background noise;Noise generators","","167","1","39","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the author presents a mathematical formulation and numerical methods for analyzing a broad class of such circuits or systems. The key idea is to use multiple time variables, which enable signals with widely separated rates of variation to be represented efficiently. This results in the transformation of differential equation descriptions of a system to partial differential ones, in effect decoupling different rates of variation from each other. Numerical methods can then be used to solve the partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, time-domain methods can be used to handle the hitherto difficult case of strong nonlinearities together with widely separated rates of signal variation. The author examines methods for obtaining quasiperiodic and envelope solutions, and describes how the PDE formulation unifies existing techniques for separated-time-constant problems. Several applications are described. Significant computation and memory savings result from using the new numerical techniques, which also scale gracefully with problem size.","1558-1268","","10.1109/81.922460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922460","","Circuit analysis;Partial differential equations;Switching circuits;Power filters;Switching converters;Differential equations;Communication switching;Signal analysis;Frequency;Oscillators","","166","1","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This frequent topology change may lead to sudden packet losses and delays. Transport protocols like TCP, which have been designed for reliable fixed networks, misinterpret this packet loss as congestion and invoke congestion control, leading to unnecessary retransmissions and loss of throughput. To overcome this problem, a feedback scheme is proposed so that the source can distinguish between a route failure and network congestion. When a route is disrupted, the source is sent a route failure notification packet, allowing it to invalidate its timers and stop sending packets. When the route is reestablished, the source is informed through a route reestablishment notification packet, upon which it resumes packet transmissions. Simulation experiments show that in the event of route failures, as the route reestablishment time increases, the use of feedback provides significant improvements in performance.","1558-0652","","10.1109/98.904897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904897","","Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Base stations;Transport protocols;Feedback;Telecommunication network reliability;Network topology;Delay;Throughput;Resumes","","166","1","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The results presented here show, contrary to some earlier claims, that correlation between different channel coefficients as a function of antenna spacing, can in fact decrease when the mutual coupling effect is accounted for. As a consequence, capacity also improves. A realistic channel model is used to perform simulations to support these claims.","1520-6149","0-7803-7041-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2001.940505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=940505","","Mutual coupling;MIMO;Fading;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Voltage;Antenna measurements;Signal processing;Channel capacity;Scattering","","165","","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Generalized multiple description coding with correlating transforms","V. K. Goyal; J.

Unlike multiresolution or layered source coding, there is no hierarchy of descriptions; thus, MD coding is suitable for packet erasure channels or networks without priority provisions. Generalizing work by Orchard, Wang, Vaishampayan and Reibman (see Proc IEEE Int. Conf. Image Processing, vol.I, Santa Barbara, CA, p.608-11, 1997), a transform-based approach is developed for producing M descriptions of an N-tuple source, M/spl les/N. The descriptions are sets of transform coefficients, and the transform coefficients of different descriptions are correlated so that missing coefficients can be estimated. Several transform optimization results are presented for memoryless Gaussian sources, including a complete solution of the N=2, M=2 case with arbitrary weighting of the descriptions. The technique is effective only when independent components of the source have differing variances. Numerical studies show that this method performs well at low redundancies, as compared to uniform MD scalar quantization.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.945243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=945243","","Source coding","","165","8","60","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In place of rigid capacity planning rules, the planning process needs to incorporate more detailed simulations of capacity constraints and customer damage costs because utilities now assume more risk. Planning tools need to simulate load variations, contingencies, dispatch and control action to more accurately determine the capacity limits and related costs. This is especially important when considering DG because the siting and dispatch have an important impact on the benefits to the utility. Equally important is the evaluation of economic risk given uncertainties such as load growth. Because of the added complexities associated with these analysis techniques, the planning process must incorporate appropriate screening tools to determine the depth of analysis needed for particular projects, thereby making more efficient use of already scarce planning resources.","1558-0598","","10.1109/2943.911193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=911193","","Distributed control;Investments;Power generation economics;Environmental economics;Substations;Power system planning;Process planning;Cost function;Economic forecasting;Power system economics","","165","","11","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

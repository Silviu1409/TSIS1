Inspired by plants, an infrared small target detection method based on the four-leaf model is proposed. This model has both macro and micro attributes, with macro attributes referred to as the background suppressor (BS) and micro attributes referred to as the texture collector (TC). BS is a four-neighborhood model that can achieve background suppression while reducing the interference of bright background clutter in the target neighborhood to a certain extent. TC can collect texture information of small targets and improve the enhancement effect of small targets. The fusion of TC and BS can effectively suppress background clutter and improve the detection performance of infrared small targets. The experiment is carried out on five real infrared image sequences. The results show that the proposed infrared small target detection method can improve the detection rate and reduce the false alarm rate in the face of infrared images with complex backgrounds. Compared to existing algorithms, the algorithm has high robustness.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3337996","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA17010205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336390","Background suppressor (BS);detection rate;false alarm rate;infrared small target detection;texture collector (TC)","Object detection;Clutter;Image sequences;Feature extraction;Analytical models;Adaptation models;Robustness","","11","","34","CCBYNCND","30 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed rectenna is consisted of by a wide-band antenna and a modified rectifier. The antenna bandwidth has been optimized to cover both the  $f _{1}\,\,=$  868 MHz and  $f _{2}\,\,=$  915 MHz UHF-RFID bands. A dual-band Class-F harmonic structure is employed to maximize the power conversion efficiency (PCE) at both the  $f _{1}$  and  $f _{2}$  at low levels of radio frequency (RF) input power (–30 dBm  $ < {P} \mathrm {_{IN}} < 10$  dBm) compared to conventional designs. The dual-band class-F harmonic load compensates for the capacitive reactance of the rectifier diodes at the fundamental frequencies  $(f _{1}$  and  $f _{2}$ ) and controls the rectifier output harmonics at  $2f _{1}$ ,  $2f _{2}$ ,  $3f _{1}$  and  $3f _{2}$ . The proposed modified rectifier depicts a measured maximum PCE of 71% (at  $f _{1}$ ) and 64% (at  $f _{2}$ ) for an RF input power  ${P} \mathrm {_{IN}}\,\,=$  0 dBm with an optimum load resistance  $({R} \mathrm {_{L}}$ ) of 7  $\text{k}\Omega $ . To demonstrate the proof of concept of wireless powering and validate of the rectenna performance, a DC-DC boost converter, a supercapacitor  $(C \mathrm {_{OUT}}\,\,=\,\,370\,\,\mu \text{F}$ ), and a low-power electronic circuit is connected to the presented rectenna. According to measured results, the proposed rectenna demonstrates wireless powering of an LED at different distances and various  $P \mathrm {_{IN}}$  levels (at both the  $f _{1}$  and  $f _{2}$ ).

The complexity and automated nature of UAVs requires sophisticated simulation environments for effectively testing their safety requirements. The primary challenges in setting up these environments pose significant barriers to the practical, widespread adoption of UAVs. We address this issue by introducing Aerialist (unmanned AERIAL vehicle teST bench), a novel UAV test bench, built on top of PX4 firmware, that facilitates or automates all the necessary steps of definition, generation, execution, and analysis of system-level UAV test cases in simulation environments. Moreover, it also supports parallel and scalable execution and analysis of test cases on Kubernetes clusters. This makes Aerialist a unique platform for research and development of test generation approaches for UAVs. To evaluate Aerialist's support for UAV developers in defining, generating, and executing UAV test cases, we implemented a search-based approach for generating realistic simulation-based test cases using real-world UAV flight logs. We confirmed its effectiveness in improving the realism and representativeness of simulation-based UAV tests.","2574-1934","979-8-4007-0502-1","10.1145/3639478.3640031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554828","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;Test Generation;Simulation","Autonomous aerial vehicles;Safety;Complexity theory;Reliability;Test pattern generators;Research and development;Testing","","7","","17","CCBY","20 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To mitigate such an increase, a forward body biasing (FBB) technique in bulk CMOS is proposed, which can operate up to the nominal supply without problematic leakage currents, thanks to the larger diode turn-on voltage at cryogenic temperatures. As a result, traditional circuits, such as pass-gates, can operate down to 4.2 K, and their performance is augmented, e.g., digital circuits speeding up by  $1.62\times $  or lowering their energy per transition and energy-delay product by  $4.24\times $  and  $2.33\times $ , respectively. Unlike back biasing in FD-SOI, here all FBB voltages remain within the supplies, hence enabling on-chip and device-specific biasing. The proposed FBB technique thus represents a valuable design tool for bulk cryo-CMOS circuits.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2023.3337441","Intel; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10334493","Cryo-CMOS;body biasing;bulk CMOS","Cryogenics;MOS devices;Logic gates;Inverters;Transistors;Threshold voltage;Switching circuits","","6","","19","CCBY","29 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we present the design of a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA) in 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) technology.

To configure the shared-aperture structure in a limited space, the S-band element is stacked on top of the X-band elements.

Moreover, the distance of the integrated-circuit active regions from the peripheral bond pads and wire would require a thorough optimization. To investigate the role played by the EMC under such conditions, a dedicated test chip made by an array of charge sensors covering short distances from bon-pads has been manufactured.

The required reflection phase difference is achieved by using different dielectric super-strates for each antenna element. Then, by arranging the three types of subarrays next to each other, a low scattering TCDA (8 × 9) is designed. Meanwhile, a reference antenna array with a single type of antenna element is also constructed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RCS reduction technique, simulated and measured results of the reference and proposed antenna array are compared. Both antenna arrays operate over the 6–18 GHz frequency band and can scan up to ±45° in the E-/H-planes. However, the proposed antenna array achieves a significant monostatic RCS reduction over 8–12 GHz, with a maximum reduction value of 7.55 dB.

The PI controller requires a gain tuning to improve a dynamic characteristic, however, an overshoot of the output voltage can be occurred in transient state when the gain is increased.

One of the main obstacles is the strong polarization electric field in GaN-based materials, which leads to a strong quantum confinement Stark effect (QCSE) and reduces the efficiency of radiative recombination. In this study, we systemically simulated and compared the optical and electrical performance of GaN-based green VCSELs based on Ga-polar and N-polar InGaN quantum wells (QWs) by using the software of PICS3D. The results show that the light-output power of N-polar VCSEL is greatly improved by 183% compared to Ga-polar VCSEL at an injection current of 20 mA, while the threshold current is reduced by 49%. The improved performance is mainly attributed to: 1) the decreased QCSE; 2) the more efficient carrier injection, and 3) the reduced carrier leakage in N-polar devices. The results of this study suggest that N-polar based GaN is promising for the realization of high-performance green VCSELs, which can provide a guidance for the fabrication of high-power green VCSELs.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2024.3356190","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20493,62234011,62104204); President's Foundation of Xiamen University(grant numbers:20720220108); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10409520","VCSEL;gallium nitride;N-polar;simulation","Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Electric fields;Quantum well devices;Optical polarization;Gallium nitride;Radiative recombination;Simulation;Stark effect","","2","","33","CCBY","19 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using a total of eight highly on-state symmetric reconfigurable field effect transistors fabricated from monolithic Al-Si heterostructures, we experimentally demonstrate a fully functional full adder, a fundamental circuit for many arithmetic applications. The two slightly adapted reconfigurable XOR gates for sum and carry output provide a full output voltage swing using only a single symmetric supply rail, while achieving very low static power consumption due to complementary circuit design and inherent leakage suppression of the devices.

However, all the analysis reported overlooked the transformations that affect the probability density function (PDF) of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) after the SIC process. Therefore, the signal model after the SIC process is generally inaccurate, which makes the analysis just approximations rather than exact because the noise after SIC is not Gaussian anymore. Therefore, this letter derives the exact noise PDF after the SIC process and evaluates its impact on the BER analysis. The analytical results obtained show that the noise PDF after SIC should be modeled as a truncated Gaussian mixture. Moreover, the PDF after successful and unsuccessful SIC should be modeled differently.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2023.3343813","Khalifa University 6G Research Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10363636","Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA);probability density function (PDF);successive interference cancellation (SIC);truncated Gaussian;bit error rate (BER)","Interference cancellation;Probability density function;NOMA;Bit error rate;Symbols;AWGN;Signal to noise ratio","","2","","11","CCBYNCND","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, direct training from scratch or fine-tuning the latent diffusion model on new datasets is non-trivial due to massive parameters. To tackle the troublesome training problem, we implement the low-rank adaptation strategy in the training process of the diffusion model. The low-rank adaptation strategy decomposes 2-dimensional matrices into 1-dimensional vectors, which can decrease the number of parameters greatly and accelerate the training of the latent diffusion model.

Usually, such cells are built of metal sheets with linear profiles. Due to these simple geometries, impedance matching is limited. To improve the matching, a simple semianalytical method for an advanced septum profile is developed. Dominant TEM-mode propagation and an expression for the characteristic impedance of a stripline are considered. The characteristic impedances of the feed and the central stripline are equal to a given, desired value. To minimize reflections, the characteristic impedance of the TEM mode is enforced to be constant over the entire structure, especially along the tapered sections. In this way, the proposed method returns the septum width as a function of the longitudinal coordinate along the cell, such that each cross section has a characteristic impedance equal to the given, desired value. A septum designed according to the proposed method is manufactured and installed in a TEM cell prototype. The 30 MHz–1 GHz frequency range is considered to cover CISPR bands C and D. Both measurements and full-wave simulations indicate an improvement in the return loss of 4.6 dB from 10.6 to 15.2 dB with respect to the previously installed linearly tapered septum.

The dual head structure with the designed open stub can provide two radiation nulls on both sides of the passband for the filtering function and can excite three resonant modes (HEM $_{11\delta} $ , HEM $_{11\delta} $ , and TE131 mode) at different resonant frequencies to enlarge the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna.

Up to  $11 ~\mu \text{m}$ -thick GaN stacks were grown crack-free, with excellent control over the wafer warp. Breakdown values of 900 V were reached for the vertical p/n-junction. Full device processing was completed in a CMOS-compatible pilot line without any wafer breakage, demonstrating the mechanical strength of these substrates. On module level, a new gate trench profile combining a smooth sidewall and round corners, is presented. While a smooth sidewall is important for the ON-state performance of the devices, the rounded corners are beneficial for the OFF-state operation. A semi-vertical test vehicle was used to demonstrate the ON-state of the fabricated power transistors.

Additionally, a functionality was designed to implement systematic flagging of missing data and unexpected user behaviors, both frequent in unsupervised monitoring. Results: DISPEL is available under MIT license. It already supports formats from different data providers and allows traceable end-to-end processing from raw data collected with wearables and smartphones to structured SDM datasets. Novel and literature-based signal processing approaches currently allow to extract SDMs from 16 structured tests (including six questionnaires), assessing overall disability and quality of life, and measuring performance outcomes of cognition, manual dexterity, and mobility.

In particular, the selectivity achieved relies on discerning ion diffusion dynamics at low frequencies during EIS measurements and coupling these with the variations in OECT response associated with ion concentration. Unlike existing literature, our sensor is fabricated using cost-effective techniques, is planar, integrated directly onto textiles, and operates without external gate electrodes. Employing the same device configuration for both OECT and EIS measurements (both methods with a high coefficient of correlation $R^{2} = 89\%$ and $R^{2} > 94\%$, respectively), we demonstrate its efficacy by characterizing the sensor across three different concentrations of potassium chloride and sodium chloride, establishing a comprehensive 3-D calibration space to extract the electrolyte composition in a concentration between 1.25 and 100 mM.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2024.3414851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10557700","Sensor phenomena;bioimpedance;flexible sensor;organic electrochemical transistor (OECT);PEDOT;PSS;stretchable sensor;sweat analysis;wearable electronics","Sensors;Ions;Electrodes;Logic gates;Fabrication;Electrolytes;Calibration","","2","","21","CCBY","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the signal is injected into the drain, the negative current responsivity shows a bell-shape dependence on  $V_{\mathrm{ GS}}$  centered slightly above the threshold voltage for all the studied frequencies (1–43 GHz) and temperature ranges (8–400 K). In the case of the voltage responsivity, depending on the temperature range (associated with the presence or absence of drain leakage current), an increase or decrease of the responsivity is observed in subthreshold conditions. For the gate-injection (GI) configuration, as expected by the capacitive gate–drain coupling, the voltage responsivity at low frequency is null, but only for  $V_{\mathrm{ GS}}$  above threshold. Surprisingly, in subthreshold conditions, it is very high and positive, contrary to the negative values intuitively expected for this configuration. The origin of this unexpected behavior, taking place in both gate and drain injection (DI) configurations, is that the drain terminal is self-biased at the zero-current (ZC) operating point ( $V_{\mathrm{ DS}}$  being largely negative).

Teachable agents (TAs) have been employed in educational settings for decades to facilitate learning by teaching students. Previous research has indicated that TAs can have a positive impact on self-esteem which is an important aspect of ikigai. TAs may hold the potential to address issues related to declining ikigai that are often associated with aging.

To tackle this challenge, this letter proposes a novel data-driven method to improve equivalency accuracy of DNs with distributed energy resources. This letter provides a new perspective that an equivalent model can be regarded as a mapping from internal conditions and border voltages to border power injections. Such mapping can be established through 1) Koopman operator theory, and 2) physical features of power flow equations at the root node of a DN.

Nonlinear loads pose significant challenges due to their complex behavior, which can adversely affect power quality and system stability. This paper aims to propose a dual closed-loop control strategy for three-phase inverters under nonlinear loads to enhance stability, dynamic response, and robustness. The control strategy employs model-compensated Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) as the outer loop and traditional Proportional-Integral (PI) control as the inner loop. Theoretical derivations and simulation tests were conducted in the dq coordinate system to validate the effectiveness of the approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the designed controller successfully combines the advantages of both ADRC and PI control, offering improved stability, rapid dynamic response, and excellent robustness.

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have been applied for collecting forest vertical structure information. NASA’s global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) is a spaceborne LiDAR system, which measures the forest vertical structure and its change at a global scale. In comparison with GEDI, ESA’s Sentinel-1 SAR satellites have regular revisit, longer operational lifespan, and larger spatial coverage. On the one hand, detecting seasonal changes in forest vertical structures with GEDI has not been extensively investigated. On the other hand, the relationship between Sentinel-1 backscatter and GEDI canopy cover at given height is not clear yet. In this study, we first generated the time series of GEDI canopy cover profiles at landscape scale for two broadleaved forests and two coniferous forests in Germany. We then extracted the Sentinel-1 backscatter at all available GEDI acquisition dates. A regression analysis was finally performed to quantify the influence of vertical structure on backscatter. The results show layers between 10 and 25 m have stronger seasonal change of canopy cover in broadleaved forests than in coniferous forests. In broadleaved forests, canopy cover time series at 15–20 m layer height shows the strongest correlation with Sentinel-1 VV/VH time series. There is no significant correlation between canopy cover times series and backscatter time series in coniferous forests. This study provides new insights into monitoring the dynamics of forest vertical structure and understanding its influence on SAR backscatter.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2024.3443525","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202006270054); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) PhenoFeedBacks(grant numbers:FO 979/4-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10636205","Forest vertical structure;global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI);Sentinel-1;temperate forests;time series","Forests;Sentinel-1;Backscatter;Time series analysis;Laser radar;Spaceborne radar;Measurement","","1","","25","CCBY","14 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is relevant during magnet ramping or discharging after a quench, particularly when using energy extraction. CCT magnets provide substantial flexibility in terms of generating the required field shape, including the combined function field in a curved bore. However, this flexibility results in magnet geometry that often requires three-dimensional (3D) quench simulations. We propose a cooperative simulation (co-simulation) developed at CERN as part of the STEAM framework with finite element (FiQuS) and finite difference (LEDET) tools. It allows for a 3D quench simulation of a CCT magnet with great geometrical detail while maintaining reasonable computational cost. FiQuS simulates the transient electromagnetics of the entire magnet and the transient thermal behavior of the formers. The thin 3D insulation layers between the coil windings and formers are collapsed into two-dimensional surfaces, thus considerably reducing the meshing complexity and solution time. LEDET is used for 3D simulation of a quench transient, including heat diffusion in the windings, ohmic loss, and inter-filament coupling loss. Using the finite difference tool for resolving temperatures in coil windings with many turns greatly improves the simulation efficiency. In the co-simulation communication, data exchange, and convergence is controlled and achieved programmatically. A complete numerical approach is proposed, and the CCT magnet simulation results are presented and discussed.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2023.3338142","Wolfgang Gentner Programme of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:13E18CHA); Graduate School CE within the Centre for Computational Engineering at the Technical University of Darmstadt; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10337614","Computer-aided engineering;finite difference methods;finite element method;quench protection;superconducting magnets","Superconducting magnets;Windings;Magnetic flux;Geometry;Solid modeling;Inductance;Transient analysis","","1","","33","CCBY","1 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The experimental results show that the temperature range from 60 to 760 °C can be expanded with an error of approximately ±5 °C.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2023.3344105","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP22K04143); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10365198","Sensor networks;ethernet;long-period fiber grating;optical fiber sensing;single-board computer;temperature sensing system","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Sensors;Optical fiber sensors;Optical attenuators;Optical fibers;Optical switches","","1","","17","CCBYNCND","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Starting from the knowledge that a three-port network cannot be simultaneously lossless, matched and reciprocal, the solutions of the system are usually calculated by verifying the unitary conditions on a matched matrix, which is the point where the error arises in many books. As a matter of fact, it should not be underestimated because microwave and millimeter-wave circulators are unique and basic components used in a huge number of applications due to their great ability to redirect microwave signals, and the related theory is covered within most of the microwave engineering courses.

While error correcting codes (ECCs) are widely used in DRAM and SRAM, they are not directly applicable in CAM: if a dataword that is supposed to match a query altered due to an error, it will falsely mismatch even if it is ECC-encoded.

A delay network consists of several feedback loops, each containing a delay line and an attenuation filter, which approximates the same decay rate by appropriately setting the frequency-dependent loop gain. A remaining challenge is the design of the attenuation filters on a wide frequency range based on a measured room impulse response. This letter proposes a novel two-stage attenuation filter structure, sharpening the design. The first stage is a low-order pre-filter approximating the overall shape and determining the decay at the two ends of the frequency range, namely at the dc and the Nyquist limit. The second filter, an equalizer, fine-tunes the gain at different frequencies, such as on one-third-octave bands. It is shown that the proposed design is more accurate and robust than previous methods. A design example applying the proposed method to an interleaved velvet-noise reverberator is also exhibited. The proposed two-stage attenuation filter is a step toward a realistic parametric simulation of measured room impulse responses.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2024.3352510","Nordic Sound and Music Computing Network—NordicSMC, NordForsk(grant numbers:86892); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387752","Acoustic signal processing;audio systems;digital filters;equalizers;room acoustics","IIR filters;Attenuation;Gain;Band-pass filters;Delays;Delay lines;Reverberation","","1","","29","CCBY","10 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is because even such a high-end GPU such as NVIDIA A100 can store only a subset of parameters due to its limited memory capacity. To reduce the number of required GPUs, especially for inference, we may exploit the large memory capacity of (host) CPU to store not only all the model parameters but also intermediate outputs which also require a substantial memory capacity. However, this necessitates frequent data transfers between CPU and GPU over the slow PCIe interface, creating a bottleneck that hinders the accomplishment of both low latency and high throughput in inference. To address such a challenge, we first propose CPU-GPU cooperative computing that exploits the Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) capability of the latest Intel CPU, codenamed Sapphire Rapids (SPR). Second, we propose an adaptive model partitioning policy that determines the layers of a given LLM to be run on CPU and GPU, respectively, based on their memory capacity requirement and arithmetic intensity. As CPU executes the layers with large memory capacity but low arithmetic intensity, the amount of data transferred through the PCIe interface is significantly reduced, thereby improving the LLM inference performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that CPU-GPU cooperative computing, based on this policy, delivers 12.1× lower latency and 5.4× higher throughput than GPU-only computing for OPT-30B inference when both CPU-GPU and GPU-only computing store the model in CPU memory.","1556-6064","","10.1109/LCA.2024.3397747","IBM IIDAI and Google; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10538369","Large language models;advance matrix extensions;cooperative heterogeneous computing","Computational modeling;Graphics processing units;Throughput;Data transfer;Arithmetic;Memory management;Data models","","1","","8","CCBY","24 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The turn-on process is optimized through an adjustable charging current, while the turn-off process is optimized through an adjustable segmented drive current. The proposed gate drive circuit has the advantage of reducing switching loss, delay, and total switching time, while maintaining the switching stress and EMI noise level during both turn-on and turn-off transients. The proposed driver can be integrated into gate driver ICs, and the switching performance can be externally adjusted to match the power device for different applications. By combining the above techniques, an adjustable gate driver IC has been developed using the  $0.25~\mu $ m BCD process. The simulated and experimental results validate the proposed technique. Compared to the conventional gate driver, the overshoot voltage has been reduced from 15.4% to 8.3%, and the overshoot current has decreased from 20.5% to 10.2% under a 10A load condition.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3401406","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62174029); Distinguished Young Scholars Program of Southeast University(grant numbers:2242022R40010); Distinguished Young Scientists Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20230025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10530621","Gate driver;overshoot voltage;switching transient","Logic gates;Gate drivers;Switches;Switching circuits;MOSFET;Transient analysis;Resistance","","1","","18","CCBYNCND","15 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The type of anchor point determines the dominant instability pattern of the power system. When the anchor point is UEP or SSP, the dominant instability pattern is the instability of rotor angle of SG or the instability of phase-locked loop and outer control loop (OCL) of CIG, respectively. Transition of dominant instability pattern can be analyzed with the relative position relationship between UEP and SSP. The effect of OCL is discussed.

Admittance measurements, relying on electromagnetic transient simulation or laboratory settings, are not only time-intensive but also operationally inflexible, since various non-linear control loops make IBRs' admittance models operating-point dependent. Therefore, such admittance measurements must be performed repeatedly when operating point changes. To avoid time-consuming and cumbersome measurements, admittance estimation for arbitrary operating points is highly desirable. However, existing admittance estimation algorithms usually face challenges in versatility, data demands, and accuracy. Addressing this challenge, this letter presents a simple and efficient admittance estimation method for black-boxed IBRs, by utilizing a minimal set of seven operating points to solve a homogeneous linear equation system. Case studies demonstrate this proposed method ensures high accuracy across various types of IBRs. Estimation accuracy is satisfying even when non-negligible measurement errors exist.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2023.07090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10376018","Admittance estimation;black box;inverter-based resource;measurement error;operating point","Admittance;Estimation;Mathematical models;Admittance measurement;Voltage control;Measurement errors;Voltage measurement","","1","","11","","28 Dec 2023","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Central to the MRI system, the radio frequency (RF) coil plays a dual role: stimulating spins and receiving the MR signal, enabling the generation of detailed images from inside the body. Compared to using linear polarised (LP) methods, the efficiency of the RF coil can be improved by leveraging circular polarised (CP) driving methods, which operate with at least two elements and 90° phase input difference. Coil efficiency can also be improved with the use of a multi-channel phased array receive-only coils, as they provide higher SNR compared to volume coils. Generally, all elements of phased array coils operate in LP mode. However, if the LP elements are replaced by dimension-matched CP elements, the SNR of the phased array coil can be further increased. This study introduces a novel single-channel butterfly coil uniquely capable of operating in CP mode. This is achieved by operating the CP element with asymmetrical tuning and a split resonance peak. The performance of the single-channel CP butterfly coil was evaluated in simulations and MR measurements, and the results were compared to those from single-channel LP coils.

However, the transition from the superconducting to the normal state, known as a quench, can pose significant challenges due to the sudden local release of stored energy and damage to the magnet system. Quench protection strategies have emerged as essential mechanisms to mitigate the adverse effects of quenches. One of the commonly used methods in accelerator magnets is to use strip heaters on coil surfaces. The heater element length and configuration influence the performance of the quench protection. The study of the quench protection by heaters requires the coupled modelling of the Joule heating, normal zone propagation, and transferring heat from the heaters to the cable. In this article, we present a new 2D finite element simulation model to model the increase of the cable resistance under different heater lengths in Nb3Sn accelerator magnets. The model allows analyzing heaters with several different lengths of heating stations along the cable. This strategy can be used to maximize the cable resistance increase at high operation current while still providing the needed normal zone propagation at lower currents. We demonstrate the model use with a high-field racetrack dipole model.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3352517","Academy of Finland “HiQuench”-Project(grant numbers:334318,336287); Super20T-Project(grant numbers:324887); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387939","Accelerator magnets;Nb  $_3$  Sn dipoles;numerical simulation;protection heaters;quench protection","Heating systems;Numerical models;Superconducting magnets;Cable insulation;Copper;Power cables;Magnetic fields","","1","","20","CCBY","10 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the first stage, a subscale magnet is built with 30° bending, about 1/30 of the demonstrator conductor length, and increased current to reach coil stresses equivalent to the demonstrator. The subscale magnet enables qualification of the technology developments, fabrication methods, winding and assembly procedures, and magnetic and quench protection design and measurement setups. The subscale magnet comprises two tilted solenoids with an opposite inclination on curved aluminium formers. Each solenoid has two channel turns with 70 Nb-Ti/Cu wires. The magnet is protected by an active quench detection with energy extraction (EE). EE causes current decay, which induces eddy currents in the formers. As a result, the differential inductance of the magnet is reduced, and the formers heat up, with the potential to strongly influence the quench behaviour of the windings. Calculation of the eddy currents and heat propagation in the formers with simultaneous quench propagation in the magnet windings requires a three-dimensional (3D) simulation. A cooperative simulation approach has been developed to simulate transients in this magnet. It involves two software tools developed at CERN as part of the STEAM framework: a finite element-based tool called FiQuS and a finite difference-based tool called LEDET. FiQuS calculates eddy currents in the formers and the temperature of the formers, whereas LEDET calculates windings' temperature, current and voltage. This approach enables a 3D quench simulation with great geometrical detail while maintaining reasonable computational cost. The simulation results are compared to measurement results from the forced EE. The agreement between the measurements and simulations is presented, and the key factors that affect magnet quench behaviour are identified.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3355358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10401966","Computer-aided engineering;finite difference methods;finite element method;superconducting magnets;quench protection","Superconducting magnets;Windings;Magnetomechanical effects;Current measurement;Temperature measurement;Magnetic field measurement;Inductance","","1","","25","CCBY","17 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Relying on GAN-based generated images for remote sensing applications requires a thorough assessment of the quality and authenticity of the generated images, as well as validation of the model’s performance on real-world data.

In this paper, a millimeter wave (mm-wave) double longitudinal sawtooth slot array antenna (DLSA) based on substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology is proposed, which has wideband, high-gain and novel beam characteristics. Two irregular longitudinal slots are etched on the SIW conductor surface as the radiation structure. To improve the bandwidth of the DLSA, the metallized vias are added at the transition point of the slots to construct multiple resonant frequency points. By adjusting the size of the slots and the position of the metallized vias, the phase constant can be regulated, and the unusual beam characteristics can be obtained. That is to say, in the lower frequency band, the beam pointing angle increases with frequency. In the higher frequency band, the beam pointing angle is maintained at a fixed angle. Finally, to improve the antenna gain, a 16 × 8 DLSA is fabricated, measured and discussed. The proposed antenna has an impedance matching bandwidth close to 9.7 GHz. From 27 to 33 GHz, the beam pointing angle changes from 8° to 29°. From 33 to 37 GHz, the beam pointing angle is fixed at 29°, and the pointing angle error range is ±1°.

Based on the error storage technique, the ramp non-uniformity error is stored. And the input ramp signal of each column is shifted by level-shifting technique to eliminate the ramp non-uniformity error. Based on the 55 nm-1P4M CMOS process, this paper has completed the detailed circuit design and comprehensive simulation verification of the proposed method. Under the design conditions that the voltage range of the ramp signal is 1.4 V, the slope of the ramp signal is 71.908 V /ms, the number of pixels is 8192 (H) x 8192 (V), and a single pixel size is 10 µm, the correction method proposed in this paper reduces the ramp non-uniformity error from 7.89 m V to 36 µ V. The differential non-linearity of the ramp signal is +0.0013/-0.004 LSB and the integral non-linearity is +0.045/-0.021 LSB. The ramp uniformity correction method proposed in this paper reduces the ramp non-uniformity error by 99.54% on the basis of ensuring the high linearity of the ramp signal, without significantly increasing the chip area and without introducing additional power consumption. The column fixed-pattern noise is reduced from 1.9% to 0.01%.

The antenna is composed of three spatially distributed layers: a modified folded-line stepped impedance resonator (SIR) on the upper layer, a printed monopole antenna on the middle layer, and another folded-line SIR on the lower layer. A pair of resonant frequencies can be introduced by loading two different modified folded-line SIRs as near-field resonant parasitic elements (NFRPs) in the near field of a printed monopole antenna. Simultaneously, the resonant frequencies of the two are lower than the fundamental mode frequency of a traditional printed monopole antenna, thereby enabling the realization of a compact antenna. Furthermore, the resonant frequency can be adjusted through the wide edge strong coupling between the folded-line SIR and the printed monopole antenna. After elaborating on the design principles, a sample antenna is fabricated and underwent measurements to validate the anticipated performance of the proposed antenna. The measured outcomes closely align with the predicted results, providing compelling evidence that the design methodology expounded in this paper is indeed precise and efficacious.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3357096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10411874","Dual-band;modified folded-line SIR;compact;near-field;loading","Antenna measurements;Resonant frequency;Dual band;Loaded antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Near field communication;Resonators;Impedance measurement","","1","","21","CCBYNCND","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, one of the present technical issues is the short-circuit current. Since the current density of the high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape is ∼100 times higher than the copper and aluminum conductors in regular operation, it is more severe than the copper cables for the short-circuit current. We started the short-circuit experiments for a single HTS tape a few years ago. We constructed the capacitor bank to generate a short pulse current; its pulse duration is a few ms for the Bi2223 tape and ∼60 ms for the RE123 tape. Their peak currents are 10 to 30 times larger than the critical currents (Ic) of the HTS tapes. We measure the Ic at the first step and flow the pulse current in the next step, and finally, we measure the Ic again if we can measure the Ic. If the Ic after the pulse current is lower than the original, the pulse current degrades the HTS tape. These are the ways of the experiments. We use RE123 tape; its initial Ic is 200 A, the pulse duration is ∼60 ms, and the peak current is above 2.2 kA. After the pulse current, the Ic was almost identical to the original. However, if the peak current exceeded 2.4 kA, we observed the arc in the tape, and it broke the RE123 tape, or the critical current was lower than the original. We also tested the Bi2223 tape, which is more robust than the RE123 tape. At the same time, we estimated the temperature of the HTS tape during the discharge, which was higher than 300 degrees Celsius, even in liquid nitrogen (LN2), because the voltage-tap solder was molten. These experimental results are the basis for designing the HTS power cable.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3350017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387307","Critical current;dc power cable;HTS tape;short circuit;temperature estimation","High-temperature superconductors;Voltage;Temperature measurement;Resistance;Superconducting cables;Discharges (electric);Fitting","","1","","13","CCBYNCND","9 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, the instances of those metamodels - aka the models - must evolve according to the changes made to the metamodels. This is commonly known as co-evolution and is a prominent research topic in Model Driven Engineering. However, co-evolution mostly adopts an all-or-nothing strategy and does not consider two important aspects, namely (i) recording the evolution history of a metamodel and (ii) allowing models to co-evolve at different times. We find that industrial co-evolution is commonly triggered by customer needs (the users of metamodels). For example, in the manufacturing domain, co-evolution tends to be tied to evolving hardware infrastructure. This implies that co-evolution is rarely dictated by the evolution of the metamodel but rather by the evolution needs of the models - and these evolution needs vary. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows engineers to record the history of a metamodel as versions and also create and maintain arbitrary models of those versioned metamodels, thus allowing engineers to co-evolve models at different times.","2832-7632","979-8-4007-0500-7","10.1145/3639476.3639758","Austrian Science Fund(grant numbers:P31989-N31); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10727136","metamodel evolution;versioning;recording metamodel history","Software;Model driven engineering;Hardware;Recording;Manufacturing;History;Software engineering","","1","","32","CCBY","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, coastal environments can pose major challenges for InSAR due to natural disturbances that degrade interferogram quality. We describe a new multi-primary pairing strategy for persistent scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) to estimate subsidence in challenging coastal environments. Our method retains only consistent PS candidates across multi-primary substacks and solves for redundant velocity observations using SVD-based inversion, similar to the conventional small baseline subset (SBAS) method. Through simulations and a case study comparing with single-primary PS-InSAR and conventional SBAS techniques, we show that our pairing strategy reduces temporal and spatial uncertainty in subsidence estimates in the presence of strong but temporary decorrelation loss, even with increased distance from the reference point. Moreover, our method visibly dampens time-series variation and decreases standard error in our time-series fit by nearly 2x in our case study. Thus, we find that implementing a multi-primary PS-InSAR configuration is a simple method of increasing the robustness of VLM estimates in challenging coastal environments.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2024.3358737","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Postdoctoral Program Fellowship (NPP) currently administered by the Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), and previously administered by the University Space Research Association (USRA) until January 2022, and NASA’s “Coastal land change due to earthquakes and implications for sea-level rise in the Samoan Islands”(grant numbers:19-ESI19-0027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10414105","Coastal subsidence;persistent scatterer (PS-InSAR);sea level rise;vertical land motion (VLM)","Sea measurements;Decorrelation;Standards;Uncertainty;Redundancy;Correlation;Velocity measurement","","1","","20","CCBYNCND","25 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

And multiple high coherency signals are required as inputs for its test, which are with consistent frequency, adjustable amplitude, equal magnitude, and long-time phase consistency ≤±1°. But ordinary signal sources have only one output channel, which is far from meeting the test requirements. If the traditional power division is used for the duplication, the phase difference between the channels will be larger than ±1°. If the multi-throw Radio Frequency (RF) switch is used, it will seriously affect the phase consistency of the input signal and increase the distortion of the signal. In order to solve the above problems, the method to extend the output of the microwave signal source has been proposed in the paper by using the integrated transceiver AD9361. The proposed method can realize the duplication of the number of signal channels according to user requirements. Then a signal replicator has been designed by combining AD9361 chip and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) control module. The experimental platform has been built to test the performance of the designed device. Experimental results show that the duplicated signals are highly consistent with the source signal in the power amplitude and frequency, meanwhile the phase of the duplicated signals are all highly consistent with each other.","2398-7294","","10.26599/IJCS.2024.9100002","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:WK2100000027); Anhui Provincial Development and Reform Commission(grant numbers:WFGCYH2020447); University Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province(grant numbers:KJ2021A0986); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10530643","multi-channel transcranial magnetic stimulation;geriatric rehabilitation;Radio Frequency (RF) signal source;signal duplication;AD9361;Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","Radio frequency;TCPIP;Microwave devices;Switches;Microwave theory and techniques;Transceivers;Frequency measurement","","1","","20","","14 May 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, the further development of Al2O3 thin films is limited by the presence of defects such as oxygen vacancies, self-interstitial atoms, or impurity elements. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed a novel method for fabricating Al2O3 thin films by using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. This method replaces the conventional Trimethylaluminium (TMA)/H2O cycles with TMA/TMA/H2O/H2O cycles (referred to as ‘double cycles’), to deposit the Al2O3. The 5-nm ultrathin Al2O3 film showed a high areal capacitance of 660 nF/cm2 at 20 Hz, and a relatively low current density of 10−8 A/cm2 at 1 MV/cm. InGaZnO (IGZO) TFTs with ultrathin Al2O3 gate dielectric grown by double cycles exhibited outstanding performances, such as a near theoretical limit subthreshold swing (SS) of 70 mV/decade, a higher on/off current ratio  $(I_{\mathrm{ on}} / I_{\mathrm{ off}}$ ) of 106, an increased field-effect mobility ( $\mu $ ) of 6.5 cm2/Vs, a lower threshold voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ th}})$  of 0.2 V, and a low operating voltage of 3 V. These results are superior to the IGZO TFTs with Al2O3 dielectrics deposited using the single TMA/H2O cycle. Therefore, the implementation of ‘double cycles’ in the fabrication of dielectrics through ALD demonstrates considerable potential for future application in low-power electronic devices.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2024.3353340","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62274105); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality Program(grant numbers:19DZ2281000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10398479","Ultrathin Al₂O₃;atomic layer deposition;double cycles;thin film transistor","Dielectrics;Thin film transistors;Aluminum oxide;Leakage currents;Logic gates;Capacitance;Threshold voltage","","1","","26","CCBYNCND","12 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both compressors exploit CMOS technology and a constant and conditional approximation of selected inputs, exhibiting fewer negative errors. As a result, a resource-expensive error recovery module is eliminated, yielding superior performance as compared with prior art. The 14-transistor architecture yields a lower error rate compared to the 8-transistor architecture, trading off lower area for higher accuracy. The compressor-tailored circuit architecture is also proposed and evaluated using image multiplication.

In this letter, we present the derivation of the correlation of Global Navigation Satellite System reflectometry (GNSS-R) signals scattered by a fBm surface. We here show that this correlation depends on a parameter related to the root-mean-square (rms) surface slope as measured at the electromagnetic wavelength scale. When this parameter increases, the correlation smoothly decreases from a value close to unity reaching the value of the roughness-independent expression already available in the literature. In our experiments, based on roughness measurements available in the literature, we first show how the description of the roughness of natural surfaces can be conveniently obtained via fBm parameters. Then, we illustrate the behavior of the correlation time for different roughness regimes.

Our method employs a cascade of three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth extension, and upmixes to stereophonic audio.

In AL, a surrogate model automatically improves itself by iteratively querying more FE data. Using AL and large datasets generated with parallelized cloud FE simulations, we develop a surrogate model to rapidly predict induction machine steady-state torque, torque ripple, total losses, and current harmonic distortion, as a function of motor frequency, voltage, and slip.

"Lightweight and High Accurate RR Interval Compensation for Signals From Wearable ECG Sensors","Y. Hashimoto","School of Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan",IEEE Sensors Letters,"22 May 2024","2024","8","6","1","4","This letter presents a new lightweight and high accurate RR intervals (RRIs) compensation technique suitable for wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors. RRIs are among the important features of ECG signals and are thus widely used in medical and healthcare applications, and their estimation is commonly implemented in wearable ECG sensors. The data sampling rate is one of the factors influencing on the RRI accuracy from ECG signals acquired by wearable sensors. However, in wearable sensors, high sampling rates consume substantial electrical power, leading to a tradeoff between power consumption and RRI accuracy. A spline interpolation is one of the conventional compensation methods obtaining high-resolution RRI at low sampling rates. However, the method requires heavy computational processing for high-order interpolation. Therefore, a method that achieves highly accurate RRI interpolation with lightweight computational processing is desirable for low power consumption in wearable measurement. Here, we developed a novel lightweight and high-accurate RRI compensation method suitable for wearable ECG sensors. The method is specifically designed for algorithms commonly used for R wave detection in wearable ECG sensors. Validation results using simulated ECG signals confirm that the proposed method enables accurate RRI estimation for sampling rates ranging from 50 to 1000 samples, demonstrating superior performance compared with the conventional cubic spline interpolation. Furthermore, the proposed method was confirmed to meet the accuracy requirements for heart rate variability analysis, even at a low sampling rate of 66.7 samples. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method was experimentally confirmed during specific actions with various motion artifacts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for RRI compensation in wearable ECG sensors. With the future introduction of wearable ECG devices, we expect our method to provide a needed balance between low power consumption and high resolution.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2024.3398251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10522897","Sensor signal processing;electrocardiogram (ECG);interpolation;RR interval (RRI);sampling rate;wearable sensors","Rail to rail inputs;Electrocardiography;Sensors;Wearable sensors;Interpolation;Wearable devices;Splines (mathematics)","","1","","23","CCBY","8 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A good benchmark must include recent examples that accurately reflect technologies a nd development practices of today. To be executable in the long term, a benchmark must feature test suites that do not degrade over-time due to, for example, dependencies that are no longer available. Existing benchmarks fail in meeting both criteria. For instance, Defects4J, one of the foremost Java benchmarks, last received an update in 2020. Moreover, full-reproducibility has been neglected by the majority of existing benchmarks.

In particular, the characteristic features of some non-conform behaviour, such as an insulation fault, may be easier to assess when performing impedance measurements rather than observing time-domain signals. A physics-driven equivalent circuit model of a superconducting magnet has been recently developed, whose parameters are derived using solely measured geometric and material properties. This contribution describes its validation against impedance measurements of a spare LHC superconducting main dipole, performed at the CERN magnet test facility.

Weak magnetic coupling between the DB-DGS sensing resonators generates two closely spaced resonances, the separation of which can be adjusted by the coupling level. Since the phase of the reflection coefficient experiences an excursion of 360° between such frequencies, the phase slope can be made arbitrarily high. Thus, by tuning the device within that frequency range, the phase response of the sensor is highly sensitive to variations in the dielectric constant of any material surrounding the DB-DGS resonators, e.g., a liquid under test (LUT). This configuration, with the sensing elements etched in the ground plane, avoids any interference between the driving line and the LUT, or any mechanical accessory required for operation, thereby enhancing the sensor’s practical application.

For networks with undeterministic routing, this study proposes a method for estimating the status of each link using a neural network that does not require path information as an input. Instead, it es-timates the status of each link using only end-to-end measurements. The neural network is trained using various patterns of individual link statuses as teaching signals on a simulated network where the path changes dynam-ically.

Since human experts may face several challenges while annotating such high-frequency data, this letter evaluates effective health indexes using time–frequency analysis to extract reliable patterns or vibration signatures assigned to the process quality or bearing health status. A benchmark dataset for process monitoring of Brownfield milling machines over two years is utilized in this letter where the resulting process is evaluated by experts in a gauging station. Vibration signals are collected from three different computer numerical control (CNC) using a triaxial accelerometer, which is mounted on the rear side of the machines.

Moreover, those studies revealed that without a proper design of the manifolds, the flow partitioning among breeder units would be strongly nonuniform along the poloidal direction. In the present work, MHD flows in electrically coupled liquid metal manifolds are studied by using an efficient hybrid model that has been developed for prediction of MHD pressure drop in such geometries and for determining flow distribution in BUs. The tool combines global mass conservation and pressure drop correlations with detailed 3-D simulations. From the experience gained when applying the model to the geometry of a test blanket module (TBM), it is concluded that the design of the manifolds requires optimization for achieving a balanced flow partitioning among BUs. In the second step, the hybrid model is applied to determine the optimum position of the baffle plates that separate the feeding and collecting ducts in manifolds in order to guarantee comparable flow rates in all BUs.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2024.3362689","Framework of the EUROfusion Consortium, funded by the European Union via the Euratom Research and Training Program(grant numbers:101052200—EUROfusion); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10443334","Liquid metal blankets;magnetohydrodynamics (MHDs);pressure drop and flow distribution","Manifolds;Magnetohydrodynamics;Geometry;Ducts;Solid modeling;Magnetic liquids;Optimization","","1","","16","CCBYNCND","21 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, adversarial examples pose a significant threat to their robustness, which hinders their usage, for instance in safety-critical applications. The arms race of attacks and defenses against adversarial examples has received much attention, whilst the analysis on measuring the robustness received little. Robustness scores provide a means to estimate safe regions in the input space for which no adversarial examples exist for a given model. However, these methods often do not scale. On the other hand, empirical investigations have brought the insight that adversarial examples are not isolated examples in the input space, but form contiguous subspaces.In this paper, we contribute to these investigations with methods for the empirical analysis on identifying the extent of adversarial subspaces through analyzing their boundaries. To that aim, we apply two methods to measure their boundaries and draw conclusions on the shape, extent, and distribution of adversarial subspaces within the input space. The presented results are a first step towards an efficient and scalable empirical measurement of adversarial subspaces, aiming to quantify the robustness of an ML model in cases where a formal verification is not feasible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical investigation of the extent of adversarial subspaces. We illustrate our results on the OpenSky dataset and identify the challenges in assessing the robustness of ML models.","2833-9061","979-8-4007-0588-5","","Ministry of Economic Affairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10556460","artificial intelligence;machine learning;adversarial attacks;adversarial subspaces;robustness assessment","Automation;Shape;Weapons;Shape measurement;Machine learning;Robustness;Software","","1","","14","CCBY","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current tools focus on the structured data in REST API specifications but often neglect valuable insights available in unstructured natural-language descriptions in the specifications, which leads to suboptimal test coverage. Recently, to address this gap, researchers have developed techniques that extract rules from these human-readable descriptions and query knowledge bases to derive meaningful input values. However, these techniques are limited in the types of rules they can extract and prone to produce inaccurate results. This paper presents RESTGPT, an innovative approach that leverages the power and intrinsic context-awareness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve REST API testing. RESTGPT takes as input an API specification, extracts machine-interpretable rules, and generates example parameter values from natural-language descriptions in the specification. It then augments the original specification with these rules and values. Our evaluations indicate that RESTGPT outperforms existing techniques in both rule extraction and value generation. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions for advancing REST API testing through LLMs.","2832-7632","979-8-4007-0500-7","10.1145/3639476.3639769","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-0725202,DE-FOA-0002460); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10727123","Large Language Models for Testing;OpenAPI Specification Analysis","Large language models;Knowledge based systems;Complexity theory;Testing;Software engineering","","1","","40","CCBY","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our analysis uncovers distinct capacitance values per unit area among diodes with varying diameters within the same diode family. These findings underscore the limitations of conventional capacitance equations formulated for planar devices when extended to mesa-structured devices. To separate the capacitance portion dependent solely on the PN junction’s area from the overall depletion capacitance, which is influenced by the device’s geometry, we applied a methodology involving multiple C-V measurements across diodes with differing diameters and validated the experimental outcomes through rigorous calculations. This enables the utilization of standard capacitance equations. Neglecting the impact of device geometry has the potential to introduce significant inaccuracies in critical device parameters.

Based on ReBCO high temperature superconducting tapes wound around a copper former, it exploits round cross-section guaranteeing electrical and mechanical isotropy. However, these cables can degrade as a result of the winding process and operating conditions, as ReBCO tapes are strain-sensitive. This paper presents a 3D multi-physics numerical model for characterizing the critical current ($I_{c}$) of bended ReBCO CORC® cables, based on a T–A formulation implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics® coupled with a thermal model of a straight cable, already validated against experimental results. The tape is approximated as a thin shell, taking advantage of its high aspect ratio, and the $I_{c}$ scaling for the tape accounts for the local strain. A pure geometrical strain evaluation on the tape surface allow to properly account for the punctual degradation of $I_{c}$, as an input for the multi-physics model.

Yet, SiC wafers may contain killer defects that could reduce fabrication yield and make the device fall into unexpected failures. To prevent these failures from happening, it is very important to develop inspection tools that can detect, characterize and locate these defects in a non-invasive way. Current inspection techniques such as Dark Field or Bright field microscopy are effectively able to visualize most such defects; however, there are some scenarios where the inspection becomes problematic or almost impossible, such as when the defects are too small or have low contrast or if the defects lie deep into the substrate. Thus, an alternative method is needed to face these challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of coherent Fourier scatterometry (CFS) as a complementary tool in addition to the conventional techniques to overcome different and problematic scenarios of killer defects inspection on SiC samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used to assess the same defects to validate the findings of CFS.

Secondly, the hybrid moments (MoM)-large element physical optics (LEPO) method is used to calculate the scattering characteristics with the certain frequency points and incident angles according to the system parameters. Finally, range Doppler algorithm (RDA) is adopted to process the signal in the 2D-frequency domain with radar cross section (RCS) exported from electromagnetic calculations.

For the design and evaluation of the mobile communication system in the sky, the air-to-ground (A2G) propagation channel characteristics have been investigated by the UAV-based measurement systems. However, there is a measurement resolution issue due to the limitation of the UAV payload. In this paper, we propose the UAV-based virtual array channel sounding system in the 4.8 GHz band to solve this limitation. In our system, the channel data are continuously measured by the receiver, which is mounted on the UAV station, while the UAV station flies along the measurement course. The data are combined offline, and they are processed virtually as data of large array antenna for investigation of angular characteristics of the propagation channel. A great advantage of our system is to be able to configure an arbitrary virtual antenna array in the air. To mitigate the UAV position error, 3D UAV positions are tracked by laser equipment and used in the array signal processing. The experiment was conducted in an indoor workshop space in the 4.85 GHz band. The HPBW of the angular power spectrum was 3.2 deg., which was quite a sharp value in this frequency band. The azimuth angular and distance estimation errors of the incident radio wave were approximately 0.1 deg. and 0.01 m. Future works will include conducting experiments in various radio propagation environments and analyzing more detailed channel characteristics.","2187-0136","","10.23919/comex.2024ATL0001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10633220","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle;Radio Propagation Measurement;Channel Sounder;Virtual Array Measurement;Microwave-band Radio Propagation;5G system","Wavelength measurement;Sensors;Microwave propagation;Microwave measurement;Microwave devices;Microwave communication;Microwave antennas","","","","","","9 Aug 2024","","","IEICE","IEICE Early Access Articles"

Each coil is made of two different Nb3Sn cables wound around each other and submitted together to the high temperature heat treatment needed for Nb3Sn compound formation. The experience on Nb3Sn coils has taught us that the management of the deformations undergone by the Nb3Sn cable during its formation must be a priority in the definition and the dimensioning of the tools and the manufacturing processes of the coils. This paper reports the results of the test campaigns carried out at CEA Saclay to study the behavior of R2D2 cables during heat treatment. The first campaign consisted of reduced-coils made of a few turns of each cable, with representative lengths. For each coil, the winding is performed with gaps in the components, and the gaps are measured before and after the heat treatment to quantify the coil length variations.

In this study, we designed and tested BN hardware based on superconductor integrated circuit technology. We used a superconductor random number generator, where the output probability of “1” can be controlled by adjusting the input control current, as a node in the BN. Since the “1” output probability is controlled according to the previous node’s output, the conditional probability table (CPT) in the BN can be represented. We designed a two-node BN capable of operating at a clock frequency of 20 GHz, which is two orders of magnitude higher than previously implemented BN hardware. The proposed BN offers a more than three order advantage in power consumption over existing technology, even when considering cooling costs.

However, understanding the influence of each input modality on decision-making within deep learning models remains an open challenge. This letter proposes a deep occlusion framework to enhance the interpretability of a multimodal model for land naturalness assessment, using a supervised pixelwise regression task for naturalness mapping with the input modalities Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 imagery, land cover maps, and nighttime lights intensity data. The proposed framework systematically occludes individual input modalities to create modality-level influence scores. Influence scores are attributed to input modalities by measuring the distance between the embedding of the nonoccluded input and the embedding of the input with a single modality occluded, revealing how each modality influences predictions and clarifying their contributions (and, thus, importance) in the model’s decision-making process. The results provide further insights into how input modalities influence the model’s decision-making at both the sample level, enabling regional case studies, and the dataset level, allowing for data pruning and improving training and inference times.

Early quench detection and a prompt protection system response are essential to avoid conductor damage. One of the conventional methods for accelerator magnet quench protection is to place resistive heaters on the surface of the coils. The protection heaters are stainless steel strips which are powered with a voltage pulse from capacitor bank discharge. Current is passing through the heaters, generating heat due to the resistivity of the stainless steel. Heat is transferred to the cable by conduction. There is at least one layer of polyimide film and the cable insulation (impregnated glass fiber) between the heater and the superconducting cable. Heater delay is defined as the required time to reach the current sharing temperature in the cable after heater firing. Typically predicting the heater delay requires numerical simulations which are computationally somewhat challenging and require expertise and need of specific software. In this study, we are providing a fast and easily accessible surrogate model for predicting the heater delay in Nb3Sn magnets. Finite Element Method simulations with COMSOL Multiphysics are used for collecting the dataset and training a supervised artificial neural network algorithm. The model can be used for first estimations of heater delay in Nb3Sn accelerator magnets during their design phase. In future, the surrogate model could be also integrated with other quench protection design tools to accelerate the detailed protection design of future magnets.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3523873","Academy of Finland “HiQuench-2”-project(grant numbers:334318,336287); Super20T(grant numbers:324887); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10818393","Accelerator magnets;machine learning;neural network;Nb3Sn dipoles;protection heaters;quench protection","Heating systems;Delays;Numerical models;Computational modeling;Magnets;Protection;Predictive models;Power cables;Training;Superconductivity","","","","","CCBY","30 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To resolve this problem, this study introduces into MPT the signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR), used to suppress co-channel interference in multi-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) downlink communications. We establish a beamforming scheme that maximizes SLNR for MPT. Compared with a beamforming scheme that does not consider leakage power, the proposed method transmits power to intended receivers while suppressing leakage power to protected devices.

However, these solvers often come with a significant computational cost, making their application in design tasks, such as optimization, impractical. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques have been explored for accurate and efficient modeling and design of photonic devices. Deep neural networks, in particular, have gained considerable attention in this field. They can be used to create both forward and inverse models. An inverse modeling approach avoids the need for coupling a forward model with an optimizer and directly performs the prediction of the optimal design parameters values. In this paper, we propose an inverse modeling method for nanophotonic structures, based on a mixture density network model enhanced by transfer learning. Mixture density networks can predict multiple possible solutions at a time including their respective importance as Gaussian distributions. However, multiple challenges exist for mixture density network models. An important challenge is that an upper bound on the number of possible simultaneous solutions needs to be specified in advance. Also, another challenge is that the model parameters must be jointly optimized, which can result computationally expensive. Moreover, optimizing all parameters simultaneously can result numerically unstable and lead to degenerate predictions. The proposed approach copes with these limitations using transfer learning-based techniques, while obtaining accurate results in the prediction of the design solutions given an optical response as an input. A dimensionality reduction step is also explored. Numerical results validate the proposed method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3383790","National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS); Swedish Research Council(grant numbers:2022-06725); Methusalem and Hercules Foundations; Research Council (OZR), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10486893","Machine learning;mixture density network;inverse modeling;transfer learning;photonics","Training;Probability density function;Inverse problems;Transfer learning;Optical mixing;Computational modeling;Numerical models;Machine learning;Photonics","","","","18","CCBYNCND","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The physics of RS is complex because it involves the coupled action of electrons and ions or vacancies, a connection which gives rise to the hysteretic behavior of the conduction characteristic of the device. In this letter, a model based on the Landauer approach for the electron transport through a narrow constriction is revisited and combined with the master equation for the generation and dissolution of a nanosized gap. The proposed model not only sheds light on one of the most widely invoked equations for conduction in RS devices (Stanford-PKU RRAM model) but also provides the physical meaning of its parameters.

To this end, we contribute a process for decomposing trust in a complex large-scale system into key trust relationships, systematically identifying behavior-based indicators for the components of trust for a given relationship, and in turn operationalizing data-driven metrics for those indicators, allowing for the wide-scale measurement of trust in practice.","2832-7632","979-8-4007-0500-7","10.1145/3639476.3639775","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS2206859); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10727137","","Grounding;Supply chains;Stars;Large-scale systems;Software measurement;Security;Open source software;Software engineering;Software development management","","","","26","CCBY","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Evidence for both device types suggests that the downscaling of LGS and LG augments the electron velocity in the source-access region, as a result of which the higher carrier density under the gated-channel improves the maximum drain-current density but not necessarily the  $G_{m}$  linearity of the device. It is shown that the devices having a planar and longer source access region are exhibiting relatively improved gate-transconductance linearity. This is suggested to be due to their almost constant source access resistance (Rs). In addition, the downscaling of the LG is observed to have a positive influence on device linearity. This observation could be due to the larger exposure to the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and the resulting rush of the carriers from the source access region to the gated-channel, leading to the suppression of the increasing  $R_{s}$  at higher drain currents.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2024.3428969","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant Program; MNT Awards of Canadian Microelectronic Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10599155","InAlN/GaN;heterostructure field effect transistor (HFET);lattice-matched;source access resistance;transconductance linearity","Logic gates;MODFETs;HEMTs;Resistance;Linearity;Electrons;Threshold voltage","","","","31","CCBY","15 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"“Black Magic 5G Sidelink”: Transparently Extending Short-Range Black-Box Wearable Sensors to a Wide Area via 5G Sidelink","M. Nomura; A.

Most wearable sensing devices to capture data employ short-range wireless protocols such as serial communications over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to satisfy the requirement of low power consumption. On the other hand, the short-range wireless communications limit the applications of human motion capture since digital twinning is often considered more useful in a wide area, e.g., capturing motions of sports players in a large stadium, etc. However, the problem is that replacing BLE with 5G for the existing sensors is not favorable for developers due to the additional cost of re-designing the system, not to mention that it is infeasible for end-users as the sensor protocol is proprietary. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose “black-magic 5G Sidelink” to extend the range of the existing human motion capture sensing system with serial communications via BLE, “transparently” tunneling the black-box sensor protocols over 5G. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a viable architecture of transparent extension of any existing BLE serial sensor systems to a wide area. Second, we actually implement the proposed system.

The oscillation frequency is tuned from 2.5 to 6 GHz in an experiment to verify the theory, and the phase noise of the generated fundamental tone is measured to be −115 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 10 kHz. By appropriately setting the gain of the OEO loop, the power of the first- and third-order harmonics can be adjusted to meet the required power ratio. Periodical triangular pulses with repetition rates of 5 GHz, 6 GHz and square pulses with repetition rates of 2.5 GHz, 5 GHz were successfully generated.

However, in harsh measurement environments, the amount of noise in a LiDAR point cloud increases significantly. In this case, an algorithm using LiDAR data will be misleading, resulting in performance degradation. Although many noise filtering algorithms at point cloud-level were proposed, their effectiveness is limited, as traditional point clouds contain only distance information. In this letter, a method with multistage noise reduction (MSNR) is proposed. It takes point cloud+ as input.

However, when multiple cores access a shared cache, inter-core evictions become a relevant source of interference that must be appropriately controlled. To solve this issue, one can statically partition caches and remove the interference. Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of less flexibility and, in some cases, worse performance. In this context, enabling more flexible cache allocation policies requires additional monitoring support.

The grain size index (GSI) based on 89 and 150 GHz from AMSU-B and independent observations at 89 GHz from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) also show concurrent unusual values. To explain such event, a theoretical analysis was carried out by means of a radiative transfer model. We explore the sensitivity of brightness temperature to surface snow properties focusing on December, just before the decrease, and April, at its end. Results confirm that this variation is mainly related to an increase in snow grain size. A decrease in snow density is also involved as suggested by the increase in brightness temperature at 1.4 GHz from soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) and in the polarization ratio at 36 GHz from AMSR-2. Extreme values observed at multiple frequencies, as well as peculiar atmospheric conditions explored in a previous study, confirm the uniqueness of this event at least on decennial scale.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2024.3367111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10439251","Advanced microwave sounding unit B (AMSU-B);cryosphere;microwave radiometry;modeling","Ocean temperature;Snow;Atmospheric modeling;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Sea surface;Microwave radiometry","","","","27","CCBY","19 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The lenses are uniform in one direction to maintain a wide RCS angular range of the underlying Van Atta arrays. They are manufactured using affordable 3-D printing stereolithography (SLA) process using high-performance resin. The resulting manufactured and measured Van Atta retrodirective arrays integrated with lenses exhibit measured RCS levels up to -28 dBsm at 24 GHz frequency.

ACT automates the tedious aspects of unit testing IaC programs and is extensible through a plugin system for test generators and ora-cles.

This report is focused on exploring the way micro-swimmers move in a liquid environment with a low Reynolds number and how their physical parameters affect their speed of movement and finally, simulate the movement trajectory of cells. In conclusion, the way of motion of a cell is divided into “Run Phase” and “Tumble Phase”, and cells move at different speeds in different states. Additionally, the relationship between the speed of cells and the pitch angle of the tail flagella is roughly a quadratic function with the opening facing downwards, which helps to control the speed of micro-swimmers. Lastly, the trajectory of a cell is simulated based on the analysis above and the results showed that they matched perfectly.","2997-6278","979-8-3503-5030-2","10.1109/CACRE62362.2024.10635085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10635085","micro-swimmer;Reynolds number;Pitch angle control;simulate;flagella","Liquids;Automation;Tail;Trajectory;Motion analysis;Robots","","","","8","IEEE","23 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regression testing is a key task in continuous development and integration, where software is built in small increments and new features are integrated as soon as possible. It is therefore important that developers are notified about possible faults quickly. In this article, we propose a test case prioritization schema that combines the use of a static and a dynamic prioritization algorithm. The dynamic prioritization algorithm rearranges the order of execution of tests on the fly, while the tests are being executed. We propose to use a conditional probability dynamic algorithm for this. We evaluate our solution on three industrial datasets and utilize Average Percentage of Fault Detection for that. The main findings are that our dynamic prioritization algorithm can: a) be applied with any static algorithm that assigns a priority score to each test case b) can improve the performance of the static algorithm if there are failure correlations between test cases c) can also reduce the performance of the static algorithm, but only when the static scheduling is performed at a near optimal level.","2833-9061","979-8-4007-0588-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10556478","regression testing;Test Case Prioritization (TCP);dynamic prioritization","Job shop scheduling;Correlation;Heuristic algorithms;Fault detection;Software algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Software","","","","20","CCBY","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the number of ECUs is increasing and moving toward the realization of fully automated vehicles, Ethernet is being introduced to send them. In addition, as Ethernet-based in-vehicle networks are being deployed, adopting IEEE 802.1TSN is also being considered. Although many studies have evaluated QoS controls, such as CBS and TAS, few studies of QoS provided ATS over in-vehicle networks. Thus, the authors evaluate the QoS of ATS and then compare ATS to the other QoS controls by two experiments. One evaluates basic QoS, and the other treats actual use cases. Experimental results show that ATS can suppress maximum delay and frame losses more than the other controls when the frame interval is wide and the size is large over in-vehicle network. Moreover, they also indicate that ATS can reduce the maximum delay and delay jitter at the sacrifice of the frame loss rate by lowering the maximum residence time. Therefore, if the requirement for delay is more important than that for frame losses. it is better to adopt ATS.","2187-0136","","10.23919/comex.2024XBL0085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554799","IEEE 802.1TSN;in-vehicle Ethernet;QoS;asynchronous traffic shaping;credit based shaper;time-aware shaper","Delays;Quality of service;Switches;Ethernet;Propagation losses;Synchronization;Indium tin oxide","","","","13","","11 Jun 2024","","","IEICE","IEICE Journals"

As the number of users increases, it becomes impossible to assign unique orthogonal pilot sequences to each device, making the necessary channel state estimation challenging. Hence, intra-cell pilot reuse becomes necessary. In this letter, we propose a novel method for determining the optimal pilot length that maximizes spectral efficiency (SE) in mMIMO networks with pilot reuse. To that end, we develop an approximated expression for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, which is a function of the pilot length. The proposed method achieves accurate SE for different degrees of channel correlation and block length. This allows for efficient evaluation of the SE for different pilot lengths, without having to resort to lengthy network simulations.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2023.3337895","Research Council of Finland (formerly, Academy of Finland) through ROHM Project(grant numbers:319485); 6G Flagship Programme Project(grant numbers:346208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10335902","Pilot length;SINR;pilot reuse;massive MIMO","Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Channel estimation;Covariance matrices;Partial transmit sequences;Correlation;Contamination","","","","15","CCBY","30 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The research is structured around three areas: (1) a critical review of existing adaptive UX practices and the potential for their automation; (2) an investigation into the role and effectiveness of personas in enhancing UX adaptability; and (3) the proposal of a theoretical framework that leverages LLM capabilities to create more dynamic and responsive UX designs and guidelines.","2574-1934","979-8-4007-0502-1","10.1145/3639478.3639810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554906","","Automation;Reviews;User experience;Proposals;Standards;Software engineering;Guidelines","","","","26","CCBY","20 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, in IoT systems, such as IEEE 802.15.4g, constant envelope modulation, which is resistant to nonlinear distortion, is employed. However, strong nonlinear distortion occurs even in such modulation schemes, and a tradeoff between cancellation performance and computational cost arises for terminals with limited computational resources. In addition, small IoT terminals cannot sufficiently suppress self-interference (SI) in the analog domain owing to form factor limitations. Therefore, this letter proposes an in-band full-duplex transceiver with a low intermediate frequency (IF) and shared local oscillator (LO) structure for IEEE 802.15.4g-based IoT devices that can achieve sufficient SI cancellation with a linear digital SI canceller of low computational cost. The proposed system significantly reduces computational cost, by up to 1/81 compared to a nonlinear SI canceller based on the Hammerstein model. Moreover, the system achieves 66 dB self-interference cancellation with the digital canceller alone and 99 dB with the digital cancellation and analog domain suppression, achieving almost down to the receiver noise floor even with low analog SI cancellation in practical wireless implementation.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2024.3519712","The Nitto Foundation, Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP24K17275); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10806895","In-band full-duplex;self-interference cancellation;low-IF;internet-of-things (IoT)","Nonlinear distortion;Internet of Things;Distortion;Mixers;Wireless communication;Transceivers;Interference cancellation;Computational efficiency;Band-pass filters;Full-duplex system","","","","","CCBYNCND","18 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It involves the storage of large data generated by different users and efficient computation of application and web-related tasks. With the help of edge nodes installed near the users, the computation load of Web 3.0 will be efficiently managed. Thus, efficient task offloading and computation become a key concern in edge computing-enabled Web 3.0. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed that solves the challenges of load imbalance at the edge nodes resulting in large queue sizes and increased task delays. The proposed technique identifies the edge nodes with a large network load and pairs them with a lightly loaded edge node that can handle some of their network load. The edge node pairing is based on the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm. The preference profile of edge nodes is developed based on factors such as task computation delay and task transmission delay. Once the pairing is done, the number of tasks is offloaded as per the computing capacity of the lightly loaded edge nodes. A detailed simulation-based performance evaluation of the proposed technique is presented showing a reduction in task delay by 20% and task deadline miss ratio by 68%.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10654717","Web 3.0;task offloading;edge computing","Semantic Web;Performance evaluation;Collaboration;Delays;Computational efficiency;Classification algorithms;Internet of Things","","","","25","","28 Aug 2024","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

The blocking junction in the proposed device is formed by embedding a p-drift between the highly doped carrier storage layer and n-drift. Thereby, not only low voltage drop ( $V_{\mathrm {ON}}$ ) is  $\cdot $  achieved, but also the breakdown-voltage is not-affected. At the low current on-state, due to extra auxiliary BJTs, the snapback phenomenon of FPBJ-LIGBT is eliminated.

Based on these characteristics, a speckle correction filter is proposed by calculating the polarimetric coherency level on a selected neighboring pixel. A correction is applied to the pixel which has a low polarimetric coherence level.

This letter presents a method to optimize the data transfer interval using a Markov model. Although the Markov model directly implies the assumption of exponentially distributed failures' interarrival times, using extensive simulations, we showed that the optimal data transfer interval derived by this model still performs exceptionally well under other failure distributions with less than 7.3% difference in terms of period of data loss compared to the true optimal data transfer interval.

Therefore, evaluating the DMD of FMF is necessary to implement MDM transmission systems. In this paper, we propose a method to simultaneously measure the DMDs for all linearly polarized (LP) modes in FMFs. The method involves using a commercially available optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR). It measures the round-trip impulse responses for all LP modes simultaneously using delay lines of different lengths and a mode-selective coupler. The DMDs for all LP modes are obtained from these round-trip impulse responses. By using commercially available OTDR and delay lines, the proposed method can measure the DMD easily and reasonably compared with the conventional method. We use delay lines for each mode to distinguish the signal of each mode and crosstalk component. We also clarify the conditions for the length of delay lines given to each mode.

For samples prepared from smaller powder particles, we found, that despite the increase in inner demagnetization factor as a result of the smoothing procedure, the differential relative permeability increased, and total energy loss decreased.","1949-3088","","10.1109/LMAG.2024.3450334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10648613","Soft magnetic materials;direct current magnetic properties;permeability;surface treatment","Powders;Surface treatment;Permeability;Smoothing methods;Soft magnetic materials;Magnetic hysteresis;Magnetic cores","","","","23","CCBY","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most ship detection algorithms are deployed in unmanned surface Vehicles, so the detection algorithm should meet the two aspects of lightweight model and high detection precision. However, most of the current algorithms in the pursuit of precision make the model have an excessive number of parameters and the lightweight model cannot meet the detection precision. To address this challenge, this paper improves the current relatively advanced YOLOv7 algorithm and proposes Light-YOLOv7. On the basis of YOLOv7, The GhostNet with CA attention mechanism is employed as the backbone network for feature extraction in the detection algorithm, which reduces network parameters and computation. The E-ELAN module in the neck is combined with the EMA attention mechanism, forming the EMA-E-ELAN module, the EMA-E-ELAN module enhancement network is mainly capable of sensing and multi-scale feature extraction. The auxiliary head in YOLOv7 was abandoned, and only the lead head was used to complete the final loss calculation and positive and negative sample matching. Light-YOLOv7 algorithm reduced the number of parameters by 45% and the computational load by 57.1%, as demonstrated by experimental results. The precision and mAP@0.5 values are almost the same as those of the original algorithm, which are 97.3 % and 98.3 %. With a significant reduction in the number of parameters and calculations, the precision and mAP@0.5 of the Light- YOLOv7 algorithm remain equal to those of the original algorithm. The lightweight of the model is realized.","2997-6278","979-8-3503-5030-2","10.1109/CACRE62362.2024.10635091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10635091","YOLOv7;Object Detection;Lightweight;Attention mechanism","Training;Attention mechanisms;Object detection;Lead;Feature extraction;Neck;Marine vehicles","","","","8","IEEE","23 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing bus planning methods cannot offer optimal solutions concerning the special resource distribution of the FPC design. To investigate an effective way to shorten the routing time of FPC and achieve enhanced performance, a bus planning algorithm is proposed to tackle complex area connection problems. On the basis of the pin location information, the routing space is partitioned and generally represented as an undirected graph, and the topological non-crossing relationship between different regions is obtained using the dynamic pin sequence. Considering the rout ability and electrical constraints, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to search the optimal location of the crossing point on the region boundary.

Since the absorptance of the HZO films with TiN electrodes is highest in UV region, the UV-LED annealing process is promising to achieve a much more energy-efficient annealing process than a conventional halogen lamp RTA method. It was experimentally confirmed that UV-LED annealing reduces the energy consumption by nearly half compared to the conventional method. The ferroelectric characteristics obtained by this method are comparable to those achieved by the halogen lamp RTA process at 400-450°C. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) pattern shows that no monoclinic phase is formed and only the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases are confirmed.

Thus, the function of transverse tritium engineering has been created in the DEMO Central Team Design work package. In this conference proceeding, a brief introduction to the DEMO organization and those parts of the project that are tritium related will be highlighted—these extend beyond the obvious tritium breeding and fuel cycle areas, to areas such as balance of plant and remote maintenance, all underpinned by a strong relationship with the safety and environment function. The transverse tritium engineering activity ensures that tritium is considered in all relevant design sprints and work packages and provides awareness of the issues relating to the use of tritium to those unfamiliar with the field. Driven by considerations such as tritium and HTO toxicity, tritium scarcity, and waste and decommissioning factors, four core tritium design principles have been derived to drive the best practice and awareness across the project. These are: 1) tritium inventory minimization; 2) tritium confinement; 3) tritium management and control; and 4) minimization of the use of other hydrogen isotopes. To identify where tritium should be considered during design activities, the pathways taken by tritium through an operational reactor are identified—both intended and unwanted. In addition, the entire life cycle of EU DEMO is considered. Integration between work packages is facilitated by the creation of interface identification documents in conjunction with system engineering to establish parameters such as mass balances and the establishment of trade budgets for important parameters affecting multiple work packages, such as tritium inventories and tritium release limits.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2024.3401869","EUROfusion Consortium; European Union via the Euratom Research and Training Programme(grant numbers:101052200—EUROfusion); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/W006839/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10741044","Fusion;transverse tritium engineering;tritium","Fuels;Isotopes;Maintenance;Europe;Inductors;Plasmas;Minimization;Tokamak devices;Streams;Heat transfer","","","","10","CCBYNCND","1 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, lateral charge spreading, rather than vertical loss, is mainly studied as an indicator to determine how long stored data can survive on the selected cell. When the SiN layer is doped with p-type, the electrostatic potential decreases and SRH recombination increases in the doping region. As a result, the p-type doping structure has better retention characteristics than others. In addition, for an optimized structure between retention characteristics and cell current, the doping region of the SiN layer is split and analyzed by the thickness of the doping region. Since the p-type doping region is thicker, lateral spreading is effectively blocked although the cell current decreased slightly.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3381525","Daegu University Research(grant numbers:20200262); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10478720","3D NAND;doped SiN layer;electrostatic potential;lateral charge spreading;SRH recombination","Doping;Periodic structures;Three-dimensional displays;Flash memories;Electrons;Electron traps;Electric potential","","","","34","CCBYNCND","25 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multiple types of data are shared among the ITS devices which include safety information, road services, web based information retrieval and task computation. Web 3.0 offers a decentralized, distributed and secure data sharing mechanism for ITSs. Allocation of wireless channel resources are critical to enable an efficient ITS system. In this paper, a novel data sharing technique for Web 3.0 based ITS is presented that relies on an intelligent clustering algorithm. In the first step, the proposed technique uses a K-means algorithm to find groups of vehicles with similar speeds. In the second step, each cluster is assigned an RSU which has the highest average data rate with all vehicles in the cluster. This is achieved by using a stable matching technique so that there is no contention and each cluster is assigned a separate RSU. The algorithm periodically updates the clusters and RSU allocation for web data sharing between vehicles and RSUs. Simulation results show that the proposed clustering-based data sharing technique improves sum-rate by 20% and reduces network delay by 23%.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10815633","Intelligent transportation system;vehicular network;Web 3.0;mobility;data sharing","Semantic Web;Wireless communication;Simulation;Roads;Clustering algorithms;Transportation;Delays;Safety;Resource management;Communication system security","","","","20","","25 Dec 2024","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

The current state-of-the-art in the WR-3 band (220 GHz to 330 GHz) is based on single notch frequency selective surfaces (FSS), whose maximum number of implementable frequency codes is too few for indoor localization applications. This work proposes the coding of the CR with a single layer FSS implementing two notches, using split ring resonators (SRRs) with two different resonance frequencies. The concept is demonstrated by encoding the response of a 3 cm edge CR with an FSS resonating at 242 GHz and 308 GHz. The tag achieves a maximum radar cross-section (RCS) of 3 dBsqm at 275 GHz. Four more tags are demonstrated by simply varying the radii of the SRRs.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) as they are currently conceptualized have not yet responded to these changes. They are still designed around the idea of a human programmer typing textual code into an editor window with the IDE providing assistance via the integration of various tools for syntax highlighting, compilation, debugging, and (maybe) code version control. This paper presents a vision for transforming the IDE from an Integrated Development Environment to an Intel-ligent Development Environment. The new IDE will be designed around the idea of a human programmer as the manager or curator of a software project who, rather than manually typing in code to implement a solution, will instead use the IDE to direct AI programming agents and/or automated tools to combine existing APIs, packages, and new code to implement the needed features. In this new model, the fundamental roles of the IDE are to 1) facilitate the communication between the human programmer and the AI agents and automated tools and 2) organize the workflow tasks needed to go from requirements gathering to the final tested and validated deployed feature. This paper presents a vision for the new Intelligent Development Environment based on a range of proof-of-concept high-value scenarios we have experimented with and discusses the challenges that remain to realizing these in a cohesive intelligent development experience.","","979-8-4007-0580-9","10.1145/3643796.3648452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10713964","Interactivity;Development Environment;AI Assisted Programming","Computer languages;Codes;Automation;Conferences;Debugging;Programming;Syntactics;Software;Artificial intelligence","","","","12","CCBY","16 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, development teams must actively identify and communicate all breaking changes to affected teams to stay compatible. This research addresses this problem with three contributions. First, we identified API evolution strategies and open challenges in practice with an explorative study. Based on the study findings, we formulated two open research directions for evolving publicly accessible APIs, i.e., REpresentational State Transfer (REST) APIs. As the second contribution, we will introduce a REST API change extraction approach to improve the change no-tification accuracy. We plan experiments on open-source projects to evaluate our approach's accuracy and compare it to openapi-diff for structural changes.

"Web 3.0 Chord DHT Resource Clustering","K. Chan; Y.

The traditional Chord algorithm allows nodes to freely join and leave the network by hashing their IP addresses, and publishing and storing resources through the same hash function. When the keys of the resources are unique, the resources will be evenly distributed across each node, thereby achieving load balancing. However, in cases where many identical resources are published, this method leads to specific nodes bearing too much load, causing performance bottlenecks and resource concentration issues. In Web 3.0, when the nodes use the resource's topic as the key to publish resources, as the topic's popularity increases, the number of nodes using the same key as the publishing node and the nodes with demand for the topic resources will also increase. In the traditional Chord algorithm, the same key will be managed by the same node. The node responsible for the key needs to save the routing information of all related nodes and cope with a large number of resource requests for it. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new variant of the Chord algorithm, which uses two different Chord rings for resource clustering: one based on the hash of resource names and the other based on the hash of IP addresses. This method allows us to allocate resources more effectively, ensuring each node bears a reasonable load share according to capacity. This paper will present the design principles of this method and validate its effectiveness in improving resource distribution and reducing the problem of single-point overload through experiments.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2355","MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea(grant numbers:RS-2023-00240211); ITRC (Information Technology Research Center)(grant numbers:RS-2023-00259099); IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10654691","Chord;DHT;Web 3.0;resource clustering;load balancing","Semantic Web;Hash functions;Publishing;System performance;Load management;Routing;Reliability engineering","","","","12","","28 Aug 2024","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

To this end, recent approaches have utilized machine learning algorithms operating in the time domain. In our letter, we advocate for the use of spectral representation, where the gap between pre-blockage and non-blockage periods is much wider and directly measurable. By utilizing this idea, we developed a simple proactive blockage detection algorithm for indoor deployment of sub-THz systems and evaluated it using blockage detection probability, mean time to blockage, and false alarm rate. Our results obtained using measured traces of blockage events at 156 GHz show that it is capable of detecting a blockage event at least 50 ms prior to its occurrence.

Linear waveform distortion caused by, e.g., chromatic dispersion (CD) is commonly compensated by linear equalizers using digital signal processing (DSP) in digital coherent receivers. However, mitigation of nonlinear waveform distortion is considered to be one of the next important issues. An ANN-based nonlinear equalizer is one possible candidate for solving this problem. However, the risk of overfitting of ANNs is one obstacle in using the technology in practical applications. We evaluated and compared the overfitting of ANN- and conventional VSTF-based nonlinear equalizers used to compensate for optical nonlinear distortion. The equalizers were trained on repeated random bit sequences (RRBSs), while varying the length of the bit sequences. When the number of hidden-layer units of the ANN was as large as 100 or 1000, the overfitting characteristics were comparable to those of the VSTF. However, when the number of hidden-layer units was 10, which is usually enough to compensate for optical nonlinear distortion, the overfitting was weaker than that of the VSTF. Furthermore, we confirmed that even commonly used finite impulse response (FIR) filters showed overfitting to the RRBS when the length of the RRBS was equal to or shorter than the length of the tapped delay line of the filters. Conversely, when the RRBS used for the training was sufficiently longer than the tapped delay line, the overfitting could be suppressed, even when using an ANN-based nonlinear equalizer with 10 hidden-layer units.","1745-1345","","10.23919/transcom.2023EBP3121","JSPS(grant numbers:20K05367); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10417032","optical nonlinear compensation;nonlinear equalizers;artificial neural network;Volterra series transfer function;overfitting","Equalizers;Optical distortion;Training;Artificial neural networks;Optical fibers;Nonlinear distortion;Fiber nonlinear optics","","","","22","","30 Jan 2024","","","IEICE","IEICE Journals"

With the increase in GPS data coverage and availability, some research has expanded its use to estimate state-wide vehicle-miles travelled, to classify driving maneuvers for road safety assessment, or to estimate environmental performance indicators, such as vehicular fuel consumption and pollution emissions. In computer science, research has used GPS data to infer road network maps. Although the inferred maps provide a correct topology and connectivity, they lack the essential details to be used for transport modeling. Therefore, this work proposes a method to extract network-wide road direction and turning movement rules.

Accurate positioning and defined application of pressure with the US probe play a significant role in US imaging. Robot-assisted US imaging can address these issues and additionally facilitate three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of US images, providing a deeper understanding of tissue structures. Therefore, this paper focuses on the fundamental step of acquiring US images and reconstructing US volumes through the integration of a US system with a collaborative robot. The paper demonstrates that force-controlled images can be acquired with high accuracy and that 3D images can be accurately reconstructed to closely match real-world measurements. The utilization of the DICOM standard enhances the performance of robot-assisted 3D reconstruction in this preliminary phase by enabling image extraction and pose data embedding. Furthermore, tissue elasticity is a critical factor in various medical applications, and accurate measurement of tissue stiffness is essential for prosthesis fitting, requiring innovative approaches such as shear wave elastography (SWE) in addition to conventional US imaging. Therefore, this paper also lays the groundwork for future efforts in 3D reconstruction of SWE images with the aim of refining tissue modeling for prosthetic fitting and diagnostics.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10781744","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781744","ultrasound imaging;robot-assisted ultrasound imaging;force control;3D reconstruction;shear wave elastography","Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Accuracy;Ultrasonic imaging;Imaging;DICOM;Elastography;Image reconstruction;Standards;Prosthetics","","","","16","CCBY","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, data collection for learning is costly when using CNNs. In addition, there is a problem of missing data owing to various factors when collecting AP information.

However, automatically conducting this process requires input data other than the DSM and/or setting parameters that are suitable for the target region. Here, to directly generate a DTM from only a DSM, we used the pix2pix model that performs domain conversion using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). Pix2pix and the generator-only model were tested in areas with different topography and building characteristics. For both the models, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the generated DTMs were approximately 0.4 m for areas where small buildings were distributed on flat terrain. In areas with large buildings with flat roofs or rapid elevation changes, the RMSEs were 1 m or even larger. In areas with rapid elevation changes, pix2pix showed an RMSE that was 1 m smaller than that of the generator-only model, suggesting the effectiveness of cGANs.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2023.3337798","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP22K12343); Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) projects entitled “The Project for Development of Integrated Expert System for Estimation and Observation of Damage Level of Infrastructure in Lima Metropolitan Area (PI: Prof. Koichi Kusunoki).”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10335727","Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs);digital surface model (DSM);digital terrain model (DTM);urban areas","Urban areas;Data models;Interpolation;Generators;Spatial resolution;Point cloud compression;Training","","","","17","CCBYNCND","30 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are increasing concerns about the monopolization and potential breach of private data by greedy and malicious organizations. Interest in Web 3.0 systems is on the rise as an alternative. These systems aim to guarantee the self-sovereignty of personal data in a decentralized setting. Users can share data with others directly for fair compensation. Nevertheless, malicious remote users can still violate the integrity and confidentiality of personal data. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method of preventing unwanted leakage and counterfeiting of the private data lent on the premise of remote users. This paper focuses on the decentralized nature of Web 3.0 to leverage existing personal storage so that the burden of collecting secure data is relieved. Data owners create a lightweight Docker container to encapsulate their private data sources. The data owners generate another container to be deployed on a remote premise for taking and executing any ML algorithms remote users create. Between the containers forming a distributed trusted execution environment (TEE), data are read through a secure channel. Since the TEE is strictly controlled by the data owner, no malicious ML application can leak or breach the private information.

For verification, the HSC with bandwidth of 12–15 GHz/15-18 GHz is designed to apply to a 6–18 GHz T/R module. As a result, the second harmonic of 6–9 GHz transmitting signal can be suppressed below 32 dBc when compared to the PA's fundamental output. While the p-i-n switches are “OFF” state, the HSC is almost the same as a 50 Ω transmission line, which will have a little effect on the 9–18 GHz transmitting signal. The measurement results approximately agree with the calculated results and simulated results, which demonstrate the validity of the proposed HSC.","2075-5597","","10.23919/cje.2022.00.295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10488050","GaN power amplifier (PA);Harmonic suppression;Low in-band harmonic;p-i-n switch;Wide-band T/R module","Microstrip filters;Harmonics suppression;Power transmission lines;PIN photodiodes;Switches;Harmonic analysis;Transmission line measurements","","","","21","","1 Apr 2024","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

This topic has been of interest for many decades. Several mathematical models and optimization algorithms have been developed to achieve a controllable sidelobe level. However, few researchers have considered the effect of the non-uniform distribution on the aperture efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive study and proposes accurate mathematical modelling of the aperture efficiency of an antenna array which is divided into two components: power-loss efficiency (which dominates total aperture efficiency) and power-distribution efficiency to gain a better understanding. The paper also shows how the sidelobe level of an antenna array is linked to these efficiencies and how they can be improved. It is proved that the aperture efficiency exponentially decays when lowering the sidelobe level. However, it converges to a certain value when the sidelobes vanish. Moreover, a validation example through simulations is presented to verify the mathematical modelling of the aperture efficiency.","2637-6431","","10.1109/OJAP.2024.3354048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10399903","Antenna array;aperture efficiency;non-uniform distribution;sidelobe level;weight vector","Antenna arrays;Mathematical models;Aperture antennas;Antenna feeds;Attenuators;Antenna radiation patterns;Attenuation","","","","16","CCBY","15 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The injection depth is confirmed to be over 30 nm with a fluorine peak concentration of 1023 at/cm3 in vicinity of the surface. Traditional method of partial AlGaN recessing with a pretty tiny processing window is proven unfriendly for production and vulnerable to the fluorine injection.

However, the feasible region of FFR controller parameters is inherently nonlinear and implicit because the power point tracking controllers of wind turbine would counteract the effect of FFR controllers. To address this issue, this letter proposes a linear feasible region formulation method, where frequency regulation characteristics of wind turbines, the dead band, and reserve limits of generators are all considered.

We first present expressions for the OP of this system, complemented by an outage loss function (OLF) for its minimization. We then derive: (i) the necessary and sufficient properties of an optimal model (OpM) and (ii) expressions for the average number of resources scanned by both OpM and non-OpMs. Here, non-OpMs refer to those trained with the OLF and binary cross entropy (BCE) loss functions. We establish that optimal performance requires a channel that exhibits no time decorrelation properties. For very high decorrelation values, we find that models trained using the OLF and BCE perform similarly. For intermediate (practical) decorrelation values, OLF outperforms BCE, and both approach the OpM as decorrelation tends to zero. Our analysis further reveals that, to be able to capture a suitable resource, models trained with the OLF scan a slightly higher number of resources than the OpM and those trained with BCE. This increase in the mean number of scanned resources is offset by a significant enhancement in the OP as compared to BCE.","2576-3156","","10.1109/LNET.2024.3474253","Royal Academy of Engineering(grant numbers:RF\201920\19\191); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10705105","Machine learning;outage prediction;outage loss function;optimal classifier;resource allocation","Correlation;Resource management;Predictive models;Training;Decorrelation;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless networks;Power system reliability;Monte Carlo methods;Limiting","","","","15","CCBY","4 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can mitigate the effects of ISI by inserting a GI, thereby main-taining an excellent performance. However, the transmission efficiency decreases owing to GI. This study leverages the distinctive properties of both FBMC and OFDM and proposes a hybrid approach that can achieve robust transmission efficiency even in the face of a varying delay spread. In particular, we theoretically calculate the transmission efficiency of FBMC and OFDM based on the instantaneous channel response, choose a trans-mission method that offers superior efficiency, and ensure high transmission efficiency regardless of the wireless channel conditions. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method through computer sim-ulations and compare its performance with those of the FBMC-only and OFDM-onlyapproaches.","2187-0136","","10.23919/comex.2023XBL0125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10315082","filter bank multicarrier (FBMC);orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM);multipath fading;inter-symbol Interference (ISI);inter-carrier interference (ICI);guard interval (GI);Classification: Wireless communication technologies","OFDM;Interference;Fading channels;Signal to noise ratio;Delays;Symbols;Degradation","","","","12","","10 Nov 2023","","","IEICE","IEICE Journals"

Taking advantage of GWG structure without good electrical contact, the antenna can also be fabricated and assembled easily in the mmW band. The principle analysis of the antenna is given, and the antenna is simulated and fabricated. The measured results show that the bandwidth for S11, lower than −10.7 dB and the axial ratio (AR) lower than 2.90 dB in 75–110 GHz, with realative bandwidth of 38%. Over the frequency band, the gain is higher than 9.16 dBic, and the dual-CP port isolation is greater than 32 dB. The proposed antenna with dual-CP and highly isolated in a wide bandwidth range has broad application prospects in the field of mmW communication.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2024.000082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10685045","dual circularly polarized (dual-CP) antenna;gap waveguide (GWG);endfire antennas;millimeter-wave (mmW) antennas;broadband antennas","Broadband antennas;Antenna measurements;Antennas;Frequency measurement;Floors;Gain measurement;Broadband communication","","","","","","20 Sep 2024","","","BIAI","BIAI Early Access Articles"

After a tailored transformation that maps the data gathered by the UCA into a virtual uniform linear array (VULA), the mutual coupling effect is modeled via gain and phase errors affecting the resulting VULA. Therefore, a coordinate descent (CD) iterative procedure is designed to approximate the maximum likelihood estimates of the VULA calibration factors and of the sources power. Leveraging the resulting calibrated VULA array manifold, the DOAs are obtained using the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariant technique (ESPRIT). Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method with respect to the baseline uncalibrated ESPRIT, in terms of DOA estimation accuracy in the presence of mutual coupling, making it viable to be implemented in actual sensing systems due to its moderate computational complexity.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2024.3392010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10506612","Sensor signal proccessing;antenna mutual coupling;direction-of-arrival (DOA);online calibration;uniform circular array (UCA)","Mutual coupling;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Antenna arrays;Manifolds;Maximum likelihood estimation;Vectors;Iterative methods","","","","22","CCBY","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the covariance matrix from a backscatter with reflection symmetry, the terms $\bm{S_{hh}} \bm{S}_{\bm{hv}}^{*}$, $\bm{S_{vv}} \bm{S}_{\bm{hv}}^{*}$, and their complex conjugates are 0. The backscatter from natural covers, such as fields and forested areas, is typically reflection-symmetric, as these four elements have near-zero values. The backscatter from urban areas and man-made structures is substantially different, and the backscatter from buildings not aligned with the radar line of sight usually does not have reflection symmetry. A novel block-diagonality test statistic for reflection symmetry with a constant false alarm rate property is proposed. It is compared with an approximate test built on a change detection test statistic for Wishart-distributed covariance matrices. Their use on quad-polarimetric data in different situations shows their high potential for man-made structure detection. Applied after an orientation correction of the covariance matrices, these test statistics highlight with high-contrast buildings and urban areas.

A single-heat-flux method is one of the noninvasive techniques that estimate CBT by measuring heat flow changes near the skin with temperature sensors. The method requires calibrating parameters for estimating CBT in advance by comparing them with reference values obtained through another method. The invasive measurement method is generally used to obtain the reference values, which poses a challenge in terms of measurement burden. Here, we propose a new calibration method that does not require acquiring reference values. This method identifies calibration parameters based on the temperature history after the measurement probe is attached. It has been numerically and experimentally confirmed that the estimation accuracy by the method is equivalent to that of a general-purpose electronic thermometer.

By forming a pseudo N+/P/N/P+ structure with the word line (WL) bias of 3D string cells, thyristor operation with steep switching characteristics and a high on-current can be obtained. It is known that there is a strong cell-to-cell interference effect in thyristor operation, and in previous report (Horii et al., 2020), we have suggested novel WL bias conditions, referred to as the wide barrier mode, that can suppress the cell-to-cell interference effect. In order to evaluate the advantages of thyristor operation in 3D flash memory further, we report for the first time the several cell characteristics and reliability issues of thyristor operation required for the actual usage of storage products. (1) We demonstrate excellent cell characteristics of a wide programmed Vth window and sufficient program slope values in thyristor operation, which are indispensable for realizing multi-level cells. (2) Cell characteristics of thyristor operation exhibit hysteresis when sweeping in the WL direction but not in the bit line (BL) direction, which is essential for determining the read operating waveform. (3) Our proposed new WL biasing scheme to suppress the cell-to-cell interference effect is described with a more detailed dependence on adjacent cells and its effect on the on-current. We show that a high on-current can still be achieved even with highly stacked WL of approximately 100 layers. (4) In terms of reliability issues, thyristor operation exhibits a sufficient margin against read cycle stress with minimal change in the cell Vth even after 2 million read cycles. Thyristor operation can be applied to storage products even in read-intensive applications. (5) We also describe storage performance, including read latency and bandwidth, for SLC and QLC mode in memory arrays with highly stacked WL of approximately 100 layers.

The antenna consists of three layers, two substrates with annular-ring patches and a parasitic metal patch. The antenna can radiate different patterns by exciting different modes of annular-ring micro-strip antenna (ARMSA). When port 1 is excited, the antenna is excited at the second-order mode(TM21) to generate the conical radiation pattern, whereas the antenna is excited at the fundamental mode(TM11) to generate the broad beam radiation pattern when port 2 is excited. In order to generate circular polarization, ARMSAs are fed by two feeding points and both of the annular-ring patches are fed with the network in the same layer. The two-port antenna achieves the broadband property by parasitic patch. The parasitic top metal layer can broaden the impedance bandwidth of TM11 mode while the ground plane of TM11 mode can act as the parasitic patch to broaden the impedance bandwidth of TM21 mode. To verify the design, the antenna is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the antenna proposed in this paper has an impedance bandwidth of 0.22GHz (1.92-2.14GHz) and 3dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of about 0.25GHz (1.90-2.15GHz).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3370031","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12203046); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10445230","Multi mode;circularly polarized antenna;pattern diversity","Broadband antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna measurements;Antennas;Substrates;Satellite communication;Satellite antennas;Pattern formation;Parasitic capacitance","","","","10","CCBYNCND","26 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Especially, based on cyclic voltammograms (CVs) obtained by electrochemical sensors, the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been widely attempted in the accurate quantification of drug concentrations, enabling the development of point-of-care and potentially system-level wearable devices. However, most of the work only considers the accuracy of how the predicted value is close to the actual value, which does not consider whether the predicted drug concentration is underestimated. In practical drug quantification, potential toxicity due to overexposure with underestimated quantification can lead to endangering the patient's body. Therefore, avoiding underestimating the concentration of drugs based on existing quantification models is required and necessary to optimize the conventional loss function at the output stage of ANN. In this letter, a novel loss function based on mean squared error (MSE), WeightedMSE, is proposed for avoiding underestimated quantification. It can be changed flexibly by adjusting parameters in order to adapt the acceptable overestimation range corresponding to the different types of drugs. A simulated dataset and a real dataset of etoposide and methotrexate are used as drug models, demonstrating that the proposed method can avoid underestimation in predicted values by over 98% in quantifying the concentration of multiple drugs and showing significant effectiveness for the development of point-of-care and wearable monitoring systems.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2024.3452009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10659106","Sensor applications;artificial neural network (ANN);cyclic voltammogram (CV);drug quantification;loss function;personalized therapy;therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)","Drugs;Feature extraction;Sensors;Vectors;Monitoring;Time division multiplexing;Sensor phenomena and characterization","","","","15","CCBYNCND","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This causes significant overhead for the channel estimation. We have proposed a channel prediction method to reduce the overhead using Gaussian process regression with spectral mixture kernel. In Gaussian process regression, the determination of the hyperparameters used to calculate the kernel matrix has a significant impact on prediction accuracy.

The superconducting coils as well as the connections in between are made of the same NbTi cable-in-conduit conductor (CICC) type. Two plasma breakdowns in the past have induced voltages into the non-planar coils, which triggered the quench detection (QD) system and activated the safety system with a fast discharge of the magnet system. Plasma operation creates toroidal and poloidal currents; a plasma breakdown can change the plasma currents within 100 ms. Especially fast poloidal current changes are able to induce voltages into the superconducting coils. Using the adjustment capabilities of the QD system, new parameter sets for threshold values and shunted capacitor settings were deduced. These parameters prolongs the time until the start of the magnet discharge, which increases the hot spot temperature in the CICC in case of a quench.

However, on the high permittivity environment, such as silicon substrates, the bandwidth dramatically reduced to below 100 GHz even if the voltage was raised to around 3 V. We break the voltage–bandwidth trade-off limit in TFLN modulators on silicon substrates using low inductance thick metal traveling wave electrodes, which reduce RF phase index and microwave losses while preserving high EO modulation efficiency. We demonstrate a TFLN EO modulator on silicon substrate with 3 dB EO bandwidth $>$ 120 GHz and half-wave voltage $(V_\pi) < $ 2 V.

RBFNN is used to estimate the inverse dynamic model of the piezoelectric actuator, and avoiding the difficult modeling and impossible to invert problems. This feedforward controller has model-free advantage that it does not depend on the specific physics-based model and is only data-driven by references and control signals. The parameters of RBFNN are training by offline methods and online learning strategy especially. The offline learning method can compensate the trained trajectory with high precision, but for the untrained trajectory, the compensation accuracy is insufficient. For unknown target trajectories, the online learning strategy is proposed, which utilizes current data for parameter iteration and updating to improve control accuracy. Finally, simulation verify that the proposed model-free feedforward control strategy is effective.

For the classification problem, we use the approximate location determined from this imaging method to recover spectral characteristics of the target over the system bandwidth. For the dispersive point target we use here, this spectrum corresponds to its radar cross-section (RCS). For a more general target, this recovered spectrum is a proxy for the frequency-dependence of the RCS averaged over angles spanning the synthetic aperture. The recovered spectrum is noisy and exhibits an overall scaling error due to modeling errors. Nonetheless, by smoothing and normalizing this recovered spectrum, we compare it with a library of pre-computed normalized spectra in a simple multi-class classification scheme. Numerical simulations in two dimensions validate this method and show that this spectral estimation method is effective for target classification.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2024.3521342","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-24-1-0196); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10811963","Ground-penetrating synthetic aperture radar;dispersive targets;Kirchhoff migration;radar cross-section spectrum;classification","Imaging;Dispersion;Apertures;Scattering;Frequency measurement;Soil;Dielectric constant;Atmospheric modeling;Synthetic aperture radar;Shape","","","","","CCBYNCND","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This article presents an algorithm that applies the RO radiometry to detect and monitor long-term variations of GNSS jamming power from a deeply occulted height (HSL = −140 km). At these heights, the RO signal amplitude is at its noise level because the GNSS transmitter is far behind the Earth shadow. Thus, any enhanced RO amplitudes from these heights are considered as a jamming signal. The algorithm was successfully applied to two conflict zones: Mediterranean Sea and Middle East and Central Africa, where the Global Position System (GPS) jamming was frequently used by state-sponsored electronic warfare. The time series of normalized RO amplitude in these regions show a steady increase of the GPS jamming power since 2017, but a sharp decrease since the start of Russo–Ukrainian War.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3385738","NASA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10496914","Global navigation satellite system (GNSS);jamming;radio occultation (RO);time series","Jamming;Global navigation satellite system;Signal to noise ratio;Global Positioning System;Atmospheric measurements;Receivers;Sea measurements","","","","18","CCBYNCND","11 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As approximating epipolar lines in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is difficult, conventional dense image matching (DIM) algorithms are unsuitable for these images. This study proposes a DIM algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) SAR images that does not require epipolar rectification. The proposed algorithm uses tie-point matching results to construct a search window for corresponding points and utilizes an improved DAISY descriptor incorporating the ratio of exponentially weighted averages (ROEWAs) operator for cost calculation, which suppresses errors caused by speckle noise. Cost aggregation was performed using computationally efficient superpixel segmentation and the guided filter (GF) algorithm, and the winner-takes-all (WTA) strategy was applied for dense matching. Finally, experiments were performed on six pairs of UAV SAR images containing different terrains and ground objects, and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.3 pixels was obtained, demonstrating that the proposed method is superior to conventional DIM algorithms and has excellent precision and accuracy.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2024.3372089","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42201492); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10456897","DAISY descriptor;dense matching;guided filter (GF);superpixel segmentation;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Costs;Radar polarimetry;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Synthetic aperture radar;Image segmentation;Optical filters;Vegetation mapping","","","","18","CCBYNCND","1 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurately and efficiently simulating sea clutter has important practical significance for radar signal processing and sea surface target detection. However, in traditional zero memory nonlinearity (ZMNL) method, the correlated Generalized compound distribution model cannot deal with non-integral or non-semi-integral parameter. In order to overcome this shortcoming, a new method of generating correlated Generalized compound distributed clutter is proposed, which changes the generation method of Generalized Gamma distributed random sequences in traditional Generalized compound distribution models. Firstly, by combining with the Gamma distribution and using the additivity of the Gamma distribution, the Probability Density Function (PDF) of Gamma function is transformed into a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation, and the Gamma distributed sequence under arbitrary parameter is solved. Then the Generalized Gamma distributed sequence with arbitrary parameter can be obtained through the nonlinear transformation relationship between the Generalized Gamma distribution and the Gamma distribution, so that the shape parameters of the Generalized compound distributed sea clutter are extended to general real numbers. Simulation results show that the proposed method is not only suitable for clutter simulation with non-integral or non-semi-integral shape parameter values, but also further improves the fitting degree.","1745-1345","","10.23919/transcom.2024EBP3032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10545330","clutter simulation;Generalized compound distribution model;Generalized Gamma distribution;Gamma distribution","Clutter;Compounds;Shape;Gamma distribution;Radar clutter;Random sequences;Probability density function","","","","23","","31 May 2024","","","IEICE","IEICE Journals"

To tackle the task allocation problem in WQMSNs and enhance network performance, this paper introduces a novel Chaotic Quantum Grey Wolf Algorithm (CQGWA). This algorithm incorporates a new chaotic operator and a quantum operator to optimize the task allocation of sensor nodes. The chaotic operators introduce randomness, helping to avoid local optima and enhancing the global search capability. Meanwhile, the quantum operators utilize quantum bit representation and quantum rotation gates to refresh the evolutionary search. They select predefined candidate solutions from the candidate states and seek the globally optimal predicted solution for a given objective function. Extensive simulation experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of CQGWA. The results demonstrate that compared to the traditional Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), the task allocation efficiency in WQMSNs optimized using CQGWA increases by at least 8.46%.

The grain boundary inside polysilicon acts as an energy barrier to the movement of carriers, and research on its passivation has been attempted. In this study, polysilicon passivation was performed using deuterium bonds (Si-D) instead of conventional hydrogen bonds (Si-H). To investigate the effect of the grain boundary density on passivation, polysilicon with three types of grain sizes was prepared. Annealing was performed at atmospheric and high pressure to increase the diffusion of deuterium into the film. The passivation characteristics of polysilicon were investigated based on the dark current, photocurrent, photo-to-dark current ratio (PDCR), and reliability of the fabricated devices. In the case of devices manufactured at atmospheric pressure, the PDCR was excellent among the devices, but showed low reliability after electrical stress. As the deuterium pressure increased, passivation of the grain boundaries progressed further. The potential height reduction due to the passivation of grain boundaries simultaneously increased the dark current and photocurrent of the device. Therefore, the performance factor, PDCR, did not improve significantly. However, durability evaluation confirmed that the reliability of the device was greatly improved. This means that passivation was maintained at the grain boundaries even during stress. Therefore, when manufacturing polysilicon-based photodetectors, deuterium annealing for the purpose of passivation can have a positive effect on the sensing operation of the device, and the annealing pressure should be selected considering the trade-off relationship between the performance and reliability of the device.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3478741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10714351","Polysilicon;photodetector;deuterium;grain boundary;passivation","Deuterium;Grain boundaries;Passivation;Annealing;Photodetectors;Photoconductivity;Performance evaluation;Dark current;Reliability;Grain size","","","","22","CCBYNCND","11 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a DE, the relative phase of the transmitted signal lights and the FWM light generated in the previous spans is shifted.

In order to provide secure services in an LPWA IoT environment, important information stored in IoT devices (encryption keys, device unique numbers, etc.) must be safely protected from external hacking or theft by physical access, and it is necessary to develop tamper-proof technology to enhance physical security. Meanwhile, with so many ruggedized IoT devices processing and transmitting sensitive information, security systems are essential to protect the integrity and privacy of IoT data.

The two armature winding concepts result in conceptual designs of a fully SC motor (FSCM) and a partially SC motor (PSCM), respectively. The specific power and power density of the conceptual designs are assessed by comparing them with aviation-oriented goals and with other reference motor concepts. The results show that the CRC SC winding concept for FSCMs can reach and even exceed the higher specific power goal of 25 kW/kg. The DLC copper winding concept for PSCMs is quite close to the lower specific power goal of 12.7 kW/kg.

In a TEG, the power generation varies owing to various ambiences, sources, and loads. These variables make it difficult to draw available power from the device, leading to poor utilization of the TEG. To overcome these drawbacks, maximum power tracking technique (MPPT) can be employed in TEG. A modified PEMPPT scheme is developed to track the maximum power point (MPP) when there is a change in the operating conditions, and is based on a parabolic curve of the power current characteristics of the TEG. The proposed algorithm is developed by considering two features. First, the reduction in tracking time by a sample compared with the PEMPPT algorithm by considering a new shifted point as the first duty. Second, the sign of the voltage is checked to limit the voltage, current, and power by applying the next duties close to the MPP. The proposed system is simulated and experimentally verified using a laboratory prototype. The simulation and experimental results show that the tracking time of the proposed algorithm is almost 3/4th of PEMPPT.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2024.000079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10557514","Thermoelectric generator;parabolic extrapolation;maximum power point tracking;duty ratio","Maximum power point trackers;Generators;Mathematical models;Voltage control;Voltage;Resistance;Temperature","","","","21","","13 Jun 2024","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Wind energy has especially increased demands for high-performance magnets because of the unique large power density and high conversion efficiency the powertrains require. Exciting new materials that meet these requirements include Nd/DyFeB, SmCo, and SmFeN-based permanent magnets. To reduce the waste of materials used in production, manufacturing techniques like compression molding are necessary. The work presented here compression molds a blend of Nd2Fe14B (NdFeB) and Sm2Fe17N3 (SmFeN) hybrid powders in a polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) polymer matrix over a 3-D printed iron silicon rotor. Vickers and nano-hardness is measured of both the polymer blend and as well as the steel rotor. Small piece of the inserted magnet has a measured energy product of 8.324 MGOe through a post magnetic field annealing.

For quantification, experiments based on multiple echoes with multiple local peaks are conducted using an electrical model generated from real situation.

Bipolar transistors based on crystalline rubrene exhibit high-speed operation in the GHz range and allow direct measurement of minority carrier diffusion.

This work exploits this methodology by introducing a sparse sensing (SS) technique to generate additional virtual SM, increasing the degrees of freedom (DoF) of AoA detection. It is demonstrated that SS with MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) and estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique algorithms can identify up to six uncorrelated sources with a five-port SM beamforming antenna, resulting in the number of simultaneously detected sources being greater than the number of ports used.

Software tests are a necessity in the development of software to secure functionality, reliability, and usability [10]; however, these tests are costly and time-consuming [6]. Although tool support for software testing has advanced, there remains considerable potential for enhancement. Many software tests are still devised manually, with the creation of unit tests being particularly laborious. Automating the generation of test cases is promising for streamlining this aspect of software testing [6].Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited capabilities in code generation [11, 13–15], test case generation [17], and various other domains [11]. The advancement of model performance of transformer-based LLMs is mainly achieved by expanding the model size in line with an increase in training data size [7, 8]. However, this approach leads to high computational costs which can only be afforded by corporations with significant financial resources. This highlights the need for transformer-based LLMs that perform well on a specific downstream task and are also cost-efficient. Addressing this, we focused on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of more resource-efficient transformer-based LLMs LLaMA 2 13B, Code Llama 13B, and Mistral 7B for the specific downstream task of generating test cases for mobile applications.","2833-9061","979-8-4007-0588-5","","Helmholtz Association; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10556388","Software Testing;Mobile Testing;Machine Learning;Large Language Models","Software testing;Codes;Computational modeling;Training data;Transformers;Software;Data models","","","","17","CCBY","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, a sparse ISAR imaging method based on the modified reweighted atomic norm (MRAM) was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the atomic representation model of ISAR signal was built, and utilizing the semi-definite property of atomic norm to transform the problem of minimizing atomic norm into a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. Subsequently, a new non-convex surrogate function was introduced to reduce the number of iterations of the RAM method. Secondly, to swiftly handle SDP problem, the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) was used. Finally, Vandermonde decomposition was used to obtain amplitude and frequency information of scattering points, and imaging was completed through fast Fourier transform.

For this, they perform adaptation actions which have an effect on the objectives. But, this effect is not reached immediately. Instead, there is a latency between performing an adaptation action and the effect on the objective. In this paper, we present an exemplar which allows to investigate this latency of adaptation actions for a remote data mirroring system (RDMs) based on a previous exemplar, which wasn't latency-aware. The purpose of an RDM is to replicate a data package among multiple locations (called mirrors) to protect against data loss and unavailability.

In particular, with the emergence of technologies such as WebGL and WebGPU, which enable real-time 3D content rendering in web browsers, immersive experiences and interactions on the web have been significantly enhanced. These technologies are widely used in applications such as 3D visualization of virtual products or 3D exploration of building interiors on real estate websites. Through these advancements, users can experience 3D content directly in their browsers without the need to install additional software, greatly expanding the possibilities of the web. Amidst this trend, the neural radiance field (NeRF) has garnered attention as a cutting-edge technology that improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction and rendering. NeRF is a technique widely used in computer vision and graphics for reconstructing 3D spaces from 2D images taken from multiple viewpoints. By predicting the color and density of each pixel, NeRF captures the complex 3D structure and optical properties of a scene, enabling highly accurate 3D reconstructions. However, NeRF's primary limitation is the time-consuming nature of both the training and inference processes. Research efforts to address this issue have focused on two key areas: optimizing network architectures and training procedures to accelerate scene learning, and improving inference speed for faster rendering. While progress has been made in enhancing training speed, challenges remain in improving the inference process. To address these limitations, we propose a two-step approach to significantly improve NeRF's performance. First, we optimize the training phase through a multi-resolution hash encoding technique, reducing the computational complexity and speeding up the learning process. Second, we accelerate the inference phase by caching the input data of the NeRF MLP, which allows for faster rendering without sacrificing quality. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach reduces training time by 68.42% and increases inference speed by 98.18%.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2376","Hoseo University(grant numbers:20210481); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10815716","Neural radiance field;multiresolution hash encoding;3D reconstruction;cache","Training;Three-dimensional displays;Accuracy;Neural radiance field;Rendering (computer graphics);Optical imaging;Market research;Real-time systems;Browsers;Image reconstruction","","","","15","","25 Dec 2024","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

However, compared to single-view segmentation, these multi-view methods that directly fuse all features face inferior real-time performance and higher computation costs. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-view-assisted semantic segmentation network via multi-level mutual learning knowledge distillation (KD) to implement a high real-time and accurate semantic segmentation at a lower cost. The keys of the multi-level mutual learning-based KD strategy are intra-view mutual learning and inter-view mutual learning. To accelerate the computation and improve accuracy, we also introduce a two-step fusion strategy to fuse features hierarchically. Finally, we evaluated our approach on the SemanticKITTI dataset.

Such data protection has become even more important since the European Union rolled out the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since app developers are not legal experts, they find it difficult to write privacy-aware source code. Moreover, they have limited tool support to reason about data protection throughout their app development process. This paper motivates the need for a static analysis approach to diagnose and explain data protection in Android apps. The analysis will recognize personal data sources in the source code, and aims to further examine the data flow originating from these sources. App developers can then address key questions about data manipulation, derived data, and the presence of technical measures. Despite challenges, we explore to what extent one can realize this analysis through static taint analysis, a common method for identifying security vulnerabilities. This is a first step towards designing a tool-based approach that aids app developers and assessors in ensuring data protection in Android apps, based on automated static program analysis.

A bulk current path, via two serially connected n-p-n transistors, comprising buried layers (BLs) gives rise to a high-voltage I–V (HV-IV) branch. The sharp snapback is caused by a sudden jump of the current path from the bulk to surface region, thus activating the SCR.

"nvshare: Practical GPU Sharing Without Memory Size Constraints","G. Alexopoulos; D. Mitropoulos","University of Athens and National Infrastructures for Research and Technology, Greece; University of Athens and National Infrastructures for Research and Technology, Greece",2024 IEEE/ACM 46th International Conference on Software Engineering: Companion Proceedings (ICSE-Companion),"20 Jun 2024","2024","","","16","20","GPUs are essential for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) work-loads. A common practice is deploying ML jobs as containers managed by an orchestrator such as Kubernetes. Kubernetes schedules GPU workloads by exclusively assigning a device to a single job, which leads to massive GPU underutilization, especially for interactive development jobs with significant idle periods. Current GPU sharing approaches assign a fraction of GPU memory to each co-located job to avoid memory contention and out-of-memory errors. However, this is impractical, as it requires a priori knowledge of memory usage and does not fully address GPU underutilization. We propose nvshare, which transparently enables page faults (i.e., exceptions that are raised when an entity attempts to access a resource) to allow virtual GPU memory oversubscription. In this way we permit each application to utilize the entire physical GPU memory (Video RAM). To prevent thrashing (a situation in which page faults dominate execution time) in a reliable manner, nvshare serializes overlapping GPU bursts from different applications. We compared nvshare with KubeShare, a state-of-the-art GPU sharing solution. Our results indicate that both perform equally well in conventional sharing cases where total GPU memory usage fits into VRAM. For memory oversubscription scenarios, which KubeShare does not support, nvshare outperforms the sequential execution baseline by up to 1.35x.

Consequently, significant two-dimensional (2D) interference emerges, encompassing inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-track interference (ITI) along the cross- and down-tracks, respectively. To address the 2D interference, modulation with non-isolated patterns can be employed to mitigate the interference from neighboring bits. In previous studies, authors relied on the Hamming code to propose a non-isolated modulation code with a minimum Hamming distance (MHD) of 3. However, for encoding, authors utilized a mapping method with a large look-up table, resulting in prolonged delay for the decoder. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a generator matrix for creating the Hamming code with an MHD of 3, thereby generating reverse codewords in the look-up table. Consequently, only half of the look-up table needs to be stored, leading to reduced complexity and delay time in the decoder for non-isolated modulation code with an MHD of 3. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed model can enhance bit error rate performance and decrease delay time compared to previous studies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3445975","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant; Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2021R1A2C1011154); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639394","Bit-patterned media recording (BPMR);error correction codes (ECCs);Hamming code;modulation coding;non-isolated pattern","Codes;Magnetohydrodynamics;Interference;Modulation;Table lookup;Decoding;Generators;Error correction codes","","","","17","CCBYNCND","19 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A robust link-adaptation method is presented based on the measured signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the URLLC user, which varies between the time when interference power is measured and the time of payload transmission. We obtain the statistical distribution of the change of SINRs between two consecutive time slots and devise backoff methods guaranteeing the reliability of transmissions against flashlight interference. We derive the average transmission rate over Rayleigh fading channels in the considered system model. We observe that in the presence of flashlight interference, a strict reliability requirement reduces the transmission rate to a small fraction of the best effort service rate. When increasing the number of antennas at both the serving and interfering transmitters, the increase in array gain is partially compromised by the increased backoff needed to guarantee reliability.

Heat exchangers, essential to this sector, suffer efficiency losses and increased energy consumption due to fouling. To ensure optimal operation of heat exchange systems, regular assessment of solid deposits and the implementation of cleaning schedules are imperative. However, the multitude of influencing factors renders traditional estimation methods unreliable. Consequently, we developed a stacking model to predict the fouling factor of heat exchangers. Specifically, we first constructed fouling factor prediction models using various machine learning techniques, then selected the best-performing models random forest, extreme gradient boosting , and light gradient boosting machine for integration. Finally, the predictions from these three models were fed into a linear regression layer to form the final stacking model. The results indicate that the constructed stacking model significantly enhances the accuracy of fouling factor prediction. This model not only surpasses traditional multilayer perceptron neural network methods but also outperforms the well-performing gaussian process regression. This achievement not only validates the effectiveness of our model but also provides robust support for future research and applications in related fields.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2024.10670205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10670205","Fouling Factor Prediction;Heat Exchanger Fouling;Stacking Model","Data models;Analytical models;Random forests;Fluids;Regression tree analysis;Temperature;Predictive models","","","","","IEEE","10 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic idea is to use fixed toroidal magnets, producing an axis-symmetric (or periodical axis-symmetric) field configuration that can bend beams from several directions onto the patient location. In principle, neither magnets nor patient need to be moved. In addition, the field of the magnets of this toroidal gantry is static. Such system is perfectly adapted to FLASH therapy, a novel method of beam dose delivery that has shown benefits for electrons and potential for hadrons. In this paper we describe the magnetic design of a “compact GaToroid”, which could be built with iron-dominated magnets, suitable for 200 MeV electron beams, as well as protons at 70 MeV. The gantry profits from the use of toroidal quadrupoles, which greatly simplify the beam transmission. An additional novelty is the use of a resonant kicker as the vector magnet. Starting from the requirements for beam transmission, we derive first the magnet main characteristics (strength, aperture, size and mass) and report the detailed magnetic field calculations in support of the design.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3379970","CERN Budget for Knowledge Transfer to Medical Applications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10477573","Particle therapy;hadron therapy;gantry;FLASH effect","Magnets;Structural beams;Medical treatment;Bending;Apertures;Toroidal magnetic fields;Protons","","","","16","CCBYNCND","21 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The conventional proposal method adopted a circularly polarized antenna as the primary radiator to accommodate the polarization rotation of the antenna. However, this method had the issue of angle dependency in the angular profile. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a measurement method that uses an orthogonally polarized antenna as the primary radiator of a rotating reflector antenna for rotational measurements, and processes the acquired data offline. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, a demonstration experiment is conducted in an anechoic chamber, and it is shown that an angular profile with less angular dependence can be obtained than using a circularly polarized antenna as the primary radiator.

Moreover, ensuring the network's survivability is a critical issue. While the MPLS-TP (multi-protocol label switching-transport profile) defines various protection and recovery mechanisms as standards, it does not address methods for calculating and selecting protection and recovery paths. Therefore, an algorithm is needed to calculate and set up paths to ensure quick protection and recovery across the entire integrated network, minimizing conflicts in protection and recovery at the packet optical integrated network level. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm that calculates and sets a path that enables rapid protection and recovery in an MPLS-TP network composed of a multi-ring-mesh topology. To this end, this study proposes the concept of a transparent node (T-node) for calculating link-disjoint SPF (shortest path first) in a multi-ring network with dual or more rings. A T-node is a node in a ring with more than a dual ring and indicates that the node has been used once in route calculation. Therefore, during path calculation, a T-node can be used as a source node and an intermediate node but not as a destination node.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2364","Namseoul University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10747169","MPLS-TP;protection and recovery;optimal path calculation","Integrated optics;Network topology;Optical switches;Optical fiber networks;Topology;Reliability;Protection;Standards;Optical packet switching","","","","11","","7 Nov 2024","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

This inaccurate knowledge can lead to foot-end position errors and ultimately affect precise state estimation and control. Directing against this issue, this paper introduces the concept of a virtual fixed base and designs a non-redundant parameter identification method. The virtual fixed base is established by 4 marking points on the body, determining a hypothetical coordinate system, which is used to solve the hand-eye calibration problem of quadruped robots. This study provides the overall process of the kinematic parameter identification method. Simulation and experiment results show that the identified kinematic parameters converge to their actual value and the foot-end position accuracy is improved by over 80% after parameter compensation.","2997-6278","979-8-3503-5030-2","10.1109/CACRE62362.2024.10635029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10635029","Kinematic parameter identification;Quadruped robots;Virtual fixed base;Hand-eye calibration;Least square method","Legged locomotion;Parameter estimation;Accuracy;Robot kinematics;Simulation;Kinematics;Machining","","","","21","IEEE","23 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To assess the usefulness of CR comments, we augment traditional ‘textual’ features and pre-trained embeddings with ‘emoji-specific’ features and pre-trained embeddings. To fortify our inquiry, we expand an existing dataset with emoji annotations, guided by existing research on GitHub emoji usage, and re-evaluate the CR comments accordingly. Our models, which incorporate textual and emoji-based sentiment features and semantic understandings of emojis, substantially outperform baseline metrics. The often-overlooked emoji elements in CR comments emerge as key indicators of usefulness, suggesting that these symbols carry significant weight.

In this case, it is necessary to consider the effects of the increase in stray capacitance between the primary and secondary windings of the transformer. This paper describes the influence of the loss due to the capacitance generated between the transformer windings when a noise filter is connected to the LLC converter.

To improve the voltage response of traditional linear active disturbance rejection voltage regulators in noisy environments, a voltage control method based on cascaded linear active disturbance rejection controllers is proposed. A low-pass filter is often used to filter noise in bus voltage signals, resulting in phase and amplitude losses. Therefore, in the proposed method, the output and filtering losses of the low-pass filter are defined as new system state variables. Subsequently, a cascaded linear active disturbance rejection controller is introduced to estimate the system state variables and compensate for filtering loss. Compared to the traditional linear active disturbance rejection voltage controller, the proposed method can effectively shorten the voltage recovery time and improve the anti-interference performance. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2024.000066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10557516","Active disturbance rejection control;filter;dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous generator;bus voltage","Noise;Voltage control;Low-pass filters;Switches;Noise measurement;Vectors;Rectifiers","","","","27","","13 Jun 2024","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Although SQL injections have been known for many years, they are still one of the top security vulnerabilities. For example, in 2022 more than 1000 CVEs related to SQL injection were reported. We propose a runtime application protection approach that infers and constrains the information that can be disclosed by database-backed applications.

In our previous studies, we demonstrated that arc-faults in AC systems differ from those in DC systems because in an AC system the arc itself is not a gap-jumping electrical arc between two conductors but rather an advanced glowing connection state that occurs exclusively in copper-based connections. In the present study, we improved upon our AC arc-fault generation simulation in MATLAB, matching our previous findings. The arc-fault simulation in MATLAB replicated the exact waveform exhibited in an actual AC arc-fault environment. Therefore, we concluded that the phenomenon likely followed the mechanism we proposed in our previous research. We have also detected the phenomenon by using a method we devised in our previous research and refined it to match the mechanism derived from our present findings. The simulation results for our detection method revealed that to obtain the best detection accuracy, the magnetic core of the inductor/current transformer must have low coercivity and may not be saturated before the current waveform has shifted to another polarity. This detection method may yield a greater ratio of accuracy to manufacturing cost given that the main component does not include a high-frequency circuit analyzer.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2023.3324637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10286113","Arc discharges;circuit simulation;contacts;electrical fault detection;magnetic cores;sparks;surface discharges;transformer cores","Resistance;Voltage;Mathematical models;Current transformers;Generators;Low voltage;Integrated circuit modeling","","","","27","CCBY","16 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of reflecting the out-of-band signal back to the source, the proposed antenna array dissipates the energy through a lossy network, which can reduce the interference to the former stage. The prototype circuit of the reflectionless filtering antenna array based on the complementary duplex theory is established, consisting of a bandpass network and a bandstop network, whose responses are completely complementary. High selectivity is achieved by introducing non-resonating nodes (NRNs) and configuring the transmission zeros (TZs) of the bandpass network and the reflection zeros (RZs) of the bandstop network to be set at the same frequency. The synthesis of the prototype circuit is given and a fourth-order reflectionless filtering antenna array is designed and fabricated to verify the design method. Two TZs are generated at 9.62 GHz and 10.4 GHz, leading to an out-of-band suppression of more than 23 dB. The measured |S11| is less than -10 dB from 8.3 GHz to 12 GHz, providing a wideband reflectionless filtering response with high selectivity and high gain.","2637-6431","","10.1109/OJAP.2024.3470843","Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022A0505050010); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2024A1515011615); National Funded Postdoctoral Program of China(grant numbers:GZB20230226); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M741206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10700742","Bandstop filter (BSF);compact;non-resonating nodes (NRNs);reflectionless filtering antenna array;waveguide antenna array","Antenna arrays;Reflector antennas;Filtering;Q-factor;Couplings;Band-pass filters;Filtering theory;Resonant frequency;Reflection;Power harmonic filters","","","","","CCBYNCND","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the problem of mutual interference between automotive radar signals is becoming a non negligible threat. Mutual interference can cause a significant performance decrease of radar target detection, and this artide proposes a simple and efficient target detection method to address this issue. The proposed method utilizes the distribution difference between target echoes and interference signals in the time-frequency domain to obtain a accumulation vector of spectral peaks, which follow a Poisson distribution. Based on that, the Poisson constant false alarm detection method is proposed to detect target echos effectively at low signal-to-interference ratios. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the method is above 95% when the signal-to-interference ratio is below -20dB. In addition, this algorithm does not require interference compression before detecting the target, and its computational complexity is only slightly greater than that of the short time Fourier transform, so it is a fast anti interference detection method.","2187-0136","","10.23919/comex.2023XBL0118","Shandong Provincial Department of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2022TSGC2091); Key research and development program of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2021JMRH0108); Major Innovation Project of Qilu University of Technology(grant numbers:2022JBZ02-02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355753","target detection;automotive radar;mutual interference","Radar;Interference;Time-frequency analysis;Radar detection;Frequency modulation;Object detection;Automotive engineering","","","","19","","12 Dec 2023","","","IEICE","IEICE Journals"

Three adjacent potential wells form a linearly repeating array structure, forming a nano-optical conveyor belt.

Previous studies have investigated the use of a multi-segment wires with sharp conductivity changes to mitigate this RF coupling. However, past work in this area has evaluated stripline and straight cylindrical geometries. Clinical lead designs often use helical wrapping for internal conductors for improved fatigue resistance. In this study we assessed the applicability of the multi-segment lead design with a helical structure at 1.5 T to better assess the potential heating reduction with a more clinically relevant geometry.

The FSRP element consists of an upper indium tin oxide layer printed on polyethylene glycol terephthalate substrate, a metallic loop, and a metallic patch in the middle and bottom layer, respectively, which is designed to absorb most of out-of-band incidence while achieving in-band reflection. The bottom metallic patch is a partially reflected surface which is utilized to construct an FP resonant cavity with the reflective metasurface to ensure in-band radiation. The excellent performance of proposed FP antenna is demonstrated by simulations and measurements, revealing that the antenna exhibits an in-band peak measured gain of 21.8 dBiC at 12 GHz. Besides, a significant out-of-band scattering reduction is achieved within 9.9-11.3 GHz and 13.3-20 GHz under normal detection.

This involves using more power and designing larger magnetizing yokes to reduce heat generation through compensatory design.

However, these fragments, being incomplete, frequently lack details on exception handling. Integrating exception handling into a codebase is not a straightforward task, requiring developers to understand and remember which API methods may trigger exceptions and which exceptions should be handled. To address that, we introduce EHBLOCK, a learning-based exception handling recommender for Java code snippets. EHBLOCK analyzes a given code snippet and suggests whether a try-catch block is necessary. It employs a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) to learn exception handling from complete code. R-GCN considers program dependencies in the surrounding context, allowing EHBLOCK to learn the identities of APIs and their relations with corresponding exception types that need to be handled.

This enables a new principle for externally observable force sensors, in contrast to traditional force detection that relies on contact-based displacement measurements. Among the sensors that estimate force from visual inputs, those using machine learning methods based on experimentally generated data have the possibility to outperform other visual sensors. However, the existing models have very limited applicability due to their low adaptability to environmental changes and their capacity for only single-point estimation. Therefore, in this letter, the authors propose and verify a method that can flexibly respond to environmental changes and estimate force at multiple points in three dimensions. The authors conducted a demonstration experiment and confirmed that estimation was possible with an error of approximately 20%. Observation-type force sensors are expected to enable a variety of applications that are difficult to achieve with conventional sensors, such as sensing people in living environments and the development of sensing robots.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2024.3423656","Japan Science and Technology Agency(grant numbers:JPMJPF-2101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10587072","Sensor applications;convolutional neural network;deep learning;force sensor;image processing;vision sensor","Sensors;Force;Shape;Deformation;Training;Robot sensing systems;Force sensors","","","","24","CCBYNCND","5 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this need, we propose Security Annotations, which can be added to any codebase regardless of programming language and allows linking blocks of code, functions, or single statements with assets. In order to use the main functionality of the Security Annotations an asset catalog of sufficient quality is needed. These assets can either be identified upfront or while annotating. We conducted a preliminary evaluation in which four pairs of developers created an asset catalog for a legacy software system and then annotated the code using Security Annotations.

The complex impedance of one HL-LHC recombination dipole magnet was recently measured at the CERN magnet test facility. Moreover, to mimic an inter-turn short in the coils, resistances at warm were connected externally to the voltage taps and the complex impedance of the magnet was measured. The acquired measurements are used to validate a developed lumped-element network model, reproducing the electromagnetic behaviour of the HL-LHC recombination dipole magnet in the frequency domain. The simulation results are compared to the measurements without artificial short circuits and are in good agreement up to a frequency of 10 kHz. The simulated effects of short circuits across a few turns in the frequency domain are compared to the measurements performed on the magnet. Since good agreement between measurements and simulations was obtained, these models can be used to predict the electromagnetic effects of any inter-turn short in the HL-LHC recombination dipole magnet or similar types of accelerator magnets.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3520079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807401","Accelerator magnet;Superconducting coil;Fault diagnostics;Frequency-domain;Impedance measurements;AC-loss","Superconducting magnets;Impedance;Coils;Impedance measurement;Electrical resistance measurement;Magnetic domains;Apertures;Voltage measurement;Circuits;Magnetomechanical effects","","","","","CCBY","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This article discusses the gate ringing behavior under different operating conditions for the first time and examines the fundamental causes of the differences. Through double pulse test and five-contact mixed-mode simulations, it was confirmed that gate ringing becomes more severe at higher currents and weaker at higher temperatures. This can be attributed to the variation in plateau voltage under different operating conditions, which affects the switching speed of the device. Consequently, this indicates a difference in source current rating ( $\textit {dI}_{\text {S}}$ /dt), leading to variations in gate ringing. In addition, the influence of  ${C}_{\text {GD}}$  as a damper on gate ringing was compared, as it could cause differences in gate ringing. However, it was confirmed that, in practice,  ${C}_{\text {GD}}$  does not dominantly influence the variations in gate ringing behavior with respect to operating current and temperature.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2024.3474617","Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of Republic of Korea(grant numbers:20224000000320,20224000000100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10720929","Dynamic capacitance;gate ringing;inductive switching;MOSFET;silicon carbide (SiC)","Logic gates;Switches;Silicon carbide;MOSFET;Capacitance;Temperature measurement;Current measurement;Inductance;Discharges (electric);Turning","","","","12","CCBY","17 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, flux density model with phase angle characteristics is derived, and the relationship of the cogging torque and magnetic field harmonic is analyzed using energy method. Then, based on the magnetic modulation mechanism, the impact of the phase angle and magnetic field harmonics on the coupling relationship among cogging torque components is analyzed. All cogging torque components are classified as a combination of multiple positive and negative harmonic components, and the contribution characteristics of the components are determined by the harmonic combination and phase angle characteristics. Based on the finite element model (FEM), the magnetic field modulation model of the cogging torque is proved. On the basis of the conclusions obtained, it is further explained that the suppression mechanism of rotor-step skewing is a mutual complementary effect of the positive components and negative cogging components, and the main harmonic is effectively offset by selecting the seasonable of segment number and skewed angle of rotor.

These generated pieces are then transmitted separately to the destination through the parallel sub-channels of the MIMO communication link. The secret-sharing method ensures that the transmitted information remains unrevealed unless all the divided pieces are obtained, thus achieving secure communication by establishing an advantageous situation for the legitimate receiver to gather the divided pieces against wiretappers in the surrounding area. Computer simulations demonstrate that allocating transmission power inverse-proportionally to the channel gains among the MIMO sub-channels creates a secure link to the receiver from the channel capacity perspective.

Notably, the positive shift in threshold voltage diminished and eventually reversed at low gate bias as the temperature increased. In contrast, the negative shift intensified with increasing temperature but began to mitigate above 100°C at high gate bias due to an enhanced de-trapping process of electrons and holes. These results suggest the presence of multiple mechanisms behind the threshold voltage instability under varying thermal conditions.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2024.3436820","Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology(grant numbers:P0020966); National Research Foundation(grant numbers:2015R1A6A1A03031833,2022M3I8A1077243); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10620298","p-GaN gate HEMTs;threshold voltage instability;positive bias temperature instability (PBTI);temperature dependence;trapping;de-trapping","Logic gates;Threshold voltage;Temperature measurement;Stress;MODFETs;HEMTs;Electron traps","","","","31","CCBY","1 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A comprehensive gate lifetime model, based on the I.I mechanism, was developed to quantitatively model the voltage and temperature dependence of mean-time-to-fail (MTTF). Two distinct activation energies (Ea) were observed across different temperature ranges. At lower temperatures, the temperature dependent MTTF is primarily influenced by the temperature dependence of I.I. coefficients, resulting in a negative Ea. At higher temperatures, thermionic emission (TE) becomes the dominant conduction mechanism for the gate leakage current (IG). Consequently, IG increases exponentially with temperature, leading to considerably more hot electrons within the depleted pGaN gate layer, which accelerates the I.I. failure process. Therefore, the temperature dependence of IG dominates over the effect of I.I. coefficients, yielding a positive Ea at elevated temperatures.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2024.3516086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10795126","Gate Reliability;Lifetime Modeling;Schottky-type pGaN Gate;GaN HEMTs","Logic gates;Temperature measurement;Temperature dependence;HEMTs;Wide band gap semiconductors;MODFETs;Electrons;Aluminum gallium nitride;Temperature distribution;Impact ionization","","","","","CCBY","12 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Utilizing characteristic mode (CM) analysis, this paper presents a five-patch substrate integrated suspended line (SISL) antenna with suppressed unwanted higher-order modes, and achieves an enhanced bandwidth by using differential multi-point feeding (MPF) systems. Compared to single-point feeding systems, the proposed dual-polarized SISL antenna with the MPF system demonstrates a bandwidth 1.87 times wider. The novel SISL feeding system incorporates two pairs of differentially-fed branch line feed structures.

The closed-form formulas are derived to extract the TLIN parameters with a low complexity.

In situations where humans are entangled in such conflicts without proper explanation, they experience frustration. The consideration of the human’s frustration level in such scenarios therefore is a key aspect of solving these conflicts. Our approach involves synthesizing an appropriate supervisory control system (SCS) within a gaming context. The main focus of this paper is to seamlessly blend a SCS with conflict resolution capabilities, capitalizing on the explanatory potential. The central objective is to explore how this integration can be accomplished by employing the SCS as a game master or as a moderator within a game-theoretic framework. In this capacity, the system becomes a central authority equipped with comprehensive information relevant to the game, possessing the knowledge and insights required to navigate intricate scenarios. Employing a game-theoretic approach allows us to harness the system’s in-depth understanding of the game’s dynamics to strategically resolve conflicts and optimize outcomes. The game master utilises an explanation model designed to provide understandable and situationally aware explanations, effectively mitigating frustration levels for humans involved in the process.CCS CONCEPTS • Theory of computation→Algorithmic game theory; • Humancentered computing→User models; • Computing methodologies→ Modeling methodologies.","","979-8-4007-0596-0","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10734513","Game Theory;Explanations;User Models;Frustration Models;Explanation Game;Game Master","Navigation;Computational modeling;Scalability;Games;Supervisory control;User experience;Vehicle dynamics;Game theory;Distributed algorithms;Context modeling","","","","23","CCBY","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, incorporating the developed SPFSC into a barrier function, based on the disturbance observer and the barrier function, a proportional-derivative controller with specified performance is proposed for position stabilization of Lagrange systems such that the position stabilization error settles within a specified tolerance error band in a specified settling time. Therein, the problem that the bandwidth of the controller approaches infinity when the time approaches the specified settling time is solved due to the SPFSC-incorporated barrier function being injected into the position stabilization controller as its bandwidth and properly choosing the parameters of the SPFSC.

We study signal processing for estimating angular velocity directly by radar. First, we describe the signal model. In addition, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to show the feasibility of angular velocity estimation. Furthermore, a method for estimating angular velocity is proposed in which the angular velocity is obtained by capturing the variations in the angular spectrum after noise reduction for signals represented in two dimensions: array and slow time. Specifically, we focus the signal with a frequency transform in the slow-time direction, insert zeros outside the focused target, and perform an inverse frequency transformation to obtain the signal with less noise. In the array direction, zeros are inserted on both sides, frequency transform is carried out, and interpolation is performed to capture the time variation to the azimuth angle. The angular velocity is obtained by evaluating the captured angular change using the least-squares method. Evaluation results show that angular velocity estimation performance improves with more antennas and higher signal-to-noise power ratio. When inserting zeroes, the appropriate length of target extraction can mitigate the adverse effects of noise and the Gibbs phenomenon. However, the angular velocity estimation performance of the proposed method deviates from that of the CRLB and requires improvement.","1745-1345","","10.23919/transcom.2024EBP3120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10772390","Angular velocity;CRLB;antenna array;pulse Doppler radar","Angular velocity;Radar antennas;Estimation;Antenna arrays;Vectors;Doppler radar;Antennas;Azimuth;Accuracy;Target tracking","","","","","","2 Dec 2024","","","IEICE","IEICE Early Access Articles"

The magnet cross-section features an innovative design with asymmetric elements and effective stress-management. Thanks to the asymmetric design narrow pole racetrack coils are not required in proximity of the magnet apertures to improve the field quality. Its magnetic design achieves adequate margin with respect to the short-sample limit while utilizing two available cables. This choice accelerates the completion of the 0.8 m long demonstrator magnet, but limits the flexibility of the conductor grading and makes the magnet quench protection more challenging. In this contribution, the strategy to limit the hot-spot temperature and peak voltage to ground reached in the magnet conductor after a quench is discussed. The electro-magnetic and thermal transients occurring during a quench discharge are simulated with the STEAM-LEDET program. Quench detection based on differential-voltage monitoring is proposed, and the expected quench detection times are evaluated in the case of quenches occurring in different coil locations. Furthermore, the performances of various quench protection systems, including energy-extraction based either on a resistor or a varistor, a CLIQ (Coupling-Loss Induced Quench) system, or combinations of these are assessed. It is shown that while energy-extraction is a viable option to protect the magnet, acceptable performance can be achieved with CLIQ while achieving a significantly lower peak voltage to ground.

In this work, we employ a streamlined in-house two-dimensional ray-tracing model to design dielectric lenses, with the goal of enhancing the gain of an array antenna at large scanning angles. The ray-tracing model also accounts for losses from material absorption and reflections. The interfaces between the dielectric layers of these lenses devised in this study are defined using splines to allow a large flexibility of their shape. First, dielectric lenses consisting of a core layer supplemented by two matching layers are investigated. The results show better performance compared to the lens constructed using the conic equation. In addition, multilayer dielectric lenses also provide more flexibility, as proved by the proposed configuration with five layers which also minimizes reflections in the optimized direction. Finally, a nonuniform multilayer lens, featuring two layers on the sides and a single layer near to broadside can improve gain at $60^\circ$ while maintaining efficiency at smaller angles.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2024.3507178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10769008","Array antennas;dielectric lens;multilayer lens;ray tracing","Lenses;Dielectrics;Antenna arrays;Splines (mathematics);Antenna radiation patterns;Nonhomogeneous media;Reflection;Ray tracing;Directive antennas;Phased arrays","","","","","CCBY","27 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, previous studies have simplified the model of the interfering system, which is different from the real environment. In wireless communications, fluctuations in received power occur due to shadowing caused by the location and the surrounding environment. Previous studies have not clarified the effect of received power fluctuation due to shadowing on observing the occupancy rate.

There is no accepted choice criterion for how to choose appropriate process parameters in the slot milling. In this study, a milling force test system was set up, and the spindle speed, tool diameters, milling depth, number of tool teeth, and machining characteristics of the workpiece were taken as test factors in the slot milling. It is revealed that the identifications of the cutting force coefficient decrease with the increase of the tool speed, but are correlated with the tool diameter positively. While the dynamic cutting force increases with intensified milling depth, a larger milling depth may lead to an expansion of the contact area between the tool and the workpiece. Also, more workpiece material is removed simultaneously, and the milling depth and the number of tool teeth have almost no effect on the identifications. In addition, it is also found that materials with better milling performance, such as aluminum alloy, exhibit larger identification errors, which may be related to the “sticky knife” phenomenon during the process, compared with difficult-to-machine materials. The findings can provide a good reference for cutting force coefficient identification test.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3428534","Suzhou Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project, China(grant numbers:SNG2021038); Major Basic Research Project of Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, China(grant numbers:21KJD460008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10599187","Cutting force coefficient;milling force calculation;process parameter;slot milling","Force;Milling;Dynamics;Force measurement;Feeds;Mathematical models;Sensors;Machining","","","","30","CCBY","15 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method greedily generates the rule with maximal marginal gain and uses an efficient minorize-maximization (MM) approach to select rules iteratively, maximizing a non-monotone submodular lower bound. Compared with existing fault localization algorithms, our algorithm can adapt to the imbalanced fault scenario of change service, and provide interpretable fault causes which are easy to understand and verify.

The novel modular CanBot developed in this research represents a unique design framework whereby mobility aspects of the vehicle form discrete and interchangeable modules. Initial characterization of the locomotion capabilities of these modules were determined independently using an optical Motion Capture system.

We utilize short-time Fourier transform in conjunction with deep learning models designed for spectrograms to estimate arterial diameter trends. We train the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network with Attention (CRNN-A) and Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) to provide scaled trend estimates in increments of 1, 2, or 4 seconds (s). We present an algorithm for Arterial ReScaling (AReS) that utilizes scaled trend predictions to fill in missing arterial diameter data at 1, 2 or 4 s increments. The CRNN-A model trained on 1 s lengths performed best at predicting scaled trends (R2 = 0.8083). However, when implementing AReS, the AST model trained on 2 s segments performed best at predicting the shortest gaps (1 s) in arterial diameter data (MAE: 0.0341 mm). Our study showcases that training to predict longer time segments can be beneficial in real-world performance, even if standardized metrics show otherwise.Clinical Relevance— In cases where an arterial ultrasound image becomes temporarily lost or inaccessible, the spectral Doppler signal can be used to estimate changes in the arterial diameter, offering continuous data.

In this study, we address the issue of reducing power consumption in access networks by tackling surplus power. Our approach involves utilizing three different types of Reed-Solomon (RS) decoders to apply appropriate forward error correction (FEC) redundancy based on transmission distance, aiming to lower power consumption of RS decoders in optical network units (ONUs).

In applications where determinism and timing are crucial, a clear and well-defined approach to deterministic dynamism is much needed, but inherently difficult to define. This work gives dynamism deterministic semantics, thus enabling precise and repeatable behavior. To this end, we select the Lingua Franca (LF) coordination language that is based on the reactor model, and introduce dynamism to the distributed LF programs, referred to as federations.

Therefore, if the training samples used to calculate the weight vector does not contain the jamming, then the jamming cannot be removed by adaptive spatial filtering. If the weight vector is constantly updated in the range dimension, the training data may contain target echo signals, resulting in signal cancellation effect. To cope with the situation that the training samples are contaminated by target signal, an iterative training sample selection method based on non-homogeneous detector (NHD) is proposed in this paper for updating the weight vector in entire range dimension.

It employs two hybrid-structure substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) triplets, which show completely inverse transfer responses under the same conditions of inductive cross coupling. The first meander-line-based triplet is able to produce a transmission zero (TZ) above the passband. Whereas the second SIW triplet,which is composed by a composite right/left-handed (CRLH) resonator, creates a TZ below the passband. By utilizing these features, a dual-band quasi-elliptic filter based on SIW dual-mode resonances (TE101 and TE201), whose operating frequencies are allocated at 8 GHz and 10 GHz, is designed for demonstration. The design process, principles, and experiments are carefully described in this communication. The measured and simulated results are in good agreement, indicating excellent electrical performance with low loss, compact device size and high selectivity. The most notable point is that a dual-band quasi-elliptic filter on SIW platforms is obtained with all inductive couplings for the first time, which shows a unique benefit in eliminating negative-coupling structures while permitting miniaturization for SIW dual-band filter design.","2836-8282","","10.23919/emsci.2024.0017","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202006070154); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10719601","Dual-band quasi-elliptic filter;High selectivity;Compact size;Meander-line and CRLH resonators;Substrate integrated waveguide","Resonator filters;Dual band;Electric variables measurement;Electromagnetic waveguides;Size measurement;Filtering theory;Loss measurement;Inductive coupling;Passband;Substrates","","","","24","","15 Oct 2024","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

However, more antennas imply the use of high-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in additional radio frequency (RF) chains, which would result in significant power consumption and costs. Equipping low-cost 1-bit ADCs in the RF chain is a viable approach, but it leads to the deterioration of the OAM receiver’s BER. Therefore, we apply comparators and a deep learning (DL)-based detector to the 1-bit quantized OAM receiver to improve the BER.

Relay transmission using sidelink communications, specified by the C-V2X standard, is considered as a potential approach for information exchange in vehicle platooning. The autonomous resource management scheme, SB-SPS (Sensing Based Semi Persistent Scheduling), has been standardized for sidelink communications. However, half duplex problem, one of major problems in the SB-SPS, is not sufficiently resolved for the relay transmission in vehicle platooning.

In this paper, we propose a modulation classification algorithm based on a feature-embedding GCN (FE-GCN). It comprises three parts: feature-embedding network (FEN), similarity adjacent matrix calculation network (SAMCN), and graph convolutional classification network (GCCN). The FEN embeds the signal data into a one-dimensional feature vector. The SAMCN calculates the similarity of all signal feature vectors to a matrix using a single convolutional neural network (CNN). The GCCN is used to extract the final features and classify the signals in a graph. Simulation results on the public dataset RML2016.10A show that the FE-GCN performs effectively and outperforms a series of advanced deep-learning methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3385663","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:CXJ2021075); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10493016","Feature Embedding;Modulation Recognition;GCN","Feature extraction;Modulation;Logic gates;Signal to noise ratio;Convolutional neural networks;Vectors","","","","","CCBYNCND","5 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Based on the miraculous characteristics of the employed resonator modes, the HEM $_{11\delta }$  and TE12 modes can be excited and decoupled simultaneously. For the fundamental HEM $_{11\delta }$  mode, the attenuation constant outside the DP is crucial to address the high mutual isolation issue. Furthermore, the E-field and H-field of the higher TE12 mode are both null at two marginal regions, which are attractive features for decoupling design. Therefore, with the appropriate dielectric constant of DP, the attenuation constant of fundamental HEM $_{11\delta }$  mode not only can be controlled but also the weak field region of higher TE12 mode can be constrained better. Thus, the two modes can be decoupled at the same time without adding extra components. To validate the proposed decoupling method, a two-element DPA array is developed and demonstrated. Then, a four-element DPA array is fabricated and measured with 21.5 dB isolation in a bandwidth of 10.5%. The DPA array supports up to ±46° beam scanning in the E-plane.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3467388","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371263); Nantong Basic Science Research Program(grant numbers:JC2023021); Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10693430","Wideband self-decoupling;closely spaced;multi-element dielectric patch antenna array;multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)","Antenna arrays;Wideband;Antenna radiation patterns;Dielectric constant;Broadband antennas;Antennas;Mutual coupling;Patch antennas;MIMO","","","","25","CCBYNCND","25 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When using spatial multiplexing, the indoor and outdoor sites demonstrate an average capacity gain of 2× and 1.5× at link distances below 60 m. Also, the rank for our measured 142 GHz channels is comparable to that at 60 GHz channels but significantly lower than the rank at 5 GHz channels reported in the literature.

The high voltage applied to the control gate of the FGMOS attracts the generated free electrons towards the floating gate, trapping them (tunnel effect) even after the control gate voltage is lowered. Hence, the electrons trapped in the floating gate affect the threshold voltage of the MOSFET, thus making the memory easily readable electrically.

The intensity scintillations (stripes) are not always visible in the single-look complex (SLC) images. However, they start to be visible, as the image is semifocused at different heights with a peak of contrast where electron density irregularities are found (ionospheric height). The slant range between the satellite and the ionospheric plane can be estimated and converted directly into the ionospheric height by autofocusing the stripes. The observations show good agreement with the height of maximum ionization estimated by the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). Furthermore, we perform an alternative geometric validation based on feature tracking by comparing the shifts between azimuth sublooks. With both methods for the presented dataset, the height of the ionospheric irregularities was estimated to be 330 km.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2024.3431023","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(grant numbers:57478193); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10604874","Intensity scintillation;ionosphere;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Azimuth;Ionosphere;Satellites;Ionization;Faraday effect;Rough surfaces;Radar tracking","","","","25","CCBYNCND","19 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The receivers utilize frequency separated local oscillators derived from an integrated injection-locked gain-switched comb laser assembly (iCLA) followed by an all-active  $1\times 4$  demultiplexer photonic integrated circuit (PIC) to derive the spectral signal slices. The high mutual coherence of the comb lines is then exploited to enable signal reconstruction in the digital domain. The use of the active demultiplexer PIC is a key advance compared to previous work using passive comb demultiplexers as it delivers sufficient local oscillator power without the need for bulky, external optical amplifiers to compensate for demultiplexer losses. Furthermore, a minimal performance penalty is observed (< 1dB at the HD-FEC limit), compared to a conventional high-bandwidth receiver.

Machine-learning (ML) models, particularly explainable methods, offer promise in understanding and mapping the naturalness of these environments through the analysis of satellite imagery. However, current approaches encounter challenges in delivering valid and objective explanations and quantifying the contribution of specific patterns to naturalness. These challenges persist due to the reliance on hand-crafted weights assigned to contributing patterns, which can introduce subjectivity and limit the model’s ability to capture relationships within the data. We propose the confident naturalness explanation (CNE) framework to address these issues, integrating explainable ML and uncertainty quantification. This framework introduces a new quantitative metric to describe the confident contribution of patterns to the concept of naturalness. Additionally, it generates segmentation masks that depict the uncertainty levels in each pixel, highlighting areas where the model lacks knowledge. To showcase the framework’s effectiveness, we apply it to a study site in Fennoscandia, utilizing two open-source satellite datasets. In our proposed metric scale, moors and heathlands register high values of 1 and 0.81, respectively, indicating pronounced naturalness.

The encoder is thus deemed necessary to ensure the rejection of speed variation errors. However, the encoder introduces additional constraints on the measurement system design and has limited performance in certain applications, such as field measurements at cryogenic temperatures. This paper presents an alternative method for rotating-coil measurement that does not require an angular encoder. The induction-coil signals themselves are used to reconstruct the rotation speed and the angular position. This is possible thanks to the field quality of particle accelerator magnets, with errors in the range of 10−4 relative to the main field. The approach also leverages the compensation capabilities of induction-coil magnetometers. A feasibility study and a metrological characterization of a prototype system are presented, which includes phase-shifted coils and measurements of the absolute field orientation.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2023.3345849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10368292","Accelerators;induction coils;magnetic measurements;magnetometers;magnets","Coils;Sensitivity;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetometers;Superconducting magnets;Rotation measurement;Voltage measurement","","","","12","CCBY","21 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although the use of verification-aware languages, such as Dafny, has increased considerably in the last decade, these are still not widely adopted. Often the cost of using such languages is too high, due to the level of expertise required from the developers and challenges that they often face when trying to prove a program correct. Even though Dafny automates a lot of the verification process, sometimes there are steps that are too complex for Dafny to perform on its own. One such case is that of missing lemmas, i.e. Dafny is unable to prove a result without being given further help in the form of a theorem that can assist it in the proof of the step.In this paper, we describe preliminary work on using LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use. Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, we attempt to provide accompanying calculational proofs. We also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Software notations and tools; Software verification and validation.","2575-5099","979-8-4007-0589-2","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10555641","Verification-Aware Languages;Dafny;Large Language Models;Generative AI;Software Productivity;Software Verification;Lemma Inference;Proof Inference;Automated Program Repair","Productivity;Costs;Manuals;Maintenance engineering;Syntactics;Software;Formal specifications","","","","45","CCBY","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By simulating random impact ionization events for individual carriers, two distinct quenching mechanisms are identified: successful quenching (SQ) and unsuccessful quenching (UQ). SQ occurs when quenching is achieved after the initial pulse of avalanche multiplication (AM), mainly attributed to the minimum average carrier number within a multiplication region (MR). In contrast, UQ involves prolonged and repetitive pulses, caused by stochastic fluctuations around the equilibrium carrier number. This study has derived an analytical expression for the probability of quenching failure (1– ${P}_{\text {Q}}$ ) as functions of the quenching resistance and the capacitance of the MR. This analytical expression exhibits a good agreement with the simulation results. Moreover, analytical formulas for the threshold quenching resistance and the dead time have been derived as a function of the desired  ${P}_{\text {Q}}$  value. Notably, the tradeoff relationship between the dead time and the standard deviation of the voltage swing is elucidated, leading to the scaling limitation. Additionally, avalanche triggering probability (ATP), breakdown voltage, and the average voltage swing are revealed to be scale-invariant. Based on these aforementioned observations, the comprehensive scaling law is established.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2023.3338596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10353982","Avalanche breakdown;avalanche photodiodes;CMOS image sensors (CISs);Monte Carlo simulation;quenching;quenching probability;scaling law;single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs)","Single-photon avalanche diodes;Fluctuations;Capacitance;Stochastic processes;Resistance;Monte Carlo methods;Impact ionization","","","","21","CCBYNCND","12 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study proposed a single antenna that can produce PS-OAM beams in the 8-16 GHz frequency range. The antenna is composed of six Vivaldi antennas placed in a tangential circular array, and the ports of the neighboring Vivaldi antenna elements exhibit phase difference. When fed with equal phase and amplitude, the antenna can generate broadband PS-OAM beams with mode +2.

However, the discrete WVD (DWVD) has the problem of a narrow frequency observation range. This is because the time sampling of the symmetric instantaneous auto-correlation function (SIAF) changes simultaneously in the positive and negative directions. As a result, the sampling period of the SIAF in the case of DWVD is doubled and the frequency observation range is halved. Therefore, we propose a DWVD that does not narrow the frequency observation range. Specifically, when deriving the SIAF, in addition to the conventional sample that varies in both the positive and negative directions, we consider a sample averaged over two samples that vary only in the positive or negative direction. The proposed process allows the DWVD to be performed without halving the frequency observation range. However, this process causes a small aliasing component, which can be reduced by the use of window functions. This study will demonstrate this effect by using the proposed method for chirp waveforms.","2187-0136","","10.23919/comex.2024XBL0168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10799926","Discrete Wigner-Ville distribution;time-frequency analysis;Wigner-Ville distribution","Time-frequency analysis;Interpolation;Fast Fourier transforms;Chirp;Reviews;Wavelet transforms;Sensors;Interference;Wavelet analysis;Very large scale integration","","","","","","13 Dec 2024","","","IEICE","IEICE Early Access Articles"

Furthermore, the write time decreases by ~6.3 % compared conventional device structure thanks to the charge plasma effect which can virtually increase source/drain doping concentrations. It is also demonstrated that improvements in both retention time and write time are achievable within the ranges of material parameters used in current fabrication processes.

Quench protection of such magnets is challenging for two main reasons. First, the high energy density and relatively high margin to quench require a high-performance quench protection system. Second, integration of the protection system in an accelerator machine foreseen to be operated for decades calls for easy-to-integrate, robust, and redundant elements. A new and promising protection method named Secondary CLIQ (S-CLIQ) has recently been proposed. It relies on auxiliary normal-conducting coils that are electrically insulated from the coils to protect but are magnetically coupled to them. Upon magnet quench detection, the coupled coils have dual functionality: first, they introduce high coupling loss in the superconductor, which is sufficient to transfer most of the windings to the normal state in a few milliseconds; second, they extract part of the magnet's stored energy by magnetic coupling. In this work, a S-CLIQ system based on auxiliary coils placed on the top and bottom of a racetrack magnet and made of a thin 1 mm$^{2}$ wire is presented. It is shown that the quench protection performance in terms of hot-spot temperature and peak voltage to ground are superior to alternative methods such as energy extraction, quench heaters, and CLIQ.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2023.3336272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10330023","Accelerator magnet;coupling loss;quench protection;simulation;superconducting coil","Coils;Superconducting magnets;Magnetic circuits;Voltage;Couplings;Discharges (electric);Conductors","","","","21","CCBY","28 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed architecture integrates three separate unidirectional input power sources: photovoltaics, fuel cells, and storage system batteries. The architecture has five switches, and the implementation of each switch in the converter is achieved by applying the calculated duty ratios in various operating states.

First, four polysilicon gates, GateA1, GateA2, GateC1, and GateC2, were introduced to the N+ and P+ middle regions of the anode and cathode. When the voltage acts on the anode, the electric field generated by the polysilicon gate strengthens the SCR current path while promoting the release of ESD current in the substrate path. Specifically, the holding voltage of the DG-DDSCR and failure current derived from the test results of a transmission line pulse (TLP) are 29.4 V and 16.7 A, respectively. When the clamping voltage was 40 V, the transient current release of the structure can reach 11.61 A, which met the specifications of the CAN bus ESD window and was suitable for the ESD protection of the target application.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2024.000061","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62174052); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10586888","High failure current;high holding voltage;CMOS technology;dual-direction SCR;gate controlled device","Electrostatic discharge protection;Thyristors;Voltage;Logic gates;System-on-chip;Anodes;Voltage control","","","","25","","4 Jul 2024","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

In my doctoral research, I introduce an approach for reconstructing and refining information flow graphs in order to elicit threats. Using static analysis, I automatically reconstruct an information flow graph.

In addition, the proposed circuit produces a constant current regardless of the data voltage. As a result, a relative current error rate of less than 2% was achieved across all gray levels under the ±0.5 V VTH fluctuation.

An oscilloscope with some kind of search coil or pickup coil can be used for measuring a pulsed magnetic field value. Integration of the induced voltage from the search coil using an integrator is needed in order to calculate the measured value. This paper presents a traceable method with a PCB search coil and with a digital oscilloscope for measuring the pulsed magnetic field directly from the induced voltage without using an integrator. A detailed uncertainty analysis has been described. The method has been tested on pulsed magnetic field signals with repeating frequencies of 40 Hz and 140 Hz. A comparison was performed between the use of an 8-bit (DSO-X 4024A) and a 16-bit (PicoScope 5444D) digital oscilloscope. Further, the method was improved using a 3458A digital multimeter as a digitizer, which significantly reduced the expanded uncertainty of the measurement. The measurement results obtained using the 3458A multimeter were compared to the results obtained using digital oscilloscopes and also with measurements obtained by some commercial teslameters with Hall probes.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2024.3463701","Ministerstvo Pr?myslu a Obchodu(grant numbers:UTR20E801701,UTR21E801701); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10684268","Measurement;search coil;pulsed magnetic field;traceability;uncertainty analysis","Uncertainty;Oscilloscopes;Coils;Standards;Magnetic field measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Voltage measurement","","","","","CCBY","19 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The SDFS is optimized to improve isolation characteristics between adjacent ports. To verify the feasibility, the proposed SRMP antenna is fabricated, and antenna performance such as reflection coefficients, mutual couplings, and radiation patterns are measured in a full anechoic chamber. The SRMP antenna achieves a broadband of 2.1 GHz (from 6.3 GHz to 8.4 GHz) and a low mutual coupling of −21.22 dB at 8 GHz. In addition, a bore-sight gain of 0.78 dBi is measured at the target frequency of 8 GHz. To investigate the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of the SRMP antenna, we utilize the Qorvo test board with the DW3000 chip, generally used in commercial UWB direction-finding systems. At distances of 1 m and 2 m, average estimated errors of 2.35° and 2.13° are obtained, respectively.

Due to the large size of the tooling of the parts, there are problems such as large installation and positioning errors and low precision of robot automatic drilling. Therefore, a robot automatic hole making calibration method is proposed to solve the current problems. In order to achieve automated control, a large-scale robot automatic drilling system must have large-scale flexible tooling, control algorithms, human-computer interaction interfaces, execution units, and integrated tool rooms. It is essential to build effective calibration procedures as a foundation for this automation. The calibration plane is fitted, positioned, and calibrated using the point cloud scanning method. Subsequently, the hand-eye calibration method is employed to establish the relationship between the coordinate systems. Using this approach, the calibration process is ultimately finished, resulting in the successful implementation of automated drilling. The experimental findings demonstrate that, in the designated quadrant, the drilling rate of the robot can achieve 5 holes per minute. Furthermore, the average variance of the hole position is below 0.2mm, and the highest error is 0.5mm.

First, the power transformer's fault model is established to calculate the short circuit currents under initial short circuit and reclosing conditions. Then, three-dimensional (3D) finite element analyses of the transformers' winding short-circuit forces with initial short circuits and reclosing are conducted.

We developed a novel transcutaneous cannulation-type mechanical circulatory system for an alternative therapeutic approach to cardiac arrest using a small centrifugal blood pump. We proposed a transcutaneous mechanical circulatory support capable of rapid installation and quick start of circulatory support for recovery after cardiac arrest by left ventricular direct puncture using the Seldinger technique. The cannula consisted of three components as follows: a) a double-layered cylindrical blood pump housing, b) a centrifugal blood pump impeller primarily installed inside of the cannula, and c) an insertable actuator with magnet coupling. The special feature of the cannula inflow was a backflow resistive unit for adjusting backflow in the process of ventricular puncture. In this study, we performed an in vivo experiment to install the direct cannulation centrifugal blood pump on a goat after cardiac arrest induced by ventricular fibrillation as a proof of concept. As a primary result, the mechanical circulatory support could start in a short period by around one minute installation from the start of cannulation, which could be effective for the recovery after cardiac arrest under the assisted flow of 1.6 L/min at 13,000 rpm of the cannulation pump. Consequently, the novel approach may be useful for the prompt start of mechanical circulatory support.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782583","cardiac arrest;mechanical circulatory system;centrifugal blood pump;heart failure;ventricular cannulation","Couplings;In vivo;Fibrillation;Electric shock;Impellers;Cardiac arrest;Color;Circulatory system;Engineering in medicine and biology;Blood","","","","6","CCBY","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A scheme named Selectively Biased Optical OFDM (SBO-OFDM) was proposed in this letter. SBO-OFDM multiplies the OFDM signals with random phase sequences, selects the signal that requires the least amount of bias for transmission, and dynamically adds the bias based on signal variations to improve power efficiency.

The proposed sensor consists of a planar micromachined sensing coil, a signal conditioning instrumentation, and a nearby nonferromagnetic conductive target. The working principle relies on the magnetic coupling between the sensing coil, driven by AC current, and the target. Due to the eddy currents induced in the target, the magnetic flux and, thus, the equivalent inductance of the sensing coil is altered as a function of the target position. Two configurations have been experimentally adopted to explore the proposed inductive sensor. A proximity sensor has been achieved by measuring the inductance variation while changing the distance between the coil and a brass tip with a diameter of 3 mm. A nondestructive defect detector has been achieved by sliding a copper target over the sensing coil. For the proximity sensor, a sensitivity of 6500 nH/m within the range 0–50 µm has been achieved. The resolution of the proximity sensor at one standard deviation is 470 nm. For the defect detector, a 1-mm wide and 35-µm deep cut induced in the target has been detected.

With recent advances in surgical reconstruction, which created additional signal sites for myoelectric control, intuitively controlling all fingers of a prosthetic hand became a possibility. To fully utilize a multiple degree of freedom (DoF) bionic hand, the fingers need to be controllable both individually and simultaneously. However, training algorithms to decode motor intent typically requires large sets of labeled data. This data requirement grows combinatorically with each additional DoF, complicating the training process for multi-DoF control. Here, we evaluated a method to create labeled simultaneous data from linearly combining individual movement data. We found that a classifier trained on such artificial data performed equivalently in decoding 3 DoF real-time finger movement to a classifier trained on ground truth data. However, its effectiveness diminishes with more complex tasks, i.e., 5 DoF finger control. In both cases, linearly combining individual movements decreased the time to acquire labeled data to train the classifier by up to 85%.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782980","pattern recognition;myoelectric;prosthetics;simultaneous control;deep learning","Training;Surgery;Process control;Motors;Real-time systems;Recording;Decoding;Pattern recognition;Engineering in medicine and biology;Prosthetic hand","","","","12","CCBY","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most advanced object detection framework currently processes all information in the image uniformly through a deep neural network. In the past, in the process of detecting aircraft small targets, the feature extraction process was carefully designed, and handcrafted features were derived from expert knowledge or historical data, which included prior knowledge that was conducive to object detection. Embedding prior features into deep neural networks can enhance the saliency of target information and improve the detection performance of the model. Accordingly, this letter proposes a handcrafted feature fusion stream (HFFS) for embedding prior knowledge. We obtain handcrafted features based on the grayscale co-occurrence matrix and edge extraction operator and generate an attention map in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve the fusion of handcrafted feature maps and high-level feature maps in deep convolutional networks. The experimental results show that using HFFS on the baseline model improves the detection performance of the model for aircraft small targets.

By using mechanically compliant and potentially highly biocompatible smart hydrogel materials as well as medical ultrasound, this approach provides an effective and minimally invasive CGM solution. While previous results demonstrated proof-of-principle in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, they still used standard and less mobile medical ultrasound equipment, and thus limits the ease-of-use of the approach. In this study, the transition from this full-size and less mobile module to a portable benchtop medical US equipment for exciting and reading out the hydrogel resonators is explored. The results demonstrate the ability of the portable US module to detect the small changes in Mean Gray Value (MGV) in ultrasound images that correspond to the altered state of the smart hydrogel structures in varying glucose environments while maintaining good signal quality.

A conclusion is that voltage control is relatively robust against this effect. Based on the preceding analysis, a novel foreground calibration procedure is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration method is demonstrated for a manufactured open-loop VCO ADC in 28nm CMOS and compared to results obtained using a prior art calibration method and results without calibration.

The gain and noise factor (NF) of analog optical link can be improved by optimizing the laser impedance matching network. The radio frequency (RF) package of DFB is optimized to extend bandwidth and reduce return loss. In this paper, a flexible printed circuit (FPC) with low-loss impedance matching network is designed to improved the RF characteristics of TO-CAN DFB laser. The return path between FPC and TO-CAN is optimized to eliminate microwave resonances. The small signal model of an analog optical link is analyzed in detail. The measured frequency response of the TO-CAN DFB is 18.4 GHz. The microwave reflection is below −10 dB. The measured results correlates perfectly with the simulated results. The gain of analog optical link is increased by 3 dB. The NF is also reduced by about 2.5 dB.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2024.3422269","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB2206500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10582283","DFB;transformer of through-hole (TO)-CAN;radio over fiber;optical module;optical transimmion","Impedance;Packaging;Impedance matching;Bandwidth;Optical losses;Optical fiber networks;Optical fiber devices","","","","23","CCBYNCND","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By applying the dual-reflector shaping technique to the CPFRA antennas, the reflection-phase distributions of the two reflecting surfaces comprising the CPFRA antennas are modified to realize low profile, high aperture efficiency, and arbitrary aperture-field distribution simultaneously. Numerical simulations based on the geometrical optics show that the aperture efficiency can be improved up to around 100% by realizing uniform aperture-field distribution and reducing the spillover. Designs of CPFRA antennas with low sidelobe levels are also presented.","2187-0136","","10.23919/comex.2024XBL0115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10633229","folded reflectarray;circular polarization;low profile;high efficiency;geometrical optics;reflector shaping","Antennas;Antenna feeds;Lighting;Aperture antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Broadband antennas;Wideband","","","","13","","9 Aug 2024","","","IEICE","IEICE Journals"

The paper provides experimental support for CRIU in Docker and offers insights into the impact of application memory usage on checkpoint size, time, and resources. Through a series of tests, we establish that the time to checkpoint is linearly proportional to the size of the memory allocation of the container, while the restore is significantly lower. Our findings contribute to the understanding of CRIU's performance and its potential use in edge computing scenarios. To obtain accurate and meaningful findings, we monitored system telemetry while using CRIU to observe its impact on the host machine's CPU and RAM utilization. Although our results may not be groundbreaking, they offer a good overview and a technical report on the feasibility of using CRIU on edge devices, which are typically resource constrained. This study's findings and experimental support for CRIU in Docker could serve as a useful reference for future research on performance optimization and application migration using CRIU.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2357","European Commission(grant numbers:739574); Republic of Slovenia (Investment funding of the Republic of Slovenia and the European Regional Development Fund); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10654692","Checkpoint/Restore;edge computing;run-time container migration","Checkpointing;Performance evaluation;Random access memory;Containers;Writing;Image restoration;Telemetry","","","","9","","28 Aug 2024","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

However, due to the highly open communication network and complex information interaction environment, it also faces more security risks. Existing intrusion detection algorithms based on machine learning cannot cope with the increasing features in the Energy Internet. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Improved Gravitational Search Algorithm (IGSA) for feature selection. Our core idea is to utilize IGSA for efficient feature selection, reducing the learning cost of machine learning methods and improving detection accuracy. Furthermore, to enhance the algorithm's global search capability and robustness, a novel elite selection strategy and adaptive mutation strategy are introduced. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that IGSA improves detection accuracy by an average of 11.14% compared to other feature selection methods.","2997-6278","979-8-3503-5030-2","10.1109/CACRE62362.2024.10635055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10635055","smart grid;intrusion detection;feature selection","Accuracy;Machine learning algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Power system stability;Nearest neighbor methods;Feature extraction","","","","21","IEEE","23 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our proposed switch combines header information from Layer-2 to Layer-4 to determine whether incoming packets are attack packets or not. It also achieves fast packet forwarding using low-latency hierarchical hash table. We evaluated the system performance with the FPGA board implementing the proposed security switch, and achieved low-latency transfers of 500 nanoseconds or less.","2187-0136","","10.23919/comex.2024XBL0093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554805","Intrusion detection system;security;hash table;FPGA","Security;Switches;Engines;Logic gates;Hash functions;IP networks;Delays","","","","5","","11 Jun 2024","","","IEICE","IEICE Journals"

The state process is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and known non-causally at the transmitter as well as the non-degraded receiver. The two receivers have to decode the messages from the transmitter, while the degraded receiver also needs to estimate the channel input codeword to meet a prescribed distortion limit. A complete characterization of the optimal rates versus distortion performance is provided. The tight characterization is also illustrated by means of an example of an additive binary broadcast channel with a Hamming distortion constraint for the input reconstruction at the degraded receiver.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2023.000045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10466682","Broadcast channel;codeword reconstruction;constrained communication;Gelfand-Pinsker coding;Hamming distortion;rate-distortion;state-dependent channel","Receivers;Distortion;Decoding;Rate-distortion;Channel estimation;Distortion measurement;Channel coding","","","","","","11 Mar 2024","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

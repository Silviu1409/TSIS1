Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such ‘multilayer’ features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize ‘traditional’ network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnu016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155443","multilayer networks;dynamical systems on networks;models of networks;structural analysis of networks;mathematical analysis and simulations of networks;data analysis","","","291","2","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Google's MapReduce and Apache's Hadoop, its open-source implementation, are the defacto software systems for big-data applications. An observation of the MapReduce framework is that the framework generates a large amount of intermediate data. Such abundant information is thrown away after the tasks finish, because MapReduce is unable to utilize them. In this paper, we propose Dache, a data-aware cache framework for big-data applications. In Dache, tasks submit their intermediate results to the cache manager. A task queries the cache manager before executing the actual computing work. A novel cache description scheme and a cache request and reply protocol are designed. We implement Dache by extending Hadoop.

A simple and unified interface is exposed to the customers of DR-Cloud to adapt the heterogeneity of cloud service providers involved in the disaster recovery service, and the internal processes between clouds are invisible to the customers. DR-Cloud proposes multiple optimization scheduling strategies to balance the disaster recovery objectives, such as high data reliability, low backup cost, and short recovery time, which are also transparent to the customers. Different data scheduling strategies based on DR-Cloud are suitable for different kinds of data disaster recovery scenarios.

The proposed model is based on the total generalized variation method which involves and balances the higher order of the structure.

Differently from other works, the authors have developed an approach able to coordinate active and reactive generation output with storage systems requirements and features, making no use of remote communications between different points of the system. The control strategy acts on frequency and voltage in order to reduce as much as possible the power exchanges between the storage system and the network. This means involving mainly generators in supplying load requirements. In this way, the storage system can provisionally compensate significant events in terms of active and reactive balance, as shown in the reported simulations.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993217","Islanded networks;Renewables;Storage systems;Frequency and Voltage regulation;Remote communication absence","","","18","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Relying on the relatively good correlation characteristic of the pseudo-noise (PN) sequence, a joint frame offset and normalized CFO estimation algorithm based on PN preamble in time domain is developed to realize the frame and frequency synchronization in the OFDM system. By comparison, the performances of the traditional algorithm and the improved algorithm are simulated under different conditions.

However, detecting hardware Trojan is extremely difficult due to Trojans are always triggered by rare events. Side-channel signal analysis is effective in detecting Trojan but facing the challenge with process variation and environment noise in nanotechnology. Moreover, side-channel approaches that analyze global signals cannot scale well to large circuits. This paper presents a heuristic partition and test pattern generation based localized signal analysis method for hardware Trojan detection. First, we partition the design into regions controlled by scan chains. Then a test vector ordering algorithm is used to generate optimized vectors which can magnify the activity in the target region where Trojan may be located. At last, power ports are placed in each region to measure the localized transient current anomalies for Trojan detection, while a signal calibration technique is used to eliminate the negative effect of process variation and noise. We evaluate our approach on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits and the results show that the proposed scheme can magnify the detection sensitivity in multiples from the state-of-the-art. Two further benefits of this method are that it can scale well to large circuits and determine Trojan's location.","","978-1-84919-844-8","10.1049/cp.2014.0728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992221","hardware security;hardware Trojan detection;heuristic partition;test pattern generation","","","12","1","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

We can identify the real number of active sources and achieve separation in any TF neighborhood by the sparse representation method. Compared with the subspace-based algorithm under the same sparseness assumption, which suffers from the extra noise effect since it cannot estimate the true number of active sources, the proposed algorithm can estimate the number of active sources and their corresponding TF values in any TF neighborhood simultaneously. Another contribution of this paper is a new estimation procedure for the DOA of sources in the underdetermined case, which combines the TF sparseness of sources and the clustering technique.

These, in turn, can cause EMC issues, unwanted protection trips and other problems. In the present article a dc micro-grid in which the neutral point of the MV/LV transformer is directly grounded and the dc micro-grid is floating (i.e., there is no grounding connection) is analysed. When a ground fault occurs, potentially harmful fault currents flow through the front-end converter, depending on the fault resistance and on the load conditions. The methodology proposed in this work protects the front-end converter while the task of feeding the dc-side loads is committed to storage systems.

Many architectures and protocols are proposed to meet this demand. However, these proposals either require complicated configurations on switches and servers, or cannot deliver an optimal performance. In this paper, we propose the peer-assisted data dissemination for DCNs. This approach utilizes the rich physical connections with high bandwidths and mutli-path connections, to facilitate efficient one-to-many data dissemination. We prove that an optimal P2P data dissemination schedule exists for FatTree, a speciallydesigned DCN architecture. We then present a theoretical analysis of this algorithm in the general multi-rooted tree topology, a widely-used DCN architecture. Additionally, we explore the performance of an intuitive line structure for data dissemination. Our analysis and experimental results prove that this simple structure is able to produce a comparable performance to the optimal algorithm. Since DCN applications heavily rely on virtualization to achieve optimal resource sharing, we present a general implementation method for the proposed algorithms, which aims to mitigate the impact of the potentially-high churn rate of the virtual machines.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2014.6733208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6733208","data center networks;cloud computing;P2P;scheduling;peer-assisted data dissemination","Servers;Bandwidth;Topology;Algorithm design and analysis;Peer-to-peer computing;Network topology;Computer architecture","","8","","","","7 Feb 2014","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In practice, storage operators will not have perfect foresight and will have to devise operational strategies using price forecasts. This paper investigates the impact of forecast accuracy on the optimality of storage revenue. The optimal revenue available is determined using linear programming and historic electricity prices. The results are compared to those found using dynamic programming and electricity price forecasts with increasing percentage error. A small scale lithium ion battery and a large pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) device are compared. The results show that revenue reduces at an increasing rate with increasing forecast error. The PHES device is more sensitive to forecast accuracy than the lithium ion battery. For both technologies, with a maximum error of 30%, 80% of the optimal revenue can be achieved. With increased capacity and significantly increased power rating, the lithium ion battery becomes more sensitive to price forecast accuracy.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993295","Electricity Storage;Price Arbitrage;Dynamic programming;Forecast Accuracy","","","8","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Following a brief introduction into Trojans and detection methods, we present the S-box circuit noise model in AES core and simulate the power tracks of various sizes of hardware Trojans using HSPICE. We also apply different sets of test vectors in 40 nm processing. Experimental results show that the power of the entire circuit is reduced by 41% and the PRV value increased 12.71% and 3.34% at most corresponding to combinational and sequential Trojan circuits. The valid test vectors can enhance the activity of hardware Trojans. They can also limit the noise from process, supply voltage, and temperature and extrude the features from the Trojan circuit to increase PRV value. As a result, a sample amount can be compressed at a reduced cost given a similar detection effect. Hence, the investigation into the influence of test vectors on the detection methods of hardware Trojans based on side-channel analysis is extremely important.","","978-1-84919-844-8","10.1049/cp.2014.0756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992249","integrated circuit;test vector;hardware Trojans;detection technology;side channel analysis","","","6","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This paper discusses the influence of PhotoVoltaic (PV) plants in real distribution lines. In particular, a numerical tool has been developed in order to study the active power of distribution lines. The dataset derives from real measured acquisitions of distribution lines feeding residential and commercial users. The mathematical approach is based on both the Wavelet Analysis (WA) and the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) in order to select and isolate the different operation modes of the distribution line. Numerical results highlight that PV plants strongly affect the time-domain power signal. As this signal is typically non stationary and nonlinear, the HHT-based approach allows to fix power disturbances and anomalies.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993264","Power Quality Monitoring;Power systems;Smart grid;Non-stationary signal analysis;Hilbert-Huang transform;Wavelet","","","4","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The numerical results show that the proposed scheme can match the error performance of SM-OD very closely, even at low bit-error rate (BER). The computational complexity at the receiver, is shown to be independent of the symbol constellation size, and hence, offers a much lower complexity compared to existing schemes. To further improve the error performance, we then propose two closed-loop transmit antenna selection (TAS) schemes for conventional SM. We assume the receiver has knowledge of the channel and a perfect low-bandwidth feedback path to the transmitter exists. From evaluation of the BER versus normalized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the complexity analysis, the proposed schemes exhibit a significant improvement over SM-OD and other improved SM schemes in terms of error performance and/or complexity.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2014.8531875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531875","Spatial modulation;transmit antenna selection;multiple-input multiple-output;adaptive spatial modulation;reduced complexity detection;signal vector based detection;optimal detection","Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Indexes;MIMO communication;Computational complexity","","4","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Since PV generators exhibit nonlinear I–V characteristics and their maximum power point varies with solar insolation. Therefore, the MPPT controller optimises the solar energy conversion by ensuring that the PV generator runs at the maximum power point at all times under different illumination conditions. In this paper, a new artificial neural network (ANN) based searching algorithm is proposed for maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The system is composed of solar array, buck converter and centrifugal pump load driven by a permanent magnet DC motor. The proposed ANN controller uses the output power of the PV generator and speed of the DC motor as input signals and generates the pulse width modulation (PWM) control signal to adjust the operating duty ratio of a buck converter to match the load impedance to the internal impedance of the PV array; thus maximizing the motor speed and the water discharge rate of a centrifugal pump. A complete dynamic simulation of the system is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK to demonstrate the feasibility of the ANN control scheme under different sunlight insolation levels. The results obtained verify that the proposed ANN controller shows a significant improvement in the power extraction performance under different sunlight conditions, when compared with a directly-connected PV-generator energized pumping system. Moreover, the simulation results match the calculated improvement.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993316","Artificial Neural Network (ANN);DC/DC buck converter;maximum power point tracking;photovoltaic water pumping system","","","4","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, the full skewed redundant SINS (RSINS) can not only enhance the reliability of the system, but also improve the accuracy of the system, such as the initial alignment. Firstly, the observability of the system state includes attitude errors and all the inertial sensors biases are analyzed with the global perspective method: any three gyroscopes and three accelerometers can be assembled into an independent subordinate SINS (sub-SINS); the system state can be uniquely confirmed by the coupling connections of all the sub-SINSs; the attitude errors and random constant biases of all the inertial sensors are observable. However, the random noises of the inertial sensors are not taken into account in the above analyzing process. Secondly, the full-observable Kalman filter which can be applied to the actual RSINS containing random noises is established; the system state includes the position, velocity, attitude errors of all the sub-SINSs and the random constant biases of the redundant inertial sensors. At last, the initial self-alignment process of a typical four-redundancy full skewed RSINS is simulated: the horizontal attitudes (pitch, roll) errors and yaw error can be exactly evaluated within 80 s and 100 s respectively, while the random constant biases of gyroscopes and accelero-meters can be precisely evaluated within 120 s.

The AC output signal from the wind generator to the internal DC collector or DC bus is regulated through active rectifier. An active rectifier is a cascade connection of an uncontrolled full bridge diode rectifier and a controlled DC-DC boost converter.

In this scheme, the inscribed circle of the original image matrix is selected as the ZM calculation area, and the square of the inscribed circle is chosen to embed watermark. Firstly, the watermarking embedding area is conducted with 1-level DWT and the low frequency DWT coefficient is divided into non-overlapping blocks; SVD is applied to every block. Secondly, a bit of the watermark is embedded through slight modifications of the singular value (SV) matrix in each block.

The problem has been addressed through the employment of several models for wind speed stochastic variable, i.e. Weibull, Lognormal, Gamma, Burr, Rayleigh, extending a previous work. Indeed different model assumptions, although all able to provide a global good fitting of the wind speeds data, may lead to quite different estimates of producibility. This is theoretically crucial both at planning and operating stage when the electrical infrastructures (e.g. transmission lines, transformers, etc.) devoted to transfer green energy have to be designed and managed. Indeed, the paper will demonstrate that while at planning stage a different probabilistic description of the wind resource does not affect in significant manner the transmission line design, at the operating stage instead different assumptions on WS distribution lead to different measures, in probabilistic terms, of the their loadability. This is accomplished by comparing the distribution quantiles of the entire wind farm producibility, estimated through a proper methodology of wind speeds simulation based upon an extensive Monte Carlo procedure.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993302","Wind;Correlation;Gamma;Burr;Weibull;Lognormal;Rayleigh","","","3","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Peripheral blood lymphocytes from four healthy donors were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin for 24 h and then exposed for 20 h to 1950 MHz radiofrequency fields (RF, adaptive dose, AD) at an average specific absorption rate of 0.3 W/kg. At 48 h, the cells were subjected to a challenge dose (CD) of 1.0 or 1.5 Gy X-irradiation (XR, challenge dose, CD). After a 72 h total culture period, cells were collected to examine the incidence of micronuclei (MN). There was a significant decrease in the number of MN in lymphocytes exposed to RF + XR (AD + CD) as compared with those subjected to XR alone (CD). These observations thus suggested a RF-induced AR and induction of resistance to subsequent damage from XR. There was variability between the donors in RF-induced AR. The data reported in our earlier investigations also indicated a similar induction of AR in human blood lymphocytes that had been pre-exposed to RF (AD) and subsequently treated with a chemical mutagen, mitomycin C (CD). Since XR and mitomycin-C induce different kinds of lesions in cellular DNA, further studies are required to understand the mechanism(s) involved in the RF-induced adaptive response.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227115","radiofrequency;adaptive response;micronucleus;X-rays;human lymphocytes","","","3","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using numerical wavefield simulations and adjoint techniques, we calculate interstation correlations and sensitivity kernels for arbitrarily distributed noise sources where—as in the real Earth—different frequencies are generated in different locations. While both heterogeneous noise sources and processing can have profound effects on noise correlation waveforms, narrow-band traveltime measurements are less affected, in accord with previous analytical studies. Sensitivities to Earth structure depend strongly on the source distribution and the processing scheme, and they reveal exotic frequency dependencies that go beyond the well-known frequency scaling of the Fresnel zone width. Our results indicate that modern full waveform inversion applied to noise correlations is not possible unless one of the following measures is taken: (1) properly account for noise source distribution and processing, or (2) limit measurements to phase or time shifts in narrow frequency bands. Failure to do so can lead to erroneous misfits, tomographic artefacts, and reduced resolution.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggu093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8144334","Inverse theory;Tomography;Interferometry;Computational seismology","","","2","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Such kind of analysis is deemed to be necessary in order to perform a proper ""decision making"" approach for the choice of the best solution among different possible alternatives (in terms, e.g., of number and size of generating units). In the paper a proper decision making methodology for this aim is presented, in the framework of wind power plants design. It is based upon analyzing the risk in terms of ""loss of load"" of a wind turbine system in order to perform the best decision between alternative generation systems, designed to meet a given power demand and accounting the uncertainty of data, especially reliability and power demand data. A random variable is used to represent the risk of failure meanwhile utility theory is used to describe the consequences in a Bayesian approach. The methodology is then illustrated presenting the results obtained in the comparison between the risk functions of different alternatives of power plant generation systems. Uncertainties of load and of wind turbine generator reliability are dealt with by means of a combined Monte Carlo simulation/analytical probabilistic, which allows - with an excellent degree of precision - the deduction probability density function of the risk, becoming itself a random variable in the proposed approach, which allows a rational and complete decision making process. This is shown by means of numerical simulations in Section 4.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993300","decision making;power systems;reliability;risk analysis;uncertainty;wind energy","","","1","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The specificity of the proposed system is that the two generators have different numbers of turns in their windings and the two rectifiers are in parallel in the same DC source. It has been demonstrated that the proposed system is able to harness very efficiently the energy of the turbine in the whole tidal cycle. The proposed system is interesting because it does not need complex control system and it allows minimizing converter losses costs due to electronic devices as controlled IGBT PWM converters usually used in conventional power generation systems.

To vary the AD distribution, 7 PVs in the central region were targeted with two, four and six times the peripheral dose, and the number of central PVs receiving four times the peripheral dose was increased from 3 to 11. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for in-focus plane quality and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of artifact spread function (ASF) for resolution in the z-direction were used. Although the ASF improved with increasing PV densities at two peripheral sites, the CNRs were inferior to those obtained with other subsets. With increasing PV density in the central area, the vertical resolution decreased but the CNR increased. Although increasing the central PV or AD concentrations improved image quality, excessive central densities reduced image quality by increasing noise in peripheral views.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150258","digital breast tomosynthesis;microcalcification;projection view distribution;angular dose distribution","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In particular, a key point of the above identification and estimation aspects is the one of representing the extreme values of wind speed probability distributions, which in the ""static"" case, as defined in the paper, may be expressed in terms of ""extreme upper quantiles"". This topic has indeed brought about an increasing number of studies in the last years, both for wind energy production assessment and also in risk and reliability analysis. Concerning the aspect of energy production, it is well known that a great sensitivity exists in the relationship between wind speed extreme upper quantiles and the corresponding wind energy quantiles. Concerning risk and reliability analysis, the extreme wind speed values characterization is useful for a proper understanding of the destructive wind forces which may affect mechanical tower reliability, and consequently a proper choice of the “cut off” wind speed value. The above modeling is however difficult due to uncertainty in wind speed probability distributions. For this purpose, the paper proposes a novel Bayes approach for the estimation of the probability that wind speed is lower than a prefixed extreme value. The basic feature of the method is its being not dependent on the underlying wind speed model, be it the classical Weibull distribution, or alternative models such as the recently adopted Log-logistic or Burr distributions. A large set of numerical simulations are performed in the last part of the paper, in order to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the above method of estimation, especially when compared to the classical Maximum Likelihood method.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993304","Bayes estimation;extreme value theory;Poisson process;reliability;wind energy;wind speed","","","1","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Using the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP-4C, we calculated the β-ray dose for 129mTe, 129Te, 131I, 132Te, 132I, 134Cs and 137Cs in air as a function of altitude and in soil. These calculations of β-dose rate for each radionuclide were conducted for the conditions following the FDNPP accident, with 137Cs deposition assumed to be 1000 kBq/m2. Beta-ray dose rate was found to be ∼10-fold (resp. 5-fold) higher than the γ-ray dose rate in the soil (resp. on the ground surface) at ∼20 days after deposition, and ∼4-fold (resp. 1.7-fold) higher after 6 months or more.

User revocation is the most difficulty in cloud which revocation of any single user would affect others who share common attribute space. In this paper, we apply Broadcast Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) and attribute segmentation to deal with this problem, and perform concrete construction to achieve scalable user revocation in further step. Broadcast CP-ABE is a direct revocation architecture, fine-grained revocation can be done without affecting any non-revoked users. Attribute segmentation decides whether to instantaneously revoke user authorization according to attribute subset. Our contributions are summarized as: Firstly, we resolve this problem by considering cloud service application scenarios in which dishonest cloud service is available. Secondly, our scheme is the owner can directly revoke multiple users, user mediator may revoke single user with its attribute subset which the system needn't periodically update private key. Thirdly, colluders cannot decrypt the private content. We attain this by integrating Broadcast CP-ABE with the technique of attribute segmentation, and redefine under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. At last, our scheme is provably secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack. In addition, we show our scheme can also be applicable to the PHR service.","","978-1-84919-844-8","10.1049/cp.2014.0745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992238","Direct revocation;Full collusion resistance;Non-periodically updating;Attribute segmentation","","","1","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Chapman",NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","1","2","9","The radiation killing of tumor cells by ionizing radiation is best described by the linear–quadratic (LQ) model. Research into the underlying mechanisms of α- and β-inactivation has suggested that different molecular targets (DNA in different forms) and different microdosimetric energy deposits (spurs versus electron track-ends) are involved. Clinical protocols with fractionated doses of about 2.0 Gy/day were defined empirically, and we now know that they produce cancer cures mainly by the α-inactivation mechanism. Radiobiology studies indicate that α and β mechanisms exhibit widely different characteristics that should be addressed upfront as clinical fractionation schemes are altered. As radiation treatments attempt to exploit the advantages of larger dose fractions over shorter treatment times, the LQ model can be used to predict iso-effective tumor cell killing and possibly iso-effective normal tissue complications. Linking best estimates of radiobiology and tumor biology parameters with tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models will enable us to improve and optimize cancer treatment protocols, delivering no more fractions than are strictly necessary for a high therapeutic ratio.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154330","LQ model;tumor cell killing;TCP modeling;NTCP modeling;optimal radiotherapy","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Identifying subsurface boundaries in the topographic data can be difficult due to smoothness constraints used in inversion, so a statistical population-based approach is used that extends previous work in calculating isoresistivity surfaces. The analysis framework involves a procedure for guiding a clustering approach based on the fuzzy c-means algorithm. An approximation of resistivity distributions, found using kernel density estimation, was utilized as a means of guiding the cluster centroids used to classify data. A fuzzy method was chosen over hard clustering due to uncertainty in hard edges in the topography data, and a measure of clustering uncertainty was identified based on the reciprocal of cluster membership. The algorithm was validated using a direct comparison of known observed bedrock depths at two 3-D survey sites, using real-time GPS information of exposed bedrock by quarrying on one site, and borehole logs at the other. Results show similarly accurate detection as a leading isosurface estimation method, and the proposed algorithm requires significantly less user input and prior site knowledge. Furthermore, the method is effectively dimension-independent and will scale to data of increased spatial dimensions without a significant effect on the runtime.

In order to reduce the scale of fuzz testing data, heuristic operators are defined to remove useless items from value sets of attributes.

The majority of methods provides deterministic forecasts even though a great interest was recently dealt with probabilistic forecast methods. Similarly, the majority of indices that have been used to quantify the forecasting accuracy refers to deterministic forecasting and does not directly account for the economic consequences of forecasting errors in the framework of competitive electricity markets. In this paper, advanced, more accurate probabilistic indices are proposed: they account directly for the economic consequences of forecasting errors and the uncertainties that characterize the PV power-production.

The dataset comprises secondary ion mass spectrometry determinations of 18O/16O in single compositional zones of plagioclase crystals from the primitive Borgarhraun flow in northern Iceland, along with trace and major element data from the same zones. The presence of mantle under Iceland with δ18O below typical mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) values of ∼5·5 ± 0·3‰ (VSMOW) has previously been disputed, because variability in δ18O in many Icelandic basalts is also known to be caused by the interaction of basaltic melts with crustal lithologies that have been altered by low-δ18O meteoric water. Primitive basalt flows, such as Borgarhraun, and their macrocrysts are the most likely candidates to retain a mantle δ18O signature. However, the role of crustal processes in generating the low δ18O in olivine crystals from these flows has not unequivocally been ruled out. By making intra-crystal analyses in Borgarhraun plagioclase it has been possible in this study to obtain a detailed record of the chemical and isotopic compositions of the melts that crystallized the plagioclase zones. The variability observed in trace element compositions of the early crystallized anorthitic plagioclase zones (80·9–89·4 mol % anorthite) is firstly shown to arise from melt compositional variability, and equilibrium melt concentrations of Sr, La and Y are then calculated from the crystal concentrations of these elements using carefully selected partition coefficients. The ranges of incompatible trace element ratios (La/Y, Sr/Y) in these equilibrium melts reflect a range of compositions of fractional mantle melts, a result that is in agreement with previous proposals for the cause of variability in trace element indices of Borgarhraun olivine-hosted melt inclusions and clinopyroxene compositional zones. Correlations observed between La/Y and Sr/Y in the melts in equilibrium with the Borgarhraun plagioclase zones and the δ18O of these zones therefore support the hypothesis that the mantle under Iceland is heterogeneous in 18O/16O. Such correlations have not previously been observed in intra-crystal data from Iceland, and provide strong evidence that mantle material with abnormally low δ18O may exist in the form of readily fusible heterogeneities alongside ambient mantle with MORB-like δ18O (≈+5·5‰) on a length scale of <100 km. The lowest δ18O of plagioclase that is attributed to a mantle origin in this study is 4·5 ± 0·4‰, equating to a melt equivalent value of 4·3 ± 0·5‰ or an olivine equivalent value of 3·8 ± 0·5‰.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egu066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8183286","Iceland;mid-ocean ridge;oxygen isotopes;plagioclase;trace elements","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel handoff scheme which uses attribute-based encryption to realize security requirement oriented access control. Only the authorized mobile station which satisfies the access control policy made by the new domain can access into the new access point. With our scheme, each domain is able to make its own access control policy to avoid private data being illegally used by unauthorized users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first secure handoff scheme equipped with security requirement oriented access control in handoff scheme. Security analysis shows that our scheme can effectively provide enterprise-level security. The experiment analysis indicates that the handoff process can be completed within 30ms, which is fast enough to support real time communication such as VoIP.","","978-1-84919-844-8","10.1049/cp.2014.0746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992239","WLAN;Fast Handoff;CP-ABE;Fine-grained;Security-requirement-oriented","","","","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Methods Between 1998 and 2008, 190 patients with VS were treated with SRS. All patients had tumors <2 cm diameter. Patients received 13.5 Gy prescribed to the 80th isodose at the tumor margin. The primary endpoint was LC. Secondary endpoints were symptomatic control and morbidity. Results Median follow-up was 40 months. LC was achieved in 88% of patients. There were no acute reactions exceeding Grade I. Trigeminal nerve dysfunction was present in 21.6% (n = 41) prior to SRS. After treatment, 85% (n = 155) had no change, 4.4,% (n = 8) had a relief of symptoms, 10.4% (n = 19) had new symptoms. Facial nerve dysfunction was present in some patients prior to treatment, e.g. paresis (12.6%; n = 24) and dysgeusia (0.5%; n = 1). After treatment 1.1% (n = 2) reported improvement and 6.1% (n = 11) experienced new symptoms. Hearing problems before SRS were present in 69.5% of patients (n = 132). After treatment, 62.6% (n = 144) had no change, 10.4% (n = 19) experienced improvement and 26.9% (n = 49) became hearing impaired. Conclusion This series of SRS for small VS provided similar LC rates to microsurgery; thus, it is effective as a non-invasive, image-guided procedure. The functional outcomes observed indicate the safety and effectiveness of linac-based SRS. Patients may now be informed of the clinical equivalence of SRS to microsurgery.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227111","vestibular schwannoma;acoustic neurinoma;stereotactic radiosurgery;image-guided intervention;local control","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The super-twisting algorithm is adopted to control the rotor side converter (RSC) and the grid side converter (GSC) at a fixed switching frequency. In addition, single power (or voltage) control loops instead of cascaded current and power (or voltage) control loops are used for the RSC and the GSC, which simplify the design of the controllers.

Finally, the service nodes can be eventually divided into different trusted node sets, which provide a reference for the service nodes selection.

The geometry of the modelling region is simplified by excluding the exit ports at either end and focusing on the upper half of the central section of the bioreactor. Cells are seeded on a porous scaffold throughout the extracapillary space (ECS), and fluid pumped through the bioreactor via the lumen inlet and/or exit ports. In the fibre lumen and porous fibre wall, flow is described using Stokes and Darcy governing equations, respectively, while in the ECS porous mixture theory is used to model the cells, culture medium and scaffold. Reaction–advection–diffusion equations govern the concentration of a solute of interest in each region. The governing equations are reduced by exploiting the small aspect ratio of the bioreactor. This yields a coupled system for the cell volume fraction, solute concentration and ECS water pressure which is solved numerically for a variety of experimentally relevant case studies. The model is used to identify different regimes of cell behaviour, and results indicate how the flow rate can be controlled experimentally to generate a uniform cell distribution under regimes relevant to nutrient- and/or chemotactic-driven behaviours.","1477-8602","","10.1093/imammb/dqt015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8191429","tissue engineering;multi-phase flow;asymptotic reduction","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Irradiation of an exact number of charged particles on a single cell means that the limitations of the Poisson distribution of the number of charged particles can be overcome. Moreover, microbeams are particularly useful for the field of radiation-induced non-targeted effects, so-called bystander effects that are considered to be one of the major effects in the low-dose region. Thus, microbeam technique is one of the powerful tools for investigating studies related to radiation effect and risk of low dose in space radiation for astronauts and cosmonauts.Our microbeam irradiation system, the Single-Particle Irradiation system to CEll (SPICE) provides a 3.4 MeV proton microbeam focused with a quadrupole magnetic lens on an upward vertical beam line. SPICE was severely damaged by the Tohoku-oki Earthquake on 11 March 2011, and was out of operation for about a year and a half. We have successfully reconstructed the facility, and it is now operational with system refinements. At present, SPICE is the only proton microbeam facility in Japan at which a single-ion single-cell irradiation can be performed on mammalian cells with stability and high throughput using an upward vertical beam of below 2-μm diameter, focused with a magnetic quadrupole triplet lens . A variety of irradiation modes have been established for radiation-induced bystander effects, cytoplasm irradiation etc. An example of cells targeted with a multi-position targeting mode is shown in Fig., which cells were targeted with five different positions in the nucleus with 50 protons per position. SPICE has been administrated as a ‘Joint-use facility for Collaborative Research’, and thus researchers outside NIRS can apply for beam time of SPICE after their research proposals are approved.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206907","space radiation;microbeam;bystander effects;low-dose effect","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To aid the interpretation of the experimental results, the clay-rich samples were characterized in terms of mineralogy, water content, porosity, permeability and microstructure.The two shales have significantly different quality factors; and this is seen to be dependent on both the saturation state of the samples and the propagation direction of the oscillatory signal. The attenuation coefficient for compression/extension parallel to bedding is less than that vertical to bedding in both the preserved and partially dehydrated situations.No frequency dependency is observed in the preserved samples within the range of frequencies explored in this study. On the other hand partially saturated samples show peaks in attenuation at around 40 Hz when the stress perturbation is transmitted normal to the macroscopic bedding.

The results demonstrated a generally downward trend in the RBE values with increasing doses of simulated SPE radiation for leukocytes in the irradiated animals. The fitted RBE values for white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils were above 1.0 in all three radiation dose groups at all time-points evaluated, and the lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals were > 1.0 in the majority of the dose groups at different time-points, which together suggest that proton-simulated SPE radiation is more effective than electron-simulated SPE radiation in reducing the number of peripheral WBCs, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils, especially at the low end of the 5–10 Gy dose range evaluated. Other than the RBE values, the responses of leukocytes to electron-simulated SPE radiation and proton-simulated SPE radiation exposure are highly similar with respect to the time-course, the most radiosensitive cell type (the lymphocytes), and the shape of the dose—response curves, which is generally log-linear. These findings provide additional evidence that electron-simulated SPE radiation is an appropriate reference radiation for determination of RBE values for the simulated SPE radiations, and the RBE estimations using electron-simulated SPE radiation as the reference radiation are not complicated by other characteristics of the leukocyte response to radiation exposure.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227117","solar particle event;protons;blood cells;relative biological effectiveness","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The mean dose to 90% of the prostate volume at 1 month (D90) and the prostate volume receiving at least 100% dose at 1 month (V100) were 173.4 Gy and 95.8%, respectively. The median follow-up was 66 months (range, 12–94 months). The 5-year biochemical non-evidence of disease rate was 95.5% (low-risk, 94.2%; intermediate-risk, 97.3%). The 5-year freedom from clinical failure rate was 98.9% (low-risk, 98.9%; intermediate-risk, 99.2%). The initial prostate-specific antigen level was identified as a significant predictive factor for biochemical recurrence (P = 0.029). The late Grade 3 genitourinary toxicity rate was 2.0%. No patients displayed late gastrointestinal toxicity of Grade 3 or worse.

This paper presents a new efficient group signature scheme with a simple joining protocol which possesses the properties of full-traceability and full anonymity. The security of our new construction is based on the DCR assumption, strong RSA assumption, and collision resistant hash functions, which is proved in the random oracle model.

We have focused mitochondria as a target of ionizing radiation, particularly heavy ions, because mitochondria are a kind of organelles existing widely in cytoplasm. They play a vitally important role of ATP formation through the operation of electron transport chain located in the membranes, and generate reactive oxygen species as a by-product in the process of ATP production. As mitochondria are fusing or dividing depended on cell cycle, their morphology is continuously changing . Defects of these processes contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Effects of high LET irradiation, such as heavy ion bombardment, on mitochondrial morphology, however, remain to be fully elucidated. The object of this study is to reveal effects of high LET radiation on mitochondria.We have performed preliminary test experiments using X-rays. We used NMuMG (Normal murine mammary gland)-FUCCI2 cell line . Using the FUCCI2-expressing cells, we can distinguish G1 or S/G2/M phase cells as observed red or green fluorescence in their nucleus. We also labeled mitochondria by another fluorescence probe, Mitotracker Red. Kinetics of mitochondrial morphology was analyzed by the live-cell imaging technique using a fluorescence microscope. Mitochondrial images were captured at certain hours after irradiation, and classified them into three categories, namely tubes, intermediates and fragments (Fig. ).We found that X-ray irradiation of cells caused mitochondrial fragmentation, and cell population with fragmented mitochondria increased with increasing dose, and also with time after irradiation (Fig. ). Although the cells became confluent around 48 h after irradiation as indicated by the cell-nucleus color, the mitochondrial morphology was still changing. Particularly, the population of the cells with fragments showed a maximum at 96 h after irradiation when they were exposed to 8 Gy X-rays. Based on the present study, we further investigate morphological changes of mitochondria by high LET particle irradiation in future.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206879","mitochondria;cytoplasmic irradiation;FUCCI cells;live-cell imaging","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, traditional IP voice technologies which locate users based on center server are always confronted with many problems such as distributed denial of service attack, center server failure and server bottlenecks, etc. Recently, Kademlia technology has been widely used in the distributed file sharing applications. However, it only supports slow searching and locating of file resources and machines, and is not suitable for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) voice communication system. Thus, a new improved Kademlia (I-Kademlia) protocol is proposed here to achieve the requirements of high level and flexible security, quickly addressing and locating in P2P voice communication. I-Kademlia protocol is constructed based on double-layer mechanism and uses new type of kbuckets design. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed I-Kademlia protocol can realize high node locating performance than traditional Kademlia schemes. It can improve the node locating efficiency up to 20%. The Network Address Translation (NAT) traversing for private IP address IKademlia nodes are also successfully solved in the proposed scheme.","","978-1-84919-844-8","10.1049/cp.2014.0727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992220","Voice communications;P2P;Kademlia;Double-layer design;K-bucket","","","","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Morphological changes were observed in the jejunum and bone marrow, and apoptotic cells were determined in both tissues. Peripheral blood cells were counted, and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in tissues of both thymus and spleen were measured. Compared with the radiation-only group, 20 mg/kg/d simvastatin administration significantly increased the mean villi height and decreased apoptotic cells in jejunum tissue, and stimulated regeneration and reduced apoptotic cells in bone marrow. Peripheral blood cell analysis revealed that simvastatin treatment induced a larger number of red blood cells and increased the hemoglobin level present after 4 Gy of radiation. Interestingly, it was also found that the number of peripheral endothelial progenitor cells was markedly increased following simvastatin administration. Antioxidant determination for tissues displayed that simvastatin therapy increased the SOD activity after both 4 and 8 Gy of radiation, but only decreased the MDA level after 4 Gy. Simvastatin ameliorated radiation-induced tissue damage in mice. The radioprotective effect of simvastatin was possibly related to inhibition of apoptosis and improvement of oxygen-carrying and antioxidant activities.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227123","simvastatin;radiation;tissue damage;radioprotection;endothelial progenitor cells","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

First, the α/β ratio of the cells was determined from single-dose experiments, and a biologically effective dose (BED) for 20 Gy in 10 fractions (fr) was calculated. Fractional doses yielding the same BED were calculated for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 7-, 15- and 20-fraction irradiation using LQ formalism, and then irradiation with these schedules was actually given. Cell survival was determined by a standard colony assay. Differences in cell survival between pairs of groups were compared by t-test. The α/β ratio of the cells was 3.18 Gy, and 20 Gy in 10 fr corresponded to a BED 3.18 of 32.6 Gy. The effects of 7-, 15- and 20-fraction irradiation with a BED 3.18 of 32.6 Gy were similar to those of the 10-fraction irradiation, while the effects of 1- to 5-fraction irradiation were lower. In this cell line, the LQ model was considered applicable to 7- to 20-fraction irradiation or doses per fraction of 2.57 Gy or smaller.

In this study, to evaluate the role of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the radiation-induced cell death of tumor cells, we have examined the effect of 3-methyl pyruvate (MP). MP is a membrane-permeable pyruvate derivative that is capable of activating mitochondrial energy metabolism in human lung carcinoma A549 cells and murine squamous carcinoma SCCVII cells. Pretreatment with MP significantly enhanced radiation-induced cell death in both cell lines, and also led to increases in the mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular adenosine triphosphate content, and mitochondria-derived ROS production following the exposure of the cells to X-rays. In A549 cells, MP-induced radiosensitization was completely abolished by vitamin C. In contrast, it was partially abolished in SCCVII cells. These results therefore suggest that the treatment of the cells with MP induced radiosensitization via the production of excess mitochondria-derived ROS in tumor cells.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150270","3-methyl pyruvate;A549 cells;SCCVII cells;reactive oxygen species (ROS);mitochondrial metabolism;radiosensitization","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The peroxidase activity of irradiated PaPrx was preserved, and its chaperone activity was significantly increased by increasing the proton irradiation dose. The chaperone activity increased about 3–4 fold after 2.5 kGy proton irradiation, compared with that of non-irradiated PaPrx, and increased to almost the maximum activity after 10 kGy proton irradiation. We previously obtained functional switching in PaPrx proteins, by using gamma rays and electron beams as radiation sources, and found that the proteins exhibited increased chaperone activity but decreased peroxidase activity. Interestingly, in this study we newly found that proton irradiation could enhance both peroxidase and chaperone activities.

Radiation is an important component of therapy for a wide range of malignant conditions. However, it causes damage to normal cells and, hence, can result in adverse side effects. This study was conducted to examine whether HS-1793, a novel resveratrol analogue free from the restriction of metabolic instability and the high dose requirement of resveratrol, induces a protective effect against radiation-induced DNA damage. HS-1793 effectively scavenged free radicals and inhibited radiation-induced plasmid DNA strand breaks in an in vitro assay. HS-1793 significantly decreased reactive oxygen species and cellular DNA damage in 2 Gy-irradiated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells. In addition, HS-1793 dose-dependently reduced the levels of phosphorylated H2AX in irradiated CHO-K1 cells. These results indicate that HS-1793 has chemical radioprotective activity. Glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activity in irradiated CHO-K1 cells increased significantly following HS-1793 treatment. The enhanced biological anti-oxidant activity and chemical radioprotective activity of HS-1793 maintained survival of irradiated CHO-K1 cells in a clonogenic assay. Therefore, HS-1793 may be of value as a radioprotector to protect healthy tissue surrounding tumor cells during radiotherapy to obtain better tumor control with a higher dose.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150268","resveratrol analogue;HS-1793;free radical scavenging activity;reactive oxygen species (ROS);DNA strand break;radioprotection","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To compare the effectiveness of percutaneous gastrostomy and NGT feeding in patients with HNC, relevant literature was identified through Medline, Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane, Wiley and manual searches. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-experimental studies comparing percutaneous gastrostomy—including percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous fluoroscopic gastrostomy (PFG) —with NG for HNC patients. Data extraction recorded characteristics of intervention, type of study and factors that contributed to the methodological quality of the individual studies. Data were then compared with respect to nutritional status, duration of feeding, complications, radiotherapy delays, disease-free survival and overall survival.

(ii) To promote further internationalization at NIRS by active research collaboration with foreign scientists.Brief history: IOL started at the end of 2008 and its first term ended in March 2011after 2 years and four months. Drs Hirohiko Tsujii and Ohtsura Niwa were very instrumental in the establishment of IOL. The first term IOL has three unit leaders and three distinguished scientists: These are Yukio Uchihori for the Space Radiation Research unit working with Professor Tom Hei from Columbia University (USA), Takeshi Murakami for the Particle Therapy Model Research unit working with Professor Anders Brahme from Karolinska Institute (Sweden) and Ryuichi Okayasu for the Particle Radiation Molecular biology unit working with Professor Penny Jeggo, University of Sussex (UK). Dr Tsujii was named as Director of the first-term IOL. These three units scored ‘excellent’ for overall evaluation for their accomplishment by the international review committee organized in 2010. Many workshops were held by these IOL units and helped further the internationalization of NIRS.Current IOL: In April 2011, the second-term IOL began and will complete in March 2014. As for the first-term IOL, each unit was selected by a special committee organized within NIRS. The structure of the second-term IOL is shown in Fig. . This time, four units and five distinguished foreign scientists were chosen; among them, Professors Jeggo, Brahme and Hei are continuing from the first term. Many exchanges of researchers have been arranged and further collaborative publications have been produced. In one of the IOL-sponsored meetings, we were able to invite renowned radiobiologist Professor Eric Hall from Columbia University; this conference attracted many people from all over Japan. Recognition of IOL has spread to international communities as sponsored activities have been mentioned in the websites of international organizations such as CERN (Europe), Chordoma Foundation (USA), Colorado State University (USA) and GSI (Germany). IOL activities also helped attract several external grants including Japanese KAKENHI grants. Many more activities including hosting international sessions in domestic meetings and sponsoring special seminars have taken place and will continue as long as the NIRS IOL system exists. Fig 1.

A new 9-months pregnant phantom based on magnetic resonance (MR) images tied to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference voxel phantom has been developed. Maternal and fetal organs were segmented from a set of pelvic MR images of a 9-months pregnant subject using 3D-DOCTORTM and then imported into the 3D modeling software package RhinocerosTM for combining with the adult female ICRP voxel phantom and further modeling. Next, the phantom organs were rescaled to match with reference masses described in ICRP Publications. The internal anatomy of previous pregnant phantom models had been limited to the fetal brain and skeleton only, but the fetus model developed in this study incorporates 20 different organs. The current reference phantom has been developed for application in comprehensive dosimetric study in nuclear medicine. The internal dosimetry calculations were performed for thyroid agents using the Monte Carlo transport method. Biokinetic data for these radiopharmaceuticals were used to estimate cumulated activity during pregnancy and maternal and fetal organ doses at seven different maximum thyroid uptake levels. Calculating the dose distribution was also presented in a sagittal view of the pregnant model utilizing the mesh tally function. The comparisons showed, in general, an overestimation of the absorbed dose to the fetus and an underestimation of the fetal thyroid dose in previous studies compared with the values based on the current hybrid phantom.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154239","internal dosimetry;thyroid agents;hybrid phantom;pregnancy;reference phantom","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However studies have tended to investigate the optimisation of each component of the system rather than evaluating the components as part of a larger or whole system. The controller loops segmentation methodology is proposed for all main electrical and mechanical components of a 4.5MW DFIG wind turbine considering the system as a whole. However, the application of this methodology to only electrical components of the DFIG is presented in this paper. The turbine aero-mechanical dynamics are neglected since these present a slower set of dynamics. By proposing the controller loops segmentation, the electrical interactions between the inner and outer loop controllers of the rotor-side converter (RSC) and the grid-side converter (GSC) are reduced. The verification of the methodology designed in this paper is achieved by the simulation results obtained from the software programme of PSCAD.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993212","DFIG;Controller Loops Segmentation;Wind Turbines;RSC;GSC","","","","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Cell viability, proliferation and wound-healing efficacy, mitochondrial membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as well as changes in the signaling pathway related to apoptosis were investigated in fibroblasts. The therapeutic effects of EC were explored in a zebrafish model. EC increased clonogenic survival and restored the migration ability of the fibroblasts after irradiation. EC inhibited radiation-induced ROS generation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. EC significantly reduced the expression of p-JNK, p-38, and cleaved caspase-3 compared with their significant increase after radiation treatment. EC attenuated the radiation-induced embryotoxicity in a zebrafish model. These results suggest that EC represents an effective means of reducing cellular damage and facilitating wound healing after radiation exposure.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154314","radiation;epicatechin;radioprotection;fibroblast;zebrafish","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This modelling extends our earlier work on the hydrodynamics of radio galaxies as a function of their cluster environment to consider the magnetic field configuration in the lobes and its observational consequences, using a realistic model for the magnetic field in the intracluster medium, very high density contrast in the lobes and high numerical resolution. We confirm, now with a realistic magnetic field model, that lobes have characteristic trajectories in the radio power/linear size diagram which depend strongly on their environment. We investigate the detailed evolution of polarized emission, showing that the lobes evolve from the initially ordered field configuration imposed by our boundary conditions to one in which the longitudinal field comes to dominate. We obtain simulated observations of polarization whose properties are quantitatively consistent with observations. The highly spatially intermittent magnetic field also reproduces the observation that inverse-Compton emission from lobes is much smoother than synchrotron. Our simulations allow us to study the depolarizing effect of the external medium on the lobes, and so to demonstrate that Faraday depolarization from environments of the type we consider can reproduce the integrated fractional polarization properties of large samples and the observed preferential depolarization of the receding lobe.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu1229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196443","hydrodynamics;galaxies: active;galaxies: jets;galaxies: magnetic fields","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Doetsch",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i14","i14","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in amplifying the radiation-induced damage to macromolecules as well as in downstream early responses leading to DNA repair or cell death and in delayed responses leading to tissue damage and/or tumorigenesis. We found in immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC-3KT) following exposure to 1 Gy low (X-rays) or high (Fe ions) LET radiation that ROS levels persist elevated for up to eight population doublings (2 weeks) in the progeny of cells that repaired the radiation-induced damage and survived. To evaluate the function of persistently elevated ROS levels, we interrogated cells over the same period for genomic instability, proliferation and senescence biomarkers and evaluated whether ROS are functionally related to any of these phenotypes. We found that increased ROS production overlapped temporally with the persistence of reporters for genomic instability, increased micronucleus frequency and the presence of γH2AX-53BP1 positive ionizing radiation-induced foci. Although low LET radiation at high doses and high LET radiation induced a senescence-like phenotype dependent on ATM and p38 MAPK activity, this pathway was not a causative factor in ROS generation and did not affect cell proliferation rates at day 7 post-irradiation. On the contrary, when this pathway was inhibited, ROS levels increased further and micronucleus formation frequency was reduced. Because these results suggest a positive effect for increased ROS levels in the resolution of persistent micronucleus formation, their role was further confirmed by exposure to exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which resulted in a reduced micronucleus frequency. These results implicate ROS as an effector in the resolution of genomic instability and suggest that the senescence phenotype induced by high LET radiation or high low LET radiation dose promotes genomic instability by interfering with the cellular mechanism regulating ROS levels or the DNA repair machinery.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206895","reactive oxygen species;genomic instability;senescence","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These models are implemented as the systems of non-linear ordinary differential equations, whose variables and constant parameters have clear biological meaning. The modeling studies revealed general regularities and characteristic features of the dynamics of the aforementioned hematopoietic lineages in acutely and chronically irradiated humans. It is shown that the modeling predictions qualitatively and quantitatively agree with the respective clinical data for humans exposed to acute and chronic irradiation in wide ranges of doses and dose rates. The ‘lethal’ dose rate of chronic irradiation, which is evaluated in the framework of the granulocytopoiesis model, coincides with the real minimal dose rate of lethal chronic irradiation for humans. As for the thrombocytopoiesis and erythropoiesis models, the respective ‘lethal’ dose rates of chronic irradiation are very close to the real one for humans. All this bears witness to the validity of employment of the developed models in the investigation and prediction of radiation effects on human hematopoiesis. These models could provide a better understanding of the risks to health from the space radiation environment for astronauts on long-term space missions. The models could also be helpful in estimating the hazards for health of a population, which resides in contaminated areas after an accident.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206862","blood;bone marrow;humans;modeling;radiation effects","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, the survival rate of the patients is not satisfied because of the recurrence or distant metastasis. There is an urgent need to search for therapies to control the metastasis. Hyperfractionation is the mainstream of the recent radiotherapy, and the fraction size is getting smaller. Our previous study, however, showed the migration and invasion abilities of tumor cells were enhanced by low-LET radiations at the low-dose region. Small fraction size in hyperfractionation might promote the metastasis. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of non-uniformity fractionation for cell survival and metastatic potential.Materials and methods: LM8 cells having highly metastatic potential was used and cells were irradiated with two fractionated exposure (24 h interval) in this study. X-rays and carbon-ion beams were used as low- and high-LET irradiation, respectively. First non-uniformity fractionation method: cells were irradiated with the same total dose but different dose allocation (e.g. total 2 Gy, first dose is 0.5 or 1.5 Gy and second dose is 1.5 or 0.5 Gy). Second method: cells were first irradiated with C-ions and then, with X-rays.Results/discussion: The fractionation with large initial dose decreased the cell survival and migration ability compared with small initial dose even the same total dose (Fig. ). Additionally, the fractionation with high-LET initial radiation decreased the cell survival and migration ability compared with low-LET initial irradiation, and this effect was significant at low-dose region, especially (Fig. ).It is suggested that non-uniformity fractionation using the high dose and/or high-LET beams as the initial irradiation suppressed efficiently the cell survival and metastatic potential compared with uniformity fractionation and the non-uniformity fractionation may effective from viewpoint of the suppression of tumor metastasis.Conclusion: The non-uniformity dose/LET fractionation would be effective to suppress not only the tumor cell survival and tumor metastatic abilities.

A 90-Gy irradiation dose was focally delivered to the central and peripheral areas of the left mouse lung with an image-guided small-animal irradiation system. At 1, 2 and 4 weeks after irradiation, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images of the lung were taken. Lung function measurements were performed with the Flexivent® system (SCIREQ©, Montreal, Canada). For the histopathological analysis, the lungs were fixed by perfusing with formalin, and paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's Trichrome. Gross inspection clearly indicated local lung injury confined to the central and peripheral areas of the left lung. Typical histopathological alterations corresponding to clinical manifestations were observed. The micro-CT analysis results appeared to correlate with the histopathological findings. Mouse lung tissue damping increased dramatically at central settings, compared with that at the control or peripheral settings. An animal model to simulate clinical SBRT-induced central and peripheral lung injuries was developed and validated with histopathological, radiological and functional analyses.

The deviations of source position ΔP were measured with two methods. One is to measure actual source position using a check ruler device. The other is to analyze peak distances from radiographic film irradiated with 20 mm gap between the dwell positions. The composite dose errors were calculated using Gaussian distribution with ΔT and ΔP as 1σ of the measurements. Dose errors depend on dwell time and distance from the point of interest to the dwell position. To evaluate the dose error in clinical practice, dwell times and point of interest distances were obtained from actual treatment plans involving cylinder, tandem-ovoid, tandem-ovoid with interstitial needles, multiple interstitial needles, and surface-mold applicators. The ΔT and ΔP were 32 ms (maximum for various dwell times) and 0.12 mm (ruler), 0.11 mm (radiographic film).

The median doses to the high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) D90 in the conventional brachy-plan, tentative 6-Gy plan and point A dose-reduced plan were 62 GyEQD2, 80 GyEQD2 and 64 GyEQD2, respectively. The median doses of rectal D2cc in the corresponding three plans were 42 GyEQD2, 62 GyEQD2 and 51 GyEQD2, respectively. With a median follow-up period of 35 months, three patients developed Grade-1 late rectal complications and no patients developed local recurrence. Our preliminary results suggested that CT-guided brachytherapy using an individualized point A dose-reduced plan might be useful for reducing late rectal complications while maintaining primary tumor control.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154253","cervical cancer;CT-guided brachytherapy;small-sized uterus;late rectal complication;point A dose","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Heavy-ion (56Fe) irradiation leads to impaired aortic relaxation prior to atherosclerotic plaque formation in ApoE−/− mice","C. R. White; T. Yu; K. Gupta; J. H. Kabarowski; D. F. Kucik",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i42","i43","Terrestrial radiation exposure is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. For example, coronary artery disease and stroke are both well-established adverse effects of therapeutic radiation, especially for breast and head-and-neck cancers . Similarly, atomic bomb survivors were significantly more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than their countrymen . Even radiation technologists, prior to 1950 (when regulations governing shielding and occupational exposure were less rigorous), had an increased risk of clinically significant atherosclerosis . Although the character of the radiation in interplanetary space is very different from that encountered on Earth, there is concern that exposure to this cosmic radiation might pose a similar risk for astronauts. Decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilation is thought to predispose humans to the development of structural vascular changes that precede development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effect of 56Fe, an important component of cosmic radiation, on vascular relaxation. At the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory, 10-week-old apoE−/− mice (an age at which there is little atherosclerotic plaque in the descending aorta) were exposed to 2.6 Gy 56Fe, a dose in the range that was shown previously to accelerate the development of atherosclerotic plaques in this mouse model at 13 weeks post-exposure . The mice were then transferred to the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where they were housed under standard conditions and fed a normal diet. At 4–5 weeks post-irradiation, aortic rings were isolated and endothelial-dependent relaxation in irradiated mice was compared with that of age-matched controls from un-irradiated apoE mice and from un-irradiated wild-type mice of the same C57BL/6 genetic background. Aortic relaxation was not significantly different between un-irradiated apoE−/− mice and un-irradiated wild-type C57BL/6 mice, consistent with previous studies. 56Fe radiation, however, resulted in significantly impaired relaxation in response to acetylcholine. This suggests that heavy-ion radiation exposure leads to impairment of normal vascular reactivity prior to the appearance of atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting that it may be a driving force, rather than a consequence, of radiation-induced accelerated atherosclerosis.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206902","cardiovascular;atherosclerosis;56Fe;mouse;aorta;heavy ions","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Updating of HIMAC beam delivery with broad beam method","M. Mizota; S. Fukuda",NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i106","i106","Carbon ion radiotherapy at HIMAC started in 1994 using two horizontal and two vertical beam ports with broad beam method. The maximum beam energy extracted from accelerators was 400 MeV/n for the horizontal beam port, and 350 MeV/n for the vertical one. In recent years, the scope of diseases that can be treated by the carbon ion radiotherapy has widened and their tumor targets have varied in dimension and location. So, situations of shortage in the beam range in treatment planning have increased.In order to provide sufficient dose to the deeply seated target, we adopted higher energy beam, that is, 430 and 400 MeV/n for the horizontal port and the vertical port, respectively. For the introduction of the new energy beams, we carried out the following.(1) Adjustment of new parameter-sets of the accelerators for the high-energy beams.(2) Replacement of ridge filters with the redesigned ones for the high-energy beams.(3) Updating irradiation condition tables in the irradiation control system and registering new beam data in the treatment planning system, on the base of dose distribution measurements.As a result, the beam range for horizontal port and vertical port was extended ∼30 and 50 mm, respectively. This allows us to treat all patients without ingenuity of patient's posturing and beam weight for each direction.On the other hand, adding new operational energies leads to a decrease in whole throughput, because it takes time to switch among the beam energies. We have at the same time simplified the procedures for the dose calibration and beam adjustment in the switching of energy.The broad beam method has reached maturity as a standard irradiation method of carbon ion radiotherapy and has achieved superior clinical results. We will continue to make upgrades this system with maintenance of its performance and improve the usability of this systems.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206870","HIMAC;heavy ion radiotherapy;broad beam method;beam energy","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is of fundamental importance to understand the properties of the phenotypes under radiation and chemical treatments, for CSCs are regarded as the source of tumor dormancy as well as recurrence after apparently successful debulking of human solid tumors by various forms of therapy. To understand the DNA damages and repairs in CSCs/NSCCs post-radiation, currently sorted CSCs/NSCCs were irradiated with microbeam irradiation system, SPICE of NIRS . The results showed that the aggregation of 53BP1 and XRCC1 are in a dose-dependent manner from 20 to 200 protons per nucleus targeted with proton microbeam of 2 µm in diameter. In addition, compared with NSCCs, there is lower average-related fluorescence unit in 53BP1 foci induced by proton radiation, indicating CSCs might be more radio-resistant than that of NSCCs. Importantly, significant higher diffusion rate of the fluorescence also observed in CSCs than that of NSCCs, indicating that CSCs may have higher repair efficiency than that of NSCCs post-proton irradiation. In addition, the radiation-induced bystander effects in CSCs and NSCCs were also studied via the aggregation of 53BP1.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206868","cancer stem cells;53BP1;SPICE microbeam facility;proton irradiation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this study the correlation between size of lymph nodes and control doses of RT was analyzed. Between January 2002 and December 2007, 245 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated with a combination of external beam irradiation with or without boost irradiation and high-dose rate brachytherapy were investigated. Size of lymph node was measured by computed tomography before RT and just after 50 Gy RT. Of the 245 patients, 78 had PLN metastases, and a total of 129 had enlarged PLNs diagnosed as metastases; 22 patients had PLN failure. The PLN control rate at 5 years was 79.5% for positive cases and 95.8% for negative cases. In cases with positive PLNs, 12 of 129 nodes (9.3%) developed recurrences. There was significant correlation between PLN control rate and size of PLN after 50 Gy (<10 mm: 96.7%, ≥ 10 mm: 75.7 % (P<0.001)). In addition, the recurrence in these poor-response nodes was significantly correlated with dose of RT. Nine of 16 nodes receiving ≤ 58 Gy had recurrence, but none of 21 nodes receiving > 58 Gy had recurrence (P = 0.0003). These results suggested that the response of lymph nodes after RT was a more significant predictive factor for recurrence than size of lymph node before RT, and poor-response lymph nodes might require boost irradiation at a total dose of > 58 Gy.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154326","uterine cervical cancer;radiation therapy;boost irradiation;lymph node metastasis;pelvic lymph node","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Road-cuts on the flanks of the nearby Nevado de Colima edifice expose pre-1913 air-fall tephra, pyroclastic flow and ash-rich surge deposits resulting from numerous highly explosive events throughout the Holocene. The majority of the pumice and scoria fallout deposits are medium-K subalkaline basaltic andesite and andesite in composition, defining a clear major element differentiation trend. In contrast, three newly discovered scoria fallout deposits are high-K subalkaline, transitional to alkaline, basaltic andesite in composition and are characterized by the presence of phlogopite; these deposits have high MgO (up to 7·9 wt %), K2O (up to 2·6 wt %) and P2O5 (up to 0·67 wt %) contents. They are also strongly enriched in fluid- and melt-mobile large ion lithophile elements (LILE; Rb, Ba, K, Sr and Th) and light REE (LREE; La, Ce, Pr and Nd) relative to the majority of the Colima tephra fallout deposits. Strontium and Nd isotope systematics reveal that the high-K mafic scoria have more radiogenic Sr (87Sr/86Sr = 0·70365–0·70408) and less radiogenic Nd (143Nd/144Nd = 0·51279–0·51294) compared with the majority of the subalkaline tephras (87Sr/86Sr = 0·70338–0·70371 and 143Nd/144Nd = 0·51290–0·51295). Two-component mixing models, using whole-rock geochemical data, indicate the importance of magma mixing in the petrogenesis of the Colima magmas, with addition of up to 50% by volume of an alkaline mafic magma component in the most potassic magmas. This is supported by mineral chemistry and textural data, which reveal multiple episodes of decompression and magma mingling within a shallow crustal magma storage region. The presence of these potassic tephra fall deposits among the otherwise prevailing medium-K subalkaline stratigraphy indicates that pulses of K-rich alkaline mafic magmas periodically enter the CVC plumbing system on timescales of a few thousand years and may trigger Plinian explosive eruptions.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egu053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8181823","tephra;alkaline;Colima;subduction;slab;pyroclastic fall","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The organ doses for 131Iodine, 123Iodine and 99mTc incorporated into the body were calculated for the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference voxel phantoms using the Monte Carlo transport method. A comparison between different thyroid uptakes of iodine in the range of 0–55% was made, and the effect of various techniques for administration of 99mTc on organ doses was studied. To investigate the necessity of calculating organ dose from all source regions, the major source organ and its contribution to total dose were specified for each target organ. Moreover, we compared effective dose in ICRP voxel phantoms with that in stylized phantoms. In our method, we directly calculated the organ dose without using the S values or SAFs, as is commonly done. Hence, a distribution of the absorbed dose to entire tissues was obtained. The chord length distributions (CLDs) were also computed for the selected source–target pairs to make comparison across the genders. The results showed that the S values for radionuclides in the thyroid are not sufficient for calculating the organ doses, especially for 123I and 99mTc. The thyroid and its neighboring organs receive a greater dose as thyroid uptake increases. Our comparisons also revealed an underestimation of organ doses reported for the stylized phantoms compared with the values based on the ICRP voxel phantoms in the uptake range of 5–55%, and an overestimation of absorbed dose by up to 2-fold for Iodine administration using blocking agent and for 99mTc incorporation.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150255","internal dosimetry;thyroid agents;voxel phantoms;Monte-Carlo method","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Setup error was corrected based on bony structure. The differences in overall survival (OS), local control (LC) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated to compare patients treated with AC (n = 22) and without AC (n = 25). The median follow-up was 42.6 months (range, 1.4–94.6 months). The differences in the 3-year OS, LC and DFS rate between the two groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.909, 0.209 and 0.639, respectively). However, the largest difference was observed in the LC rate, which was 82.5% (95% CI, 54.9–94.0%) for patients treated without AC and 65.4% (95% CI, 40.2–82.0%) for those treated with AC. After stratifying the patients into prognostic groups based on sex and T-stage, the LC difference increased in the group with an unfavourable prognosis.

"A branching process model for the analysis of abortive colony size distributions in carbon ion-irradiated normal human fibroblasts","T. Sakashita; N. Hamada; I. Kawaguchi; T. Hara; Y. Kobayashi; K. Saito",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","3","423","431","A single cell can form a colony, and ionizing irradiation has long been known to reduce such a cellular clonogenic potential. Analysis of abortive colonies unable to continue to grow should provide important information on the reproductive cell death (RCD) following irradiation. Our previous analysis with a branching process model showed that the RCD in normal human fibroblasts can persist over 16 generations following irradiation with low linear energy transfer (LET) γ-rays. Here we further set out to evaluate the RCD persistency in abortive colonies arising from normal human fibroblasts exposed to high-LET carbon ions (18.3 MeV/u, 108 keV/µm). We found that the abortive colony size distribution determined by biological experiments follows a linear relationship on the log–log plot, and that the Monte Carlo simulation using the RCD probability estimated from such a linear relationship well simulates the experimentally determined surviving fraction and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). We identified the short-term phase and long-term phase for the persistent RCD following carbon-ion irradiation, which were similar to those previously identified following γ-irradiation. Taken together, our results suggest that subsequent secondary or tertiary colony formation would be invaluable for understanding the long-lasting RCD. All together, our framework for analysis with a branching process model and a colony formation assay is applicable to determination of cellular responses to low- and high-LET radiation, and suggests that the long-lasting RCD is a pivotal determinant of the surviving fraction and the RBE.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150257","branch dynamics;delayed reproductive cell death;non-targeted effect;ionizing radiation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To deal with these difficulties, a novel nonparametric statistics based on the ‘integrate-and-fire’ algorithm of artificial neural networks was developed and tested in cancer databases established by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation. The analysis revealed unique features at low doses that could not be accounted for by nominal exposure dose, including (i) the presence of a threshold that varied with organ, gender and age at exposure, and (ii) a small but significant bumping increase in cancer risk at low doses in Nagasaki that probably reflects internal exposure to 239Pu. The threshold was distinct from the canonical definition of zero effect in that it was manifested as negative excess relative risk, or suppression of background cancer rates. Such a unique tissue response at low doses of radiation exposure has been implicated in the context of the molecular basis of radiation–environment interplay in favor of recently emerging experimental evidence on DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice and its epigenetic memory by histone marking.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150261","cancer risk;low-dose radiation;A-bomb survivors;artificial neural networks;integrate-and-fire model;DSB repair pathway choice","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Among 59 patients with local advanced disease, 31 patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (chemo-RT) with a regimen consisting of 135 mg/m2 paclitaxel on Day 1 and 25 mg/m2 cisplatin on Days 1–3. The median follow-up period was 42 months. The local control rate (LCR), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 93.3%, 90.3% and 91.6% at 3 years, and 87.6%, 87.9% and 85.7% at 5 years, respectively. There was no significant difference in outcome with respect to these three indicators for Stage III and IV disease treated with/without concurrent chemoradiotherapy (P > 0.05). Acute toxicities included Grade 3 mucositis, skin desquamation, and leucopenia, which occurred in 78 (80.4%), 8 (8.2%), and 45 (46.4%) patients, respectively. No patient had a Grade 3–4 late toxicity. SMART was associated with a favorable outcome for NPC with acceptable toxicity. The local-regional control was excellent but distant metastasis remains the main risk. The combination of SMART and chemotherapy needs to be optimized through further studies to enhance outcomes for locally advanced diseases.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154259","intensity-modulated radiotherapy;nasopharygeal carcinoma;prognosis;simultaneous modulated accelerated radiotherapy;toxicity","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Methods: We developed a Markov model to describe health states of 6-year-old children with medulloblastoma after treatment with proton or X-ray radiotherapy. The risks of hearing loss were calculated on cochlear dose for each treatment. Three types of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of EQ-5D, HUI3 and SF-6D were used for estimation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for proton beam therapy compared with X-ray radiotherapy was calculated for each HRQOL. Sensitivity analyses were performed to model uncertainty in these parameters. Results: The ICER for EQ-5D, HUI3 and SF-6D were $21 716/QALY, $11 773/QALY, and $20 150/QALY, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses found that the results were sensitive to discount rate, the risk of hearing loss after proton therapy, and costs of proton irradiation. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analysis revealed a 99% probability of proton therapy being cost effective at a societal willingness-to-pay value. Conclusions: Proton beam therapy with cochlear dose reduction improves health outcomes at a cost that is within the acceptable cost-effectiveness range from the payer's standpoint.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227120","medulloblastoma;proton therapy;cost effectiveness;hearing loss","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Classification of radiation effects for dose limitation purposes: history, current situation and future prospects","N. Hamada; Y. Fujimichi",NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","4","629","640","Radiation exposure causes cancer and non-cancer health effects, each of which differs greatly in the shape of the dose–response curve, latency, persistency, recurrence, curability, fatality and impact on quality of life. In recent decades, for dose limitation purposes, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has divided such diverse effects into tissue reactions (formerly termed non-stochastic and deterministic effects) and stochastic effects. On the one hand, effective dose limits aim to reduce the risks of stochastic effects (cancer/heritable effects) and are based on the detriment-adjusted nominal risk coefficients, assuming a linear-non-threshold dose response and a dose and dose rate effectiveness factor of 2. On the other hand, equivalent dose limits aim to avoid tissue reactions (vision-impairing cataracts and cosmetically unacceptable non-cancer skin changes) and are based on a threshold dose. However, the boundary between these two categories is becoming vague. Thus, we review the changes in radiation effect classification, dose limitation concepts, and the definition of detriment and threshold. Then, the current situation is overviewed focusing on (i) stochastic effects with a threshold, (ii) tissue reactions without a threshold, (iii) target organs/tissues for circulatory disease, (iv) dose levels for limitation of cancer risks vs prevention of non-life-threatening tissue reactions vs prevention of life-threatening tissue reactions, (v) mortality or incidence of thyroid cancer, and (vi) the detriment for tissue reactions. For future discussion, one approach is suggested that classifies radiation effects according to whether effects are life threatening, and radiobiological research needs are also briefly discussed.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154265","tissue reactions;stochastic effects;threshold;detriment;life-threatening effects;non-life-threatening effects","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Yokoya",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i120","i121","It has been recognized that bystander effect is one of the key factors for radiobiological effects, particularly in low-dose region. Although <1% of cell nuclei were actually traversed by an alpha particle, 30% of the cells showed an increased frequency of sister chromatid exchanges at very low dose (0.31 mGy) of alpha particles exposed to a CHO culture dish . Since then, a number of studies including high LET microbeam experiments have revealed that the bystander effect is possibly mediated through both gap-junction signal transfer and releasing bystander-transmitter molecules from the irradiated cell into medium. Although it has particularly been given considerable attention to the latter process, however, the signal transfer through medium seems very specific to the artificially system of monolayer culture dishes, which are substantially different from in vivo system in which cells contact each other to form a functionally three-dimensional (3D) structure. Bystander signals must mainly be transferred through gap junctions.In order to examine bystander effects in the 3D cell system, we have developed a HeLa-FUCCI spheroid system. FUCCI (Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator) cells show specific colors of cell nuclei depending on cell cycle. Thus, we can easily trace cell-cycle modifications by irradiation. We observed bystander cell-cycle delay as preliminary tests using monolayer culture of the HeLa-FUCCI cells. It will be very interesting to examine whether the cell-cycle effect also appear in the 3D cell system exposed to single high LET particles. We have studied suitable conditions for the spheroid culture, such as size of spheroids and methods of stable fixing a spheroid in a dish to perform the microbeam irradiation, and observation of the cell cycles of each cell in a spheroid after irradiation using time-lapse micro-imaging technique. The first day of the culture, single cells were seeded in a commercial 96-well multi-plate.A typical spheroid image observed for 3 days after seeding was shown in Fig. . The cells substantially formed a 3D structure of spheroid, in which the cells showed different cell cycle as shown by green (S/G2) and red (G1). This result indicates that the cells in a spheroid keep cell division to grow. We further investigate the effect of high LET particle irradiation on cell cycle in a spheroid in the future.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206878","bystander effect;3D cell culture;spheroid;FUCCI-HeLa;cell-cycle arrest","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Hei",NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i17","i17","Although radiation is a well-established human carcinogen, the mechanism of how radiation induces cancer is not clear. High linear energy transfer (LET) particles such as those used in radiotherapy and found in the natural radiation environment in space are potent clastogens that induce chromosomal breakages and present a potential mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor genes. Indeed, using an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line, we show previously that high LET radiation, including alpha and HZE particles, induces a stepwise neoplastic transformation of these cells and a consistent downregulation of the tumor suppressor TGFBI gene. Furthermore, there is recent evidence that targeted cytoplasmic irradiation induces changes in mitochondrial morphology. Mitochondria are the energy center of a cell and normal mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that move along microtubules or microfilaments and continuously fuse and divide in healthy cells. A balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission is essential to maintain normal mitochondrial function. In contrast, irradiated cells show shortened and fragmented mitochondria together with a reduction in mitochondrial functions. These included reduced cytochrome C-oxidase as well as succinate dehydrogenase activities when compared with non-irradiated controls, suggestive of reduced respiratory metabolism. Furthermore, irradiated airway epithelial cells showed an increase in mitochondrial superoxide production that was quenched by the radical scavenger, dimethyl sulfoxide. This acute mitochondrial response caused by cytoplasmic irradiation may result in the release of several stress mediators, which are necessary for mitochondria to preserve cellular homeostasis. The observation that progeny of mammalian cells that are irradiation through the cytoplasm show evidence of genomic instability highlights the functional role of mitochondrial damage in radiation carcinogenesis.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206882","space radiation;tumor suppressor;mitochondrial fusion and fission;genomic instability","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A template of region of interests (ROIs) was defined on the anterior—posterior (AP) beam's eye view, and WEL measurements were made over these ROIs to quantify chest wall thickness variations. Interfractional proton dose distributions were calculated to assess changes in the expected dose distributions caused by range variations. Mean intrafractional chest wall WEL changes during respiration varied by: −4.1 mm (<−10.2 mm), −3.6 mm (<−7.1 mm), −3.2 mm (<−5.6 mm) and −2.5 mm (<−5.1 mm) during respiration in the ITV, upper, middle and lower lung regions, respectively. The mean interfractional chest wall WEL variation at Week 6 decreased by −4.0 mm (<−8.6 mm), −9.1 mm (<−17.9 mm), −9.4 mm (<−25.3 mm) and −4.5 mm (<−15.6 mm) in the ITV, upper, middle and lower lung regions, respectively. The variations were decomposed into anterior and posterior chest wall thickness changes. Dose overshoot beyond the target was observed when the initial boli was applied throughout the treatment course. This overshoot is due to chest wall thickness variations and target positional variations. The radiological path length can vary significantly during respiration as well as over the course of several weeks of charged particle therapy. Intrafractional/interfractional chest wall thickness changes can be a significant source of range variation in treatment of lung tumors with charged particle beams, resulting in dose distribution perturbations from the initial plan. Consideration of these range variations should be made in choosing the therapeutic charged particle beam range.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227122","charged particle radiotherapy;intrafractional range variation;interfractional range variation;dose distribution perturbation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dosimetric verification of IMAT treatment plans using a 2D diode array detector (2D array), radiochromic film (RCF) and radiosensitive polymer gel dosimeter (RPGD). The specific verification plans were created for IMAT for two prostate cancer patients by use of the clinical treatment plans. Accordingly, the IMAT deliveries were performed with the 2D array on a gantry-mounting device, RCF in a cylindrical acrylic phantom, and the RPGD in two cylindrical phantoms. After the irradiation, the planar dose distributions from the 2D array and the RCFs, and the 3D dose distributions from the RPGD measurements were compared with the calculated dose distributions using the gamma analysis method (3% dose difference and 3-mm distance-to-agreement criterion), dose-dependent dose difference diagrams, dose difference histograms, and isodose distributions. The gamma passing rates of 2D array, RCFs and RPGD for one patient were 99.5%, 96.5% and 93.7%, respectively; the corresponding values for the second patient were 97.5%, 92.6% and 92.9%. Mean percentage differences between the RPGD measured and calculated doses in 3D volumes containing PTVs were –0.29 ± 7.1% and 0.97 ± 7.6% for the two patients, respectively. In conclusion, IMAT prostate plans can be delivered with high accuracy, although the 3D measurements indicated less satisfactory agreement with the treatment plans, mainly due to the dosimetric inaccuracy in low-dose regions of the RPGD measurements.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150267","IMAT;dosimetric verification;3D dose measurement;radiosensitive polymer gel;radiochromic films;2D array detector","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Reproducibility of IMRT dose delivery to HN regions can be critically influenced by treatment-related changes in body contours. Moreover, some set-up margins may not be adaptable to positional uncertainties of HN structures at every treatment. To obtain evidence for appropriate set-up margins in various head and neck areas, we prospectively evaluated positional deviation (δ values) of four bony landmarks (i.e. the clivus and occipital protuberance for the head region, and the mental protuberance and C5 for the neck region) using megavoltage cone-beam computed tomography during a treatment course. Over 800 δ values were analyzed in each translational direction. Positional uncertainties for HN cancer patients undergoing IMRT were evaluated relative to the body mass index. Low positional accuracy was observed for the neck region compared with the head region. For the head region, most of the δ was distributed within ±5 mm, and use of the current set-up margin was appropriate. However, the δ values for the neck region were within ±8 mm. Especially for overweight patients, a few millimeters needed to be added to give an adequate set-up margin. For accurate dose delivery to targets and to avoid excess exposure to normal tissues, we recommend that the positional verification process be performed before every treatment.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150271","positional accuracy;body mass index;head and neck;IMRT;MV-CBCT","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Hence, we propose a new entropy measurement base on the node importance to measure complex networks' robustness to attacks. The experimental analysis shows that the importance-based entropy measure describes the robustness properties of complex networks precisely which are in consistent with the well-known conclusion and it distinguishes the difference between the scale-free networks and random networks more obviously.","","978-1-84919-844-8","10.1049/cp.2014.0726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992219","complex network;entropy;node importance;intentional attack;random failures","","","","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

These events consist primarily of low energy protons that produce a highly inhomogeneous dose distribution. Due to this inherent dose heterogeneity, experiments designed to investigate the radiobiological effects of SPE radiation present difficulties in evaluating and interpreting dose to sensitive organs. To address this challenge, we used the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation framework to develop dosimetry software that uses computed tomography (CT) images and provides radiation transport simulations incorporating all relevant physical interaction processes. We found that this simulation accurately predicts measured data in phantoms and can be applied to model dose in radiobiological experiments with animal models exposed to charged particle (electron and proton) beams. This study clearly demonstrates the value of Monte Carlo radiation transport methods for two critically interrelated uses: (i) determining the overall dose distribution and dose levels to specific organ systems for animal experiments with SPE-like radiation, and (ii) interpreting the effect of random and systematic variations in experimental variables (e.g. animal movement during long exposures) on the dose distributions and consequent biological effects from SPE-like radiation exposure. The software developed and validated in this study represents a critically important new tool that allows integration of computational and biological modeling for evaluating the biological outcomes of exposures to inhomogeneous SPE-like radiation dose distributions, and has potential applications for other environmental and therapeutic exposure simulations.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8227126","solar particle event;Monte Carlo;dosimetry;animal models;radiobiology;inhomogeneous dose distribution;stopping beams","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, simulated calculations and measurements have predicted that secondary particles resulting from the shielding of cosmic rays produce a significant fraction of the total dose and dose equivalent. In this study, we investigated the biological effects of secondary radiation with two cell types, and with cells exposed in different phases of the cell cycle, by comparing the biological effects of a 200 MeV/u iron beam with a shielded beam in which the energy of the iron ion beam was decreased from 500 MeV/u to 200 MeV/u with PMMA, polyethylene (PE), or aluminum. We found that beam shielding resulted in increased induction of 53BP1 foci and micronuclei in a cell-type-dependent manner compared with the unshielded 200 MeV/u Fe ion beam. These findings provide experimental proof that the biological effects of secondary particles resulting from the interaction between HZE particles and shielding materials should be considered in shielding design.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154307","space radiation;shielding;secondary particles;survival;DNA damage","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To better understand the processes causing mountains to form at great distances from a plate boundary, we analyse passive source seismic data collected on 40 broad-band stations of the MANAS project (2005–2007) and 12 stations of the permanent KRNET seismic network to determine variations in crustal thickness and shear wave speed across the range. We jointly invert P- and S-wave receiver functions with surface wave observations from both earthquakes and ambient noise to reduce the ambiguity inherent in the images obtained from the techniques applied individually. Inclusion of ambient noise data improves constraints on the upper crust by allowing dispersion measurements to be made at shorter periods. Joint inversion can also reduce the ambiguity in interpretation by revealing the extent to which various features in the receiver functions are amplified or eliminated by interference from multiples. The resulting wave speed model shows a variation in crustal thickness across the range. We find that crustal velocities extend to ∼75 km beneath the Kokshaal Range, which we attribute to underthrusting of the Tarim Basin beneath the southern Tien Shan. This result supports the plate model of intracontinental convergence. Crustal thickness elsewhere beneath the range is about 50 km, including beneath the Naryn Valley in the central Tien Shan where previous studies reported a shallow Moho. This difference apparently is the result of wave speed variations in the upper crust that were not previously taken into account. Finally, a high velocity lid appears in the upper mantle of the Central and Northern part of the Tien Shan, which we interpret as a remnant of material that may have delaminated elsewhere under the range.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggu225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8230471","Tomography;Surface waves and free oscillations;Intra-plate processes;Continental tectonics: compressional;Crustal structure;Asia","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These data are then used to map the stress state in the lithosphere of the downgoing plate as it bends into the subduction zone. Our results provide new constraints on the faulting of oceanic lithosphere at the outer rise, which is important for understanding the transmission of plate-driving forces through the subduction system. In all cases, shallow normal-faulting earthquakes are observed at the top of the plate, and are separated in depth from any deeper thrust-faulting earthquakes. No temporal variation associated with large thrust-faulting earthquakes on the subduction interface is seen in the depth extent of each type of faulting at the outer rise. The transition depth from trench-normal extension to compression is found to vary in agreement with models in which deformation is driven by the combination of in-plane stresses and bending stresses, resulting principally from slab pull. Combining the seismologically derived constraints on the thickness of the elastic core of the plate with estimates of the plate curvature, we place upper bounds on the strength of the lithosphere at the outer rise, which is required to be≲300 MPa for a constant yield stress model, or governed by an effective coefficient of friction of≲0.3.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggu013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8144273","Earthquake source observations;Rheology and friction of fault zones;Dynamics and mechanics of faulting;Lithospheric flexure;Rheology: crust and lithosphere","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Accurate evaluation of wind shear distribution lays a solid foundation for series of works on the early stage of wind farm development. However, it is challenging to precisely fit the wind shear exponent, especially its distribution, since it is variable with time, location, roughness, height, atmospheric stability, etc. In this paper, a new method for modeling wind shear exponent is proposed considering separate wind speed range. Moreover, for the sake of practical application, the calculation method for wind shear is presented by projection from measurement height to hub height. First, the variation laws of wind shear exponent with different time scale, height and spatial scale are revealed based on measured data from a wind farm installing two met masts. And then, the appropriate mathematical model is established to fit the temporal-spatial distribution discipline in a wind farm. To take a wind farm as example, the proposed model is validated by cross verification of two met masts. The results show that the wind shear exponent at one met mast can be projected by the links with wind shear distribution at other masts. The proposed method provides more accurate way for data interpolation of met mast data, wind resource assessment and wind turbine load calculation.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993211","wind shear exponent;temporal-spatial distribution;fitting method","","","","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

A total of 85 metastases in 78 patients, including tumors >30 cm3 (4 cm in diameter) were treated with five-fraction CyberKnife radiotherapy with a median marginal dose of 31 Gy at a median prescribed isodose of 58%. Changes in the neurological manifestations, local tumor control, and adverse effects were investigated after treatment. The surrounding brain volumes circumscribed with 28.8 Gy (single dose equivalent to 14 Gy: V14) were measured to evaluate the risk of radiation necrosis. Neurological manifestations, such as motor weakness, visual disturbances and aphasia improved in 28 of 55 patients (50.9%). Local tumor control was obtained in 79 of 85 metastases (92.9%) during a median follow-up of eight months. Symptomatic edema occurred in 10 patients, and two of them (2.6%) required surgical resection because of radiation necrosis. The V14 of these patients was 3.0–19.7 cm3. There were 16 lesions with a V14 of <7.0 cm3, and two of these lesions developed extensive brain edema due to radiation necrosis. None of the patients with a V14 of <7.0 cm3 exhibited edema requiring surgical intervention. We therefore conclude that a high rate of local tumor control and low rates of complications can be obtained after five-fraction CyberKnife radiotherapy for large metastases in critical areas.

However, radiation pneumonitis (RP) is still a major problem after HRT. To determine the significant parameters associated with developing RP, we retrospectively investigated data from patients with lung metastases treated with HRT using helical tomotherapy. A total of 45 patients were included in the study and the median age was 53 years old. The median prescriptive doses were 50 Gy to the internal target volume and 40 Gy to the planning target volume in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. RP was diagnosed by chest X-ray or computed tomography after HRT, and its severity was determined by CTCAE version 4.0. The incidence of symptomatic RP was 26.6%. Univariate analysis indicated that mean lung doses, V5, V10, V15, V20 and V25 were associated with the development of symptomatic RP (P < 0.05). However, multivariate analysis indicated that only V5 was associated with the development of symptomatic RP (P = 0.019). From the ROC curve, V5 was the most powerful predictor of symptomatic RP, and its AUC (area under curve) was 0.780 (P = 0.004). In addition, the threshold value of V5 for the development of symptomatic RP was 65%. A large distribution of low-dose radiation resulted in a higher risk of lung toxicity. So, to prevent symptomatic RP, it is recommended that the V5 be limited to <65%, in addition to considering conventional dosimetric factors. However, further clinical study must be undertaken in order to confirm this result.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154309","low-dose radiation distribution;radiation pneumonitis;hypofractionated radiotherapy;helical tomotherapy;pulmonary metastases","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Maximum contact metamorphic temperatures in quartzo-feldspathic gneisses were determined in two sample traverses across the aureole on the western contact of the intrusion using a combination of microstructural observations (both optical and cathodoluminescence) and the titanium-in-quartz (TitaniQ) thermometer. The onset of recrystallization of the quartz in the gneisses occurred between 390 and 340 m from the contact whereas H2O-fluxed melting occurred in gneisses closer than 130 m from the contact (where T > ∼ 675°C). The maximum temperature recorded by quartz at the contact is ∼865 ± 70°C. Melt fractions reach 50–60 vol. % in some samples although the melt is heterogeneously distributed on all scales. Minor bands of amphibolite-facies mafic gneiss are extensively reacted to an anhydrous pyroxene-bearing hornfels close to the contact, whereas those further than ∼130 m are overprinted by a greenschist-facies assemblage. Discrepancies between the expected temperature for the amphibolite- to greenschist-facies reaction and temperatures obtained from adjacent quartzo-feldspathic gneisses are consistent with the formation of the anhydrous pyroxene hornfels directly from the mafic gneiss, with the lower-grade greenschist-facies assemblage forming on the retrograde path after the establishment of limited hydrothermal activity. It is unlikely that devolatilization reactions in the gneiss produced sufficient H2O to account for the pegmatitic features formed in the Marginal Border Series in the intrusion. A simple one-dimensional thermal model, neglecting any advection of heat by hydrothermal circulation, was fitted to the profile of maximum temperature through the aureole. The generally lower temperatures seen in the gneiss compared with those previously reported for the contact metamorphosed basalts higher up the walls of the intrusion are consistent with a heterogeneous release of latent heat of crystallization.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egu035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8181735","metamorphic aureole;Skaergaard;cathodoluminescence;titanium-in-quartz thermometry","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The experiments were performed, simulating the case where one of two 125I sources of Oncoseed 6711 was lacking strength by 4–48%. As a result, the calculation without regression was in agreement with the GRD measurement within 26–62%. In this case, the shortage in strength of a source was neglected. By the regression, in order to reflect the strength shortage, the agreement was improved up to 17–24%.

Flyback inverter traditionally operates in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) or boundary conduction mode (BCM) due to its simplicity in controller design. In this study, the controller has been designed for continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation in order to reduce component stress and increase power density. The current control is based on the primary side, which is an indirect regulation for the grid outflow. A small signal model is also developed for the controller synthesis.

In this study, the correlation between the planning target volume (PTV) and the dose delivery is investigated by separation of the heterogeneity correction effects into photon attenuation and electron transport. Under Institutional Review Board exemption status, 74 patients with lung cancer who were treated with SBRT were retrospectively evaluated. All treatment plans were generated using an anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) of an Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) treatment planning system. Two additional plans were created using the same treatment parameters (monitor units, beam angles and energy): a plan with no heterogeneity correction (NC), and a plan calculated with a pencil beam convolution algorithm (PBC). Compared with NC, AAA and PBC isocenter doses were on average 13.4% and 21.8% higher, respectively. The differences in the isocenter dose and the dose coverage for 95% of the PTV (D 95% ) between PBC and AAA were correlated logarithmically (ρ = 0.78 and ρ = 0.46, respectively) with PTV. Although D 95% calculated with AAA was in general 2.9% larger than that for NC, patients with a small PTV showed a negative ΔD 95% for AAA due to the significant effect of electron transport. The PTV volume shows logarithmic correlation with the effects of the lateral electron transport. These findings indicate that the dosimetric metrics and prescription, especially in clinical trials, should be clearly evaluated in the context of target volume characteristics and with proper heterogeneity correction.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154244","heterogeneity corrections;lung cancer;stereotactic body radiotherapy;radiation dosimetry","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have chosen to use a lung cancer susceptible (LA-1 K-Ras) mouse model to examine the effects of heavy ion (56Fe−) and simulated solar particle events (SPEs) on cancer progression. The long-term goal of the study is to assess the risk of developing invasive cancers in this mouse model and to extrapolate the data to human risk projections. The murine model (LA-1) randomly expresses mutated K-RAS in a subset of lung cells resulting in initiation and formation of lesions that mimic lung cancer progression in humans. Greater than 50% of the mice with oncogenic K-ras expression die in less than a year with a small percentage of mutant mice living to a maximum of ∼600 days. About 9% of LA-1 mice spontaneously develop invasive non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas. We have compared this lung cancer susceptible mouse model with another mouse model of susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) . About 6% of CDX2P-Cre, APC+/loxP (CPC;Apc) mice spontaneously develop invasive cancers. Although the risk of normal mice to tumorigenesis upon exposure to low and high linear energy transfer radiation has been studied in the past, very limited data are available on progression of cancer-susceptible mice to more advanced, perhaps fatal, invasive cancers.Initial studies included administrating whole-body proton irradiation as a simulated SPE of 2.0 Gy over 2 h with a wide range of energies (50–150 MeV). Histopathological analysis of the irradiated LA-1 and CPC;Apc mice 1 year post-ionizing radiation (IR) demonstrated a progression in tumor grade (in the lung from 9 to 19% and in the colon from 6 to 21%). Thus, 2.0 Gy SPE demonstrated a significant increase in the progression of invasive adenocarcinomas in the lung and colon. In previous studies using the LA-1 mouse model 70 days post-fractionated 1.0 Gy 1 GeV/n 56Fe− IR, there was an increased expression of inflammatory factors within the lung (∼200 days prior to the observation of invasive cancer). In studies on the CPC;Apc mice 100 days post-SPE irradiation, there was an increased expression of senescence-associated inflammatory genes in tumor-free distal colon tissues. These data suggested that chronic inflammation may be important in the progression of invasive cancer. These results indicate that exposure to simulated SPE can increase the risk of invasive adenocarcinoma progression in lung and colorectal cancer.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206861","simulated solar particle events;LA-1 K-Ras;CPC;Apc;chronic inflammation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In the MK model, there are specific parameters, k and y D , where k is an inherent parameter to represent the number of potentially lethal lesions (PLLs) and y D indicates the dose-mean lineal energy in keV/μm. Assuming the PLLs to be DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the rate equations are derived for evaluating the DSB number in the cell nucleus. In this study, we estimated the ratio of DSBs for two types of photon irradiation (6 MV and 200 kVp X-rays) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells and human non-small cell lung cancer (H1299) cells by observing the surviving fraction. The estimated ratio was then compared with the ratio of γ-H2AX foci using immunofluorescent staining. For making a comparison of the number of DSBs among a variety of radiation energy cases, we next utilized the survival data in the literature for both cells exposed to other photon types, such as 60Co γ-rays, 137Cs γ-rays and 100 kVp X-rays. The ratio of DSBs based on the MK model with conventional data was consistent with the ratio of γ-H2AX foci numbers, confirming that the γ-H2AX focus is indicative of DSBs. It was also shown that the larger y D is, the larger the DSB number is. These results suggest that k and y D represent the characteristics of the surviving fraction and the biological effects for photon irradiation.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150277","microdosimetric-kinetic model;γ-H2AX foci;double-strand breaks;RBE 37","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It plays an important role in brain signal processing and non-synaptic signal transfer as well . Since it is composed of largely negatively charged chains of disaccharides, it can be easily affected by strong external electromagnetic field irradiated by high-energy particles passing brain tissues. One of the effects of such exposure is a cognitive impairment. Since outside of the Bragg peak area local electromagnetic field irradiation strong enough to affect on the PNN's dynamics, it is very important to understand PNN's behavior in locally strong electromagnetic fields. The presented work is devoted to PNN modeling in field theory framework. As a toy model of PNN, we consider fractal lattice with Ising and XY model applied. More precise study requires application of the quantum electrodynamics on the lattice. We study how local excitations can change phase state of the overall lattice and its finite clusters. For this propose, the partition function of the Ising model is calculated using Monte Carlo simulation . The two-dimensional Serpinsky Carpet lattice is applied to approximate structure of the brain extracellular matrix. Order parameter is calculated for different levels of the self-similarity of the Serpinsky Carpet. It is shown that starting from the level = 3, the lattice with fractal structure has irreversible phase transition: phase state after restoration differs from the initial one. In Fig. , the calculation of the correlation length change due to the energy dissipation after a local impact is shown. The column shows correlation strength (from 0 to 1), the right axis shows the cluster size ratio to the whole lattice size in percentage. The initial lattice was totally correlated (100% of the lattice has correlation strength that equals 1). The left side of the picture corresponds the locally excited lattice with no correlation, the right side of the picture corresponds the lattice after the relaxation to the equilibrium state due to the energy dissipation. It can be clearly seen that the lattice is not correlated after the relaxation. Fig. 1. Correlation length change due to the energy dissipation. Local impact changes the correlation length of the fractal lattice: after the restoration, the correlation length becomes short, thus signal processing on the lattice changes significantly. Thus, it can be considered as a good model to study of the extracellular matrix change due to local excitations of strong electromagnetic field.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206896","brain extracellular matrix;perineural net;lattice field theory;Ising model;brain signal processing; fractal structure","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Starting from the observation that the lifetime of a battery depends on many random variables, such as the number of cycles that the battery performs, their duration, the state of charge at the end of each cycle and the aging of the battery, the proposed model takes into account the randomness of both the life-cycle and of the single cycle duration, the latter parameter being randomly dependent, e.g., on the tracks performed by the vehicle, as discussed in the paper. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider the time duration of each cycle of the battery as an additional random variable, whose study should accompany the most traditional one devoted the life cycle. Based on experimental data, it is shown that often Lognormal distributions can fit well both kinds of randomness, and a Bayes approach for the estimation of the above lifetime is discussed. Since there may be some uncertainty in the right probability distribution to be adopted for the unknown parameter values, a large set of numerical simulations are performed in the last part of the paper, in order to illustrate not only the known efficiency of the above method of estimation, but also its robustness with respect to the adopted probabilistic hypotheses about the unknown parameters of the model.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993291","Bayes estimation;Electrochemical Battery;Lognormal Distribution;Renewable Energy;Reliability","","","","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, the methods for the FIF technique used in these studies vary. These methods were classified into three categories. We simulated a radiotherapy plan with each method and analyzed the outcomes. In the first method, a pair of subfields was added to each main field: the single pair of subfields method (SSM). In the second method, three pairs of subfields were added to each main field: the multiple pairs of subfields method (MSM). In the third method, subfields were alternately added: the alternate subfields method (ASM). A total of 51 patients were enrolled in this study. The maximum dose to the planning target volume (PTV) (Dmax) and the volumes of the PTV receiving 100% of the prescription dose (V100%) were calculated. The thickness of the breast between the chest wall and skin surface was measured, and patients were divided into two groups according to the median.

However, researchers often face the problem that gaining one attribute may result in losing another. The paper proposes an elastic pointer directory (EPD) structure based on the analysis of shared-memory applications, taking the fact that the number of sharers for each directory entry is typically small. Analysis results show that for 4 096 nodes, the ratio of memory overhead to the full-map directory is 2.7%. Theoretical analysis and cycle-accurate execution-driven simulations on a 16 and 64-node cache coherence non uniform memory access (CC-NUMA) multiprocessor show that the corresponding pointer overflow probability is reduced significantly. The performance is observed to be better than that of a limited pointers directory and almost identical to the full-map directory, except for the slight implementation complexity. Using the directory cache to explore directory access locality is also studied.

Additionally, ion beams provide a higher relative biological effectiveness than photons. For this reason, an improved treatment of deep-seated tumors is achieved and normal tissue is spared. However, small deviations from the treatment plan can have a large impact on the dose distribution. Therefore, a monitoring is required to assure the quality of the treatment. Particle therapy positron emission tomography (PT-PET) is the only clinically proven method which provides a non-invasive monitoring of dose delivery. It makes use of the β+-activity produced by nuclear fragmentation during irradiation. In order to evaluate these PT-PET measurements, simulations of the β+-activity are necessary. Therefore, it is essential to know the yields of the β+-emitting nuclides at every position of the beam path as exact as possible. We evaluated the three-dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation tool PHITS (version 2.30) and the 1D deterministic simulation tool HIBRAC with respect to the production of β+-emitting nuclides. The yields of the most important β+-emitting nuclides for carbon, lithium, helium and proton beams have been calculated. The results were then compared with experimental data obtained at GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung Darmstadt, Germany. GEANT4 simulations provide an additional benchmark . For PHITS, the impact of different nuclear reaction models, total cross-section models and evaporation models on the β+-emitter production has been studied. In general, PHITS underestimates the yields of positron-emitters and cannot compete with GEANT4 so far. The β+-emitters calculated with an extended HIBRAC code were in good agreement with the experimental data for carbon and proton beams and comparable to the GEANT4 results, see and Fig. Considering the simulation results and its speed compared with three-dimensional Monte-Carlo tools, HIBRAC is a good candidate for the implementation in clinical routine PT-PET.

We can measure a three-dimensional dose distribution easily and reliably using this detector. This detector showed a promising tool for QA/QC in advanced X-ray radiotherapies such as IMRT, etc. In heavy-ion radiotherapies which shape precipitous dose distributions, it is also necessary to measure three-dimensional dose distribution easily. To use TL slab dosimeter in heavy-ion dosimetry, it is essential to measure its LET dependence sufficiently. And it is necessary to evaluate the dosimetric water equivalence of this dosimeter for heavy ions. Previous studies showed that the relative TL efficiency of this TL phosphor decreased to ∼20% at the Bragg-peak of carbon 290 MeV/u beams and the stopping-power ratio of this dosimeter to water for carbon ions was 0.87 . These results were not good for application in heavy-ion radiotherapy. It was often reported that there is a relationship between the glow curve shape of general TLDs (such as LiF and BeO) and LET. Using this relationship of glow curve and LET, the relative TL efficiency can be corrected and we could apply TLDs to dose measurement in heavy-ion radiotherapies.In this study, in order to develop better TL slab dosimeter for heavy-ion radiotherapy using TL phosphors with the above characteristics, we evaluated the dosimetric water equivalence of several base materials for TL slab dosimeter. We chose several kinds of ceramics with heating resistance as the base material; ISOPLATON E3, P1, M2, A98 S1 and Machinable Ceramics, TBS N64, N66, N1, N3 (ISOLITE Co., Ltd). We focused attention on stopping power, scattering power and nuclear cross-section of these materials for heavy ions. We calculated these interactions using the Bethe formula, the Gottschalk formula and the Sihver formula. Figure  shows the result of theoretical calculation of the water-equivalence ratio, stopping power ratio S/Sw, scattering power ratio T/Tw and nuclear cross-section ratio σ/σw for carbon-ion beam. In these ceramics, ISOPLANTON S1 was the best of base material for TL slab dosimeter for carbon-ion beam. On the basis of this evaluation, we will develop the TL slab dosimeter for heavy-ion radiotherapy.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206898","TLD;TL slab dosimeter;heavy-ion radiotherapy;three-dimensional dosimetry","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Thus, the present study examined pathological liver features over a 10-month period using an intraoperative whole-liver irradiation model. Liver function tests were performed in blood samples, whereas cell death, cell proliferation, and fibrotic changes were evaluated pathologically in liver tissues, which were collected from irradiated rats 24 h, 1, 2, 4 and 40 weeks following administration of single irradiation doses of 0 (control), 15 or 30 Gy. The impaired liver function, increased hepatocyte number, and decreased apoptotic cell proportion observed in the 15 Gy group, but not the 30 Gy group, returned to control group levels after 40 weeks; however, the Ki-67 indexes in the 15 Gy group were still higher than those in the control group after 40 weeks. Azan staining showed a fibrotic pattern in the irradiated liver in the 30 Gy group only, but the expression levels of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) in both the 15 and 30 Gy groups were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). There were differences in the pathological features of the irradiated livers between the 15 Gy and 30 Gy groups, but TGF-β1 and α-SMA expression patterns supported the gradual progression of radiation-induced liver fibrosis in both groups. These findings will be useful in the future development of protective drugs for radiation-induced liver injury.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154252","radiation-induced liver injury;liver fibrosis;transforming growth factor-beta 1;alpha smooth muscle actin;apoptosis","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For instance, stress distributions in the heart affect cardiac remodelling, but such distributions are not presently accessible in patients. Biomechanical models of the heart offer detailed three-dimensional deformation, stress and strain fields that can supplement conventional clinical data. In this work, we introduce dynamic computational models of the human left ventricle (LV) that are derived from clinical imaging data obtained from a healthy subject and from a patient with a myocardial infarction (MI). Both models incorporate a detailed invariant-based orthotropic description of the passive elasticity of the ventricular myocardium along with a detailed biophysical model of active tension generation in the ventricular muscle. These constitutive models are employed within a dynamic simulation framework that accounts for the inertia of the ventricular muscle and the blood that is based on an immersed boundary (IB) method with a finite element description of the structural mechanics. The geometry of the models is based on data obtained non-invasively by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). CMR imaging data are also used to estimate the parameters of the passive and active constitutive models, which are determined so that the simulated end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes agree with the corresponding volumes determined from the CMR imaging studies. Using these models, we simulate LV dynamics from end-diastole to end-systole. The results of our simulations are shown to be in good agreement with subject-specific CMR-derived strain measurements and also with earlier clinical studies on human LV strain distributions.","1464-3634","","10.1093/imamat/hxu029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8145444","immersed boundary method;finite element method;left ventricle;magnetic resonance imaging;myocardial infarction;hyperelasticity;invariant-based constitutive model;excitation–contraction coupling","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, the mechanism underlying the response between carbon-irradiated cancer cells and neighboring bystander normal cells remains unclear. Using the layered tissue culture strategy, human glioblastoma (T98G) cells were exposed to high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon ions (LET ∼76 keV/µm) with a single dose of 6 Gy or dose divided into three fractions given at consecutive day (2 Gy × 3 days) at Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba. Within 10 min after irradiation, carbon-irradiated T98G cells were trypsinzied and co-cultured with human skin fibroblasts (NB1RGB) in the presence or absence of gap junction inhibitor (18-α-glycyrrhetinic: AGA). During this time, irradiated T98G cells and bystander NB1RGB cells were grown on either side of an insert with 3 µm pores. Following 4 h post-irradiation, bystander NB1RGB cells were then harvested and assayed for clonogenic survival and micronucleus (MN) formation or allowed to grow for 10 weeks and assayed for MN formation. Relative to control, both single- and fractionation irradiation showed that the bystander NB1RGB cells that co-cultured with carbon-irradiated T98G cells exhibited reduced cloning efficiency and associated with increased MN formation. In contrast, treatment with AGA showed a significant increase in survival and decrease in MN formation in bystander cells. These indicated that the role of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) in the propagation of bystander response from the communication between carbon-irradiated cancer cells and bystander normal cells. Furthermore, the progeny of bystander cells that were co-cultured with carbon-irradiated T98G cells for 10 weeks showed that there was induction of MN formation in both cases. Interestingly, the level of MN formation is reduced if there is the inhibition of GJIC. This supports that a role of GJIC in the propagation of stressful effects in the progeny of bystander cells. Our results provide the clear evidence that the bystander effect and genomic instability depend on intercellular communication and GJIC may be a critical mediator in the observed effects.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206865","gap junction intercellular communication;bystander effect;genomic instability;heavy ion radiotherapy;space radiation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

GTDMG significantly enhanced the 30-day survival rate when given 30 min before or immediately after the irradiation. Its mitigative activity (administered after exposure) was examined further in detail. The optimal concentration of GTDMG given immediately after irradiation was around 100 mg/kg body weight (bw) and the 30-day survival rate was 97.6 ± 2.4%. When GTDMG was administered 1, 10 and 24 h post-irradiation, the survival rate was 85.7 ± 7.6, 75.0 ± 9.7 and 36.7 ± 8.8%, respectively, showing significant mitigation even at 24 h after irradiation (P < 0.05). The value of the dose reduction factor (100 mg/kg bw, given intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately after irradiation) was 1.25. GTDMG enhanced the recovery of red blood cell-, white blood cell-, and platelet-counts after irradiation and significantly increased the number of endogenous spleen colonies (P < 0.05). Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration also had mitigative effects.

The model is derived from the inversion of vertical magnetic-field transfer functions from the Australia-wide Array of Geomagnetic Stations. Crustal conductivity anomalies evident in the model are consistent with those previously mapped by independent magnetometer array studies and new electrical structures are suggested in the upper mantle. The model represents a seamless continent-scale basis for further models likely to be derived from subsequent studies.The model reveals three upper-mantle enhanced-conductivity anomalies beneath Archaean cratonic regions and two upper-mantle anomalies beneath Phanerozoic terranes in eastern Australia. Two of these anomalies have been investigated by recent magnetotelluric (MT) surveys, one in the Yilgarn Craton–Officer Basin–Musgrave Block the other in the Gawler Craton region, and are consistent with the MT results. Across much of central Australia enhanced conductivity at depths of 50–100 km is observed in the model. This region corresponds well with a recognized seismic velocity gradient at 75–100 km. Conductivity differences are also observed beneath Archaean cratons in Western Australia. The Pilbara Craton is represented as an enhanced conductivity anomaly at about 100 km, corresponding well with the lower-velocity anomaly evident in surface wave tomography models. The Yilgarn Craton is imaged as a low-conductivity body, with conductivity two orders of magnitude lower than the Pilbara Craton, continuing to greater depths.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggu188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8144389","Geomagnetic induction;Magnetic and electrical properties;Cratons;Crustal structure","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have previously examined clastogenic factors from irradiated individuals by looking at plasma-induced DNA damage in reporter cells. Plasma was tested from ca. 30 locally exposed clinical patients receiving fractionated radiation treatment, as well as from three radiological accident victims exposed in 1994, albeit sampled 14 years post-accident. In the current work, proteome changes in the plasma from all subjects were examined with 2D gel electrophoresis-based proteomics techniques, in order to evaluate the level of protein expression with respect to the findings of a clastogenic factor effect. No differences were observed in protein expression due to local radiation exposure (pre- vs post-exposure). In contrast, plasma from the radiation accident victims showed alterations in the expression of 18 protein spots (in comparison with plasma from the control group). Among these, proteins such as haptoglobin, serotransferrin/transferrin, fibrinogen and ubiquitin-60S ribosomal protein L40 were observed, none of them likely to be clastogenic factors. In conclusion, the proteomics techniques applied were unable to identify changes in the proteome of the locally irradiated patients, whereas such differences were observed for the accident victims. However, association with the clastogenic effect or any specific clastogenic factor remains unresolved and thus further studies with more sensitive techniques are warranted.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154254","ionizing radiation;radiation proteomics;clastogenic factors;low molecular weight plasma proteins;two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2DE-DIGE)","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The cell-cycle modifications are thought to be controlled by check point mechanisms to ensure the time for DNA repair. Linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell-cycle modifications, however, has not been fully revealed. Considerably less is known about detailed cell-cycle arrest for a single-cell level after exposure. Our purpose is to explore high LET radiation effects on the mammalian cell cycle. To examine high LET radiation effects on mammalian cell cycle, it would be essential to track single cells as live cell images observed by time-lapse imaging technique. HeLa cells expressing fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell-cycle indicator (FUCCI) are one of the useful model cell lines to visualize cell cycle because their nuclei show different colors; orange indicating G1 (Cdt1 expression); green indicating S/G2 (Geminin expression) . In order to establish a novel assay system to study cell-cycle modification by high LET irradiation such as ion beams, we have developed time-lapse protocol for the HeLa-FUCCI cells irradiated.As a preliminary experiment using conventional X-rays instead of high LET ion beams, we observed the cell cycles of the irradiated HeLa cells. Figure shows a typical time-lapse dynamics of unirradiated cells acquired for 48 h. We establish a new method to decide the time of one cell cycle as shown in Fig. . We obtained an evidence that the irradiated (5 Gy) cells show prolonged cell-cycle period when compared with that of control cells (Table ). We also revealed that the delay is mainly caused in the G2 (Geminin expressing) phase. These results suggest that S/G2, G2/M or M checkpoint mechanism regulate the cell cycle in the irradiated HeLa-FUCCI cells. In conclusion, single FUCCI cell exposure and live cell imaging are a powerful method to trace the single-cell effect of high LET irradiation on the cell cycle in future.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206871","cell cycle;FUCCI;time-lapse imaging","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, there is a tradeoff between complexity and accuracy. In this paper, we extend the popular Wireless World Initiative for New Radio (WINNER) channel model with new features to make it as realistic as possible. Our approach enables more realistic evaluation results at an early stage of algorithm development. The new model supports 3-D propagation, 3-D antenna patterns, time evolving channel traces of arbitrary length, scenario transitions and variable terminal speeds. We validated the model by measurements in a coherent LTE advanced testbed in downtown Berlin, Germany. We then reproduced the same scenario in the model and compared several channel parameters (delay spread, path gain, K-factor, geometry factor and capacity).

The complexity of students’ experiences reflected from social media content requires human interpretation. However, the growing scale of data demands automatic data analysis techniques. In this paper, we developed a workflow to integrate both qualitative analysis and large-scale data mining techniques. We focused on engineering students’ Twitter posts to understand issues and problems in their educational experiences. We first conducted a qualitative analysis on samples taken from about 25,000 tweets related to engineering students’ college life. We found engineering students encounter problems such as heavy study load, lack of social engagement, and sleep deprivation. Based on these results, we implemented a multi-label classification algorithm to classify tweets reflecting students’ problems.

The optimal CBO of near +0.3 eV can be achieved with various combinations of the two ratios. The traditional CdS emitter is near optimal for the commonly used 1.15-eV Cu(In,Ga)Se$_{2}$ (CIGS) but less optimal for higher Ga. The flexibility with Zn(O,S) emitters ranging from above 90% oxygen for CIS down to 50% oxygen for CGS allows an optimal CBO over the full gallium range.

The patch antennas are arranged in four arms, each of which contains eight elements and is series-fed using Chebyshev tapering (25 dB side-lobe level). To apply the antenna in marine radar applications, an antenna with horizontal polarization was employed because, in comparison with vertical polarization, it can relatively reduce the sea clutter reflectivity. Therefore, a slit was carved on each patch element to change the current path, thereby enabling horizontal polarization. The antenna gain, 3-dB beamwidth, side-lobe level, and front-to-back ratio were 22 dBi, 5.3$^{\circ}$ , 26.4 dB, and 38.5 dB, respectively.

Most of the image reconstruction algorithms, developed for this purpose, solve a nonsmooth convex optimization problem involving the image total variation (TV). The TV seminorm is the $\ell_{1}$ norm of the image gradient magnitude, and reducing the $\ell_{1}$ norm is known to encourage sparsity in its argument. Recently, there has been interest in employing nonconvex $\ell_{p}$ quasinorms with $0<p<1$ for sparsity exploiting image reconstruction, which is potentially more effective than $\ell_{1}$ because nonconvex $\ell_{p}$ is closer to $\ell_{0}$—a direct measure of sparsity. This paper develops algorithms for constrained minimization of the total $p$-variation $({\rm T}p{\rm V})$,  $\ell_{p}$ of the image gradient. Use of the algorithms is illustrated in the context of breast CT—an imaging modality that is still in the research phase and for which constraints on X-ray dose are extremely tight. The ${\rm T}p{\rm V}$-based image reconstruction algorithms are demonstrated on computer simulated data for exploiting gradient magnitude sparsity to reduce the projection view angle sampling. The proposed algorithms are applied to projection data from a realistic breast CT simulation, where the total X-ray dose is equivalent to two-view digital mammography. Following the simulation survey, the algorithms are then demonstrated on a clinical breast CT data set.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2300862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6714374","Computed tomography;X-ray tomography;image reconstruction;iterative algorithms;optimization","Computed tomography;Minimization;Image reconstruction;Optimization;Sparsity;X-ray detection","","62","","38","OAPA","20 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More specifically, we evaluate the SM scheme's performance penalty imposed on a bandwidth efficiency, which arises due to the time-limited pulse transmissions. Furthermore, to combat this limitation while maintaining lower RF chains than transmit antenna elements, we propose a multiple-RF antenna switching operation that allows us to exploit a longer pulse shape than that enabled by a single-RF SM scheme. It is demonstrated in our simulations that upon increasing the number of transmit antenna elements, the SM scheme is capable of outperforming the classic MIMO systems, under the assumptions of a low number of RF chains and realistic pulse shaping.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2014.2315819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784012","Bandwidth efficiency;MIMO;pulse shaping;space-shift keying;spatial modulation","Bandwidth;MIMO;Radio frequency;Transmitting antennas;Pulse shaping methods","","55","","9","OAPA","7 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, a symbol scaling technique is proposed for spatial modulation in the multiple-input-single-output (MISO) channel that enhances this minimum distance. It achieves this by aligning the phase of the relevant channels so that the received symbol phases are distributed in uniformly spaced angles in the received SM constellation. In contrast to existing amplitude-phase scaling schemes that are data-dependent and involve an increase in the transmitted signal power for ill conditioned channels, here a phase-only shift is applied. This allows for data-independent, fixed per-antenna scaling and leaves the symbol power unchanged. The results show an improved SM performance and diversity for the proposed scheme compared to existing amplitude-phase scaling techniques.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2014.031414.140233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6777399","Spatial modulation;multiple-input-single-output;pre-scaling","Signal to noise ratio;Transmitting antennas;Bit error rate;Vectors;Phase modulation;Euclidean distance","","54","","15","CCBY","21 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Graphene is embedded in the slot region of a horizontal slot waveguide. If graphene were treated as an isotropic material and its dielectric constant were made close to zero by adjusting its Fermi level, the surface-normal electric field component of the fundamental TM mode of a horizontal slot waveguide might be highly enhanced in graphene. This could cause a large increase in the attenuation coefficient of the mode. This is called the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) effect. This paper discusses that graphene needs to be treated as an anisotropic material that has an almost real surface-normal dielectric constant component. Then, the ENZ effect does not exist. Approximate analytic expressions and numerical simulation are used for the discussion, and they demonstrate that horizontal slot waveguides are not appropriate for graphene-based modulators for TM modes.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2326667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820729","Waveguide devices;optical properties of photonic materials;graphene","Graphene;Optical waveguides;Mathematical model;Electric fields;Modulation;Dielectrics;Optical attenuators","","53","","25","OAPA","23 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the interaction of the symmetric and antisymmetric waveguide modes, the transmission spectra possess a sharp asymmetrical profile. Because of different origins, these Fano resonances exhibit different dependence on the parameters of the structure and can be easily tuned. These characteristics offer flexibility to design the device. This nanosensor yields a sensitivity of ~820 nm/RIU and a figure-of-merit of ~ 3.2× 105.

To propel in an energy efficient manner, wheelchair users must learn to control bimanually applied forces onto the rims, preserving both speed and direction of locomotion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique during the initial stage of motor learning. Therefore, 70 naive able-bodied men received 12-min uninstructed wheelchair practice, consisting of three 4-min blocks separated by 2 min rest. Practice was performed on a motor-driven treadmill at a fixed belt speed and constant power output relative to body mass. Energy consumption and the kinetics of propulsion technique were continuously measured. Participants significantly increased their mechanical efficiency and changed their propulsion technique from a high frequency mode with a lot of negative work to a longer-slower movement pattern with less power losses. Furthermore a multi-level model showed propulsion technique to relate to mechanical efficiency. Finally improvers and non-improvers were identified. The non-improving group was already more efficient and had a better propulsion technique in the first block of practice (i.e., the fourth minute). These findings link propulsion technique to mechanical efficiency, support the importance of a correct propulsion technique for wheelchair users and show motor learning differences.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2280301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6626622","Biomechanics;motor learning;rehabilitation;wheelchairs","Propulsion;Wheelchairs;Wheels;Torque;Educational institutions;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Hand;Humans;Learning;Male;Man-Machine Systems;Middle Aged;Motor Skills;Movement;Oxygen Consumption;Task Performance and Analysis;Wheelchairs;Young Adult","48","","41","IEEE","9 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When used correctly inhalers relieve and improve patients' symptoms. However, adherence to inhaler medication has been demonstrated to be poor, leading to reduced clinical outcomes, wasted medication, and higher healthcare costs. There is a clinical need for a system that can accurately monitor inhaler adherence as currently no method exists to evaluate how patients use their inhalers between clinic visits. This paper presents a method of automatically evaluating inhaler adherence through acoustic analysis of inhaler sounds. An acoustic monitoring device was employed to record the sounds patients produce while using a Diskus dry powder inhaler, in addition to the time and date patients use the inhaler. An algorithm was designed and developed to automatically detect inhaler events from the audio signals and provide feedback regarding patient adherence. The algorithm was evaluated on 407 audio files obtained from 12 community dwelling asthmatic patients. Results of the automatic classification were compared against two expert human raters. For patient data for whom the human raters Cohen's kappa agreement score was ${>}{0.81}$, results indicated that the algorithm's accuracy was 83% in determining the correct inhaler technique score compared with the raters. This paper has several clinical implications as it demonstrates the feasibility of using acoustics to objectively monitor patient inhaler adherence and provide real-time personalized medical care for a chronic respiratory illness.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2310480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762909","Acoustics;adherence;algorithm;chronic respiratory diseases;inhaler","Acoustics;Algorithm design and analysis;Diseases;Training;Respiratory diseases;Biomedical monitoring;Classification algorithms","","48","","","OAPA","20 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We found numerically that the DS spectrum moving, together with spectrum narrowing/broadening, is caused by the effective gain profile change resulted from the moving of the artificial spectral filter. Furthermore, we show that the wavelength switching observed in the laser is a natural consequence of the effective gain switching. The moving of the artificial spectral filter could be originated from either the cavity birefringence change or the polarizer rotation. Due to the broad gain and the artificial birefringent filter introduced by the NPR technique, apart from the central wavelength shifting and bandwidth changing, wavelength switching of DSs could be obtained by simply rotating the polarizer. Numerical simulations well reproduced the experimental observations.

A unique solution using directional overcurrent elements further secured by a load encroachment function can solve these problems. This approach has been validated in renewable plant collector circuit protection applications over a wide range of operating conditions.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2013.2283237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6607207","Directional overcurrent;distributed generation;distribution protection;feeder protection;future distribution feeder;load encroachment;renewable feeder protection;smart grid;VAR control","Reactive power;Wind turbines;Circuit faults;Substations;Relays;Generators;Distributed power generation","","44","","7","OAPA","24 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of precisely emulating the transfer function of the whole nonlinear system in the digital domain, the key distortion information is directly acquired from hardware. By low biasing the Mach–Zehnder modulator, linearization can be achieved through simply multiplying the distorted signal by the coreceived low-pass band. Theory analysis shows that only the bias angle should be known by the algorithm, whereas the simulation shows adequate tolerance. The low bias angle also results in an improved link gain. The experiment shows a well-suppressed third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3). With the optical down conversion, we demonstrate a spurious-free dynamic range increasing from 103.2 to 123.3 dB in a 1-Hz bandwidth.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2308196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748005","Radio frequency photonics;fiber optics systems;digital signal processing","Optical distortion;Optical fiber communication;Nonlinear optics;Radio frequency;Optical filters;Photonics;Optical fibers","","43","","20","OAPA","25 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In MANET, power aware is important challenge issue to improve the communication energy efficiency at individual nodes. We propose efficient power aware routing (EPAR), a new power aware routing protocol that increases the network lifetime of MANET. In contrast to conventional power aware algorithms, EPAR identifies the capacity of a node not just by its residual battery power, but also by the expected energy spent in reliably forwarding data packets over a specific link. Using a mini-max formulation, EPAR selects the path that has the largest packet capacity at the smallest residual packet transmission capacity. This protocol must be able to handle high mobility of the nodes that often cause changes in the network topology. This paper evaluates three ad hoc network routing protocols (EPAR, MTPR, and DSR) in different network scales, taking into consideration the power consumption. Indeed, our proposed scheme reduces for more than 20% the total energy consumption and decreases the mean delay, especially for high load networks, while achieving a good packet delivery ratio.;Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles<br><br>""Designing Energy Routing Protocol with Power Consumption Optimization in MANET,""<br>by Shivashankar, H.N.

Recently, the generation of sinc-pulse sequences with extraordinary quality was shown by the utilization of cascaded modulators. However, the line width and repetition rate of the pulses is limited by the modulator bandwidth. Here, we present the nonrestricted generation of flexible Nyquist pulse sequences. Therefore, multiple single lines of a comb generator are extracted with optical filters and subsequently processed by cascaded modulators. In a first proof-of-concept experiment, we achieved almost ideally sinc-shaped Nyquist pulses with a bandwidth of 286 GHz, a pulse width of 3.5 ps, and a duty cycle of 2.2%. However, sinc-shaped Nyquist pulse sequences in the femtosecond range with terahertz bandwidths would be possible with the method.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2331240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838957","Modulation;optical communication;pulses;sources","Frequency modulation;Bandwidth;Generators;Optical pulse generation;Optical modulation;Optical signal processing","","34","","32","OAPA","18 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The simulations reveal that the resonant wavelength and the total absorption frequency may be tuned by tilting the angle of incidence of the impinging source. We also show that the losses, related to the dielectric materials constituting the one-dimensional PhC, can degrade the optical performance of the device. Conversely, by arranging the same dielectric slabs in a different order (supercell), it is possible to achieve a broadband absorption that is almost constant over a wide range of angle of incidence. In this configuration, the absorption and the bandwidth can be tuned by varying the supercell geometry.

One of the sub-MZMs (MZM1) of the DPMZM is driven by the sinusoidal RF signal, whereas the other sub-MZM (MZM2) has no driven signal. In this way, the powers of even- and odd-order sidebands can be separately controlled by adjusting the bias of the MZM1. The power ratio between the odd- (or even-) order sidebands is tunable by adjusting the RF power. Moreover, the power and the phase of the optical carrier can be independently tunable by adjusting the biases of the MZM2 and the parent MZM of the DPMZM, respectively. After detecting by a photodetector, an RF signal with controllable harmonics is generated. Thus, a desired RF waveform can be generated by separately manipulating its harmonics. The proposed method is theoretically analyzed.

The proposed method does not require frequency sampling and iterative optimization to compute the coefficients of the filters or that of the differentiators. The magnitude and phase specifications are simultaneously approximated, and the errors in the specified frequency bands are controlled by using frequency-weighting factors. In addition, a maximum pole radius, which corresponds to a stability margin, can be specified to robustly ensure the stability of the filters or the differentiators. To evaluate the efficiency of proposed method, we compare the proposed method with several established methods.

The toolkit assigns trust values to all protection nodes. Faulty nodes, attributed to component or communication system malfunctions (either intentional or unintentional), are assigned a lower trust value, which indicates a higher risk of failure to mitigate detected faults.

The replacing of the tapered cavities by the single-stepped cavities in a 12-cavity MDO increases the interaction space where the charged particles interact with the induced RF waves. The electronic efficiency of the 12-cavity MDO with single-stepped cavities driven by the transparent cathode [2] of GW output power level can be as high as 73% for  $\alpha=18.2^{\circ}$ , 74% for  $\alpha=17.5^{\circ}$ , and 72% for  $\alpha=12.5^{\circ}$  at  $\beta=32^{\circ}$ , where  $\alpha$  is the angle between the outer wall and  $z$ -axis, and  $\beta$  is the angle between the inner wall and  $z$ -axis. The depth of single-stepped cavities is changed when  $\alpha$  is changed, which results in different frequency range of magnetron operating modes. When a 400-kV voltage pulse of 10-ns duration is applied to a transparent cathode or a solid cathode, the output power can be as high as 1 GW. Without loss of generality, for  $\alpha=12.5^{\circ}$  at  $\beta=32^{\circ}$ , the peak efficiency around 70% of 12-cavity MDO with single-stepped cavities design occurs at the voltage  $(V\sim 400\pm 50~{\rm kV})$ .

In our scheme, encryption of the downstream signal is obtained by applying exclusive or (xor) operation between optical network units' (ONUs') downstream signals and received upstream signals at the optical line terminal side. The upstream signals are used as secure keys for corresponding ONUs. Then the encrypted downstream signals are sent to the ONU sides, where the downstream signal can be retrieved by applying xor operation again between the encrypted downstream signal and the stored upstream signal. Since each ONU cannot obtain the upstream signals of other ONUs, only the ONU itself can recover its downstream signal from the encrypted downstream signal. Moreover, the secure key is dynamically changing along with the upstream signal, significantly improving the security of the downstream signal for the OFDM-PON system. A 5-Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation OFDM signal with xor-based encryption has been successfully implemented over a 25-km standard single-mode fiber.

A new method for testing the optical Kerr-effect induced bias error in the RMOG is proposed and demonstrated. A square-wave intensity-modulated optical signal with a symmetrical duty ratio of 50% is achieved by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM), thus making the input-intensity mismatch between the CW and CCW lightwaves change periodically. In this way, we obtain the optical Kerr-effect induced bias errors that vary periodically in accordance with the variation of the square-wave signal. The experimental results show a good agreement with the theoretical value. Moreover, the testing result of the closed-loop RMOG is consistent with the open-loop one.

The phenomenon whereby the capacitor on DC side discharges quickly during a DC fault contributes to a large short-circuit fault current. Neither traditional DC breakers nor DC switches can cut off the fault current under this condition. A fast solid state DC breaker design method is proposed in this paper. This method is based on the fault current characteristics of the inverter in multi-terminal HVDC systems (MTDC), where a fault current appears at the natural zero-crossing point near the inverter. At this point, by coordinating the AC breakers near the rectifier, the DC breaker could reliably cut off the DC fault current and protect the system.

The state time-delay feedback is introduced into the existing consensus protocol to begenerate an improved protocol. Then a sufficient condition is derived which can make the system with time-varying self-delays achieve the consensus. On this basis, a specific form of consensus equilibrium influenced by the initial states of agents, time-delays and state feedback intensity is figured out. In addition, the multi-agent consensus is considered with time-varying topologies.

The waveguides are excited with two TE eigenmodes driven in phase quadrature. As references, two better known modes are also analyzed: a plane, a circularly polarized wave (a TEM mode), and a TE-Bessel beam, both of infinite transverse extent and with no metallic boundaries. Our analysis shows that modes carrying OAM and spin can also propagate in the metallic waveguides, even when the cross section of the waveguide is distinctly non-circular. However, the mode density of orthogonal modes carrying OAM is at most equal to that of the waveguides' eigenmodes.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2014.2308891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762817","Computational and applied electromagnetics;eigenmode;electromagnetic (EM) field theory;field analysis and guided waves;TEM waveguides;wave propagation;waveguide analysis","Optical waveguides;Photonics;Electromagnetics;Hollow waveguides;Extraterrestrial measurements;MIMO","","17","","37","OAPA","10 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper investigates the node scheduling problem in the chain-type WSN. Firstly, a node dormant scheduling mode is analyzed theoretically from geographic coverage, and then three neighboring nodes scheduling criteria are proposed. Secondly, a hybrid coverage scheduling algorithm and dead areas are presented. Finally, node scheduling in mine tunnel WSN with uniform deployment (UD), non-uniform deployment (NUD) and optimal distribution point spacing (ODS) is simulated. The results show that the node scheduling with UD and NUD, especially NUD, can effectively extend the network survival time. Therefore, a strategy of adding a few mobile nodes which activate the network in dead areas is proposed, which can further extend the network survival time by balancing the energy consumption of nodes.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2014.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6808324","wireless sensor network (WSN);chain-type;node scheduling;network survival time;mobile nodes","Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Energy consumption;Job shop scheduling;Mobile communication;Scheduling algorithms","","16","","","","11 Jul 2014","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

There is one and only one switch open on each tie branch. Decimal identity number of open switch on each tie branch is taken as the optimization variable. Therefore, the length of chromosome is very short. Each spanning tree corresponds to one subpopulation. Gene operations of each subpopulation are implemented with parallel computing method. Individuals of offspring after gene operation automatically meet with radial and connected constraints for distribution network operation. Disadvantages of conventional genetic algorithm for network reconfiguration that a large amount of unfeasible solutions are created after crossover and mutation, which result in very low searching efficiency, are completely overcome.

The proposed model incorporates state transitions of components in a PV system and captures effects of insolation variations. The paper performs a reliability assessment incorporating PV systems at resource locations. The results suggest that the reliability performance of an active distribution network at stressed operating conditions might be influenced by the high penetration of PV system. Reliability performance of distribution networks that are high penetrated with PV systems can be affected by cloudy effects resulting from insolation variations.

For thin cloud cover, support vector value contourlet transform is used to achieve multi-scale decomposition of the area of thin cloud cover on remote sensing images. Through enhancing coefficients of high frequency and suppressing coefficients of low frequency, the thin cloud is removed. For thick cloud cover, if the areas of thick cloud cover on multi-source or multi-temporal remote sensing images do not overlap, the multi-output support vector regression learning method is used to remove this kind of thick clouds. If the thick cloud cover areas overlap, by using the multi-output learning of the surrounding areas to predict the surface features of the overlapped thick cloud cover areas, this kind of thick cloud is removed.

The internal resonant modes have recently been studied by the authors; this letter investigates the static loop modes. Like internal resonant modes, static loop modes, in theory, should not be observed in the MOT solution since they do not satisfy the zero initial conditions; their appearance is attributed to numerical errors. It is discussed in this letter that the dependence of spurious static loop modes on numerical errors is substantially different from that of spurious internal resonant modes. More specifically, when Rao-Wilton-Glisson functions and Lagrange interpolation functions are used as spatial and temporal basis functions, respectively, errors due to space-time discretization have no discernible impact on spurious static loop modes. Numerical experiments indeed support this discussion and demonstrate that the numerical errors due to the approximate solution of the MOT matrix system have dominant impact on spurious static loop modes in the MOT solution.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2014.2305716","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS 1303142); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737267","Electric field integral equation;marching-on-in-time;numerical analysis;static loop modes;time domain","Integral equations;Electric fields;Antennas;Time-domain analysis;Matrix decomposition;Interpolation;Null space","","14","","8","OAPA","11 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A dynamic algorithm that opportunistically grabs packets from current neighbors is developed. Under a simple model where each user desires a single file with infinite length, the algorithm is shown to optimize utility while incentivizing participation.

Ray-tracing analysis is a rigorous method, but it is highly demanding in terms of computing time. Accordingly, in our method, ray tracing is only implemented between a pair of transmitting and receiving antenna points that are used as reference, after which statistical analysis is applied to estimate the properties of the surrounding areas. The results of an environment analysis of an empty room containing no objects produced via our method were compared to a room analyzed by ray tracing alone, from which we found our simplified method to be highly accurate within a range of several wavelengths from the receiving reference points.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2014.2353663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6891152","Channel capacity;channel correlation matrix;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);plane-wave approximation;ray tracing","Ray tracing;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;MIMO;Arrays;Approximation methods","","11","","8","IEEE","4 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An administrative policy specifies how each user in an enterprise may change the policy. Fully understanding the consequences of an administrative policy in an enterprise system can be difficult, because of the scale and complexity of the access control policy and the administrative policy, and because sequences of changes by different users may interact in unexpected ways. Administrative policy analysis helps by answering questions such as user-permission reachability, which asks whether specified users can together change the policy in a way that achieves a specified goal, namely, granting a specified permission to a specified user. This paper presents a rule-based access control policy language, a rule-based administrative policy model that controls addition and removal of facts and rules, and an abductive analysis algorithm for user-permission reachability. Abductive analysis means that the algorithm can analyze policy rules even if the facts initially in the policy (e.g., information about users) are unavailable. The algorithm does this by computing minimal sets of facts that, if present in the initial policy, imply reachability of the goal.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616529","Security policy;attribute-based access control;policy administration;rule-based policy;policy verification","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Semantics;Hospitals;Grammar;Organizations","","11","","17","IEEE","1 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SLDDE algorithm steers four candidate solution generation strategies simultaneously in the framework of the self-adaptive learning mechanism.

Because the wavelength shift is larger for a dip/peak at a longer wavelength than at a shorter wavelength, a linear spectral chirp will occur in the transmission spectrum when the surrounding RI changes.

Al-Durra","Department of Electrical Engineering, Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",IEEE Access,"20 May 2017","2014","2","","1085","1091","One of the principal issues of alternative combustion modes for diesel engines (such as HCCI, PCCI, and LTC) is caused by the imbalances in the distribution of air and EGR across the cylinders, which affects the combustion process and ultimately cause significant differences in the pressure trace and indicated torque for each cylinder. In principle, a cylinder-by-cylinder control approach could compensate for air, residuals, and temperature imbalance. However, in order to fully benefit from closed-loop combustion control, it is necessary to obtain feedback signals from each engine cylinder to reconstruct the pressure trace. Therefore, cylinder imbalance is an issue that can be detected in a laboratory environment, wherein each engine cylinder is instrumented with a dedicated pressure transducer. This paper describes the framework and preliminary results of a model-based estimation approach to predict the individual pressure traces in a multicylinder engine relying on a very restricted sensor set, namely, a crankshaft speed sensor, a single production-grade pressure sensor. The objective of the estimator is to reconstruct the complete pressure trace during an engine cycle with sufficient accuracy to allow for detection of cylinder to cylinder imbalances. Starting from a model of the engine crankshaft dynamics, an adaptive sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the cylinder pressure from the crankshaft speed fluctuation measurement. The results obtained by the estimator are compared with experimental data obtained on a four-cylinder diesel engine.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2358954","Center for Automotive Research, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901187","Engine;cylinder pressure imbalance;sliding mode observer;adaptive observer;parameter uncertainty","Engines;Sliding mode control;Combustion;Engine cylinders;Temperature control;Torque control;Compensation;Pressure control","","10","","23","OAPA","17 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the last few years, electricity market has become more and more flexible as many utilities have started to replace the fixed retail prices schemes with prices changing during the day. Dynamic pricing, also known as Real-Time Pricing (RTP), reflects the trend of the wholesale market and allows to reduce the volatility of the wholesale prices, also contributing to a reduction of demand peaks. Electricity customers take advantage of dynamic pricing by shifting their consumption according to the real-time prices or by using Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) to shift electricity consumption. As a result, storing electricity in off-peak periods allows customers to lower electricity rates during on-peak periods. This paper describes the application to a medium-scale public facility of a simple BESS operating strategy which aims to maximize the saving for the end-user. The operating strategy is able to identify, for each daily period, the charging and discharging hours, relying only on the hourly spot market price profile (day-ahead electricity prices) and may be applied to all kinds of BESS. The experimental evaluation uses a Lithium-ion (Li-ion) storage system and results highlight how the power profile of the public facility changes as a result of the proposed charging strategy.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993235","Battery energy storage system;optimal operation;load shifting;real-time electricity price","","","10","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Then two dimensional (2D) Chebyshev amplitude distribution optimization is respectively used in two mutual vertical directions of the tangent plane. According to the location of the elements, the excitation current amplitude distribution of each element on the conformal structure is derived reversely, then the excitation current amplitude is further optimized by using the genetic algorithm (GA). A truncated cone problem with 8×8 elements on it, and a 3D pattern desired side lobe level (SLL) up to 35 dB, is studied.

Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to this task, while it is still difficult to measure the relevance between two objects with multiple views. In recent years, learning-based methods have been investigated in view-based 3-D object retrieval, such as graph-based learning. It is noted that the graph-based methods suffer from the high computational cost from the graph construction and the corresponding learning process. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to accelerate the learning-based view-based 3-D object matching in large scale data. Given a query object Q and one object O from a 3-D dataset D, the first step is to extract a small set of candidate relevant 3-D objects for object O. Then multiple hypergraphs can be constructed based on this small set of 3-D objects and the learning on the fused hypergraph is conducted to generate the relevance between Q and O, which can be further used in the retrieval procedure. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2014.6838195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838195","view-based;3-D object retrieval;hypergraph learning","Solid modeling;Feature extraction;Visualization;Cameras;Learning systems;Measurement;Computational efficiency","","10","","","","18 Jun 2014","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Compared with deterministic forecasts, probabilistic forecasts can provide additional information concerning wind uncertainty for economic operation and efficient trading. However, it is far from ideal with respect to the accuracy, reliability and sharpness, since the wind shows strong variable property. In this paper, a robust probabilistic wind power forecasting method is proposed as (RPWPF) that can reflect the variability of wind generation under different wind conditions. The wind scenarios are identified concerning wind generation process and dominance of wind direction in a wind farm. And then, forecasting models for each scenario can be established and executed separately so that model parameters, such as kernel function and kernel width will be adjusted with the changing external wind conditions, wind speed and direction, in a real time operation. In this way, the forecasting model will provide more fined information on power outputs and their variabilities under different wind conditions. This proposed model is validated through comparison between the simulated power outputs and their variabilities under differing wind speeds and directions with the actual outputs on a practical 183 MW wind farm in northwest China. The results show that RPWPF achieves lower root mean square error comparing with artificial neural network model, while higher skill score for forecasting interval comparing with quantile regression. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the contribution of individual input (NWP variables) to help optimize the dimension of forecasting model.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993221","wind power;robust;probabilistic forecast;power curve;power generation process","","","10","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The complex permittivity measurements were performed on cells suspended in culture medium using an open-ended coaxial probe. Maxwell’s mixture equation then allows the calculation of the permittivity profiles of the cells from the difference in permittivity between the cell suspensions and pure culture medium. The open-ended coaxial probe turned out to be very sensitive to disturbances affecting the measurements, resulting in poor precision. Permittivity differences were not large in relation to the spread of the measurements and repeated measurements were performed to improve statistics. The 95% confidence intervals were computed for the arithmetic means of the measured permittivity differences in order to test the statistical significance. The results showed that for bone cells at the lowest tested concentration (33 500/ml), there were significance in the real part of the permittivity at frequencies above 30 GHz, and no significance in the imaginary part. For the second lowest concentration (67 000/ml) there was no significance at all. For a medium concentration of bone cells (135 000/ml) there was no significance in the real part, but there was significance in the imaginary part at frequencies below about 25 GHz. The cell suspension with a concentration of 1 350 000/ml had significance in the real part for both high (above 30 GHz) and low (below 15 GHz) frequencies. The imaginary part showed significance for frequencies below 25 GHz. In the case of an osteosarcoma cell line with a concentration of 2 700 000/ml, only the imaginary part showed significance, and only for frequencies below 15 GHz. For muscle cells at a concentration of 743 450/ml, there was only significance in the imaginary part for frequencies below 5 GHz.

The photonic and DLSPP waveguides are designed to reduce the loss and tapering region length of the coupling, and the tapering region is optimized. We achieve the coupling between the photonic and DLSPP waveguides based on a dielectric of refractive index of 1.57 with a coupling loss of 2.3 dB through a 3-$\mu\hbox{m}$-long coupling region. The coupling loss is further reduced by modifying the DLSPP waveguide into a double-DLSPP $( \hbox{D}^{2}\hbox{LSPP})$ waveguide. The $\hbox{D}^{2} \hbox{LSPP}$ waveguide has an additional low-index dielectric between its high-index dielectric and metal layer. Designed appropriately, the $\hbox{D}^{2}\hbox{LSPP}$ waveguide can be coupled to the photonic waveguide with a coupling loss of 1.1 dB through a 4- $\mu\hbox{m}$-long coupling region. Since the photonic and DLSPP or $\hbox{D}^{2}\hbox{LSPP}$ waveguides investigated in this paper can be simultaneously fabricated, they may constitute an easily realizable hybrid planar lightwave circuit with a relatively low loss.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2326657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820730","Plasmonics;subwavelength structure;waveguide devices","Couplings;Photonics;Optical waveguides;Optical losses;Dielectrics;Refractive index","","9","","31","OAPA","23 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Estimating recombination rate is crucial for understanding the process of recombination. Experimental methods are normally difficult and limited to small scale estimations. Thus statistical methods using population genetics data are important for large-scale analysis. LDhat is an extensively used statistical method using rjMCMC algorithm to predict recombination rates. Due to the complexity of rjMCMC scheme, LDhat may take a long time for large SNP data sets. In addition, rjMCMC parameters should be manually defined in the original program which directly impact results. To address these issues, we designed an improved algorithm based on LDhat implementing MCMC convergence diagnostic algorithms to automatically predict values of parameters and monitor the mixing process. Then parallel computation methods were employed to further accelerate the new program. The new algorithms have been tested on ten samples from HapMap phase 2 data set. The results were compared with previous code and showed nearly identical output. However, our new methods achieved significant acceleration proving that they are more efficient and reliable for the estimation of recombination rates.

Detections of the characteristic X-rays can be used for the imaging of iodine concentration distribution in an object. In this paper, we propose an X-ray fluorescence computed tomography method for reconstruction of a LINPs distribution over a region of interest (ROI) in a small animal. X-rays are focused onto a submillimeter focal spot utilizing a polycapillary lens, generating a pair of X-ray cones in the animal. This focused beam irradiates LINPs, the most strongly at the focal spot. Then, the focal spot can be scanned over an ROI in the object to produce X-ray fluorescence signals.

Sensitivity studies with respect to the pre-fault power flow, various steady state and fault ride-through (FRT) control modes were performed. Our simulations for a realistic 2022 scenario show that a lack of FRT capability can cause the distribution system load to increase by 35-70 % of its peak value. It was found that for under-excited operation of PV systems prior to the fault, an overvoltage can occur post-fault at some busbars in the distribution system.

We show by numerical computations that the group delay of an optical pulse of finite bandwidth transmitted through a piece of a low loss optical fiber of unit length is proportional to the energy stored by the standing wave electromagnetic field. The stored energy-group delay ratio typically approaches unity as the confinement loss converges to zero. In case of a dispersion tailored Bragg fiber, we found that the stored energy-group delay ratio decreased while the confinement loss increased compared to those of the standard quarterwave Bragg fiber configuration. Furthermore, a rapid variation in the group delay versus wavelength function due to mode-crossing events (in hollow core photonic bandgap fibers for instance) or resonances originating from slightly coupled cavities, surface or leaking modes in index guiding, photonic bandgap, or photonic crystal fibers always results in a rapid change in the mode-field distribution, which seriously affects splicing losses and focusability of the transmitted laser beam.

A successful way to implement these termination conditions is the decomposition of the transient fields in the absorbing plane in terms of modal field patterns. The absorbing condition is then accomplished by transferring the wave impedances (or admittances) of the modes to time domain, which leads to convolution operations involving Bessel functions and integrals of Bessel functions. This paper presents a new alternative approach: the convolution operations are approximated by appropriate state-space models whose system responses can be conveniently computed by standard integration schemes.

In this paper, a restricted variant of ASN P systems, called ASN P systems without annihilating priority, is considered, where the annihilating rule is used as the standard rule, i.e., it is not obligatory to use in the neuron associated with both spikes and anti-spikes. If the annihilating rule is used in a neuron, the annihilation will consume one time unit.

The wavelength of the optical carrier is adjusted according to the phase variation of the reference LO, to stabilize the delay of the fiber link. Once the delay of the link is stabilized, the phases of other LO signals that transferred through the same fiber link will all be stabilized.

In general, existing multi-factor grey forecasting models, such as one order and h variables grey forecasting model (GM (1, h)), always aggregate the main system variable and independent variables in a linear form rather than a nonlinear form, while a nonlinear form could be used in more cases than the linear form. And the nonlinear form could aggregate collinear independent factors, which widely lie in many multi-factor forecasting problems. To overcome this problem, a new approach, named as the Solow residual method, is proposed to aggregate independent factors. And a new expansion model, feedback multi-factor discrete grey forecasting model based on the Solow residual method (abbreviated as FDGM (1, h)), is proposed accordingly. Then the feedback control equation and the parameters' solution of the FDGM (1, h) model are given. Finally, a real application is used to test the modelling accuracy of the FDGM (1, h) model.

A certain factor is considered to be more significant in a generalized comfort function than others, when the corresponding probability of this factor is higher in value. Using stated preference and revealed preference data about passenger travel behavior obtained from the Beijing subway, the parameters of generalized comfort function are estimated by maximum likelihood techniques.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2014.6838201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838201","generalized comfort;subway system;nested logit model","Reliability;Safety;Transportation;Positron emission tomography;Thin film transistors;Estimation;Probability","","6","","","","18 Jun 2014","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, conventional SVF is only able to express the degree of openness of the sky as a ratio, and it is limited to being used as a performance index for the positioning that uses the GNSS. When the conventional SVF is used in a land transportation environment, the predicted value for the positioning performance of the GNSS is often not consistent with the actual positioning error, but when sky-view-based dilution of precision (SVDOP) is applied, we confirmed that it was substantially close to the actual positioning error. This confirms our expectation that the utilization of the proposed method rather than the utilization of SVF alone in land transportation environments will make the analysis easier.

In this work, noise interpolation (NI) is proposed, which uses preliminary data decisions together with Wiener interpolation to exploit these correlations. It turns out that the selection of samples to be used for NI is crucial.

A bismuth-based erbium-doped fiber (Bi-EDF) with a length of 1.5 m and a bismuth-based highly nonlinear fiber (Bi-HNLF) with a length of 4.1 m are used as a gain medium and a spectral broadening device, respectively. We also employ a wavelength-tunable and bandwidth-variable optical filter for an intracavity filter. The center wavelength of the OFC output can be widely tuned from 1535 to 1585 nm because the Bi-EDF has a broadband gain profile. A spectrally broadened ultra-flat OFC is successfully generated by the self-phase modulation in the Bi-HNLF. By tuning the filter bandwidth, the 10-dB spectral width and the pulsewidth of the generated OFC can be widely varied from 0.23 to 2.4 nm and from 3 to 20.1 ps, respectively. The fiber ring cavity is as short as 17.8 m.

Furthermore, when the power dissipation of magnetic nanoparticles rises linearly, the temperature gradient on the edge of the tumor increases exponentially. With energy input held constant, the location and duration of maximum power dissipation in the treatment time scheme will affect the final energy concentration inside the tumor.

In contrast to the previous works, where data association is established by calibrating the intrinsic parameters of the camera and the extrinsic parameters of the camera and the LIDAR, we formulate the map between laser points and pixels as a 2-D homography. The line-point correspondence is employed to construct geometric constraint on the homography matrix. This enables checkerboard to be not essential and any object with straight boundary can be an effective target. The calculation of the 2-D homography matrix consists of a linear least-squares solution of a homogeneous system followed by a nonlinear minimization of the geometric error in the image plane. Since the measurement quality impacts on the accuracy of the result, we investigate the equivalent constraint and show that placing the calibration target nearby the 2-D LIDAR will provide sufficient constraints to calculate the 2-D homography matrix. Simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed algorithm is robust and accurate. Compared with the previous works, which require two calibration processes and special calibration targets such as checkerboard, our method is more flexible and easier to perform.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2014.6838203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838203","sensor fusion;2-D homography;extrinsic calibration;camera calibration","Cameras;Laser radar;Calibration;Quantum cascade lasers;Accuracy;Robot sensing systems","","5","","","","18 Jun 2014","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

This paper presents the existing technologies of malicious code detection and a malicious code detection model is proposed based on behavior association. The behavior points of malicious code are first extracted through API monitoring technology and integrated into the behavior; then a relation between behaviors is established according to data dependence. Next, a behavior association model is built up and a discrimination method is put forth using pushdown automation. Finally, the exact malicious code is taken as a sample to carry out an experiment on the behavior's capture, association, and discrimination, thus proving that the theoretical model is viable.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2014.6919827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6919827","malicious code;behavior monitor;behavior association;pushdown automation","Automation;Grammar;Computers;Monitoring;Virtual machining;Trojan horses","","5","","","","13 Oct 2014","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The STC model is derived successfully from an ideal single-diode circuit model. Relative error estimations are developed to do the conformity error measurements. The analysis results showed that though the biases at those critical points are very small, the conformity will depend on both of the two ratio values $I$m/$I$sc and $V$m/$V$oc, which can be used to verify whether 2C model is applicable for the PV module produced by a particular manufacturer.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-014-0085-8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005349","Photovoltaic module;Analytic model;Explicit model;Implicit model;Borowy model;Conformity check;Derivation of the model;Conformity error measurement","Integrated circuit modeling;Analytical models;Mathematical model;Voltage measurement;Data models;Measurement uncertainty;Resistance","","5","","10","","20 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

For small filling factor grating (f <; 0.9), the enhanced anomalous absorption only appears at grazing incidence with incident angle larger than 85°; however, if the filling factor is sufficiently large (f > 0.9), anomalous absorption is realizable only if the total internal reflection occurs.

The impact of NO2 and NH3 on 1/f noise of p- and n-type nanowires, respectively, is limited. However, 1/f noise increases in n-Si nanowires under influence of NO2  while it decreases in p-Si nanowires for NH3. This effect is attributed to oxygen vacancies in the SiO2 and the presence or absence of holes, h+ in the humid gas environment.

The algorithm maintains SNR consistent in the entire initial average phase difference space, and has a better SNR performance than the overlap average algorithm. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by both theoretical analysis and simulation results.

At ultrafast transmission rates, ISI becomes a dominant component of the BER, and its effect on the BER should be carefully addressed. One solution to this problem, termed the bit-pattern-dependent (PD) approach, is to first calculate the conditional BER given a specific bit pattern and then average over all possible bit patterns. Alternatively, a simplifying method, termed the bit-pattern-independent (PI) approach, has been commonly used whereby the average bit stream is used to calculate the distribution of the receiver output, which, in turn, is used to calculate the BER. However, when ISI is dominant, the PI approximation is inaccurate. Here, the two approaches are analytically compared by analyzing their asymptotic behavior and their bounds. Conditions are found to determine when the PI method overestimates the BER. The BER found using the PD method exponentially decays with the received optical power, whereas for the PI approach, the BER converges to a constant, which is unrealistic. For an InP-based APD receiver with a 100-nm multiplication layer, the PI method is found to be inaccurate for transmission rates beyond 20 Gb/s.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2302792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725617","Bit error rate (BER);optical receivers;Gaussian distribution;photodectors;intersymbol interference (ISI);analytical models;approximation error","Bit error rate;Optical receivers;Approximation methods;Noise;Educational institutions;Photonics","","4","1","14","OAPA","27 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to reduce the emission times of the radar, a novel sensor selection strategy based on an improved interacting multiple model particle filter (IMMPF) tracking method is presented. Firstly the IMMPF tracking method is improved by increasing the weight of the particle which is close to the system state and updating the model probability of every particle. Then a sensor selection approach for LPI takes use of both the target's maneuverability and the state's uncertainty to decide the radar's radiation time. The radar will work only when the target's maneuverability and the state's uncertainty exceed the control capability of the passive sensors.

The Magnus turbines have cylinders instead of conventional blades and its operation is based on the physical principle known as the Magnus Effect. The Magnus turbines consume power for rotating the cylinders, so the MPPT performs tracking of the net power generated by subtracting the power consumed in the electric motor to drive the cylinders. The simulation results are presented for the proposed Magnus wind turbine system with measurements of mechanical shaft power including the controlled mechanical load torque and DC servo drive (DC servo drive and brushless DC motor). This system was designed to perform optimization studies of a turbine Magnus prototype. In the proposed HCC algorithm, the negative net power band uses a fixed step increment of cylinder rotation and the other parts of the curve use an adaptive step. As the curve slope tends to zero near the maximum point, the step increment decreases, thus minimizing the oscillations around that point.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993314","Magnus Wind Turbine;HCC Algorithm;Magnus Effect;MPPT;Rotating Cylinders","","","4","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The multiplication factor can be tuned by changing the frequency difference between the CW and the free oscillating wavelength of the DFB laser.

Due to the slight advance of imaging instruments, such as the focus of camera and the image element of charge coupled device (CCD), it is an innovative and economical way to improve the camera's resolution to enforce the satellite to fly on the lower altitude orbit. DFH-3, the mature satellite bus developed by Chinese Academy of Space Technology, is employed to define the mass and power budgets for the computational mission analysis and the detailed engineering design for super low altitude satellites. An effective iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the ergodic representation of feasible mass and power budgets at the flight altitude under constraints. Besides, boundaries of mass or power exist for every altitude, where the upper boundary is derived from the maximum power, while the minimum thrust force holds the lower boundary before the power reaching the initial value. What's more, an analytical algorithm is employed to numerically investigate the coverage percentage over the altitude, so that the nominal altitude could be selected from all the feasible altitudes based on both the mass and power budgets and the repetitive ground traces. The local time at the descending node is chosen for the nominal sun-synchronous orbit based on the average evaluation function. After determining the key orbital elements based on the computational mission analysis, the detailed engineering design on the configuration and other subsystems, like power, telemetry telecontrol and communication (TT&C), and attitude determination and control system (ADCS), is performed based on the benchmark bus, besides, some improvements to the bus are also implemented to accommodate the flight at a super low altitude. Two operation strategies, drag-free closed-loop mode and on/off open-loop mode, are presented to maintain the satellite's altitude. Finally, a flight planning schedule for the satellite is demonstrated from its launch into the initial altitude at the very beginning to its decay to death in the end.","1004-4132","","10.1109/JSEE.2014.00006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754227","super low altitude;computational mission analysis;drag free control;mass and power budget","Satellites;Space vehicles;System analysis and design;Batteries;Computational modeling;Benchmark testing","","4","","","","4 Mar 2014","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

In case a permanent magnet generator is used, the rotor magnets will cause an additional cogging torque which makes starting even more difficult. By using the generator as motor from the moment a wind gust is detected, the turbine is able to accelerate much faster to reach the maximum power point. A maximum power point tracking algorithm is used to locate the optimal working point. At sufficiently large rotor speeds, the controller switches to the generator mode where the energy used for acceleration is recuperated, together with the additional energy captured from the wind gust. To control the generator power in both directions, an active rectifier is used in a back-to-back converter topology. In this paper, this wind capture strategy is simulated. The results show that the power output during a wind gust can be largely increased compared to common MPP-tracking.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993228","Wind energy conversion system;Maximum power point tracking;Wind gust capture;Permanent-magnet synchronous generator;Back-to-back converter","","","4","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Each bag is made up of several unlabeled instances. A bag is labeled positive if at least one of its instances is positive, otherwise negative. Existing multiple-instance learning methods with instance selection ignore the representative degree of the selected instances. For example, if an instance has many similar instances with the same label around it, the instance should be more representative than others. Based on this idea, in this paper, a multiple-instance learning with instance selection via constructive covering algorithm (MilCa) is proposed. In MilCa, we firstly use maximal Hausdorff to select some initial positive instances from positive bags, then use a Constructive Covering Algorithm (CCA) to restructure the structure of the original instances of negative bags. Then an inverse testing process is employed to exclude the false positive instances from positive bags and to select the high representative degree instances ordered by the number of covered instances from training bags. Finally, a similarity measure function is used to convert the training bag into a single sample and CCA is again used to classification for the converted samples. Experimental results on synthetic data and standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that MilCa can decrease the number of the selected instances and it is competitive with the state-of-the-art MIL algorithms.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2014.6838199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838199","multiple-instance learning;instance selection;constructive covering algorithm;maximal Hausdorff","Training;Silicon;Benchmark testing;Signal processing algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Standards","","4","","","","18 Jun 2014","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The collimated incident laser beam is divided into the reference arm and object arm. The latter propagates through the objective lens and then interferes with the slightly deflected reference beam that reflected back by a fixed mirror, giving rise to an interferential pattern on the CCD. Any amounts of defocusing can be directly indicated from the demodulated phase of the interferential pattern. In this manner, the focusing sensitivity at nanometer scale is experimentally attainable, which shows great superiority over traditional methods, particularly the limited focal length of current projective objective lens.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2326676","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61274108,61204114,61376110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820728","Interferometry;metrology;fringe analysis;phase unwrapping;lithography","Focusing;Laser beams;Lenses;Charge coupled devices;Optical interferometry;Interferometric lithography","","4","","18","OAPA","23 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Significant measurement errors can be resulted due to the following facts: 1) a photometer with a diffuser generally has a spatial response that is stronger in the center of the detector; and 2) LED angular distributions of intensity often have a sidelobe about the central axis rather than a central peak. A special measuring facility for illuminance intensity distribution of LEDs and spatial response distribution of photometers has been designed. An evaluation factor “ c” has been introduced to describe the spatial response distribution uniformity of photometers. Three kinds of photometers with different spatial response distribution were used to measure the averaged LED intensity individually. Experiment shows that the photometer with a diffuser has a response distribution of a cosine function, and the illuminance intensity distribution of LEDs generally presents a sine, trapezoidal, or cosine function with the 6.5 ° field of view for CIE Condition B. The results show that the measurement errors could be more than -5.10% when using the photometer with a diffuser to measure the average intensity of LEDs with a narrow beam angle. It is very important that the uniformity of spatial response distribution of the photometer should be considered when calibrating Averaged LED Intensity as it can introduce a significant error.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2295458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690231","Metrology;uniformity of spatial response;light-emitting diode (LED);glass diffuser;photometer","Detectors;Light emitting diodes;Light sources;Optical filters;Standards;Semiconductor device measurement;Apertures","","4","","11","CCBY","20 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the structure, the introduced periodical back grooves bring about different orders of transmission minima into the transmission spectrum, which are named as transmission minima introduced by back grooves (TMIBBGs) here. When TMIBBGs approach the Fabry-Pérot (FP)-like resonant transmission peaks supported in the slits, the latter will be strongly suppressed. However, the reflection dips are almost unaffected. As a result, absorption is greatly enhanced. More interesting, the positions of TMIBBGs can be tuned by modulating the structural parameters of back grooves to selectively inhibit different orders of FP-like resonant transmission peaks and realize corresponding enhanced absorption, meanwhile, without influence to other orders of FP-like resonant transmissions.

In this paper, a new control topology is proposed to facilitate the use of higher droop gains. The advantages of the proposed control topology are proven through small-signal stability analysis. The controller gains are optimally determined using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), where the main objective is to maximize the droop gain while maintaining micro-grid stability and adequate dynamic performance. The proposed control topology with its optimal parameters is verified through tests on a micro-grid with three IBDG units and validated using real time hardware in loop implementation.

And finally the radial velocity difference of a target relative to two stations with the least square method is estimated. This algorithm only needs accurate estimation of the time delay between pulses and is not influenced by parameters such as frequency and modulation mode.

Moreover, because of the coarser slant-range resolution of multipolarimetric SAR data, distributed scatterers (DSs) should be taken into account to obtain a spatial density of pixels that is sufficient to estimate the parameters of interest. To this aim, we applied a small baseline criterion to create the analyzed data sets, and we used space adaptive filtering to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the DSs.

In this letter, we extract the underlying potential fluctuations directly from the enhanced minority-carrier injection experiment published in the literature. The core of the extraction lies in a combination of the two existing theoretical frameworks. First, the Gaussian distribution can serve as a good approximation of potential fluctuations. Second, no change can be made in the real bandgap between fluctuating conduction- and valence-band edges. Extracted potential fluctuations come from plasmons, as verified by our published temperature dependences of plasmons limited mobility in the inversion layer of MOSFETs as well as theoretical calculation results on bulk silicon.

Therefore, the precise mathematical model for prediction of marine current speed is developed and validated with the recorded measurements at the specific location (Pentland Firth, Scotland). Additionally, the ancillary services of frequency control and inertial response have been deployed with large-scale implementation of MCTs to improve the dispatchability and compliance with grid code requirement. The main objective of the proposed control strategy is twofold: 1) achieve the primary frequency response and 2) mitigate power imbalances. This novel frequency management scheme is based on the combination of inertial response and a deloaded margin of 10%. The presented techniques are verified using a test power system at varying load levels and different marine speeds. The simulation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed frequency control strategy in satisfying the aforementioned objectives and improving frequency regulation and transient response.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993230","Marine Current Turbine;Doubly Fed Induction Generator;Frequency Control;Inertial Response;Deloaded Operation","","","3","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The purpose of this paper is to investigate this phenomena and establish whether the safety margin of aging tests can be increased by changes in manufacture or test procedures. Using a number of cable types with different compositions and dimensions, the evolution of the absolute values of tensile strength and elongation at break upon aging was obtained. The results show that the major changes in mechanical properties happen within the first 24-48 h. This finding is valid both for ethylene vinylsilane copolymers and for grafted silane systems. In general, the effect is more pronounced for the 100°C compatibility test. Statistical analysis shows that insulation crosslinked in a hot waterbath will exhibit this behavior to a lesser extent, thus increasing the safety margin in aging tests, compared with ambient curing. This paper demonstrates that preconditioning at 70°C has no significant impact on aging properties. In addition, only small variations in mechanical properties were seen when changing the process parameters. It is concluded that further crosslinking is the principal cause of the phenomena under investigation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2308919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758336","Mechanical properties;silane crosslinking;thermal aging","Aging;Mechanical factors;Cable insulation;Polyethylene;Power cables","","3","","7","OAPA","6 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, the testing and performance evaluations of these applications are increasingly important. User model based evaluations can significantly reduce the manual work required, and can enable us to determine the performance of applications under real runtime environments. Hence, it has become one of the most popular evaluation methods in both industry and academia. Significant efforts have focused on building different kinds of models using mining web access logs, such as Markov models and Customer Behavior Model Graph (CBMG). This paper proposes a new kind of model, named the User Representation Model Graph (URMG), which is built based on CBMG. It uses an algorithm to refine CBMG and optimizes the evaluations execution process. Based on this model, an automatic testing and evaluation system for web applications is designed, implemented, and deployed in our test cloud, which is able to execute all of the analysis and testing operations using only web access logs. In our system, the error rate caused by random access to applications in the execution phase is also reduced, and the results show that the error rate of the evaluation that depends on URMG is 50% less than that which depends on CBMG.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2014.6733209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6733209","cloud;web application;performance evaluation;customer behavior;user representation","Topology;Testing;Performance evaluation;User interfaces;Data models;Delays;Clustering algorithms","","3","","","","7 Feb 2014","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The protocol makes it possible for the user to get the real-time security status of the resources, thereby solving the problem of guaranteeing dynamic credibility.

The Support vector machine (SVM) is a class of supervised learning model with associated learning algorithm that analyzes data and recognizes patterns.

The power flow can be bidirectional in distribution networks which become smarter with distributed generators (DGs). It is expensive to import electricity from the generation far from load centers because of the cost of power loss and network use, so that it is more economical to use electricity generated by local distributed generators. Therefore, in order to curtail operating costs of distribution networks, this paper proposes a model of economic optimization conducted by distribution network operators. The electricity purchasing costs for distribution network operators are minimized by optimizing electric power from transmission systems and local distributed generators. Further, based on price elasticity, the formulations of load demand considering RTP are proposed with economic optimization of distribution networks. The economic optimization problems are resolved by an interior point method. The case study shows that peak load demand can be reduced about 3.5% because the household RTP and electricity purchasing costs of distribution network operators can save 28.86 £ every hour.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-014-0086-7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9005372","Distribution network;Economic operation;Electricity cost;Real-time pricing","Optimization;Economics;Generators;Elasticity;Cogeneration;Load management;Pricing","","2","","25","","20 Feb 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Firstly, the algorithm takes target region's maximum and average intensity, area, length of long axis and long-to-short axis ratio of the external ellipse as factors which influence the target appearing probability. The knowledge-based detection algorithm can produce preprocess results without the need of estimation of clutter models as CFAR does.

The proposed controller overcomes the power oscillation around the operating point which appears in most implemented MPPT techniques. The proposed MPPT controller using SMC has been developed in such a way that the sliding surface is set to be the MPP condition, so that the operating point converges to the optimum operating point. An adaptive SMC gain has been designed and implemented in the proposed controller to allow the compensation of the uncertainty of ambient conditions. The results show a satisfactory operation of a PV power system and a better achievability of the operating point to the optimal operating point. The validation of the proposed controller is shown by MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation.

Earlier, major research on this new scheme had only focused on the perfect-condition scenarios, with the assumption that the system is free from synchronization errors. However, recent studies show that synchronization errors, especially the carrier frequency offsets, have significant impact on the OFDM-IDMA systems. This work therefore examines comprehensively, analyses and verifies the impact of synchronization errors on the performance of the OFDM-IDMA hybrid multicarrier scheme. Furthermore, simple but effective synchronization algorithms, namely; the linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) based algorithm, and the Kernel Least Mean Square (KLMS) algorithm as well as its normalized counterpart called the Normalized-KLMS are adopted and adequately exploited to combat the degrading impacts of synchronization errors on the OFDM-IDMA scheme. The linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) based algorithm, is a non-data aided method, which focuses on the mitigation of the interchannel interference induced by the effect of synchronization errors on the system. The Kernel Least Mean Square (KLMS) algorithm, as well as its normalized counterpart, presents an efficient approach for estimation and effective correction methods to combat the effect of carrier frequency offset errors on the performance of the OFDM-IDMA system. The bit error rate (BER) performance of these algorithms is presented, compared, and analyzed.

The index gratings play a role in selectively transmitting the incident beam carrying the periodic grating pattern of a code scale. The beam router, consisting of a collimating lens in conjunction with a prism, is used to collimate and steer the beam originating from a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) toward the code scale. The proposed encoder is rigorously designed by ray optic simulations and manufactured by passively aligning a smart frame, which is produced by plastic injection molding, with a VCSEL at λ = 850 nm and two semicircular photodetectors. The index grating is created by forming an Al grating pattern of a 10- μm pitch on a silica substrate. Two output signals provide sinusoidal signals, which are 90 ° out of phase from each other. The period of the signals is 4 μs at a frequency of 250 kHz, which is equivalent to a period of 10 μm. As expected, the relative phase relationship is reversed by altering the direction of rotation of the code scale. By examining either of the two output signals, we can simply demonstrate positional and angular resolutions of about 10 μm and 0.04 °, respectively. The attained resolutions can be readily enhanced to 2.5 μm and 0.01 °, by simultaneously taking into account the two signals with a distinct 90 ° phase difference.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2307554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746062","Sensors;micro-optics;gratings;electro-optical systems","Gratings;Indexes;Optical sensors;Optical reflection;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Laser beams;Lenses","","2","","21","OAPA","20 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At present, most of the research on acceleration estimation is carried out in cases of a single target with time-frequency analysis methods such as fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), Hough-ambiguity transform (HAT), and Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), which need to satisfy enough time duration and sampling theorem. Only one reference proposed a method of acceleration estimation for multiple targets based on modified polynomial phase transform (MPPT) in the linear frequency modulation (LFM) continuous-wave (CW) radar. The method of acceleration estimation for multiple targets in the pulse Doppler (PD) radar has not been reported so far. Compressive sensing (CS) has the advantage of sampling at a low rate and short duration without sacrificing estimation performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method of acceleration estimation for multiple maneuvering targets with the unknown number based on CS with pulse Doppler signals. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under several conditions with different duration, measurement numbers, signal to noise ratios (SNR), and regularization parameters, respectively.

"The use of 66kV technology for offshore wind demonstration sites","A. P. Neumann; M. J. Mulroy; C.

This is also currently the standard distribution voltage (or collection voltage) for interarray networks. Larger, further-from-shore wind farms normally use offshore substations to step-up generation to a higher voltage, e.g.132kV/170kV before transmission back to shore. Recent research shows that a submarine cable capable of being used for 66kV networks, i.e. a “wet-type” cable, could be type-tested and made available. The Carbon Trust is currently progressing work to qualify and type-test this cable, which presents opportunities for standard collection voltages to increase from 33kV to 66kV. This paper presents the benefits of utilising 66kV for near-shore and medium distance offshore wind farms, both for UK and international demonstration wind farm projects. The benefits include the potential to reduce the amount of submarine cabling required, reduced losses in the connection at 66kV versus 33kV, and the potential to eliminate offshore substations in some cases. The costs and benefits have been quantitatively and qualitatively assessed and detail is provided for 33kV/66kV equipment cost comparisons (switchgear, cable and transformers), cost reduction/benefit impacts of substation and cabling rationalisation, and full-life difference in losses and hence revenue from generation. The paper specifically addresses the feasibility of developing a system implementing 66kV at the Blyth Offshore Demonstration site. Also presented are potential enablers and barriers to 66kV market uptake such as supply chain readiness, the feasibility of demonstrating the proposed 66kV technology at dedicated sites in the UK and outline design and feasibility considerations for certification at 66kV with an emphasis on Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) certification. It is concluded that moving to 66kV could lead to capital cost and full-life benefits compared with the present standard voltage of 33kV for many near and medium distance-to-shore wind farms. However, steps to accelerate market uptake should also be considered by exploring enablers (testing, demonstration, certification, etc.) and solutions to related barriers.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993225","Cables;Substations;Offshore;66kV;Windfarms","","","1","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

These devices successfully demonstrated the capabilities of this technology by providing reliable dose and dose-equivalent information based on a track-by-track analysis. Figure shows a sample comparison of the output from all five devices with respect to the on-board tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) for both absorbed dose (top) and dose-equivalent (bottom) as defined in NCRP 142. The lower graph in each set is the TEPC. Several issues were identified and solutions to adjust for them have been included in the analysis. These include items such as the need to identify nuclear interactions in the silicon sensor layer, and to separate penetrating from stopping tracks. The wide effective range in fluence and particle type of this technology was also verified through the highest rates seen during the South Atlantic Anomaly passes and the heavy ions nominally seen in the Galactic Cosmic Rays. Corrections for detector response saturation effects were also successfully implemented as verified by reference to ground-based accelerator data taken at the Heavy-Ion Medical Accelerator Center (HIMAC) facility at the National Institute for Radiological Sciences in Japan, and at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. Flight hardware has been produced that will be flown on the first launch of the new Orion spacecraft, and flight hardware development is ongoing to accommodate the next generation of this technology as a baseline for radiation monitoring and dosimetry on future operational manned missions.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206909","","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This rotating gantry can transport heavy ions having 430 MeV/u to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over ±180°, and is further capable of performing fast raster-scanning irradiation . A layout of the beam-transport line for the compact rotating-gantry is presented in Fig. . The rotating gantry has 10 superconducting magnets (BM01-10), a pair of the scanning magnets (SCM-X and SCM-Y) and two pairs of beam profile- monitor and steering magnets (ST01-02 and PRN01-02). For BM01-BM06 and BM09-BM10, the combined-function superconducting magnets are employed. Further, these superconducting magnets are designed for fast slewing of the magnetic field to follow the multiple flattop operation of the synchrotron . The use of the combined-function superconducting magnets with optimized beam optics allows a compact gantry design with a large scan size at the isocenter; the length and the radius of the gantry will be to be ∼13 and 5.5 m, respectively, which are comparable to those for the existing proton gantries. Furthermore, the maximum scan size at the isocenter is calculated to be as large as ∼200 mm square for heavy-ion beams at the maximum energy of 430 MeV/u.All of the superconducting magnets were designed, and their magnetic fields were calculated using the Opera-3d code . With the calculated magnetic fields, beam-tracking simulations were made. The simulation results agreed well with those of the linear beam-optics calculation, proving validity of the final design for the superconducting magnets. The five out of 10 superconducting magnets, as well as the model magnet were currently manufactured. With these magnets, rotation tests, magnetic field measurements and fast slewing tests were conducted. However, we did not observe any significant temperature increase, which may cause a quench problem. Further, results of the magnetic field measurements roughly agreed with those calculated by the Opera-3d code.The design study as well as major tests of the superconducting magnets was completed, and the construction of the superconducting rotating-gantry is in progress. The construction of the superconducting rotating-gantry will be completed at the end of FY2014, and be commissioned within FY2015. Fig. 1. Layout of the superconducting rotating-gantry.

This smart rotor approach can reduce loads on the rotor due to wind field non-uniformity, but also, as presented in this paper, can supplement the pitch control system. Rotor speed and tower vibration damping are actively controlled using pitch. By supplementing the speed control using smart rotor control, pitch actuator travel is reduced by 15%, pitch rates by 23%, and pitch accelerations by 42%. This is achieved through filtering the pitch demand such that high frequency signals are dealt with by the smart rotor devices while the low frequency signal is dealt with by pitching the blades. It is also shown that this may be achieved while also using the smart rotor control for load reduction, though with reduced effectiveness. This shows that smart rotor control can be used to trade pitch actuator requirements as well as load reductions with the cost of installing and maintaining the distributed devices.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993312","smart rotor wind turbine control","","","1","2","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Firstly, SOC theory and its validation method are introduced. Then an SOC validation method for USDT of the equipment is proposed based on the above theory. Case study is done on bottleneck equipment in a factory and corresponding data pre-process work is done. The rescaled-range (R/S) analysis method is used to calculate the Hurst exponent of USDT time-series data in order to determine the long-range correlation of USDT data on time scale; at the same time the spatial power-law characteristic of USDT time series data is studied. The result shows that the characteristics of SOC are revealed in USDT data of the equipment according to the criterion of SOC.

Five patients with esophagus cancer were studied. Datasets of the five patients were provided by DIR-lab (dir-lab.com) and consisted of thoracic 4D CT images and a coordinate list of anatomical landmarks that had been manually identified. Expert landmark correspondence was used for evaluating DIR spatial accuracy. First, the manually measured displacement vector field (mDVF) was obtained from the coordinate list of anatomical landmarks. Then the automatically calculated displacement vector field (aDVF) was calculated by using the following four DIR algorithms: B-spine implemented in Velocity AI (Velocity Medical, Atlanta, GA, USA), free-form deformation (FFD), Horn–Schunk optical flow (OF) and Demons in DIRART of MATLAB software. Registration error is defined as the difference between mDVF and aDVF. The mean 3D registration errors were 2.7 ± 0.8 mm for B-spline, 3.6 ± 1.0 mm for FFD, 2.4 ± 0.9 mm for OF and 2.4 ± 1.2 mm for Demons. The results showed that reasonable accuracy was achieved in B-spline, OF and Demons, and that these algorithms have the potential to be used for 4D dose calculation, automatic image segmentation and 4D CT ventilation imaging in patients with thoracic cancer. However, for all algorithms, the accuracy might be improved by using the optimized parameter setting.

The spatial distribution of the induced refractive index change can be obtained by subtracting the phase of different voltages, and the effective electrooptic coefficient is calculated by means of the refractive index change.

These converters operate frequently below their rated power due to the fluctuation of the power generated by the renewable sources. In this scenario, power electronics interfaces could be also used as active harmonic compensators for other converters or distorting loads. Typically, these converters do not have information on other loads or on the level of grid current distortion. For this reason, this paper presents a new control algorithm for the grid harmonics compensation that relies only on the measurement of the voltage at the point of connection of the power converter. The reference of the compensating current is calculated from the harmonic content of the voltage in a reference frame synchronous with the grid voltage. Simulation results carried out on a sample distribution network with linear and nonlinear loads show that the proposed method does not require the knowledge of the harmonic current either of the grid or of the load and it is suitable when the distorting loads are unknown.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993328","Active filters;harmonic compensation;distributed generation","","","1","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Secondly, cross-range resolution is gained with a rotating table, and the high-resolution two-dimensional (2-D) imaging of the scale model is obtained by the microwave imaging theory. Finally, two receiving antennas with a small distance in altitude are used, and the three-dimensional (3-D) height distribution of scattering points on the scale model is extracted from the phase of images.

The time scale of ultra-short term wind power prediction usually stays between the levels of minutes to hours, thus it can provide real-time technique supports to power grid dispatching and make sure the secure, stable and economic operation of electric power system. Three algorithms are adopted to establish the ultrashort term wind power prediction model, which including BP, SVM and RBF. The predicted models are applied to carry on wind power prediction in three real wind farms which locates in different regions of China, and the applicability of these three models was analysed via the comparison of various predicted results. Besides, a wind farm which has the highest predicted efficiency was taken as an example, so that we can make an analysis of the predicted error caused by different time span. The whole prediction results show that the annual variation of prediction error will change with wind farm and seasonal factors. With the increase of time span, the RMSE of forecasting power takes on ascending trend. The higher average forecasting error is, the higher error of every single predicted point, which is the same with low error situation. Due to the frequent variation of weather system in spring and winter, the three forecasting models have unstable predicted effectiveness in those two seasons. By contrast, the BP-ANN and RBF-ANN models have better forecasting results, while the SVM model acts a little bit worse.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993262","wind farm;ultra short-term;power prediction;time span;error variation","","","","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Proper signal processing and analysis become crucial here for interpreting the conditions of gears and bearings. In this paper, order analysis is studied for condition monitoring the planetary stage of wind turbine gearbox. The approach takes advantage of angular resampling to achieve cyclo-stationary vibration signals and lessen the effects due to speed changes. One key element in the scheme is taking angular information to enable resampling the time-domain signals into angular-domain signals. A vibration signal model for gearbox planetary stage is firstly described, and the scheme is then tested on simulated signals to achieve fine frequency resolution.

Then, 101 patients were treated with a 2.1-Gy daily fraction to 73.5 or 77.7 Gy. More recently, 84 patients were treated with a 2.2-Gy fraction to 72.6 or 74.8 Gy. The median patient age was 70 years (range, 54–82) and the follow-up period for living patients was 47 months (range, 18–97). Androgen deprivation therapy was given according to patient risk. The overall and biochemical failure-free survival rates were, respectively, 96 and 82% at 6 years in the 2.0-Gy group, 99 and 96% at 4 years in the 2.1-Gy group, and 99 and 96% at 2 years in the 2.2-Gy group. The biochemical failure-free rate for high-risk patients in all groups was 89% at 4 years.

To protect astronauts in space environments, improvement in our knowledge of radiation-induced changes in specific target cells that may affect the health of astronauts is required. Cancer of blood cells, in particular myeloid leukemia (ML), is one of the major health concerns from exposure to space radiation. However, the predictions of risks for developing ML post-exposure to space radiation are unsatisfactory. To increase the reliability of predicting risk for ML, a much improved understanding of space radiation-induced changes in the target cells, i.e. hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), is critically important. In vivo studies of humans are not possible. Thus, controlled and randomized animal experiments are critically important.Most proteomic applications mentioned above have used 2-DE or stable isotope-tagged mass spectrometry. Although the 2-DE has several advantages (e.g. the detection of potential post-translational modifications of proteins which can be readily visualized on the gel, although the exact type of modification requires determination by mass spectrometry), such technology is simply not as comprehensive and reliable as desired. To overcome these limitations, we recently developed a unique label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (LFQMS) platform . This is an innovative, experimentally based method that accurately determines peptide peak retention-time and uses multiple filters for exclusion of unqualified peptides by peptide frequency, retention time, intensity coefficient of variation and intensity correlation to enhance protein quantification of qualified peptides and proteins.In this study, we used the LFQMS platform to examine protein expression-profiles in the colonies of HSPCs (the best population of cells for studying in vivo biological effects of radiation on hematopoietic stem cells) obtained at 6 months after exposure (at which radiation-induced genomic instability and chronic inflammation have been detected ) of CBA/CaJ mice whole-body to a total dose of 0, 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 Gy of 300 MeV/nucleon 28Si ions, using a fractionated schedule (two exposures, 15 days apart that totaled each selected dose). These doses of 300 MeV/nucleon 28Si ions are comparable to what astronauts encounter in space. Mice exposed to 0 Gy of 28Si ions served as non-irradiated sham controls. The colonies of HSPCs were obtained from BM cells of five mice per treatment group, by means of an in vitro colony forming unit assay (CFU-A) using methylcellulose-based medium. Proteins were extracted from HSPC colonies and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford Protein Assay. The trans-proteomic pipeline (TPP) was used to assign a probability of a particular protein being in the sample.A total of 1344 unique, non-redundant proteins were identified with ≥90% confidence from 3254 peptides, quantified and their abundances were compared statistically. Among the 1344 proteins, differential expression of 198 proteins was found to be statistically significant in HSPC colonies obtained from treated groups, in relation to those found in non-irradiated sham controls. A proof-of-concept-based Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, www.ingenuity.com) was used to characterize the functions and pathways of these 198 identified proteins. The majority of these proteins are cancer-related (P < 0.0001). Biochemical analyses of the molecular and cellular functions of these proteins reveal association with perturbation in cell survival, free radical scavenging, cell cycle, DNA repair, cellular assembly, hematological system development and inflammatory responses. These proteins are linked to two major molecular networks that are linked to cancer and inflammatory responses (i.e. nuclear factor-κ B and the protein phosphatase 2 A networks). Our results indicated 28Si ion-induced damage in HSPCs.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206905","protein expression profiles;hematopoietic stem cells;silicon ions","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

By carrying out a series of experiments, we have found that altered transcriptional regulation network composed of radiation-mediated miRNAs regulates the expression of their downstream target genes in most biological processes to control cell growth, cell cycle and apoptosis. For example, the newly identified miR-3928 negatively regulates the expression of Dicer, which has been validated by the luciferase assay and western blotting. Dicer is not only a key participant in responding to radiation, but also a critical factor for the maturation of miRNAs, suggesting that miR-3928 affects on the expression of other miRNAs through regulating Dicer. Among the miRNAs controlled by the Dicer, we reveal that miR-185 and miR-663 can efficiently suppress ATR and TGF-β1 expression, which are both important responders in the process of radiobiological effects. Further experiments reveal that the expression of Dicer is suppressed by miR-3928 induced by IR and consequently, the maturation of other miRNAs including miR-185 and miR-663 is inhibited, resulting in the abundantly enhanced expression of ATR and TGF-β1 respectively. This mechanism to hammer at fixing DNA damage or promote cells to apoptosis caused by IR has important implications in the decision of cell fates.Moreover, it has been shown that the expression of BTG1 is characterized in response to factors that induce growth arrest and subsequent differentiation both in vivo and in vitro, affecting cellular physiological progresses of angiogenesis, follicular development and myoblast and B cell differentiation, through regulating cell growth, migration, cell cycle, apoptosis and differentiation. BTG1 gene is phylogenetically highly conserved in its coding and 3′-untranslated region (UTR), which is considered as a decisive element involved in regulation of BTG1 expression. We present evidence that BTG1 can be induced by IR and confirm that miR-454-3p, whose gene locates in the intron of Ska2 gene, can regulate BTG1 expression through directly binding to the 3′-UTR of BTG1 mRNA. These results point out that increased expression of BTG1 caused by the down-regulation of miR-454-3p in case that IR modulates endogenous activity of PRMT1, a BTG1-binding partner, which can methylate endogenous transcription factors to change gene expression pattern and reply radiostilumation. An inverse relationship between the levels of expression of BTG1 and miR-454-3p reveals that there exists a new pathway in response to IR stimulation. Furthermore, cell growth will be transiently increased by the knockdown of BTG1 by transfecting BTG1 siRNA or miR-454-3p mimic. However, the apoptotic state of cells can be tested after 2 days. Down-regulation of BTG1 by miR-454-3p increases the sensitivity of human renal cell carcinoma 786-O cells to IR-induced apoptosis, suggesting that BTG1 could serve as a terget for sensitizing renal carcinoma to standard radiotherapy.Taken together, all these data indicate that alteration of miRNA expression is evident in the cellular response to IR. MiR-3928, miR-185, miR-663 and miR-454-3p may constitute a complex network contributing to the regulation of radiobiological effects. It is apparent that the study of radiation-related miRNAs is beneficial to qualitatively and quantitatively modulating radiobiological effects, and also in favor of the advanced research of miRNA functions.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206869","microRNA;network;Dicer;BTG1;ionizing radiation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For effective optical modulation in millimeter-wave (MMW) frequency ranges, a thin (∼50 μm-thick) LiNbO3 (LN) crystal stacked structure on a low-k material substrate is adapted to the device. By using the thin LN stacked structure, an effective electrical length/volume of the device becomes large compared with the EO crystal substrate devices, and a large antenna aperture size and long standing-wave modulation electrode are obtainable. Furthermore, the degradation of the modulation efficiency by substrate-mode resonance can also be reduced. Higher-efficiency optical modulation is therefore expected. In addition, by utilizing polarization-reversed structures and multiple optical waveguides in the EO antenna-coupled-electrode modulator, direction-of-arrival estimation of a wireless signal can also be obtained. The proposed modulator was designed in the 60 GHz band. Its basic operation was successfully demonstrated, with an improvement of ∼10 dB modulation efficiency compared to the conventional device using only an LN substrate. The control of the EO modulation directivity in four-channel optical waveguides was also successfully demonstrated for the first time, as far as we know.

"TNF-α and IL-1α but not MCP-1 and Rantes increase significantly the formation of p-H2AX foci in naïve BM-derived TNFR1/p55KO EPCs","S. P. Sasi; J. Song; H. Enderling; X. Yan; D. A. Goukassian",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i122","i123","Background: Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) binds two receptors TNFR1/p55 and TNFR2/p75 and activates several signaling cascades. Ionizing radiation (IR) increases tissue levels of TNF. TNF signaling regulates numerous cytokines and chemokines that are known to mediate radiation-induced non-targeted effects (NTEs), a phenomenon where cells that are not directly ‘hit’ by IR exhibit IR effects as a result of signals received from nearby or distant IR cells. Little is known about the role of p55 or p75 in regulating NTE in bone marrow (BM) cells, specifically in BM-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In media transfer experiments, we have previously shown that compared with WT EPCs, early NTEs (within 1–5 h) are inhibited in p55KO and p75KO EPCs, whereas delayed NTEs (within 3–5 days) are amplified in p55KO and to a lesser degree in p75KO EPCs, suggesting significant role of TNFR/p75 signaling (the remaining active receptor in p55KO EPCs) in mediating delayed NTEs. We hypothesized that signaling through TNFR2/p75 may alter radiation-induced TNF-mediated inflammatory response increasing tissue levels of various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors that could then induce NTE, possibly, via activation of NFkB and other stress response transcription factors.Methods: To test our hypothesis ex vivo, expanded p55KO EPCs were irradiated with 1 Gy of γ-IR, then IR-conditioned medium (CM) was collected at 1, 5, 24 h, and 3, 5 days post-IR. CM from IR p55KO EPCs were processed for multiplex ELISA (12 proteins). After determining concentrations of each of 12 proteins in control and IR-CM media of p55KO EPCs over 5 days, we treated naïve p55KO EPCs with various concentrations of four mouse recombinant (rm) proteins that were steadily increased in IR-CM between Days 3–5. After 24 h incubation, naïve p55KO EPCs were stained with anti-p-H2AX antibodies and the formation of p-H2AX foci was visualized at ×100 magnification using laser scanning confocal microscopy. The p-H2AX foci were quantified manually by a single investigator blindfolded to the treatment conditions and were confirmed using computer-assisted algorithm.Results: ELISA profiling of 12 proteins in IR-CM over 5 days post-IR showed 200–1600% increases (P < 0.02, at least, p55KO vs WT, Days 3–5) in cumulative levels of TNF, IFNr, IL1α, IL1β, IL6, EGF, MIP-1α, MCP-1, GCSF, GM-CSF, Rantes and Leptin. The steadiest and the highest increases between Days 3 and 5 were observed in IL-1α, MCP-1 and Rantes.Naïve p55KO EPCs were then treated ex vivo with concentrations determined in the ELISA: IL-1α (290, 580 pg/ml), MCP-1 (580, 1160, 2900 pg/ml), Rantes (600, 1500 pg/ml) and TNF (100 pg/ml, 1, 40 ng/ml). After 24 h incubation with rm proteins, p55KO EPCs were stained with anti-p-H2AX antibodies. The cells were imaged and the quantification of the p-H2AX foci was performed as described above.Results showed that the mean p-H2AX foci count of MCP-1 and Rantes was not significantly different from control which had a mean of 0.98 p-H2AX foci/cell count, with the exception of MCP-1 at 1160 pg/ml (P < 0.03, mean foci count of 1.9). TNF-treated naïve p55KO EPCs showed a significant increase in the mean p-H2AX foci/cell count at all concentration compared with the control, MCP-1 and Rantes (P < 0.0001 with the mean p-H2AX foci ranging from 2.8 to 3.9).IL1α-treated p55KO EPCs showed the greatest increase in p-H2AX foci with the mean foci count of 7.1 at 290 pg/ml and 9.3 at 580 pg/ml, and was significantly different from all tested mouse recombinant proteins. Analysis of p-H2AX foci distribution of EPCs with one or more foci showed that in control p55KO EPCs, <1% of cells had a maximum of 4–9 p-H2AX foci/cell. Whereas in TNF- and IL-1α-treated p55KO EPCs, >2% and >4% of cells had 9–18 foci/cell, respectively. Remarkably, 1% of cells had as many as 18–31 foci/cell for TNF-treated cells and as many as 19–51 foci/cell for IL-1α-treated p55KO EPCs.We conclude that TNF-TNFR2/p75 axis may induce NTEs in naïve BM-EPCs and suggest that blocking/neutralizing TNFR2/p75 signaling could represent a mitigating measure for prevention of delayed NTEs, specifically, in BM-derived EPCs and, conceivably, in BM milieu in general.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206911","TNF;TNFR2/p75;BM-EPCs;non-targeted;IL-1α","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In order to examine if and to what extent heart muscle cells are affected by an exposure to heavy ions, primary avian cardiomyocytes were isolated, cultured in vitro and exposed at GSI (Darmstadt) to different ion species (carbon, titanium and nickel). Investigation of electrophysiologic radiation effects was performed on cells grown on a microelectrode array (MEA) allowing the monitoring of beat rate, spike shape, field action potential duration and signal conduction pathways across the electrode array. Data were analysed using the DrCell software . In parallel, immunohistological stainings were conducted to examine cell cycle progression, DNA-damage repair and apoptosis.Our preliminary data indicate that primary cardiac cells possess a high robustness toward ionizing radiation as cultures receiving doses of up to 7 Gy still show unaltered electrophysiologic activity. This is exemplarily shown in Fig., where the beat rate of cells irradiated with 2 and 7 Gy carbon ions has been plotted. Figure also illustrates that within each treatment group, inter-sample variations are quite large and thus do not allow detection of subtle changes in cellular electrophysiology, probably due to the embryonic character of the cells.Interestingly, in terms of the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and cell cycle progression delay, the cultures showed a dose-dependent reduction in proliferation and DSB accumulation.Taken together, our electrophysiologic studies indicate that the large variations within the same treatment group of avian embryonic cardiomyocytes obscure the detection of radiation effects. To account for this problem, we will use in further studies human cardiomyocytes differentiated from iPS cells, as these cells resemble more closely the condition of an adult human heart and do not undergo developmental changes as embryonic cell cultures do.

This is partly due to the successful reproduction of chorus emissions by computer simulations, and partly due to precise observations of the emissions by spacecraft in planetary radiation belts. We give a brief account of the nonlinear theory of the generation mechanism of chorus emissions, which has been revealed by the simulations and observations. We describe the nonlinear dynamics of resonant electrons, and the formation of the electromagnetic electron “hole” that results in resonant currents generating rising-tone emissions. In contrast, falling-tone emissions are generated through the formation of electron “hills.” We also describe the mechanism of nonlinear wave damping due to quasi-oblique propagation, which results in the formation of a gap at half the electron cyclotron frequency. The nonlinear wave-growth theory of chorus emissions can also be applied to the generation mechanism of electromagnetic ion-cyclotron-(EMIC) triggered emissions, recently found in spacecraft observations. Hybrid code simulations have confirmed that coherent rising-tone emissions are generated by energetic protons at frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. Electromagnetic ion-cyclotron waves can also interact with relativistic electrons. Both chorus emissions and electromagnetic ion-cyclotron-triggered emissions play important roles in controlling radiation-belt particle dynamics.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2014.7909958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7909958","","Charge carrier processes;Magnetic fields;Cyclotrons;Mathematical model;Electromagnetic scattering;Resonant frequency","","","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

In this study, an analysis of patients receiving the trimodality therapy was performed to identify prognostic factors of biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS). Between May 2005 and November 2008, 123 high-risk prostate cancer patients (D'Amico classification) were treated with NHT prior to HDR brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated EBRT. Among these patients, 121 had completed AHT. The patients were assigned by time to be treated with a low-dose or high-dose arm of HDR brachytherapy with subsequent hypofractionated 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). Multivariate analysis was used to determine prognostic factors for bRFS. With a median follow-up of 60 months, the 5-year bRFS for all patients was 84.3% (high-dose arm, 92.9%; low-dose arm, 72.4%, P = 0.047). bRFS in the pre-HDR PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/ml subgroup was significantly improved compared with that in the pre-HDR PSA > 0.1 ng/ml subgroup (88.3% vs 68.2%, P = 0.034). On multivariate analysis, dose of HDR (P = 0.045, HR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.038–0.97) and pre-HDR PSA level (P = 0.02 HR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.18–10.16) were significant prognostic factors predicting bRFS. In high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with the trimodality therapy, the dose of HDR and pre-HDR PSA were significant prognostic factors. The pre-HDR PSA ≤ 0.1 subgroup had significantly improved bRFS. Further studies are needed to confirm the relevance of pre-HDR PSA in trimodality therapy.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150262","high-risk prostate cancer;HDR;trimodality therapy;PSA response","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Radiation-associated degenerative cardiovascular risks during normal aging and after adverse CV event 10 months post-initial exposure","S. P. Sasi; X. Yan; J. Lee; H. Sisakyan; J. Carrozza; D. A. Goukassian",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i111","i112","Background: During the future exploration-type space missions, astronauts will be exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) for more than 1–2 years. The effect of cosmic IR during and after space flights on the cardiovascular (CV) system is unknown. Therefore, it is important to evaluate space IR effects on the CV system and determine potential post-mission degenerative excess relative risks (ERR) to the heart as a function of normal aging (IR + AGING model) as well as determine whether space IR may affect the processes of recovery after an adverse CV event (i.e. acute myocardial infarct, AMI) during normal aging (IR + AGING + AMI model).Methods: Nine-month-old C57BL6N male mice were IR once with proton (50 cGy, 1 GeV/n) or (56Fe 15 cGy, 1 GeV/n). IR-induced alterations in cardiac function were assessed by echocardiography (ECHO) and hemodynamic measurements (HEMO). AMI was induced by ligation of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery 10 months post-IR. Mice were monitored over 28 days post-AMI.Results: Compared with control, in the IR + AGING study group, left ventricular end-systolic pressure (LVESP) was significantly decreased in both 1H- and 56Fe-IR (P < 0.03, both), suggesting IR-associated decrease in contractile function 10 month post-IRs. However, compared with age-matched control mice (18 months), the LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was significantly increased (P < 0.05) and minimum LV pressure change (dP/dt min, mmHg/sec) was significantly decreased (P < 0.02) in 1H-IR but not 56Fe-IR mice, suggesting that a single 50 cGy full body 1H-IR decreases considerably the relaxation function of the heart 10 months post-AMI. Of note, an increase in LVEDP and a decrease in dP/dt min are indicators that heart is not pumping blood well and is an early independent prognostic CV risk factor for development of cardiac de-compensation.In all three IR + AGING + AMI study groups, in average, there was 10–15% mortality up to 3 days post-AMI surgery with ∼90% survival rate in all groups 28 days post-AMI. This is rather very good survival rate for 18- to 20-month-old mice after permanent LAD ligation. In the IR + AGING + AMI study group, the most harmful effects on myocardial recovery 10 months post-IR and 28 days post-AMI were observed in the 56Fe-IR group. LVESP was significantly decreased in 56Fe-IR vs control and 1H-IR mice (P < 0.04 and <0.02, respectively). LVEDP was 3-fold higher in 56Fe-IR vs 1H-IR mice (P < 0.004) but was only slightly higher (P = n.s.) compared with control mice. However, dP/dt max and dP/dt min were significantly decreased in 56Fe-IR vs control (P < 0.007 and <0.05, respectively) and 1H-IR mice (P < 0.0004 and <0.0015, respectively), suggesting that 56Fe-AMI hearts developed cardiac de-compensation.Summary: Our data in the IR + AGING study group strongly suggest that 10 months post-IR low-dose high-energy 1H-IR but not low-dose HZE (56Fe) particle IR affects considerably contractile and relaxation functions during normal aging. Conversely, our data in the IR + AGING + AMI study group at 10 months post-IR taken together with our previously reported data for AMI recovery 3 month after a single 50 cGy 1H-IR and 15 cGy 56Fe-IR indicate that 3 months and as long as 10 months after a single full-body IR, the 56Fe-IR is detrimental, whereas 1H-IR does not have negative effects on post-AMI recovery. In fact, single 1H-IR, at this dose, was considerably beneficial for post-AMI recovery at 3 months, as well as at 10 months post-IR.Major conclusions: Our longitudinal 1, 3 and 10 months studies in the IR + AGING and IR + AGING + AMI groups reveal that a single full-body low-dose 1H and HZE particle radiation (56Fe) have long-lasting negative effect on heart homeostasis during normal aging (predominantly 56Fe and at 10 months 1H-IR, as well), and present a significant CV risk for recovery after adverse CV event (exclusively 56Fe-IR, whereas 1H-IR at this dose could beneficial). Further, the divergent effects of low dose 1H-IR vs 56Fe-IR on heart function during normal aging vs after adverse CV event suggest significantly different biological responses responsible for this ion-dependent dichotomy over 10 months post-IR and necessitate further in-depth studies into underlying molecular mechanisms.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206913","HZE;iron;proton;low-dose;cardiovascular risks;echocardiography;hemodynamics","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

They cause complex damage to DNA and other cellular components, leading to both direct and indirect biological effects. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that one of these indirect effects is to compromise the accuracy of the DNA repair machinery, reducing the ability to cope with subsequent genotoxic insults. To this end, we used a new human reporter cell line with single-copy integrated fluorescent reporter cassettes that allow measurement of the frequency of mutagenic repair. Introduction of the rare cutting I-SceI nuclease stimulates both translocations (joining of two I-SceI sites on different chromosomes), and deletions (joining of two I-SceI sites after deletion of an intervening fragment) . These can be measured simultaneously in the same cell population using different color reporter genes. To test the effect of HZE exposure on the frequency of translocations and deletions in this assay, cells were exposed to 600 MeV/u 56Fe ions or 1000 MeV/u 48Ti ions at doses of 0.3 or 1.0 Gy. They were allowed to recover and challenged with I-SceI at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post-irradiation. Results showed that HZE particle irradiation significantly increased the frequency of I-SceI translocations and deletions above baseline levels. There was an increase in translocations by up to threefold, seen in both 56Fe- and 48Ti-treated populations. There was also a more modest, but significant increase in I-SceI-mediated deletions seen in a population that received the higher dose (1.0 Gy) of 56Fe particles. The increased frequency of I-SceI-induced translocations and deletions persisted for 2–3 weeks with 56Fe (but not with 48Ti). The increased frequency of translocations and deletions was not observed in populations treated with low-LET radiation at doses up 3 Gy. Thus, the phenomenon, which we term the ‘mutagenic repair phenotype’ depends on both dose and radiation quality. The mutagenic repair phenotype was associated with an elevated frequency of micronuclei and excess DNA repair foci, suggesting that persistent genomic stress might be one causative factor .To further explore the mechanism underlying the mutagenic DNA repair phenotype, we performed genome-wide expression profiling on cells that were harvested 7 days post-56Fe ion exposure. Results showed significant alterations in 234 genes. Many of the most highly induced genes encode secreted proteins that have previously been implicated in cellular senescence or pro-inflammatory processes. These findings suggest that a paracrine mechanism (induction of a set of senescence or inflammation-related proteins) may also contribute to the mutagenic repair phenotype.Altered regulation of cellular double-strand break repair, with an increased reliance on an error-prone pathway, is a novel mechanism whereby an indirect effect of HZE exposure may amplify cancer risk.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206881","HZE radiation;DNA repair;secreted factor;stress response","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this study, the dosimetric results of these two modalities were compared from the viewpoint of conformity, heterogeneity and gradient in target covering. A total of 14 patients with skull base tumors were treated with Novalis intensity-modulated (IM)-SRT. Treatment was planned on an iPlan workstation. Five- to seven-beam IM-SRT was performed in 14–18 fractions with a fraction dose of 2.5 or 3 Gy. With these patients' data, additional treatment planning was simulated using a GammaPlan workstation for PFX-SRT. Reference CT images with planning structure contour sets on iPlan, including the planning target volume (PTV, 1.1–102.2 ml) and organs at risk, were exported to GammaPlan in DICOM-RT format. Dosimetric results for Novalis IM-SRT and PFX-SRT were evaluated in the same prescription doses. The isocenter number of PFX was between 12 and 50 at the isodose contour of 50–60%. The PTV coverage was 95–99% for Novalis and 94–98% for PFX. The conformity index (CI) was 1.11–1.61 and 1.04–1.15, the homogeneity index (HI) was 1.1–3.62 and 2.3–3.25, and the gradient index (GI) was 3.72–7.97 and 2.54–3.39 for Novalis and PFX, respectively. PTV coverage by Novalis and PFX was almost equivalent. PFX was superior in CI and GI, and Novalis was better in HI. Better conformality would be achieved by PFX, when the homogeneity inside tumors is less important.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8150264","stereotactic radiosurgery;Gamma Knife;Perfexion;Novalis;intensity-modulated radiation therapy;intracranial lesions","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Pluth",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i75","i76","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether small differences in dose rate influence cellular response following radiation exposure.Introduction: Astronauts will receive chronic low-dose exposure to charged particles during space travel. The heterogeneous mix of energetic heavy ions in the space radiation environment poses a major challenge to understanding the biological significance of these exposures. Estimating the relative risk for carcinogenesis from high LET (linear energy transfer) exposures and identifying ways to mitigate these risks are key to ensuring the future safety of astronauts. Several factors complicate the accurate modeling of cancer risk from these exposures. In addition to dose effects, the rate at which dose is delivered plays a key role in the biological consequences of high LET exposure. Low-dose rate studies thus far have assessed differences between acute doses of a couple of minutes in comparison with prolonged exposures that are delivered over the course of a day or longer. Our studies aim to understand if small differences in dose rate delivered between 0.5 and 2 min show any biological effect. In these studies, we have utilized ATM-mediated phosphorylation of ATF2 in response to radiation exposure as a tool to evaluate dose rate effects. As mammary tissues are radiation-sensitive and are of particular interest to NASA, our studies were carried with isogenic mammary epithelial and fibroblasts cells.Materials and methods: Normal human primary mammary epithelial and fibroblast cells were initiated 1 week prior to X-ray or Fe 1000 MeV/u exposure. Cells at ∼80% confluency on the day of irradiation were irradiated at room temperature. Cells were fixed and stained at early time points (0.5–24 h) following different dose exposures for flow cytometry analysis of phospho-ATF2 as described previously . The mean fold induction of pATF2 fluorescence in cells in the G1 phase of cell cycle was determined relative to control samples.Results: Small dose rate changes, ∼2–2.5 fold change, resulted in obvious changes in the levels of phospho-signaling observed. The earliest time point (0.5 h) revealed the greatest effect from small dose rate changes, with most differences eliminated by 24 h post-exposure. Different cell types revealed differences in the effects observed with fibroblasts showing a greater induction with higher dose rate and epithelial cells showing a greater induction post-low-dose rate exposures. An example of the notable difference in phospho-protein induction observed in the fibroblast strain when even a minor difference in dose rate is used (2-2.5 fold) is shown in Fig. .Conclusion: The phospho-signaling profile for a key DNA damage-response protein, pATF2, was measured at both early and late (0.5–24 h) time points. Our studies reveal that even small dose rate changes show significant differences in terms of the levels of phospho-protein induction. Cell type is a major determinate in this effect, and could predict the late consequences of exposure. Fig. 1. Comparison of phospho ATF2 induction in a primary fibroblast line (184 Fb) upon exposure to a high dose rate (HDR) vs a low dose rate (LDR) of Fe 1000 MeV/u. A notable difference is observed at all doses even though the difference between dose rates is very minor (2-2.5 fold).","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206915","mammary epithelial;phospho-protein signaling;ATF2;genomic instability;cancer risk","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Acute effects of ionizing radiation on human endothelial barrier function","P. Grabham; P. Sharma",NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i97","i98","The human vasculature is critical to healthy functioning of the tissues of the body and a major factor in maintaining homeostasis is the endothelial barrier. In the brain, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is highly specialized in order to sustain the neural tissue.Here, we have examined the effects of radiation on BBB models using a unique variety of endpoints to assess barrier function. These include trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), morphological effects, localization of adhesion and cell junction proteins (in two-dimensional monolayers and in three-dimensional tissue models) and permeability of molecules through the endothelial barrier. Two culture conditions were used to represent conditions on the inside or the lumen of vessels and conditions on the outside or ablumenal side of vessels. For the lumen, cells were cultured in serum and growth factor containing media, and for the ablumenal side of vessels, cells were cultured in serum-free defined media.Initial experiments with gamma rays in serum-free conditions revealed a previously unknown acute effect involving cell detachment and the loss of the clinically relevant cell adhesion molecule—cell platelet endothelial adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 . Gamma radiation (5 Gy) induced a rapid and transient decrease in TEER at 3 h, with effects also seen at the lower radiotherapy dose of 2 Gy. This dip in resistance correlated with the transient loss PECAM-1 in discrete areas where cells often detached from the monolayer leaving gaps. Loss in PECAM-1 occurred at least in part as detached microparticles. Redistribution of PECAM-1 microparticles was also seen in three-dimensional human tissue models. By 6 h, the remaining cells had migrated to reseal the barrier, coincident with TEER returning to control levels. Resealed monolayers contained fewer cells per unit area and their barrier function was weakened as corroborated by an increased permeability over 24 h. Because PECAM-1 is involved in barrier function and platelet aggregation, this effect is likely highly relevant to cancer radiotherapy using gamma rays.These studies were extended to include low linear energy transfer (LET) photons of X-rays and ion particles present in the space environment—low LET ion particles including high energy (1 GeV) protons and helium ions. X-rays under serum-free conditions also showed an acute response involving a dip in TEER at 3 h and the loss of PECAM-1 between cells as microparticles. Ion particles, however, did not show these effects of photons under serum-free conditions. Both protons and helium ions at doses up to 5 Gy did not produce this transient change in TEER or PECAM-1, although some longer term effects in TEER were noted.In the presence of serum and growth factors, however, all radiations tested showed short-term effects in TEER, that of a series of symmetrical peaks which diminished in size over several hours. For 1 GeV protons and helium ions, this effect could be fitted to an equation for under-damped oscillation, a pattern typical of a mechanism for timing of events in periodic processes. For gamma and X-rays, the underdamped oscillation was present but superimposed on a drop in resistance at 3 h similar to that seen in serum-free conditions.In conclusion, we have shown two acute effects of low LET radiation on the human endothelial barrier. First, a short-term effect of photons but not ion particles involving a single dip in TEER and the loss of PECAM-1 at 3 h after irradiation, and second an underdamped oscillation of TEER induced by both photons and ion particles that to date does not appear to be associated with the loss of PECAM-1 or any other junction molecules.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206883","endothelial barrier;radiation;charged particles","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Three-dimensional models, including baseline models, models fitted with vortex generators, models equipped with a trailing-edge wedge and models with both devices, were built and validated through the comparison between the simulation results and experimental data. The main aerodynamic parameters were obtained to evaluate the efficiency of these two accessories. Furthermore, pressure distributions with and without the two devices were presented, and the structures of induced vortices, as well as their interaction in downstream region were also analysed. The simulation shows that vortex generators and the trailing-edge wedge work well in concert. The combined effects of the two devices on airfoil performance are positive, especially in enhancement of lift and the restriction of drag. In addition, trailing-edge wedges are suitable for blunt trailing-edge airfoils due to their strength. And the wedge with a height under 1% chord yields a significant increase in maximum lift coefficient at the cost of an acceptable drag increment.","","978-1-84919-917-9","10.1049/cp.2014.0917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993310","Wind turbine;Vortex generators;Wedge;Blunt trailing-edge airfoil;Numerical simulation","","","","","","","22 Dec 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Therefore, we compared the DSB repair kinetics and formation of γH2AX/p53BP1 repair clusters upon the action of γ-rays [, ], protons (15 and 30 MeV), and 20Ne ions (preliminary data). Consequently, we discuss biological impacts of these clusters.Material and methods: Immunostaining methods in combination with high-resolution confocal microscopy, performed on 3D-fixed normal human skin fibroblasts [2–], were used to study initial distributions of γH2AX and p53BP1 repair foci and their changes during the post-irradiation (PI) time, with a special concern on foci clustering. Irradiations with γ-rays, protons of different energies (15 and 30 MeV), and high-LET 20Ne ions was performed in IBP ASCR Brno (CR), NPI AVCR Řež (CR) and JINR Dubna (Russia), respectively.Results: Upon irradiating cells with 20Ne ions, tracks of multiple clustered γH2AX and p53BP1 repair foci appeared immediately after the irradiation; these clusters, called here as the ‘primary clusters’, were rare in cells irradiated with γ-rays or protons (submitted). Though γH2AX/p53BP1 foci were positionally quite stable, ‘secondary clusters’ occasionally appeared after all kinds of irradiation during about 30 min PI. The formation of secondary clusters usually appeared due to the heterochromatin decondensation at the sites of heterochromatic DNA double-strand breaks (hcDSBs), followed by their protrusion into a limited space of nuclear subdomains of low density-chromatin (discussed in [,, ]).Conclusions: Primary clusters appear in cell nuclei immediately PI as the consequence of highly localized energy deposition, while secondary clusters develop during (and because of) DSB repair. Primary DSB clusters probably represent the main cause of chromosomal translocations induced with high-LET radiations while secondary clusters seem to be more important for low-LET γ-rays and protons. Secondary clusters of primary clusters (higher-order clusters) observed for 20Ne ions might explain frequent formation of complex translocations upon the action of high-LET radiations. Finally, we suggest [, ] a model that describes the relationship between the higher order chromatin structure, DSB formation, repair and misrepair.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206921","DNA double-strand breaks (DSB);DSB repair;chromosomal translocations;primary and secondary DSB clusters;higher order chromatin structure;ionizing radiation of different quality","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Seismogenic magma intrusion before the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull volcano, Iceland","J. Tarasewicz; R. S. White; B. Brandsdóttir; C. M. Schoonman",NA; NA; NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2014","198","2","906","921","We present relatively relocated earthquake hypocentres for >1000 microearthquakes (ML < 3) that occurred during the 2 weeks immediately prior to the 2010 March 20 fissure eruption at Fimmvörðuháls on the flank of Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. Our hypocentre locations lie predominantly in horizontally separated clusters spread over an area of 10 km2 and approximately 4 km below sea level (5 km below the surface). Seismic activity in the final 4 d preceding the eruption extended to shallower levels <2 km below sea level and propagated to the surface at the Fimmvörðuháls eruption site on the day the eruption started. We demonstrate using synthetic data that the observed apparent ∼1 km vertical elongation of seismic clusters is predominantly an artefact caused by only small errors (0.01–0.02 s) in arrival time data. Where the signal-to-noise ratio was sufficiently good to make subsample arrival time picks by cross-correlation of both P- and S-wave arrivals, the mean depth of 103 events in an individual cluster were constrained to 3.84 ± 0.06 km. Epicentral locations are significantly less vulnerable to arrival time errors than are depths for the seismic monitoring network we used. Within clusters of typically 100 recorded earthquakes, most of the arrivals exhibit similar waveforms and identical patterns of P-wave first-motion polarities across the entire monitoring network. The clusters of similar events comprise repetitive sources in the same location with the same orientations of failure, probably on the same rupture plane. The epicentral clustering and similarity of source mechanisms suggest that much of the seismicity was generated at approximately static constrictions to magma flow in an inflating sill complex. These constrictions may act as a form of valve in the country rock, which ruptures when the melt pressure exceeds a critical level, then reseals after a pulse of melt has passed through. This would generate recurring similar source mechanisms on the same weak fault plane as the connection between segments of the sill system is repeatedly refractured in the same location. We infer that the magmatic intrusion causing most of the seismicity was likely to be a laterally inflating complex of sills at about 4 km depth, with seismogenic pinch-points occurring between aseismic compartments of the sills, or between adjacent magma lobes as they inflated. During the final 4 d preceding the eruption onset between 22:30 and 23:30 UTC on 2010 March 20, the seismicity suggests that melt progressed upwards to a depth of ∼2 km. This seismicity was probably caused by fracturing of the country rock at the margins of the propagating dyke. Subsequently, on the morning of the eruption a dyke propagated eastward from the region of precursory seismic activity to the Fimmvörðuháls eruption site.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggu169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8144374","Fracture and flow;Earthquake source observations;Volcano seismology;Physics of magma and magma bodies;Magma chamber processes;Magma migration and fragmentation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Quantitative characteristics of clustered DNA damage in irradiated cells by heavy ion beams","H. Terato; Y. Shimazaki-Tokuyama; Y. Inoue; Y. Furusawa",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i89","i90","Heavy ion beam as typical high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation produces more expanding ionization domain around their tracks than low LET radiation such as X-rays and gamma rays. Thus, heavy ion beam can cause more densely accumulated damage cluster in the target DNA, termed clustered DNA damage. This damage exhibits difficulty for repair and inhibition of DNA replication with its complex structure . So, clustered DNA damage is thought to be strongly involved in the biological effectiveness of heavy ion beam. However, a lot of studies have presented no certain correlation between yields of clustered DNA damage and severity of radiation effect. We previously indicated that the yields of clustered DNA damage decreased with increasing LET in the DNA molecules irradiated in test tubes with gamma rays, and carbon and iron ion beams whose showed different LET, respectively . In this study, we aimed to reveal correlation between clustered DNA damage and the LET of heavy ion beam in the irradiated cells.In the experiments, Chinese hamster ovary AA8 cells growing exponentially were irradiated by carbon, silicon, argon and iron ion beams from Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Japan. These LETs were 13, 55, 90 and 200 keV/µm, respectively. For comparison, we used gamma rays from 137Cs-gamma source, Gammacell 40 (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd), at Saga University. The irradiated cells were subjected by static-field gel electrophoresis to quantify clustered DNA damage of the genomic DNA. For this analysis, we used Fpg and endonuclease III for clustered DNA damage including oxidative purine and pyrimidine lesions, respectively. We also analysed the corresponding isolated DNA damages by aldehyde reactive probe method, and the surviving fractions of the irradiated cells in this study.The electrophoretic results indicated that total yields of clustered DNA damage in the irradiated cells decreased with increasing LET, including the double-strand break (DSB) and the respective clustered base damages (Fig. ). This result conforms to our previous study with the irradiated DNA molecules . The damage kinetics is thought to be mainly derived from two reasons: decreasing fluxes and increasing reaction with reactive oxygen species each other in increase in LET. In the clustered DNA damage induced by each radiation, the most decremental fraction was clustered base damage, but not DSB. The isolated DNA damages decreased with increasing LET like clustered DNA damage in this study (data not shown). These results make us realize the degree of contribution of direct and indirect effects of ionizing radiation. The certain amount of DSB were derived from the direct effect and showed less reactivity to LET. In contrast, oxidative base lesions were mainly generated by indirect effect with reactive oxygen species, which sensitively responded to LET change. We also found seemingly conflicted result of the relationship between LET and RBE (data not shown). We need further study to elucidate act of clustered DNA damage in radiobiological effect with heavy ion beams. Fig. 1. The yields of clustered DNA damages in the cells irradiated with respective ionizing radiations. Each clustered DNA damage consists of DSB (open bar) and clustered base damage (closed bar), and calculated from the strength of released band on electrophoretic gel.

"Chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes and fibroblasts after exposure to very low doses of high-LET radiation","M. Hada; K. George; L. Chappell; F. A. Cucinotta",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i50","i51","Purpose: The relationship between biological effects and low doses of radiation is still uncertain, especially for high-LET radiation exposures. Estimates of risk from exposure to low doses and low dose rates are often extrapolated from the Japanese atomic bomb survivor data using either linear or linear-quadratic models fitted to dose–response data. In this study, we determined the dose–response for chromosome damage after exposure to very low doses of high-LET radiation and assessed the radiation qualities of Fe, Si and Oxygen ions.Materials and methods: Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were measured in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and normal skin fibroblasts after exposure to very low doses (0.01–0.20 Gy) of 77-MeV/u oxygen (LET = 55 keV/µm), 170-MeV/u 28Si (LET = 99 keV/µm), or 56Fe ions with energies of 600- or 450-MeV/u (LET = 180 or 195 keV/µm). These exposures included doses that, on average, produce fewer than one in five direct ion traversals per cell nucleus. Chromosomes were analyzed using the whole-chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique during the first cell division after irradiation, and CA were identified as either simple exchanges (translocations and dicentrics) or complex exchanges (involving more than two breaks in two or more chromosomes). The frequencies of CA in the painted chromosome(s) were evaluated as the ratio between aberrations scored and total cells analyzed. The dose–response for simple exchanges was assessed using a generalized linear model assuming binomial errors per number of chromosomes scored. The model coefficients were extrapolated to whole-genome equivalents. The linear dose–response denoted as the targete effects (TE) model considered the mean number of radiation tracks per cell. Two different non-targeted effect (NTE) models, P = P0 + αT + κ × I (NTE1), and P = P0 + αT (1 − e−T) + κe−T × I (NTE2), were compared with the simple linear model, P = P0 + αT. Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayes information criteria (BIC) were used to compare TE and NTE models for fitting chromosome aberrations in low dose range.Results: Doses that on average produce more than one ion traversal per cell nucleus showed a linear dose–response for CA in both lymphocytes and fibroblasts. However, for doses that produce fewer than one tracks per cell in fibroblasts, O, Si and Fe particles showed a dose-independent response for CA that was significantly elevated relative to background frequencies. For fibroblasts the NTE model 2, P = P0 + αT (1 − e−T) + κe−T × I, showed improved fit to CA in low dose range compared with TE model or NTE1 model. For lymphocytes, tests of the various models were less clear with TE model optimal for Si and Fe while the NTE2 model optimal for O particles. When low-dose exposures were fractionated with 2-h intervals, increased frequencies of both simple and complex exchanges were observed. Nitric oxide scavenger reduced CA induced by low doses of high-LET irradiation. Inhibition of transforming growth factor-β receptor-1 reduced the frequency of simple exchanges.Conclusions: The results show a non-linear dose–response for CA in fibroblasts after very low doses of high-LET exposure. Possible explanations for this could involve non-targeted effects due to aberrant cell signaling, perhaps involving nitric oxide and TGF-β, or could be due to delta-ray dose fluctuations where CA are induced in cells that receive a significant dose from delta-rays emanating from the multiple ion tracks that do not directly traverse cell nuclei.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206923","low dose;heavy ion;chromosome aberrations","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To date, ESC are a powerful tool in disease modeling, tissue engineering and drug testing. However, in the field of radiation research, their potential has not been exploited.We used the mouse ESC line D3 as a model to examine the effects of X-rays or C-ions (spread out Bragg peak, energy 106–147 MeV/u, average LET = 75 keV/µm) . Doses of 0.5–5 Gy were applied and endpoints such as cell cycle progression (measured by flow cytometry), apoptosis (microscopic analysis of cell nucleus morphology), induction of chromosome aberrations (mFISH analysis), presence of pluripotency markers Oct3/4 and SOX2 (western blotting) and differentiation capacity by means of an embryoid body formation assay were analyzed up to 17 days post-irradiation. The experiments show that cells undergo a transient G2 arrest following exposure. After G2 checkpoint release, an increase in the apoptotic index is observed for both radiation types (3.7-fold increase for 2 Gy X-ray and 2.4-fold increase for 2 Gy C-ions). C-ions induce more structural chromosomal aberrations in first cycle cells than X-rays. During subsequent cell divisions, the frequency of chromosome aberrations declines: After >7 population doublings (8 days after exposure), the aberration frequency in the progeny of X-ray exposed cells returns to the control level (7% aberrant cells), while the progeny of C-ion exposed cells still harbor significantly more aberrations than control cells, which is mainly due to transmissible translocations.The expression of pluripotency markers is maintained in cells surviving X-ray or C-ion exposure. This finding is supported by examining the differentiation capacity of ESC through the formation of embryoid bodies. Our experiments show that after X-ray or C-ion exposure, cells are able to develop spontaneous beating activity, indicating the differentiation ability into mesodermal cell lineages, i.e. beating cardiomyocytes. However, following C-ion exposure, the formation of beating clusters was delayed compared with control cells.Moreover, our chromosome studies revealed that unexposed cells carry a high frequency of numerical aberrations. These comprise trisomies of chromosome 8 and 11 with a frequency of 29 ± 8% and 26 ± 6% respectively, as well as nullisomy of chromosome Y with a frequency of 35 ± 3%. Aneuploidy is a typical feature of mouse ESC and has been related to cell culture methods and passage number. Because aneuploidy may affect gene expression and influence the properties of a cell population, the relevance of experiments based on mouse ESC is limited.To overcome this problem, we recently extended our studies to human ESC. Human ESC are known to be cytogenetically more stable than mouse ESC, and represent a model that is closer to human embryonic development. Indeed, first investigations revealed a lower faction of cells with numerical and structural aberrations in the human ESC line H9 compared with the mouse ESC line D3 (2% vs. 73% and 3% vs. 7%, respectively).","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206887","embryonic stem cells;pluripotency;genomic integrity","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To test the role of reactive oxygen species in mediating the effects of radiation exposure, we compare responses in a catalase overexpressing transgenic mouse strain to wild type. We also use computational models of the hippocampus in three dimensions, informed by experimental measurements, to provide insight into network behavior.Radiation exposure protocols include single, acute whole-body exposures to 1H, 28Si and 56Fe ions and mixed field exposures using 1H + 56Fe ions (24 h later). The animal models are 10-week-old C57BL/6J and MCATtg males which are evaluated at 30 and 90 days postirradiation. In vitro models are cultured murine and human neural stem cells irradiated with 1H, 16O, 28Si and 56Fe ions at multiple energies and are evaluated at times from days to weeks.Highlights: Neural stem cells organized into neurospheres were irradiated with several ions at doses as low as 0.75 cGy. Data show that significant oxidative stress occurs that alters survival, proliferation and differentiation. Overall trends indicate that changes in oxidative stress (persisting for weeks) correlate with particle linear energy transfer (LET). 56Fe ions elicited the largest and most persistent changes in stress markers, including antioxidant enzyme expression levels.The hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and novel object recognition (NOR) paradigms were used to assess cognition and showed cognitive deficits after irradiation with the NOR paradigm more sensitive than CFC. Analysis of neurogenesis indicates that overall neurogenesis is inhibited at doses ≥1 Gy, but newly born activated microglia are significantly elevated at ≥0.1 Gy. High LET radiation affects all lineages of neural precursor cells and elicits a U-shaped dose–response for cells exhibiting the astrocyte marker GFAP. In a mixed field irradiation regimen (0.1 Gy 1H, then 0.5 Gy 56Fe 24 h later), NOR was impaired with 0.1 Gy 1H or 0.1 Gy 1H + 0.5 Gy 56Fe but not with 0.5 Gy 56Fe alone. A negative correlation between newly born activated microglia and NOR or behaviorally activated Arc gene expression was observed for exposures using protons and iron ions, suggesting that neuroinflammation contributes to the cognitive injury. A set of monocyte chemoattractant chemokines was reduced after the mixed beam exposure but not after the individual exposures suggesting compensatory or adaptive responses are elicited by the proton exposure.Patch clamp recordings on principal neurons of the CA1 and DG hippocampus fields were conducted on mice irradiated with 1H, 28Si and 56Fe iron ions. Input resistance and resting membrane potential were modified by irradiation in CA1 and protons were found to be the most effective ion species. These parameters suggest that more miniature excitatory post synaptic potentials must be elicited simultaneously to initiate action potentials and therefore the neurons are less responsive post irradiation. Si- and Fe-irradiated animals showed only minor alterations in mEPSCs and mIPSCs. Granule neurons of the DG field showed no differences after 28Si irradiation, but with 56Fe significant increases in AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSC frequency were observed without affecting amplitude. This focuses attention on presynaptic glutamate release mechanisms.Functional changes in the CA1 network triggered by whole-body irradiation with protons, iron and silicon radiation were assessed with microelectrode array field recordings. Deficits in input–output curves and long-term potentiation (LTP) are observed in proton irradiated mice. In the dentate gyrus field, radiation enhanced input–output curves and LTP which is opposite of the inhibition observed for the CA1 field. This suggests that in the DG the most sensitive targets may be GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons that regulate granular cell excitability. 28Si ion effects appear to be associated with dendro-somatic coupling expected to affect signaling of the hippocampal neurons to other brain structures and vary between rostral and ventral hippocampal regions. Observations on MCATtg mice show attenuation of radiation-elicited responses, which implicates reactive oxygen species as mediators of the biological responses.Modeling activities using a high-fidelity three-dimensional model of the hippocampus have begun and allow simulation of network activities incorporating neuron structural and functional parameters measured experimentally to probe their individual and combined contributions to network behavior. Changes in firing statistics are observed after incorporating measured electrophysiological parameters into the model.Clinical trial registration number: not applicable.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206925","Brain;High LET radiation;Electrophysiology;Behavior;Neurogenesis","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Up-to-date results of carbon-ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer","T. Nomiya; H. Tsuji; K. Maruyama; T. Kamada; H. Tsujii",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i28","i29","Carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) for prostate cancer was started in 1995 using the Heavy-Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), Japan. After preceding phase I/II dose-escalation studies of 20 fractions over 5 weeks, a phase II study was initiated in April 2000 using the treatment techniques and the recommended dose fractionations established by the phase I/II studies. This study was also successfully completed in October 2003 when the C-ion RT for solid tumors, including the prostate cancer, was approved as ‘Advanced Medicine’ by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. Since then, more than 1400 patients have been treated with C-ion RT as of February 2012, and advancement of hypofractionation has also been achieved. In this paper, the treatment outcomes in 1144 patients who underwent the established C-ion RT between April 2000 and July 2012 were analyzed.Out of 1144 patients, 585 patients were categorized as high-risk group, which includes patients having at least one of the following conditions: T3 clinical stage, Gleason's score of 8 or higher and PSA of 20 or higher. One hundred and ninety-seven patients who met the conditions such as clinical stage of T2a or lower, Gleason's score of 6 or lower and PSA of <20 were categorized as low-risk group. Three hundred and sixty-two patients who were not included in either high- or low-risk group were categorized as intermediate-risk group. All patients were pathologically proven to have adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and Gleason's score was determined by the chief pathologist of our study group. Written consent was obtained from all patients included in the clinical study. Patients with the following conditions were not registered in the clinical trial: having distant metastases, having synchronous primary malignancy, not histologically proven cancer, without informed consent, post-operative/post-irradiation recurrence.All patients were treated with three field irradiations (vertical one field and horizontal opposing two fields). The prostate and proximal part of the seminal vesicle were contoured as clinical target volume (CTV), and planning target volume (PTV) was set with 5–10 mm margins around the CTV. On the way of radiotherapy, a part of irradiation field of the posterior side was cut to reduce the rectal dose. The 197 patients in the low-risk group did not undergo androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), whereas the 947 patients of intermediate- and high-risk groups underwent ADT. The patients of intermediate-risk group underwent about 6 months of neoadjuvant ADT, and the patients of high-risk group also underwent about 6 months of neoadjuvant ADT and sequential adjuvant ADT for more than 18 months. The median age of all patients was 68 years, and the median follow-up time was 48.7 months (range: 3.6–151.1 months).The 5-year overall survival rate and biochemical relapse-free rate of the entire groups was 95.7% and 91.0%, respectively. T-stage and Gleason's score were significant prognostic factors for both the biochemical control and patient survival and initial PSA was also a predictive factor for survival. Regarding the late radiation toxicity, the incidence of rectal toxicity of grade 2 or worse was 1.1% and that of genitourinary toxicity was 6.5%. These outcomes seemed to be better than those of the past publications [1–]. In addition, the incidence of toxicity in patients treated with more hypofractionated C-ion RT of 16 fractions over 4 weeks was lower than those of 20 fraction treatment. These favorable outcomes can be thought as apparent evidence of physical and biological advantages of the hypofractionated C-ion RT.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206889","carbon-ion radiation therapy;prostate cancer;hypofractionation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Homologous recombination pathway may play a major role in high-LET radiation-induced DNA double-strand break repair","A. Gerelchuluun; J. Zhu; F. Su; A. Asaithamby; D. J. Chen; K. Tsuboi",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i83","i84","Purpose: Particle beams are increasingly applied to various cancer treatments because of their excellent dose localization to tumors while preserving surrounding normal tissues. However, characteristic of DNA damages induced by particle beams and their repair mechanisms are not fully understood. It is known that the majority of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation are repaired either by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or by homologous recombination (HR) pathways. However, it has not been clarified how NHEJ and HR pathways contribute to the repair of DSBs induced by various particle beams [1, 2]. Thus, the purpose of this study is to clarify how these repair pathways contribute to the DSB repair in cells after irradiation with various radiation qualities.Material and methods: A control Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (AA8), its mutant cell line deficient of DNA-PKcs (V3), XRCC4 (XR1) and Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line deficient of XRCC2 (IRS1) were exposed to gamma rays, protons, carbon ions and iron ions. V3 and XR1 lack NHEJ pathway, while IRS1 lacks HR pathway. After each irradiation, colony survival and gross-chromosome aberration were examined.Results: It was demonstrated that colony survival was clearly dependent on the presence of NHEJ or HR pathways as well as radiation qualities. Although HR-deficient cells (IRS1) became more sensitive as LET value increased, NHEJ-deficient cells (V3 and XR1) did not further sensitized as LET value increased (Fig. ). In addition, values of relative biological effectiveness of iron beams were higher in HR-deficient cells than in NHEJ-deficient cells (3.2 in AA8; 2.7 in IRS1; 1.8 in XR1 and V3). These may suggest that HR plays an important role in repairing DNA lesions induced by high-LET radiation. As for the incidence of total chromosomal aberration, we found that its incidence increased as LET values increased in wild-type (AA8) and NHEJ-deficient cells (V3, XR1), but not in HR-deficient cells (IRS1) (Table ). However, occurrence of chromosome-type aberrations increased as LET values increased in all cell lines analysed here. This may indicate that the chromosomal aberrations occur from not only unrepaired damages but also the repair process of error-prone NHEJ pathway, suggesting that limited capacity of NHEJ to repair DSBs induced by high-LET irradiation may cause increased number of chromosome-type aberrations.Conclusions: Taken together, although NHEJ pathway is the major pathway to repair DSBs induced by various types of radiation, HR pathway may play more important roles as LET value increases.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206893","high LET particle;NHEJ and HR pathway;chromosome aberration","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

From 1997 to 2010, a total of 139 consecutive patients with 146 lesions of VS were treated with X-Knife at Ramathibodi hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. SRS was selected for 39 lesions (in patients with small tumors ≤3 cm and non-serviceable hearing function), whereas HSRT (79 lesions) and CSRT (28 lesions) were given for the remaining lesions that were not suitable for SRS. With a median follow-up time of 61 months (range, 12–143), the 5-year local control rate was 95, 100 and 95% in the SRS, HSRT and CSRT groups, respectively. Hearing preservation was observed after SRS in 75%, after HSRT in 87% and after CSRT in 63% of the patients. Cranial nerve complications were low in all groups. There were no statistically significant differences in local control, hearing preservation or complication between the treatment schedules.

The given image is rotated by Δθ and the SHT is employed, generating the HT data on the columns corresponding to θ=0° and θ=90° only. After the image is rotated 90°/Δθ times, the HT columns generated are registered to the HT matrix of the original image.

This is the basis of the current system for risk estimation of radiobiological effects. However, it has recently been challenged by so-called non-targeted effects, such as bystander effect, and such radiation-induced cellular responses may have important implications for risk evaluation of low-dose-rate radiations as well as in tumor radiotherapy. Our group has been studying radiation-quality bystander cellular effects using the microbeams with different radiation sources.It is essentially important for evaluating risk such a low-dose-rate exposure as the accident of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plants to examine bystander effects induced by low-LET electromagnetic radiations, such as X or gamma rays. We have been studying the cellular responses in normal human fibroblasts by targeted cell nucleus irradiations with monochromatic X-ray microbeams (5.35 keV) produced by Photon Factory in High Energy Accelerator Research Organization. The results indicated that the bystander effect in cell- killing effect was observed in the targeted cell nucleus irradiation, not in the random irradiation containing both cell nucleus and cytoplasm by Poisson distribution. The results suggest that energy deposition in cytoplasm is an important role of inducing bystander effects in case of low-LET radiations.We have also been investigating high-LET-radiation induced bystander effects using the heavy-ion microbeams at Takasaki Ion Accelerators for Advanced Radiation Application in Japan Atomic Energy Agency. Only 0.04% of the total numbers of normal human fibroblasts were irradiated with C-ion (220 MeV), Ne-ion (260 MeV) and Ar-ion (460 MeV) microbeams collimated at 20 μm in diameter. Cell-killing effect and gene mutation at HPRT locus in the cells irradiated with C ions were higher beyond our expectations and returned the estimated values that only 0.04% of the total cells were irradiated when using the specific inhibitor of gap junctions. On the other hand, no induced biological effects were observed in Ne and Ar ions whether the inhibitor was applied or not. The result suggested that the C-ion microbeam was capable of inducing bystander cellular effects via gap junction-mediated cell-cell communication. There is clear evidence that bystander cellular effects are dependent on radiation quality.It is also important for highly developed heavy-ion radiotherapy to identify bystander effects induced by spatially low-fluence irradiations with heavy-ion beams. We have been investigating the biological effects using human tumor cell lines. The results clearly showed that bystander effects were observed in the carbon-ion irradiation but not in other ions as well as the effects in normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, the bystander cell-killing effect in tumor cell lines was strongly induced in the cells harboring wild-type P53 not in mutated-type P53 cells. The results provide the important implication for a tailor-made therapy using carbon ions.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206929","Bystander effect;Microbeam;Gap junction, P53, HPRT","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We chose the LETs at entrance of plateau (20keV/μm) and the SOBP (proximal: 40 keV/μm, middle: 45 keV/μm, distal: 60 keV/μm, distal-end: 80 keV/μm). The reference beam was 137Cs gamma rays with a dose rate of 1.2 Gy/min. Skin reaction: Skin reaction of the irradiated legs was scored every other day, between the14th and 35th post-irradiation days. Our scoring scale consisted of seven steps, ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 . The skin score analyzed a result by the method that described by Ando et al. . The Fe-plot proposed by Douglas and Fowler was used as a multifraction linear quadratic model. A plot between the reciprocal of the isoeffect dose and the dose per fraction resulted in a straight line.Results: Required isoeffect total dose increased linearly with the fraction numbers on a semi-logarithmic chart at LET 20–60 keV/µm SOBP beam. The isoeffect total dose decreased with the increase in the LET. However, no increases in isoeffect total dose were observed at few fractionations at 80 keV/µm. (data not shown) Using an Fe-plot, we analyzed the isoeffect total dose to evaluate the dependence on Carbon beam, or gamma ray. When I irradiate it by gamma ray, an Fe-plot shows linearly. But, irradiated by Carbon beam, an Fe-plot bent at low fractions (Fig. ).Conclusion: The LQ-model-based Fe-plot could not fit skin reaction at few fractions at high-LET.Clinical Trial Registration number if required: No. Fig. 1. The reciprocal of the isoeffect dose is plotted against the dose per fraction. (i) Gamma ray: Fe-plot was linear. (ii) C-ions: Fe-plot bent at low fractions.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206900","skin reaction;high-LET;fractionation;Fe-plot","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Order effect of repair processes to clustered DNA damage","I. Shiraishi; M. Suzuki; N. Shikazono; K. Fujii; A. Yokoya",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i92","i93","In a living cell, a multiply damaged site in DNA is thought to be processed by several different pathways simultaneously or sequentially. Under this situation, the cellular response to the lesion cluster might depend on the order of repair processes because the configuration of the lesions will be modified by the reaction of initial repair protein, affecting the DNA-binding or lesion-excision activities of latter repair proteins. For example, a cluster comprised an AP site or SSB and base lesions is formed after one of the lesions in a base lesion cluster is excised by a glycosylase. It has been predicted that the enzymatic activity of a protein binding to a lesion could be affected by a second lesion located nearby. In the present study, we investigate whether initial base excision repair process affects secondary process on the clustered DNA damage site produced by high linear energy transfer irradiation.Plasmid DNA (pUC18) used as model DNA were irradiated in a solution (10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA) with C6+ ions (60 keV/µm) obtained from HIMAC (NIRS, Chiba, Japan) according to our previous method, or He2+ ions from TIARA (JAEA, Takasaki, Japan) in a fully hydrated film . We used two base excision repair enzymes to examine the order effect of BER processes, Nth and Fpg, which convert pyrimidine and purine lesions to an SSB, respectively. After exposure, the sample was incubated with Nth (or Fpg) at 37°C for 30 min. Then, we added another enzyme Fpg (or Nth) and incubate for another 30 min. We also simultaneously treated the DNA sample with both enzymes for 1 h. After the incubation, the samples were analysed by agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis to determine the yield of conformational changes of the plasmid from closed circular form to open or linear form. These changes show productions of an enzymatically induced SSB (the former) or DSB (the latter).A typical example of the dependence of the loss of closed circular form DNA on radiation dose is shown in Fig. a for carbon ion irradiation. The reciprocal of the slope of each graph shows yield of prompt SSBs [n(SSB)prompt] for the sample without any enzymatic treatment, or [n(SSB)prompt] + enzymatically induced SSBs [n(SSB)Nth(or Fpg, or Nth+Fpg)]. The SSB yield for the sample treated with Nth first and then Fpg is very slightly less than that of other treatments (<10%). The dose responses of the linear form DNA production are shown in Fig. b. There were no significant differences among the enzymatic treatments. These results indicate that the configuration change of the cluster by the first enzymatic treatment does not significantly influence the activity of secondary enzyme. The most of base lesion clusters produced in the track of carbon ions might be converted to strand breaks, some of which form double-strand breaks (DSBs), by glycosylase activity in living cells.

"Cognitive effects of partial and whole-body exposures to 16O particles","B. M. Rabin; B. Shukitt-Hale; S. Gomes; K. L. Carrihill-Knoll",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i100","i101","Introduction: When rats and mice are exposed to HZE particles at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory to simulate the effect of exposure to space radiation on cognitive performance, there may be differences in the amount of tissue that is irradiated: some experimenters irradiate only the head, whereas others irradiate the entire organism. Whether or not these different patterns of exposure have differential effects on cognitive performance remain to be established. Similarly, it remains to be established whether or not exposures restricted to the body can have an independent effect on cognitive performance.Radiation: Rats were exposed to 16O (1000 MeV/n; 1, 5, 10, 25 cGy) particles at the NSRL. There were three exposure conditions: head-only, body-only and whole body. Tungsten bricks were used to shield either the head or the body, as required. The bricks were removed for whole-body exposures. The non-irradiated control rats (0 cGy) were taken to the NSRL, but not exposed. Nominal dose rates were between 1 and 10 cGy/min, depending upon the total dose.Behavior: The animals were shipped to UMBC for behavioral testing. Cognitive performance was measured using the elevated-plus-maze (baseline anxiety); novel object recognition (general learning and memory); novel spatial location (spatial learning and memory); and operant responding on an ascending fixed-ratio schedule (motivation and responsiveness to environmental stimuli). The basis for the selection of the behavioral tests was that the behaviors are dopamine-mediated or show deterioration as a function of age.Results: The results of the experiments indicate that: (i) there may be differences in cognitive performance following exposure to either head-only or whole-body exposure to NASA-relevant doses of 16O particles depending on the specific task; and (ii) for some tasks, body-only exposures can disrupt neurocognitive performance. The results also suggest that exposures involving the body may influence the responsiveness of the organism to the disruptive effects of exposure to HZE particles on neurocognitive performance. This effect is seen in two ways: first, as a direct effect of body-only exposure on cognitive performance, as shown by decreased time spent in a novel location compared with non-irradiated controls, suggesting impaired spatial location memory; and second, as an interaction between head and body exposures seen with whole-body exposures.Discussion: These results indicate that body-only exposures have the potential to influence cognitive performance which is mediated by the brain. Although the mechanism remains to be fully established, it is possible that exposure of the body to HZE particles causes the release of cytokines which can affect neuronal function, either directly or through the mediation of the vagus nerve. As such, the results of studies using head-only or whole-body exposures may not be comparable. Also, astronauts may be subject to increased risk of deficits in cognitive performance during exploratory class missions.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206899","behavior;cognition;HZE particles;space radiation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this paper, from the idea of Gentry we propose two IBE schemes, which can avoid key escrow problem. Asymmetric bilinear pairings on ordinary elliptic curves are of use and identities is mapped to integers. The first scheme is a generalization from Gentry's scheme. Our scheme saves one pairing in encryption algorithm.

"The effects of low doses of proton, iron or silicon radiation on spatial learning in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease","J. A. Bellone; R. E. Hartman; R. Vlkolinský",NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i95","i96","Astronauts venturing outside low-Earth orbit risk exposure to charged particle radiation that can cause neurological deficits via oxidative stress, synaptic changes, altered neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. Because these responses are similar to those observed in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, we hypothesized that individuals with a propensity toward developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) would be more adversely affected by such exposure. To test this hypothesis, we exposed young double transgenic (tg) APP/PSEN1 mice (a commercially available strain engineered to develop AD-like neuropathology) and their wild-type (wt) counterparts to low doses of proton radiation (150 MeV/n, whole body). Spatial learning ability, a sensitive behavioral marker of hippocampal damage, was assessed using the water maze (WM) prior to exposure, then 3 and 6 months post-irradiation. Results showed that wt mice outperformed tg mice at each time-point, and irradiation of tg mice at doses 0.1, 0.5 and 1 Gy did not induce spatial learning deficits. However, deficits were observed in wt mice exposed to 0.5 Gy compared with 0 Gy wt controls at 6 months post-irradiation. Specifically, the 0.5 Gy group performed worse than the control group during the reversal learning phase of the WM, when the platform was switched to a new location (P < 0.02). The irradiated mice were unable to alter their search strategy and often perseverated on the previous platform location. Reduced reversal learning demonstrates cognitive inflexibility in novel situations and may be indicative of hippocampal memory system dysfunction.In a follow-up study to assess the effects of high-LET particles on AD-like pathology, we exposed tg mice to low doses (0.1, 0.5 or 1 Gy) of either iron (600 MeV/n) or silicon (250 MeV/n) radiation and assessed the effects on spatial learning ability in the WM at 3 and 6 months post-irradiation. Mice exposed to 1 Gy of iron radiation performed better than 0 Gy tg controls in the WM at the 6 month time-point (P < 0.03). Conversely, mice exposed to 0.1 Gy of silicon radiation performed significantly worse than controls in the WM at the 3 month time-point (P < 0.02), but these deficits had ameliorated by 6 months. Mice exposed to 0.5 and 1 Gy of silicon radiation exhibited changes similar to those observed in the 0.1 Gy group, but the decrements did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that exposure to low doses of iron radiation decreases the behavioral effects of AD-like neuropathology in the long-term, while silicon radiation exacerbates short-term cognitive impairment in individuals with a propensity for such pathology. Electrophysiological and immunohistochemical data are forthcoming, and will aid in elucidating potential mechanisms responsible for the observed effects.Altogether, these results suggest that various types of particles induce different behavioral effects at low doses in APP/PSEN1 tg mice. Namely, proton radiation was found to have no effect on performance, iron radiation improved performance in the long-term and silicon radiation temporarily impaired performance. The finding that low doses of iron and silicon radiation alter performance on a hippocampus-dependent task could have implications for astronauts with a predisposition to developing AD-like neurodegenerative changes who travel on extended missions outside Earth's magnetosphere.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206866","proton;iron;silicon;particle radiation;Alzheimer's disease;APP/PSEN1","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, radiotherapy remains merely palliative, not curative, because of the existence of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are regarded as highly radioresistant to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) photons. Here we analyzed whether or not high-LET particles can overcome the radioresistance of GSCs. Glioma stem-like cells (GSLCs) were induced from the GBM cell line A172 in stem cell culture medium. The phenotypes of GSLCs and wild-type cells were confirmed using stem cell markers. These cells were irradiated with 60Co gamma rays or reactor neutron beams. Under neutron-beam irradiation, high-LET proton particles can be produced through elastic scattering or nitrogen capture reaction. Radiosensitivity was assessed by a colony-forming assay, and the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were assessed by a histone gamma-H2AX focus detection assay. In stem cell culture medium, GSLCs could form neurosphere-like cells and express neural stem cell markers (Sox2 and Musashi) abundantly in comparison with their parental cells. GSLCs were significantly more radioresistant to gamma rays than their parental cells, but neutron beams overcame this resistance. There were significantly fewer gamma-H2AX foci in the A172 GSLCs 24 h after irradiation with gamma rays than in their parental cultured cells, while there was no apparent difference following neutron-beam irradiation. High-LET radiation can overcome the radioresistance of GSLCs by producing unrepairable DNA DSBs. High-LET radiation therapy might have the potential to overcome GBM's resistance to X-rays in a clinical setting.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154324","glioblastoma multiforme;glioma stem cells;linear energy transfer;neutron beams;gamma rays","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Moreover, we examined OH radical-mediated indirect actions from either SOBP carbon beams or photon beams on cellular lethality.Materials and methods: Cell culture: The HSG cells were grown in E-MEM (SIGMA) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics under a humidified air with 5% CO2 at 37˚C. The cells were seeded into T25 cm2 flask (CORNING) at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells per flask for 48 h prior to irradiation. Irradiation and treatment with DMSO: Carbon ions (12C6+) were accelerated by the HIMAC synchrotron to 290 MeV/nucleon. Depths in the SOBP beams were selected using a PMMA range shifter (116.10 and 143.84 mmH2O at middle and distal-end of SOBP, respectively). X-ray irradiations were performed using an X-ray generator (Shimadzu, Pantac HF-320S) operating at 200 kV and 20 mA, with a filter of 0.5 mm aluminum and 0.5 mm copper. The flasks were filled with 5 ml of medium containing different concentrations of DMSO ranging from 0 to 1.0 M for 1 h prior to irradiation. Colony formation assay: After irradiation, the cells were seeded into triplicate 60-mm plastic dishes at a density of ∼100 living cells per dish and incubated for 14 days. The colonies were fixed with 10% formalin solution, stained with 1% methylene blue solution and colonies consisting of more than 50 cells were counted. The 10% survival level (D10 or LD90) was calculated from a dose–response curve fitted by an LQ equation. Calculation of the maximum protection by DMSO (DMSO method): The maximum degree of protection (DP), the concentration of DMSO that provides the maximum protection against cell killing, was calculated as well as our previous work [1–]. Briefly, the maximum DP was calculated by an extrapolation of reciprocals of surviving fractions over those of DMSO concentrations. The DP was defined by the below equation, and regression curves were drawn in the plots of DP as a function of DMSO concentration. (1)$${\rm DP}=\displaystyle{{{\rm ln(SF}_{\rm 0} {\rm )} - {\rm ln(SF}_x {\rm )}} \over {{\rm ln(SF}_{\rm 0} {\rm )}}}, $$where SF0 and SFx are surviving fractions at 0 and x M of DMSO concentrations, respectively. The DP is expressed as the increase in the surviving fraction in the presence of DMSO normalized by the surviving fraction in the absence of DMSO (Fig. ). Regression lines were drawn in the graphs of the reciprocals of DP plotted against those of DMSO concentration. The maximum DP is the value at the point of intersection of the regression line at the infinite concentration of DMSO.Results: Colony forming assays were used to determine the surviving fractions of exponentially growing HSG cells at various doses of X-rays. The D10 value was 4.7. The D10 values for SOBP beam were 3.1 and 1.9 at middle and distal-end positions, respectively. The RBEs were 1.5 at middle and 2.5 at distal-end of SOBP. The contributions of indirect action to cell killing were 77% for X-rays, 80% at middle and 65% at distal-end of SOBP beam. Fig. 1. Effects of DMSO on the survival of HSG cells after exposure to X-rays or SOBP carbon beams. DPs were determined using Equation (1). The curves were fitted by the Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The error bars represent the standard errors.

"Dependence of the yields of AP sites and AP clusters produced in plasmid DNA on scavenging capacity and LET","T. Shiina; R. Watanabe; M. Suzuki; A. Yokoya",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i15","i16","An apurinic or apyrimidinic site (AP site) has known to be one of the typical DNA lesions induced by ionizing irradiation to cells. A clustered DNA damage site composed of AP sites (AP clusters) can be visualized as a double-strand break (DSB) by a treatment of DNA sample with endonuclease IV proteins as an enzymatic probe. AP clusters are efficiently induced in human cells by low LET γ- and X-irradiation with the similar yields with those for the clusters which contain pyrimidine or purine base lesions. However, there has been very little knowledge of the mechanistic aspects of the production of AP sites and AP clusters. Recently, we reported the dependence of the yields of AP sites and AP clusters, as well as base lesions, strand breaks and base lesion clusters induced by irradiation of carbon ions (LET: 13 and 60 keV/μm) obtained from HIMAC (NIRS, Chiba, Japan) on radical scavenging capacity in the DNA samples .In the present study, we have performed theoretical calculation for the production of AP sites as well as those of strand breaks and base lesions by the carbon ion exposure (13 keV/μm). A Monte Carlo track structure simulation code for ion tracks, TRACION, was used for this work according to our previous study . As a DNA model molecule, simple linear DNA with 150 bp was applied for the calculation. Several scavenging capacities of the samples are tested to estimate the effect of indirect action of diffusible OH radicals in the damage induction in the experimental conditions.We assumed that the AP site formation pathway originates from a common intermediate of an OH radical adduct with that of single-strand breaks (SSBs) or base lesions (Scheme ). In order to reproduce the experimentally obtained yields of AP sites, we newly determined the branching ratio of induction of AP site to that of SSBs or base lesions to be 17:33 or 2:48, respectively, in the simulation. The calculated yields of AP site, as well as SSB, were well consistent with those for experimentally obtained (Fig. ). However, the calculated yields for AP clusters were one-fifth of those for experimental data. The yields for DSBs in lower scavenging capacities were also one-fifth of those for experimental ones in a lower scavenging capacity, thought they were well consistent with each other above a cell mimetic condition (>3 × 108 s). In order to bridge a gap between theoretical and experimental yields, we need a novel mechanism of damage-clustering such as dissociative low energy electron attachment or hole-migration onto a DNA molecule. Fig. 1. Dependence of the yield of AP site or AP cluster (A) and prompt SSB or prompt DSB (B) on scavenging capacity in the sample.

Mouse studies show that space missions can result in pulmonary pathological states. The goal of this study was to evaluate the pro-fibrotic and pro-carcinogenic effects of exposure to low doses of heavy iron ions (56Fe) in the mouse lung. Exposure to 56Fe (600 MeV; 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 Gy) resulted in minor pro-fibrotic changes, detected at the beginning of the fibrotic phase (22 weeks post exposure), which were exhibited as increased expression of chemokine Ccl3, and interleukin Il4. Epigenetic alterations were exhibited as global DNA hypermethylation, observed after exposure to 0.4 Gy. Cadm1, Cdh13, Cdkn1c, Mthfr and Sfrp1 were significantly hypermethylated after exposure to 0.1 Gy, while exposure to higher doses resulted in hypermethylation of Cdkn1c only. However, expression of these genes was not affected by any dose. Congruently with the observed patterns of global DNA methylation, DNA repetitive elements were hypermethylated after exposure to 0.4 Gy, with minor changes observed after exposure to lower doses. Importantly, hypermethylation of repetitive elements coincided with their transcriptional repression. The findings of this study will aid in understanding molecular determinants of pathological states associated with exposure to 56Fe, as well as serve as robust biomarkers for the delayed effects of irradiation. Further studies are clearly needed to investigate the persistence and outcomes of molecular alterations long term after exposure.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rru010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8154257","heavy iron ions;epigenetics;DNA methylation;repetitive elements;pulmonary fibrosis;lung cancer","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We compared DNA damage in heterochromatin (Hc) upon the action of qualitatively different radiations. We also studied, how is the sensitivity to DSB induction, assembly of repair foci and processing of DSBs influenced by the differentiation-induced changes in chromatin structure and composition.Materials and methods: Formation, localization (relative to higher-order chromatin domains) and mutual colocalization of γH2AX and p53BP1 repair foci have been studied together with DSB repair kinetics in spatially fixed human skin fibroblast and differently differentiated white blood cells (WBC) irradiated with gamma rays, protons of different energies [2, 3], and 20Ne ions (submitted). Immunostaining and ImmunoFISH were used in combination with high-resolution confocal microscopy [2, 3] and living cell imaging [4].Results: We found that less DSBs appear in Hc after irradiating cells with gamma rays and protons but not 20Ne ions (preliminary results). In addition, contrary to γ-irradiated human skin fibroblasts and lymphocytes, mature granulocytes neither express DSB repair proteins nor form functional repair foci [5]. At least some DSB repair proteins (e.g. 53BP1) are expressed and γH2AX foci still occur in immature granulocytes and monocytes [2, 5]; however, the colocalization of γH2AX with 53BP1 is low and the majority of DSBs are not repaired. Despite this fact, γH2AX foci protrude from Hc into nuclear subcompartments with low chromatin density. Our living cell observations suggest that 53BP1 can penetrate into the interior of dense Hc domains only after their decondensation [2].Conclusions: We show that Hc is less sensitive to DSB induction by gamma rays but not heavy ions; lower Hc hydratation and higher protein density (when compared with euchromatin) probably reduce formation of free radicals and increase their sequestration, respectively. This mechanism can protect cells against the indirect effect of ionizing radiation (marked for gamma rays and protons but not heavy ions). Hc features, however, preclude DSB repair, which is best illustrated by its absence in differentiated WBC but not their immature precursors. The protrusion of Hc-DSBs into low-density chromatin nuclear subdomains, however, appears also in differentiated WBC, so the process might simply follow physical forces (e.g. as suggested by M Durante's group).There is no Clinical Trial Registration number.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206906","DNA double-strand breaks (DSB);DSB repair;white blood cells differentiation;higher-order chromatin structure;ionizing radiations of different quality;ionizing radiation-induced repair foci (IRIF)","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Passive radiation shielding is one of the most important element in the entire radiation countermeasures package.Crewmembers will never experience direct exposure to space radiation; they will be either inside some shelter (the spacecraft, a ‘base’) or in an EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) suit. Understanding the radiation shielding features of materials is therefore an important step toward an optimization of shelters and suits construction in the quest for an integrated solution for radiation countermeasures.Materials are usually tested for their radiation shielding effectiveness first with Monte Carlo simulations, then on ground, using particle accelerators and a number of specific ions known to be abundant in space, and finally in space.Highly hydrogenated materials perform best as radiation shields. Polyethylene is right now seen as the material that merges a high level of hydrogenation, an easiness of handling and machining as well as an affordable cost, and it is often referred as a sort of ‘standard’ to which compare other materials' effectiveness.Kevlar has recently shown very interesting radiation shielding properties, and it is also known to have important characteristics toward debris shielding, and can be used, for example, in space suits.We have measured in the ISS the effectiveness of polyethylene and kevlar using three detectors of the ALTEA system [1–] from 8 June 2012 to 13 November 2012, in Express Rack 3 in Columbus. These active detectors are able to provide the radiation quality parameters in any orbital region; being identical, they are also suitable to be used in parallel (one for the unshielded baseline, two measuring radiation with two different amounts of the same material: 5 and 10 g/cm2).A strong similarity of the shielding behavior between polyethylene and kevlar is documented. We measured shielding providing as much as ∼40% reduction for high Z ions. In Fig., the integrated behavior (3 ≤LET ≤ 350 keV/µm) is shown (ratios with the baseline measurements with no shield) both for polyethylene and kevlar, in flux, dose and dose equivalent.The measured reductions in dose for the 10 g/cm2 shields for high LET (>50 keV/µm, not shown in the figure) are in agreement with what found in accelerator measurements (Fe, 1 GeV) . The thinner shielding (5 g/cm2) in our measurements performs ∼2% better (in unit areal density). Fig. 1. Integrated behavior (3 ≤ LET ≤ 350 keV/μm) of Flux, Dose and Equivalent Dose.

"Role of ATF-2 in regulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition and radio-sensitivity of A549 cells mediated by secreted soluble factors","S. Desai; S. Laskar; B. N. Pandey",NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i116","i117","Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known to be a crucial event whereby cancer cells acquire the traits needed to execute multiple steps of metastasis . Intriguingly, epithelial cancer cells undergoing EMT also exhibit increased radioresistance . EMT is a dynamic process and is triggered by various micro-environmental stimuli, out of which secreted soluble factors play a major role . Herein, we have investigated the effect of self-conditioned medium (CM) on the human lung carcinoma A549 cells and the underlying mechanism.A549 cells were obtained from National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, and cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS and antibiotics at 37°C in 5% CO2/air. To get CM, 1 × 106 A549 cells were grown in complete medium. After 48 h of incubation, media were harvested referred as CM. Media alone without cells were incubated under the same conditions served as control termed as plain medium (PM) . A549 cells grown in PM/CM subjected to immunofluorescence staining for E-cadherin, vimentin and actin. Motility scratch assay and matrigel invasion assay were performed to study the invasiveness of A549 cells in PM/CM. In some cases, cells were pretreated with inhibitors against MAPKs. To pinpoint the soluble factor(s) in CM responsible for initiating the invasiveness in A549 cells, CM was pretreated with neutralizing antibodies against IL-8, VEGF and IL-1β.We found that CM induced a series of changes associated with EMT in A549 cells such as change in shape from cuboidal to elongated spindle shape, decrease in E-cadherin, increase in vimentin and enhanced actin polymerization with decreased cell–cell contact. CM also promoted motility, invasion and anchorage-independent growth in A549 cells. Neutralizing IL-8, IL-1β and VEGF in CM significantly inhibited motility and invasion. Moreover, JNK and p38 activated by CM in A549 cells played important role in invasiveness. In downstream signalling, CM activated ATF-2 by phosphorylating it at Thr69 and 71. Knockdown of ATF-2 using siRNA abrogated the CM-enhanced motility and invasion. It has been reported that EMT not only accelerates cancer metastasis but may also result in resistance against therapeutic agents [, ]. We therefore investigated the effect of CM on radioresistance of A549 cells. Our results showed that A549 cells grown in CM followed by gamma irradiation exhibited higher clonogenic survival and lower DNA damage measured in terms of gamma-H2AX foci. Interestingly, these CM-treated A549 cells in response to radiation showed phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Ser 490/498 (not at Thr69/71), which was co-localized with gamma-H2AX foci. These studies suggest the dual role of ATF-2, i.e. as EMT potentiating transcription factor and DNA damage response protein in lung cancer cells stimulated with soluble factors, which can be exploited as potential therapeutic target for cancer radiotherapy.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206874","Epithelial–mesenchymal transition;gamma radiation;radio-resistance;tumor secreted soluble factors;ATF-2","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Cengel",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i66","i67","A major solar particle event (SPE) may place astronauts at significant risk for the acute radiation syndrome (ARS), which may be exacerbated when combined with other space flight stressors, such that the mission or crew health may be compromised. The National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) Center of Acute Radiation Research (CARR) is focused on the assessment of risks of adverse biological effects related to the ARS in animals exposed to space flight stressors combined with the types of radiation expected during an SPE. The CARR studies are focused on the adverse biological effects resulting from exposure to the types of radiation, at the appropriate energies, doses and dose-rates, present during an SPE (and standard reference radiations: gamma rays or electrons). All animal studies described have been approved by the University of PA IACUC. Some conclusions from recent CARR investigations are as follows: (i) the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for SPE-like protons compared with standard reference radiations (gammas or electrons) for white blood cells (WBCs) vary greatly between mice, ferrets and pigs, with the RBE values being greater in ferrets than those in mice, and considerably greater in pigs compared with those in ferrets or mice [1, 2]. This trend for the data suggests that the RBE values for WBCs in humans could be considerably greater than those observed in small mammals, and SPE proton radiation may be far more hazardous to humans than previously estimated from small animal studies. (ii) Very low doses of SPE proton radiation (25 cGy) increase blood clotting times in ferrets, and the low SPE-like dose rate has more severe effects than high dose rate radiation [3]. (iii) Results from pig and ferret studies suggest that disseminated intravascular coagulation is a major cause of death at doses near the LD50 level for SPE-like proton and gamma radiation. (iv) Exposure to SPE-like proton or gamma radiation, in combination with simulated microgravity (hindlimb suspension), leads to a very high level of morbidity/mortality in mice given a bacterial challenge with non-toxic levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Klebsiella pneumoniae; the threshold for this effect was 1.5 Gy. (v) T-cell activation was reduced in mice exposed to SPE-like radiation with or without simulated hypogravity (either partial weight suspension or hindlimb suspension) (e.g. [4]). (vi) Radiation and simulated hypogravity had synergistic effects on immune system biological endpoints (e.g. [5]). (vii) Pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation exhibited increases in intracranial pressure that remained elevated over the 90-day experimental period. (viii) A major sparing effect of SPE-like low dose rate radiation (compared with the results for high dose rate radiation) was observed for ferret emesis parameters, such that the differences between the results for ferret exposure to low dose rate radiation (50 cGy/h) and controls were not statistically significant (for doses up to 2 Gy). For high dose rate SPE proton radiation, the threshold value for retching was 75 cGy, and for ferret vomiting, it was 1 Gy.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206908","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We have previously reported that an Hsp90 inhibitor 17AAG can be an effective radio-sensitizer with X-rays for certain human tumor cells, while normal cells were not sensitized by this drug . The underlying mechanism for this was demonstrated to be inhibition of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by 17AAG; particularly, homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway was shown to be affected by this agent. In vivo mouse xenograft study also indicated a better tumor control with the combined treatment when compared with X-ray treatment alone.Materials and Methods: Cell lines used were SQ5 human lung cancer cells and HFL III normal human fibroblasts as control. For irradiation, X-rays and 290 MeV/n carbon ions were used at 50–70 keV/µm LET setting. As Hsp90 inhibitors, 17AAG and PU-H71 were used for pre-irradiation treatment for 24 h. Colony formation assay was used for radiation sensitivity studies. Repair of DNA DSBs was measured by constant field gel electrophoresis, and the appearance/disappearance of Rad51 foci was analyzed for HRR efficiency. For IRB-approved mouse xenograft study, BALB/c nu/nu mice were used to implant SQ5 cells for local irradiation.Results/Discussion: SQ5 tumor cells were better controlled with the combination of 17 AAG and carbon ion irradiation in vitro and in vivo xenograft model when compared with carbon irradiation alone. The cause of this radio-sensitizing effect seems to come from inhibition of repair of DNA DSBs by 17AAG as in X-rays. Likewise, HRR pathway was affected by addition of 17AAG in carbon irradiated tumor cells. The effect of 17AAG pre-treatment is shown below where the appearance of an HRR key protein Rad51 was significantly delayed after carbon ion irradiation in the drug-treated samples when compared with samples with carbon alone (Fig. ).We also started to investigate PU-H71 with carbon ion irradiation in vitro and in vivo. PU-H71 alone is currently under phase I clinical trial. Our data indicate that PU-H71 pre-treatment also showed a significant radio-sensitization in SQ5 human lung tumor cells exposed to carbon ions as well as to X-rays. As shown with 17AAG, normal human cells were not significantly affected with this drug. PU-H71 also seems to affect repair of radiation-induced DSBs. Further mechanism studies and in vivo experiments are currently underway.Conclusion: Hsp90 inhibitor would be a good candidate for the effective combined treatment with carbon ion radio-therapy.

The majority of space flight-associated risks identified for the cardiovascular (CV) system to date were determined shortly after low Earth orbit (LEO) short- and long-duration space flights that include: serious cardiac dysrhythmias, compromised orthostatic CV response and manifestation of previously asymptomatic CV disease. Further ground-based experiments using a surrogate model of microgravity supported the space flight data for significant cardiac remodeling due to prolonged exposure to microgravity. These symptoms were determined to be a consequence of adaptation to microgravity that could be ameliorated by a post-mission exercise program, and were not identified as risk factors that were causatively related to space IR. Long-term degenerative effects of cosmic IR during and after space flights on CV system are unknown.It was suggested that due to GCR, each cell in an astronaut's body will be traversed by 1H every 3 days, helium (2He) nuclei every few weeks and high charge and energy (HZE) nuclei (e.g. 28Si, 56Fe) every few months. Despite the fact that only 1% of GCR is composed of ions heavier than helium, ∼41% of the IR dose-equivalent is predicted to be HZE particles with 13% being from 56Fe particles, only. During an exploration-class space mission to Mars, astronauts will not have access to comprehensive healthcare services for a period of at least 2–3 years. Since the majority of experienced astronauts are middle-aged (average age is 46, and the range is 33–58 years), they are at risk for developing serious CV events which could be life-threatening for the astronaut and mission-threatening for NASA. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effects and potential CV risks caused by space IR. We hypothesized that: (i) low-dose space IR-induced biological responses may be long-lasting and are IR type-dependent; (ii) IR may increase CV risks in the aging heart (IR + AGING model) and affect the heart recovery after an adverse CV event, such as acute myocardial infarct (IR + AGING + AMI model).Methods: Eight- to 9-month-old C57BL/6N male mice were IR once with proton (1H) 50 cGy, 1 GeV/n or iron (56Fe) 15 cGy, 1 GeV/n. We evaluated IR-induced biological tissue responses—underlying molecular mechanisms, calcium handling, signal transduction, gene expression and cardiac fibrosis. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography (ECHO) and hemodynamic measurements (HEMO) as detailed in Fig. . AMI was induced by ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery 1 and 3 months post-IR as detailed in Fig. . Fig. 1. Radiation + aging model. Fig. 2. Radiation + aging model + adverse CV event model. Results: In the IR + AGING model, cardiac function was not different among the control and 1H-IR group, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was significantly increased in 56Fe mice 1 and 3 months post-IR. There was a small but statistically significant (P < 0.04) improvement of ejection fraction % (EF%) in 1H-IR vs control mice. One month post-IR, compared with control, 1H- and 56Fe-IR hearts had a significant up-regulation of sarcolemmal Na+–Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) (∼200% P<0.007), sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA2a, >200% increases, P < 0.02) and 400% decreases in p-p38 MAPK (P < 0.05), suggesting activation of compensatory mechanisms in [Ca2+]i handling in these hearts. By 3 months, compared with control, 1H- and 56Fe-IR hearts had 200–500% (P < 0.02) decreases in SERCA2a and more than 200% decreases in p-Creb-1 (P < 0.02), suggesting reduced capacity in intracellular [Ca2+]i handling. These data suggest that dysfunction in [Ca2+]i handling combined with LVEDP increase after 56Fe-IR may arise from the excessive demand on the heart due to prolonged activation of compensatory mechanisms that lead to changes in SERCA2a and p-Creb1 levels. This may represent a possible intracellular mechanism of heart failure in development in 56Fe-IR hearts.In the IR + AGING + AMI model, no mortality was observed among three different groups 1 or 3 months post-IR and up to 28 days post-AMI. However, 1 month post-IR and 28 days post-AMI, the infarct size was significantly smaller in 56Fe-IR (p < 0.003) and 1H-IR (p = n.s.) vs control-IR mice, suggesting that at 1 month, 56Fe-IR primes the heart to recover better after AMI. In contrast, 3 months post AMI, 1H-AMI mice had a better cardiac functional recovery compared with control-AMI and 56Fe-AMI mice. The ejection fraction (EF%) was most decreased in 56Fe-AMI mice (56Fe-AMI vs 1H-AMI: 18 vs 48%, P < 0.007, ∼65–70% pre-AMI EF% for all groups). There was a 2- to 4-fold increase in LVEDP in 56Fe-AMI vs 1H-AMI (P < 0.04), suggesting that 56Fe-AMI hearts developed cardiac de-compensation. Western blots showed that 3 days post-AMI, compared with control- and 1H-IR-AMI mice, 56Fe-IR-AMI hearts had a 4- to 7-fold (P < 0.04) decreases in p-Akt (Thr308), p-Erk1/2 (P < 0.007) and ∼2-fold (P < 0.01) increase in phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-S6k, a readout for mTORC1 pathway activation), suggesting decreased survival and angiogenesis signaling and decreased autophagy in these hearts. Seven days post-AMI, the levels of p-pErk1/2 were comparable between all three treatment conditions. However, in 56Fe-IR-AMI hearts, the p-Akt (Thr308) levels remained 4-fold decreased. Additionally, here was a 3-fold (P<0.05) decrease in p-S6k levels and >10-fold increase in p-p38 MAPK level in 56Fe vs control and 1H-IR-AMI hearts, suggesting continuous decreases in the survival, proliferation and angiogenesis signaling (p-Akt and p-S6k) and increase in the apoptotic signaling (p-p38 MAPK) up to Day 7 post-AMI in 56Fe-IR-AMI mice.In summary, our results revealed that by 1 and 3 months post-IR in IR + AGING, 56Fe-IR but not 1H-IR mice had worse cardiac function. Further, a single 1H-IR 3 months prior to AMI improved, whereas 56Fe-IR worsened, recovery from AMI recovery. Our data in the IR + AGING and IR + AGING + AMI groups strongly suggest that low-dose HZE particle IR (56Fe) have long-lasting negative effect on heart homeostasis during normal aging, and present a significant CV risk for recovery after adverse CV event, such as AMI.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206914","HZE;iron;proton;low-dose;cardiovascular risks;Ca2+","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Space crew living and working in the International Space Station (ISS) are exposed to a mixed radiation field comprises primary high-energy cosmic rays, including energetic protons and heavy ions, and to secondary radiations, including energetic neutrons, produced when the primary radiation interacts with the mass of the space station and its contents. The doses of ionizing radiation received by astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the ISS are many times greater than those received by radiation workers on the ground. Exposure to ionizing radiation in space includes high LET events than can produce significant biological damage in human cells and tissues, and thus represents an important risk to space crew health and safety.The Space Radiation Research Unit at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) includes both physicists and radiation biologists and there is extensive collaboration between these two groups. This provides us with the expertise needed to investigate the effects of space crew exposure to the highly complex, mixed radiation environment encountered in space. In addition, NIRS is home to a heavy ion accelerator, HIMAC and the Medical Cyclotron that can be used to simulate various components of the space radiation environment. Recently, we have developed a medium energy proton radiation field using the NIRS Medical Cyclotron. [How about a sentence or two on the significance of this proton facilities.] In addition, NIRS has also developed a high precision tool, the Single Particle Irradiation System to Cell (SPICE) microbeam facility, for use in investigating various radiobiological endpoints, including the bystander effect and the adaptive response of various cell types, Caenorhabditis elegans and in Medaka fish. Some of these research activities are described in these proceedings [, ].The Space Radiation Research Unit at NIRS has extensive international collaborations with researchers in China, Germany, Russia, USA, Sweden, Austria and other countries. In particular, collaborations with our Russian colleagues has led to opportunities to expose our dosimeters aboard the ISS and to numerous other experiments in the frame of the IOL, as described more fully elsewhere in these proceedings. We believe that the framework of the IOL is very powerful and productive and we plan to continue our collaborative research with our international colleagues.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206916","space radiation;dosimetry;HIMAC;microbeam","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Distinct mechanisms of the inhibition of vasculogenesis by different species of ionizing particles","P. Grabham; P. Sharma; A. Bigelow; C. Geard",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i44","i45","The human vasculature includes a vast network of microcapillaries networking the body and is a major target for non-carcinogenic effects of space radiation in the body. The brain microvascular system is crucial to healthy functioning of the brain and its pathology is not only a primary event in a range of neurodegenerative diseases but also an important influencing factor in many others. The vasculature is maintained by angiogenesis regenerating vessels as they are needed, this is particularly relevant if the blood–brain barrier is damaged by agents such as space radiation, thereby creating the need for angiogenic regeneration. The resulting lack of vasculature due to the inhibition of re-growth of vessels can, in turn, lead to a negative feedback loop and further pathologies.Using three-dimensional human vessel cultures with human umbilical vein and brain microvascular endothelial cells, we have developed assays that determine at what stage angiogenesis is inhibited by ionizing radiation. The relative biological effect of high linear energy transfer (LET) 1 GeV Fe ions compared with low LET 1 GeV protons is only one for developing vessels but greater than four for mature vessels. This action of low LET protons on developing vessels was surprisingly effective (50% inhibition with 40 cGy exposure) and together with the effect of high LET ions may represent a significant hazard in the space environment.The morphology of developing vessels 5 days after exposure showed significant differences that suggest distinct mechanisms of inhibition. Cells exposed to protons failed to make connections with other cells. Conversely, cells exposed to Fe ions extended cellular processes and made connections to other cells but did not develop a central lumen. The microtubule and actin cytoskeletons showed differences indicating that motility at the extending tips of endothelial cells is inhibited by protons but not Fe ions. Actin-rich protrusive structures that contain bundled and dynamic microtubules showed a 65% decrease when exposed to high-energy protons but not with the same dose of high-energy Fe ions. Since protein kinase C (PKC) has long been known to stimulate angiogenesis, we hypothesized that rescue of the capillary phenotype after proton exposure would be possible by stimulating PKC before irradiation. One-day-old vessel cultures were treated with 30 and 60 nM phorbol ester (PMA) 15 min before irradiation. Stimulation of PKC restored capillary formation in proton-treated cultures but not in Fe ion-treated cultures. More specifically, stimulation of PKC by PMA was able to restore the tip motility that was inhibited by low LET ions .Further studies with various charged particles showed that low LET ion particles (Proton and He ions) with an LET lower or equal to 1 keV/μm inhibit vasculogenesis in the same way as protons. Higher LET charged particles (Silicon 1GeV, Oxygen 250 MeV and 1 GeV and Carbon 290 MeV and 1 GeV) with an LET ≥8 keV/μm inhibit vasculogenesis in the same way as Fe ions.In conclusion, we have shown that low and high LET ions inhibit the formation of brain capillaries by different mechanisms. For low LET ions, inhibition involves regulation of PKC-dependent motile tips leading to a failure of cellular processes to migrate through the matrix and meet up with other processes. For high LET ions, the cells fail to complete angiogenesis by not migrating and forming tubular structures. This complexity of response opens up possibilities of greater control over angiogenesis and the resulting pathologies during coincident exposure or therapy. For exposure in space, knowledge of these mechanisms will enable more precise risk assessment and mitigation strategies. For radiotherapy, treatment could be manipulated to utilize the radiation effectively.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206884","angiogenesis;vasculogenesis;radiation;charged particles","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Radiation carcinogenesis is a two-compartment problem: ionizing radiation can alter genomic sequence as a result of damage due to targeted effects (TE) from the interaction of energy and DNA; it can also alter phenotype and multicellular interactions that contribute to cancer by poorly understood non-targeted effects (NTE). Rather than being secondary to DNA damage and mutations that can initiate cancer, radiation NTE create the critical context in which to promote cancer. Systems biology modeling using comprehensive experimental data that integrates different levels of biological organization and time-scales is a means of identifying the key processes underlying the carcinogenic potential of high-LET radiation. We hypothesize that inflammation is a key process, and thus cancer susceptibility will depend on specific genetic predisposition to the type and duration of this response. Systems genetics using novel mouse models can be used to identify such determinants of susceptibility to cancer in radiation sensitive tissues following high-LET radiation. Improved understanding of radiation carcinogenesis achieved by defining the relative contribution of NTE carcinogenic effects and identifying the genetic determinants of the high-LET cancer susceptibility will help reduce uncertainties in radiation risk assessment.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206922","ionizing radiation;breast cancer;heavy ion radiation;modeling;initiation;promotion","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Crystallization of Interstitial Liquid and Latent Heat Buffering in Solidifying Gabbros: Skaergaard Intrusion, Greenland","O. Namur; M. C. S. Humphreys; M. B.

The data show that plagioclase crystals display three types of compositional profile over the whole intrusion, as follows. (1) Grains with normal zoning, which dominate the MBS and UBS. These are interpreted as having formed at the top of a crystal mush and then buried in the cumulate pile. Crystallization of the interstitial melt resulted in liquid differentiation and produced normally zoned rims on plagioclase cores. (2) Unzoned crystals, which dominate the upper part of the LS, also crystallized at the top of the mush and were then buried in mush with a low interstitial liquid fraction or one experiencing convective movements that kept the liquid to a constant composition. (3) Crystals with a mantle of decreasing An content followed by a rim of constant composition. Grains showing this complex zoning mostly occur in the lower parts of the LS. Depending on the stratigraphic position within the intrusion, the composition of the rim can be An56, An51 or An40. In the main magma body, these compositions (An contents) correspond to those of plagioclase primocrysts (e.g. cores) at the appearance of cumulus clinopyroxene (An56), Fe–Ti oxides (An51) and apatite (An40). Compositional buffering of plagioclase rims is interpreted as being a consequence of enhanced release of latent heat of crystallization at the appearance of new interstitial phases in the crystal mush. When a new phase saturates, the latent heat contribution to the global enthalpy budget of the system becomes sufficiently high to keep the interstitial melt at its liquidus temperature for a period of time that could exceed thousands of years. Under these conditions, equilibrium, adcumulus growth together with diffusion and possibly advection of chemical components result in the formation of plagioclase rims of constant composition (An content). Efficient thermal buffering of the mush liquid depends on the porosity (i.e. fraction of liquid within the mush) and the degree of compositional homogeneity of the mush. In a heterogeneous and highly porous mush, saturation of the new phase occurs in the coldest part of the mush and the enhanced latent heat release at the saturation of this phase is quickly dissipated to the whole volume of liquid, including the warmest part that is not yet saturated in a new phase. As a consequence, no thermal buffering occurs and interstitial crystallization produces grains with normal zoning. The distribution of the various types of plagioclase grains throughout the Skaergaard intrusion can therefore be used to infer the spatial variability in the physical properties of the crystal mush, such as the residual porosity, both at an intrusion-wide scale and at a millimetre- to centimetre-scale.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egu028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8184177","plagioclase;thermal buffering;thermodynamics;zoning;cumulate;layered intrusion;Skaergaard","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Effects of proton radiation on evoked and spontaneous neuronal activity in the hippocampus of APP/PSEN1 transgenic mice","E. Rudobeck; A. Szucs; R. Vlkolinsky",NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i102","i103","Ground-based studies on space radiation indicate that exposure to charged particle radiation at relatively low doses may impair neuronal functions. Decrements in excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus have been previously reported in mouse brains irradiated with iron nuclei, but relatively little is known about the effects of protons on the synaptic activity in the hippocampus. Behavioral and neurophysiological decrements in irradiated subjects are also commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and we hypothesized that irradiation with protons may exacerbate AD-like neurodegenerative pathology. We used transgenic (TG) mice with AD-like neurodegeneration to test whether whole-body irradiation with protons (150 MeV; 0.1, 0.5, 1 Gy) accelerates the onset of AD and/or exacerbates synaptic impairments. We measured evoked excitatory synaptic potentials, synaptic plasticity and spontaneous oscillations in hippocampal slices prepared from APP/PSEN1 double TG mice (males only) at 6 and 9 months post-irradiation.Our electrophysiological recordings indicate that most of the radiation-induced synaptic decrements can be observed at 9 months rather than 6 months post-irradiation and they are differently expressed in TG and wild-type (WT) mice. Presynaptic excitability evaluated by the amplitude of fiber volleys was significantly increased in non-irradiated TG mice when compared with non-irradiated WT mice, and irradiation did not cause further alterations. The post-synaptic, dendritic excitability, evaluated by the initial slope of the excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs), was reduced in TG mice exposed to 0.5 Gy, but increased relative to WT mice at the same dose. Interestingly, the suppressive effect on EPSP in TG mice was not observed at 1 Gy. Post-synaptic firing of action potentials, evaluated by the amplitude of population spikes (PS), was increased in non-irradiated TG mice when compared with WT controls. However, these increases were significantly reduced by irradiation at 0.1 and 1 Gy. Long-term potentiation of the EPSPs, a widely used electrophysiological correlate of memory formation, was not significantly affected by irradiation. Last, in WT mice, we observed a significant radiation-induced decrease in the frequency of epileptiform oscillations in the CA3–CA1 network triggered by reduced concentration of extracellular magnesium. These spontaneous waveforms (SW) are reminiscent of ‘sharp-wave/ripple complexes’ that have been associated with memory consolidation in the hippocampus. Interestingly, in the behavioral part of our project, irradiation impaired hippocampal learning in WT mice, while it did not affect performance in TG mice . This may indicate altered memory consolidation in irradiated WT mice, where we observed significant negative correlation between SW and increased swim distance in water maze. Our data indicate that irradiation with protons at low doses may differently affect synaptic parameters in WT and APP/PSEN1 TG mice. Thus, different neurological or cognitive decrements may be expected in normal subjects relative to those prone to AD-like pathology. The most prominent radiation-induced decrements in TG mice were reduced dendritic excitability and firing of CA1 neurons. The reduction in PS amplitudes in TG mice suggests that proton radiation may impair communication of the hippocampal neurons with other brain areas. Memory formation and consolidation processes in TG mice are likely not further affected by the irradiation.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206886","radiation;hippocampus;synaptic transmission;electrophysiology","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Bystander signaling in C. elegans: proton microbeam studies","G. Nelson; T. Jones; L. Ortloff; J. Ford; D. Nuñez; L. Braby",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i118","i119","Biological model: In this project, we investigated the control of radiation-induced genotoxic damage expression in somatic cells of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We measured genotoxic damage in the C. elegans intestine by irradiating young larvae with 20 intestinal cells. Fourteen of these cells undergo exactly one nuclear division without cytoplasmic division leading to 14 binucleate cells. This nuclear division is synchronized and occurs at the first larval molt. Irradiation induces chromosome aberrations including dicentrics which we can quantify as stable anaphase bridges in the binucleate cells of young adult intestines. The endpoint is dose- and LET-dependent and we have demonstrated that individual intestinal cells have unique radiosensitivities.Results: The project has two components, a genetic screen for genes that control cell sensitivity and a microbeam component to directly probe individual cells. The genetic screen has identified several genes in NHEJ repair and telomere metabolism that modulate overall bridge frequency. Knockout mutants of cku-70, cku-80 and lig-4 greatly sensitize animals for anaphase bridge induction. A statistical method was used to determine whether induction of bridges was strictly random and cell autonomous and we determined that expression of bridges in pairs of cells was, in fact, non-random which suggested that signaling between cells affected the pattern of bridge expression. This allowed us to conduct an RNAi and mutation screen for genes that control the signaling (block non-random distributions) and several candidates have been identified.To directly test the notion that signaling of genotoxic damage occurs, we conducted experiments with alpha particles collimated through slits in metal foils and showed that genotoxic damage could be expressed many cell diameters away from a partial body exposure site. Thus, an in vivo bystander effect was demonstrated. Dose targeting was then improved to small regional exposures and eventually to individual cell targeting using 2 MeV protons from the microbeam facility at Texas A&M University. We now employ a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing transgenic worm (rrIs1[elt-2::GFP]) to target GFP-positive gut cells via the gut-specific transcription factor elt-2. This allows alignment of the cell of interest over the microbeam aperture under appropriate fluorescence illumination.Microbeam irradiation experiments for many pairwise combinations of cell signal transmission and reception (observed as expression of anaphase bridges) have been conducted and several interesting patterns emerge. (i) The signaling pattern is cell-specific and does not simply reflect cell–cell distance or require direct contact between cell pairs. (ii) The signal range can be as far as from cell pair 2 to cell pair 8 (>100 µm). (iii) There appears to be a functional compartment boundary at the pharynx/intestine valve as even high-dose exposures to the posterior pharyngeal bulb fail to induce bridges in nearby intestinal cells. (iv) The frequency of signal transmission and reception corresponds broadly to the overall frequency of bridges observed during whole-body irradiations which suggests that direct irradiation and ‘out-of-field’ effects may be additive. These patterns have been analyzed in terms of a cellular logic circuit map for signal transmission and reception.A dose–response for a subset of microbeam-targeted cells was measured over the range of 5–20 Gy. Controlled cell pair targeting was used to test the potential additivity of signals and we found that effects were supra-additive. Finally, preliminary measurements were conducted on GFP-expressing transgenic strains that bore cku-70(tm1524) III and smk-1(mn156) V mutations which confer enhanced radiosensitivity. Cku-70 is a Ku-70 ortholog while smk-1 is orthologous to the mammalian and Dictyostelium discoideum SMEK (suppressor of MEK null) protein. In the cku-70(0/0) strain, the severity of the bridges in bystander cells was enhanced, suggesting that signal recipient cells employ NHEJ repair pathways in the expression of anaphase bridges.Clinical trial registration number: Not applicable.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206890","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The context for this is the Universe during the epoch of recombination. The electromagnetic treatment of this phase transition can produce energetic electrons scattered throughout the Universe, localized near the edges of magnetic domains. This is confirmed by a numerical simulation in which a magnetic domain is modelled as a uniform field region produced by a thin surrounding current sheet. Conduction currents sustaining the magnetic structure are removed as the charges comprising them combine into neutrals. The induced electric field accompanying the magnetic collapse is able to accelerate ambient stationary electrons (that is, electrons not participating in the current sheet) to energies of up to order 10keV. This is consistent with theoretical predictions. The localized electron acceleration leads to local imbalances of charge which has implications for charge separation in the early Universe.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu1857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8184502","magnetic fields;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"Response of irradiated and bystander cells to charged particles in two-dimensional and three-dimensional colon models","C. Li; H. Kawamura; S. Khaled; K. D. Held",NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i48","i49","The radiation-induced bystander effect, wherein unirradiated cells near to or sharing medium with irradiated cells express biological responses, most often has been studied in two-dimensional monolayer cultures, although some studies with three-dimensional models and in vivo have also shown bystander signaling. We have shown previously that DNA damage, measured as foci of the DNA repair-related protein 53BP1, occurs in unirradiated bystander cells in a three-dimensional skin epithelium model irradiated with protons or iron ions (Lumpkins et al., submitted). In the current work, we extend the studies to a second epithelial model, colon, with studies in both two-dimensional monolayer and a three-dimensional tissue model using Caco2 human colon epithelial cancer cells and AG01522 human fibroblasts.For the monolayer studies, Caco2 cells in exponential growth were irradiated then co-cultured, sharing medium in an insert system, with unirradiated cells. Cells were irradiated with 250 kVp X-rays at Massachusetts General Hospital or with 1 GeV/amu protons, silicon ions or iron ions at the National Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory. At varying times after irradiation, cell damage was assayed as micronuclei (MN) induction or formation of 53BP1 foci in both irradiated and bystander cells. For the three-dimensional studies, AG01522 fibroblasts were embedded in a collagen gel, then Caco2 cells were grown on the top of the gel. Each three-dimensional construct was cut in half prior to irradiation, with one half irradiated then immediately placed in contact with the other, bystander, half for co-culture. At selected times after irradiation, irradiated and bystander construct halves were fixed and sectioned, and 53BP1 foci were counted.In monolayer culture, irradiated Caco2 cells showed a dose-dependent increased fraction of cells with MN after exposure to X-rays, protons, iron ions or silicon ions. Bystander Caco2 cells sharing medium with the irradiated cells also showed an increased fraction of cells with MN, reaching similar levels of ∼16% cells with MN, about a threefold increase over controls, after 1 Gy of all types of radiation. The fraction of cells with 53BP1 foci depended on radiation type and time of assay after irradiation, with the induction of foci generally greatest 5 h after irradiation and increasing with radiation dose. In bystander Caco2 cells, the appearance of foci generally was delayed, with the maximal fraction of cells showing foci at 12 h. In three-dimensional culture, after X-ray or proton exposure, cells showed similar trends to those seen in two-dimensional growth, i.e. with both the Caco2 and the AG01522 cells, the fraction of irradiated cells having 53BP1 foci reached a maximum at 5 h, but with bystander cells, the maximum occurred at 12 h after irradiation. This delay in the appearance of foci in bystander cells compared with irradiated cells is similar to our findings in the three-dimensional skin model composed of keratinocytes and fibroblasts.In summary, our data now show in two different epithelial tissue models in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional models, radiation-stimulated intercellular signaling results in substantial levels of DNA damage in unirradiated cells. Because Caco2 cells are a carcinoma cell line, the studies are now being extended to a three-dimensional colon model using normal human colonic epithelial cells.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206888","bystander effects;heavy ions;three-dimensional epithelial model;colon cancer","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"56Fe ion irradiation enhances angiogenesis and other inter-cellular determinants of carcinogenesis risk","S. Girdhani; C. Lamont; M. Peluso; M. Sun; L. Hlatky",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i124","i126","In the assessment of radiogenic cancer risk from space flight, it is imperative to consider effects not only on the creation of cancer cells (initiation) but also on cell–cell interactions that play an important and often decisive role in the promotion and progression phases. Autopsy results confirm that most adults carry fully malignant tumors that are held in check at a small size and will never become symptomatic [, ]. This introduces the possibility that cosmic radiation may significantly influence cancer risk through alteration of the bottleneck inter-tissue interactions responsible for maintaining this dormant state. One such bottleneck is the growth limitation imposed by the failure of the tumor to induce blood vessels (angiogenesis). Other deciding events are the ability of a tumor to proliferate and invade. We have previously shown that proton radiation, the most prevalent radiation in space, has a suppressive effect on all three of these functional responses. It down-regulates angiogenic genes like VEGF and HIF-1α and impairs cell invasion and tumor growth . We decided to test these responses after 56Fe irradiation, an HZE radiation type present in the cosmic environment with presumably high carcinogenic potential .Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells were irradiated with different doses of 56Fe ion radiation (1 GeV/n) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and RNA was extracted 6 h later. Genomic-wide array analysis was done on the isolated RNA through the Agilent Platform. It was observed that several pro-angiogenic genes like VEGF, IL-6 and HIF-1α were significantly up-regulated after treatment with 56Fe ion radiation (Fig. ). These results were also confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels with the human and murine lung cancer lines, A549 and LLC, respectively. Additional verification of modulation of these key genes was also observed when lungs of C57BL/6 mice treated with 56Fe ion radiation showed an increase in VEGF and MMP9 mRNA and protein expression 6 h post-irradiation (Fig. ). Cell invasion was shown to be increased by 56Fe ion radiation in various cell types, including fibroblast, tumor and endothelial progenitor cells. 56Fe ion irradiation also modulated functional processes crucial to angiogenesis. It enhanced the ability of untargeted (bystander) endothelial cells to invade and proliferate in response to factors produced by targeted fibroblast or cancer cells in vitro. Results also carry over to in vivo. C57BL/6 mice exposed to whole-body irradiation with 0.2 Gy dose of 56Fe and injected subcutaneously with LLC tumor cells showed a significant augmentation in tumor growth and growth rate in the irradiated group. Additionally, nude mice exposed to whole-body 56Fe radiation and injected intravenously with A549 cancer cells 3 h post-irradiation demonstrated a significant enhancement in lung colonization capacity when compared with the sham-irradiated control mice injected.These results together suggest cell and tissue-level responses to 56Fe irradiation may act to overcome major cancer progression-level bottlenecks including those related to angiogenesis, cell proliferation and invasion. This is of significant concern for cancer risk estimations pertinent to NASA as achieving these cancer hallmark processes can make the difference between a radiation-induced cancer cell progressing to a clinically detectable cancer in astronauts or not. In conclusion, we demonstrate a strong radiation quality dependence for space radiation carcinogenesis risk manifested through influences on intercellular interactions in the progression phase of carcinogenesis.

Cells were treated with either 0, 0.5, 1 or 2 Gy of proton radiation or 0, 0.2, 0.4 or 1 Gy of 56Fe ion dose. Among the major regulated genes were VEGF, HIF-1A and IL-6; they were down-regulated by proton radiation and up-regulated by iron radiation. Fig. 2.

Methods: We investigated a retrospective cohort of registered breast cancer patients at the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand from 2001–2007. Analysis was performed using Cox regression models to identify factors affecting the overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates. Comparisons were made between two cohorts: women who received adjuvant PMRT (74 patients) and women who did not receive adjuvant PMRT (81 patients). Results: A total of 155 patients were included with a median follow-up period of 4.45 years.

The 4-year RFS was 85.9% for patients receiving PMRT and 78.3% for patients who did not receive PMRT (P = 0.291). On multivariate analysis of OS, using hormonal treatment was the only significant independent factor associated with improved OS. On multivariate analysis of RFS, none of the variables were significantly associated with improved RFS.

Tsujii",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i26","i27","Introduction: In 1994, we started carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for peripheral stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). First, two phase I/II clinical trials demonstrated the optimal doses of 90.0 GyE in 18 fractions over 6 weeks (Protocol 9303) and 72.0 GyE in 9 fractions over 3 weeks (Protocol 9701) for achieving more than 95% local control with minimal pulmonary toxicity. As a next step, we conducted two successive phase II trials. The first trial (Protocol 9802) used a regimen of 72 GyE per 9 fractions over 3 weeks and the second trial (Protocol 0001) used a regimen of 4 fractions over 1 week, at a fixed dose of 52.8 GyE for stage IA and 60 GyE for IB. In these Phase II trials, the local control rate (LCR) for all patients was 91.5%, and those for T1 and T2 tumors were 96.3 and 84.7%, respectively. The 5-year cause-specific survival rate (CSS) was 67.0% (IA: 84.4, IB: 43.7), and overall survival (OS) was 45.3% (IA: 53.9, IB: 34.2). No adverse events greater than grade 2 occurred in the lung.In 2003, we also started a phase I/II clinical trial (Protocol 0201) as a dose escalation study using single fraction. The initial total dose was 28.0 GyE administered and escalated in increments of 2.0 GyE each, up to 50.0 GyE. This clinical trial ended in February 2012 and is still followed up. In this article, we investigated the preliminary results of this phase I/II trial.Materials and methods: In this prospective study, 151 primary stage I NSCLC were treated by CIRT monotherapy using a total dose of 36.0 GyE (n = 18), 38.0 GyE (n = 14), 40.0 GyE (n = 20), 42.0 GyE (n = 15), 44.0 GyE (n = 44), 46.0 GyE (n = 20), 48.0 GyE (n = 10) and 50.0 GyE (n = 10) using single fractionation. Mean age was 73.9 years, and size of tumor included T1 (n = 91) and T2 (n = 60). By type (cancer type was determined by biopsy), there were 104 adenocarcinomas, 46 squamous cell carcinomas and 1 large cell carcinoma. Medical inoperability was 55.6%.The patient is fixed on the rotational couch by using a custom-made immobilization device. Under free breathing conditions, planning CT images were acquired for treatment planning. The clinical target volume (CTV) was determined by adding >10-mm margin to the gross tumor volume (GTV). The planning target volume (PTV) was created by adding an internal margin to CTV as 5 mm in craniocaudal direction. The prescribed dose was delivered to PTV with different coplanar four beam angles. A respiratory-gated irradiation system was used in all irradiation sessions.Results: The median follow-up time was 45.6 months (range, 1.6–88.4 months). For 151 patients, the 5-year overall LCR was 79.2%, and those for T1 (n = 91) and T2 (n = 60) tumors were 83.6 and 72.2%, respectively. Also, local control in T1a, T1b, T2a and T2b were 96.8, 84.4, 80.2 and 20.0%, respectively. The OS was 55.1% and the CSS was 73.1%. No toxicity greater than grade 2 was observed in the lung and the skin.Conclusions: In patients with stage I NSCLC, CIRT using single fraction is considered as a promising curative modality. Especially for elderly and inoperable cases, CIRT could be a minimally invasive therapeutic option as a valid alternative to surgical resection (Fig. ).","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206926","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To estimate accurately radiation health risk detailed study of dose distribution inside human body by means of human phantom is conducted. In the space experiment MATROSHKA-R, the tissue-equivalent spherical phantom (32 kg mass, 35 cm diameter and 10 cm central spherical cave) made in Russia has been used on board the ISS for more than 8 years. Owing to the specially chosen phantom shape and size, the chord length distributions of the detector locations are attributed to self-shielding properties of the critical organs in a real human body. If compared with the anthropomorphic phantom Rando used inside and outside the ISS, the spherical phantom has lower mass, smaller size and requires less crew time for the detector installation/retrieval; its tissue-equivalent properties are closer to the standard human body tissue than the Rando-phantom material. Originally the spherical phantom was installed in the star board crew cabin of the ISS Service Module, then in the Piers-1, MIM-2 and MIM-1 modules of the ISS Russian segment, and finally in JAXA Kibo module. Total duration of the detector exposure is more than 1700 days in 8 sessions.In the first phase of the experiment with the spherical phantom, the dose measurements were realized with only passive detectors (thermoluminescent and solid-state track detectors). The detectors are placed inside the phantom along the axes of 20 containers and on the phantom outer surface in 32 pockets of the phantom jacket. After each session the passive detectors are returned to the ground. The results obtained show the dose difference on the phantom surface as much as a factor of 2, the highest dose being observed close to the outer wall of the compartment, and the lowest dose being in the opposite location along the phantom diameter. Maximum dose rate measured in the phantom is obviously due to the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) and Earth' radiation belt contribution on the ISS trajectory. Minimum dose rate is caused mainly by the strongly penetrating GCR particles and is observed behind more than 5 g/cm2 tissue shielding. Critical organ doses, mean-tissue and effective doses of a crew member in the ISS compartments are also estimated with the spherical phantom data. The estimated effective dose rate is found to be from 10 to 15% lower than the averaged dose on the phantom surface as dependent on the attitude of the critical organs.The spherical phantom proved its effectiveness to measure the critical organ doses together with the effective dose in-flight and if supplied with active dosimeters can be recommended for future exploratory manned missions to monitor continuously the effective dose.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206930","space radiation;spherical phantom;passive and active detectors;effective dose","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"mBAND analysis of early and late damages in the chromosome of human lymphocytes after exposures to gamma rays and Fe ions","M. Yuasa-Sunagawa; Y. Zhang; S. A. Yeshitla; M. A. Kadhim; B. L. Wilson; H. Wu",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Journal of Radiation Research,"18 Jan 2018","2014","55","suppl_1","i87","i88","Stable-type chromosome aberrations that survive multiple generations of cell division include translocation and inversions. An efficient method to detect an inversion is multi-color banding fluorescent in situ hybridization (mBAND) which allows identification of both inter- and intra-chromosome aberrations simultaneously. Post irradiation, chromosome aberrations may also arise after multiple cell divisions as a result of genomic instability. This study was aimed at investigating stable or late-arising chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes induced after low- and high-LET radiation exposure.Human lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to gamma ray doses of 2 or 4 Gy using a 137Cs source at a dose rate of 0.5 Gy/min. For high LET radiation, cells were exposed to Fe ions (600 MeV/nucleon) of 0.05, 0.5 or 1 Gy at NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Chromosomes were collected at 48 h which represented the first mitosis, and 7 and 14 days after irradiation using a premature chromosome condensation (PCC) technique as described previously . Chromosome 3 was painted with the XCyte3 mBAND kit (MetaSystems), and intra- and inter-chromosomal aberrations were analyzed with the mBAND analysis system (MetaSystems).With gamma irradiation, about half of the damages observed at first mitosis remained after 7- and 14-day culture, suggesting transmissibility of damages to the surviving progeny. With Fe ions irradiation, at the doses that produced similar frequencies of gamma-induced chromosome aberrations as observed at first mitosis, a significantly lower yield of aberrations remained at the same population doublings after Fe ion exposure. At these equitoxic doses, more complex-type aberrations were observed for Fe ions, indicating that Fe ion-induced initial chromosome damages are more severe and may lead to cell death.Comparison of the number of breaks indicates that Fe ions produced three or more breaks in ∼20% of the damaged chromosome 3, whereas ∼10% or a less fraction of cells with three or more breaks in chromosome 3 were found after gamma ray exposures. Unlike gamma rays, increasing doses of Fe ions did not produce more breaks in a damaged chromosome 3, indicating that damages from Fe ions exposures were mostly due to the single track effect, in agreement with the results of Hada et al. [, ].Increasing doses of exposure resulted in less fraction of chromosome break ends involved in intra-chromosomal exchange induced by either gamma rays or Fe ions in the first mitosis.Interestingly, simple inversions in chromosome 3 were found in only the 7 and 14-day samples after 4 Gy gamma irradiation. It is not clear whether cells containing simple inversions had already progressed through the first cell division at 48 h, or the simple inversions were induced after the first cell division.Detailed analysis of breaks participating in total chromosome exchanges within the first cell cycle post-irradiation revealed a common hot spot located in the 3p21 region, which is a known fragile site corresponding to Band 6 in the mBand analysis . The breakpoint distribution in chromosomes collected at 7 days, but not at 14 days, post-irradiation appeared similar to the distribution in cells collected within the first cell cycle post-irradiation. The breakpoint distribution for human lymphocytes after radiation exposure was different from the previously published distribution for human mammary epithelial cells, indicating that interphase chromatin folding structures play a role in the distribution of radiation-induced breaks.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206894","heavy ion;genomic instability;chromosome aberrations;mBAND","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The switch is based on the injection-locking property of a single-mode Fabry–Pérot laser diode (SMFP-LD). Unlike the case of full-lock (FL) in which self-locked mode and all side modes of the SMFP-LD are fully suppressed due to high injected input power, in the WL case, the injection power is gradually decreased as if the SMFP-LD's self-locked mode is still maintained. It was observed that the output waveform's rising edge, taken at the self-locked mode's wavelength after the filter, in the WL case is clean at speed of 12 Gb/s compared to the blur and noisy rising edge in the FL case even at much lower speed (1 Gb/s). In summary, the WL technique shows advantages compared to the conventional FL technique in terms of lower injection power and higher on/off switching speed.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2331257","MKE; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838968","Weak-lock;full-lock;single-mode FP-LD;optical on/off switch","Optical switches;Optical wavelength conversion;Logic gates;Laser beams;Measurement by laser beam;High-speed optical techniques","","","","20","OAPA","18 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Decreased circulating leukocytes observed during and after space flight infer suppressed immune responses and susceptibility to infection. The microgravity aspect of the space environment has been simulated on Earth to study adverse biological effects in astronauts. In this report, the hindlimb unloading (HU) model was employed to investigate the combined effects of solar particle event-like proton radiation and simulated microgravity on immune cell parameters, including lymphocyte subtype populations and activity. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell critical for adaptive immune responses and T lymphocytes are regulators of cell-mediated immunity, controlling the entire immune response. Mice were suspended prior to and after proton radiation exposure (0 or 2 Gy doses) and total leukocyte numbers and splenic lymphocyte functionality were evaluated on days 4 or 21 after combined HU and radiation exposure. Total white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte, neutrophil and monocyte counts are reduced by ∼65, 70, 55 and 70%, respectively, compared with the non-treated control group 4 days after combined exposure. Splenic lymphocyte subpopulations are altered at both time points investigated. At 21 days post-exposure to combined HU and proton radiation, T-cell activation and proliferation were assessed in isolated lymphocytes. Cell surface expression of the Early Activation Marker, CD69, is decreased by 30% in the combined treatment group, compared with the non-treated control group and cell proliferation was suppressed by ∼50%, compared with the non-treated control group. These findings reveal that the combined stressors (HU and proton radiation exposure) induce decreased leukocyte numbers and function, contributing to immune system dysfunction in crew members.This research was supported by the NIH Training Grant 2T32CAO9677 and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) Center of Acute Radiation Research (CARR) grant.

The significance is that studies of biological effects of ELF field exposure on cell cultures involved magnetic fields ranging from 0.1 μT to 50 μT. The inconsistency or variability of in vitro laboratory data prompted many to declare that there was no compelling evidence that biological effects are causally related to ELF magnetic-field exposure. Most in vitro investigations involving cell cultures in the laboratory were unaware of and therefore did not account for the large variations in background static and ELF magnetic fields in cell-culture incubators. Given the potential confounding of unspecified incubator fields, it seems only reasonable to reassess the data and reevaluate the validity of any conclusions to date, positive or negative. Are we back to square one? In some sense, it may be so: the reported background static and ELF magnetic-field variations in cell-culture incubators could be a game changer.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2014.7909944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7909944","","Magnetic fields;Ground penetrating radar;Geophysical measurement techniques;Biology;Magnetic field measurement;Pediatrics;In vitro","","","","","","7 Jul 2017","","","URSI","URSI Journals"
"Crystal Storage and Transfer in Basaltic Systems: the Skuggafjöll Eruption, Iceland","D. A. Neave; J. Maclennan; M. E. Hartley; M. Edmonds; T.

We carried out a detailed petrological and geochemical study on a highly plagioclase-phyric eruption within the Eastern Volcanic Zone of Iceland—the Skuggafjöll eruption—to investigate crystal storage and transport processes within a single magmatic system. Crystal content and phase proportions vary between samples: the least phyric samples have phase proportions similar to the low-pressure, three-phase gabbro eutectic (plg:cpx:ol ∼ 11:6:3), whereas highly phyric samples are strongly enriched in plagioclase (plg:cpx:ol ∼ 8:1:1). Statistically significant geochemical variability in 28 whole-rock samples collected across the eruption can be accounted for by variable accumulation of a troctolitic assemblage containing plagioclase and olivine in an approximately 9:1 ratio. Two macrocryst assemblages are defined using compositional and textural information recorded in QEMSCAN® images: a primitive assemblage of high-anorthite plagioclase (An>83) and high-forsterite olivine (Fo>84), and an evolved assemblage of low-anorthite plagioclase (An<79), low-forsterite olivine (Fo<82) and clinopyroxene (Mg# ∼ 82). Plagioclase and olivine have strongly bimodal composition distributions whereas the composition distribution of clinopyroxene is unimodal. The mean trace element composition of melt inclusions hosted within high-forsterite olivine and high-anorthite plagioclase macrocrysts is the same (mean Ce/Y ∼ 0·47–0·48), confirming that both primitive macrocryst phases crystallized from the same distribution of melts. Clinopyroxene macrocrysts and matrix glasses are in Ce/Yb equilibrium with each other, indicating that the evolved assemblage crystallized from melts with a more incompatible trace element-enriched composition (mean Ce/Y ∼ 0·65–71) than the primitive assemblage. Variability in whole-rock, macrocryst and melt inclusion compositions suggests that the Skuggafjöll magma experienced two stages of crystallization. Primitive macrocrysts crystallized first from incompatible trace element-depleted melts within a shallow crustal magma reservoir. These primitive macrocrysts were subsequently stored in crystal mushes that ultimately disaggregated into an evolved and incompatible trace element-enriched magma from which the evolved assemblage crystallized. On average, ∼17% of the erupted magma at Skuggafjöll is composed of accumulated macrocrysts entrained from crystal mushes. The timescale between mush disaggregation and eruption, during which crystal accumulation occurred, was short—of the order of years—according to simple diffusion calculations. Striking petrological similarities between Skuggafjöll and other highly phyric eruptions both in Iceland and along mid-ocean ridges indicate that crystal accumulation by mush disaggregation is likely to be an important mechanism for generating highly phyric magmas in basaltic plumbing systems.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egu058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8183278","mush disaggregation;magma reservoir;Iceland;plagioclase;basalt","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The possible cognitive and behavioral consequences induced by low-dose radiation are of great concern as humans are exposed to ionizing radiations from various sources including medical diagnosis . A recent study in mice reported early transcriptional response in brain to low-dose X-rays (0.10 Gy) suggesting alterations of molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and AD. The present study is to investigate the late pathological, cognitive and behavioral consequences induced by low-dose radiation.Materials and methods: C57BL/6J mice were total-body irradiated with an acute dose from X-rays (0.10 Gy) or carbon ions (0.05 or 0.10 Gy). The hippocampus was collected and the expression of 84 AD-related genes was analyzed. Morris water maze test was applied to the measurement of the learning ability and memory of the animals. Amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography were performed to detect the accumulation of fibrillary amyloid β peptide (Aβ), and characteristic pathologies of AD were examined with immunohistochemical staining of amyloid precursor protein (APP), Aβ, tau, and phosphorylated tau.Results: For the transcriptional studies, results showed that a few genes out of 84 AD-related genes were significantly up-regulated at 4 h after irradiation and the other genes had no marked change; on the other hand, a few other genes showed a significant down-regulation, while the other genes had no marked change at 1 year after irradiation. For the behavioral studies, no significant difference on learning ability and memory was observed at 1 and 2 years after irradiation. Imaging and immunohistochemical staining showed no change in the accumulation of fibrillar amyloid and the expression of APP, Aβ, tau and phosphorylated tau were detectable in the animals 4 months and 2 years after irradiation.Conclusion: These findings suggest that total-body irradiation at a dose of 0.10 Gy could hardly induce significant early or late transcriptional alterations in most of the AD-related genes in the hippocampus, learning disability and memory impairment, and AD-like pathological change in the brain in mice .","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206901","total-body irradiation;low dose;Alzheimer's disease;Morris water maze test;Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis;mice","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

High-energy heavy ions in the galactic cosmic radiation can produce qualitative and quantitative differences in biological effects when compared with sparsely ionizing radiations. Mutations are induced by charged particle exposure and are integral to the formation and/or progression of human cancers. Most cancer-associated mutations occur on autosomal chromosomes, and most solid cancers occur in epithelial tissues. Here, a combined in vitro/in vivo approach was used to evaluate cell killing and the induction of mutations at a model autosomal locus, Aprt, in mouse kidney epithelium. For in vitro exposures, Aprt heterozygous kidney cells (clones 1a, 4a or 6a) were used from C57BL/6×DBA/2 mice. Additional experiments were performed using whole body irradiation of mice with the same genotype. Both males and females were irradiated in approximately equal numbers. Irradiations were performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratories at Brookhaven National Laboratory. For in vitro studies, cells from primary kidney clones were irradiated and seeded at limiting dilution immediately post-irradiation to determine the toxicity of the treatment. The irradiated kidney cells were also seeded in mutation assays within 1 week post-irradiation to determine the Aprt mutant fraction at the earliest time post-exposure. This work was complemented by studies wherein mice were exposed to the same ions with kidneys harvested several months post-irradiation to determine the residual toxicity and the Aprt mutant fraction. Our previous studies focused on sparsely ionizing 1 GeV protons (LET = 0.24 keV/µm) and densely ionizing 1 GeV/amu Fe ions (LET = 151 keV/µm). Our most recent studies have included work with Si ions (240 MeV/amu for in vitro studies, LET = 78 keV/µm; 263 MeV/amu initial energy for in vivo studies to achieve 78 keV/µm near the midline of the animal) and O ions (250 MeV/amu in vitro studies only, LET = 25 keV/µm). Toxicity for the cultured kidney cells in vitro follows this pattern: Fe > Si > O > protons when the results are expressed per unit dose. D0 values were 92 cGy for Fe ions, 103 cGy for Si ions, 192 cGy for O ions and 340 cGy for protons. With regard to the induction of Aprt mutations, Fe ions were more mutagenic than protons. Si ions were also quite mutagenic with evidence for a linear dose–response for Aprt mutations in kidney cells exposed in vitro or in kidneys harvested from mice irradiated several months earlier. These results are consistent with the linear dose–response data obtained previously for Aprt mutation induction following Fe ion exposure in vitro or in vivo, but the results for Si ions differ from the curvilinear dose–response data we recently published following similar exposures to energetic protons [, ]. Our most recent studies examined the molecular characteristics of Si ion-induced Aprt mutants following in vitro exposure. A dose of 160 cGy was used to collect 58 Aprt kidney cell mutants. Mutational events were classified as follows based on PCR-based analyses of polymorphic markers along mouse chromosome 8: intragenic events, apparent mitotic recombination, interstitial deletions of Aprt only, multilocus deletions, discontinuous loss of heterozygosity or whole chromosome loss. The results for this group of mutants will be compared against our previous studies on Aprt mutants arising after exposure to sparsely ionizing 1 GeV protons or densely ionizing 1 GeV/amu Fe ions. Additional studies are ongoing to define mutational spectra following Si ion exposure to kidney epithelium in vivo.Clinical Trial Registration number: not applicable.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206903","charged particles;heavy ions;mutation;cell killing;epithelium","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These changes in neuronal function are similar to those seen in ageing [, ]. Although there is some recovery of function after exposure to 56Fe particles, particularly in changes observed 36 h following irradiation, long-term changes (75 days) have been observed, suggesting subcellular damage. Consequently, oxidative stress and inflammation induced by radiation could affect downstream events, such as changes in behavior and gene expression. Therefore, berry fruits high in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, such as blueberries and strawberries, may prevent the occurrence of neurochemical and behavioral changes that occur if fed prior to radiation .Rats were exposed to 56Fe (1000 MeV/n; 1.5 Gy) particles at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory; other rats served as non-irradiated controls. The animals were fed either a control or a 2% blueberry or strawberry diet 8 weeks prior to radiation. Rats were then either euthanized at 36 h (short term) or 30 days following irradiation (long term). Before and after the irradiation, the animals were housed at USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, Boston.The results of the experiments indicate that: (1) 56Fe exposure caused significant differential, neurochemical changes in critical regions of the brain, such as hippocampus, striatum, frontal cortex and cerebellum, particularly long term. (2) Neurochemical changes resulted in the disruption of autophagy, increased inflammation and increased oxidative stress protein markers. (3) Antioxidant-rich berry diets significantly reduced the accumulation of toxic cellular debris in critical regions of the brain, primarily at the 30 days post-irradiation time-point. (4) Susceptibility to inflammation, autophagy dysregulation, and oxidative stress were proportional to the levels of antioxidant enzymes in the respective brain regions. (5) Exposure to 56Fe radiation may cause the accumulation of disease-related proteins such as PHF-Tau, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Irradiation with 56Fe, which causes substantial build-up of toxic cellular debris in critical regions of the brain, may overwhelm the innate antioxidant enzyme defense system . Therefore, berry diets high in antioxidants may be used to counter these damaging effects by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and activating neuronal housekeeping, in addition to boosting endogenous antioxidant enzymes.This paper was presented at the NASA Session at Heavy Ion in Therapy and Space Radiation Symposium 2013.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrt155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206867","neurochemical;autophagy;irradiation;oxidative stress;inflammation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2306328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6740844","Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP);Efficient XML Interchange (EXI);network architecture;sensor system integration;service functions and management;Smart Cities;testbed and trials;6lowPAN","Urban areas;Smart buildings;Monitoring;Smart homes;Business;IEEE 802.15 Standards","","4345","","36","OAPA","14 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mmW bands offer orders of magnitude greater spectrum than current cellular allocations and enable very high-dimensional antenna arrays for further gains via beamforming and spatial multiplexing. This paper uses recent real-world measurements at 28 and 73 GHz in New York, NY, USA, to derive detailed spatial statistical models of the channels and uses these models to provide a realistic assessment of mmW micro- and picocellular networks in a dense urban deployment. Statistical models are derived for key channel parameters, including the path loss, number of spatial clusters, angular dispersion, and outage. It is found that, even in highly non-line-of-sight environments, strong signals can be detected 100–200 m from potential cell sites, potentially with multiple clusters to support spatial multiplexing. Moreover, a system simulation based on the models predicts that mmW systems can offer an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks with no increase in cell density from current urban deployments.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2328154","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1116589,1237821); Samsung; Nokia Siemens Networks; InterDigital Communications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6834753","Millimeter wave radio;3GPP LTE;cellular systems;wireless propagation;28 GHz;73 GHz;urban deployments","Power measurement;Antenna measurements;Standards;Clustering algorithms;Gain;Delays;Mobile communication","","1959","","68","OAPA","13 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper surveys measurements and capacity studies to assess this technology with a focus on small cell deployments in urban environments. The conclusions are extremely encouraging; measurements in New York City at 28 and 73 GHz demonstrate that, even in an urban canyon environment, significant non-line-of-sight (NLOS) outdoor, street-level coverage is possible up to approximately 200 m from a potential low-power microcell or picocell base station. In addition, based on statistical channel models from these measurements, it is shown that mmW systems can offer more than an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks at current cell densities. Cellular systems, however, will need to be significantly redesigned to fully achieve these gains. Specifically, the requirement of highly directional and adaptive transmissions, directional isolation between links, and significant possibilities of outage have strong implications on multiple access, channel structure, synchronization, and receiver design. To address these challenges, the paper discusses how various technologies including adaptive beamforming, multihop relaying, heterogeneous network architectures, and carrier aggregation can be leveraged in the mmW context.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2299397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6732923","Cellular systems;channel models;millimeter-wave radio;urban deployments;wireless propagation;28 GHz;3GPP LTE;73 GHz","Millimeter wave communication;Bandwidth;Antennas;Shadow mapping;Atmospheric measurements;Radio spectrum management;Cellular networks","","1945","211","110","OAPA","5 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346248","Austrian Science Fund (J 3437-N15) the Air Force Research Laboratory and DARPA(grant numbers:FA8750-12-C-0300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876017","Sets;set visualization;sets intersections;set attributes;set relationships;multidimensional data","Data visualization;Visualization;Power generation;Sorting;Information analysis","Computer Graphics;Databases, Factual;Informatics","1503","","29","OAPA","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This motivates the proposal of an emerging wireless communications concept conceived for single-radio-frequency (RF) large-scale MIMO communications, which is termed as SM. The concept of SM has established itself as a beneficial transmission paradigm, subsuming numerous members of the MIMO system family. The research of SM has reached sufficient maturity to motivate its comparison to state-of-the-art MIMO communications, as well as to inspire its application to other emerging wireless systems such as relay-aided, cooperative, small-cell, optical wireless, and power-efficient communications. Furthermore, it has received sufficient research attention to be implemented in testbeds, and it holds the promise of stimulating further vigorous interdisciplinary research in the years to come. This tutorial paper is intended to offer a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey on SM–MIMO research, to provide a critical appraisal of its potential advantages, and to promote the discussion of its beneficial application areas and their research challenges leading to the analysis of the technological issues associated with the implementation of SM–MIMO.

A good tracker should perform well in a large number of videos involving illumination changes, occlusion, clutter, camera motion, low contrast, specularities, and at least six more aspects. However, the performance of proposed trackers have been evaluated typically on less than ten videos, or on the special purpose datasets. In this paper, we aim to evaluate trackers systematically and experimentally on 315 video fragments covering above aspects. We selected a set of nineteen trackers to include a wide variety of algorithms often cited in literature, supplemented with trackers appearing in 2010 and 2011 for which the code was publicly available. We demonstrate that trackers can be evaluated objectively by survival curves, Kaplan Meier statistics, and Grubs testing.

However, the most computationally expensive part of many computer vision and machine learning algorithms consists of finding nearest neighbor matches to high dimensional vectors that represent the training data. We propose new algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor matching and evaluate and compare them with previous algorithms. For matching high dimensional features, we find two algorithms to be the most efficient: the randomized k-d forest and a new algorithm proposed in this paper, the priority search k-means tree. We also propose a new algorithm for matching binary features by searching multiple hierarchical clustering trees and show it outperforms methods typically used in the literature. We show that the optimal nearest neighbor algorithm and its parameters depend on the data set characteristics and describe an automated configuration procedure for finding the best algorithm to search a particular data set. In order to scale to very large data sets that would otherwise not fit in the memory of a single machine, we propose a distributed nearest neighbor matching framework that can be used with any of the algorithms described in the paper.

In particular, their main goal is to categorize data into clusters such that objects are grouped in the same cluster when they are similar according to specific metrics. There is a vast body of knowledge in the area of clustering and there has been attempts to analyze and categorize them for a larger number of applications. However, one of the major issues in using clustering algorithms for big data that causes confusion amongst practitioners is the lack of consensus in the definition of their properties as well as a lack of formal categorization. With the intention of alleviating these problems, this paper introduces concepts and algorithms related to clustering, a concise survey of existing (clustering) algorithms as well as providing a comparison, both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. From a theoretical perspective, we developed a categorizing framework based on the main properties pointed out in previous studies. Empirically, we conducted extensive experiments where we compared the most representative algorithm from each of the categories using a large number of real (big) data sets. The effectiveness of the candidate clustering algorithms is measured through a number of internal and external validity metrics, stability, runtime, and scalability tests. In addition, we highlighted the set of clustering algorithms that are the best performing for big data.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2330519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832486","Clustering algorithms;unsupervised learning;big data","Clustering algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Big data;Clustering methods;Neural networks;Taxonomies","","749","","40","OAPA","12 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A method of deriving the impedance ratios for the different inverters is proposed by means of the nodal admittance matrix.

Simulations are executed to evaluate some of the proposed planners and highlight some of the implementation details that are often left unspecified. An emphasis is placed on contemporary research directions in this field. We address planners that tackle current issues in robotics. For instance, real-life kinodynamic planning, optimal planning, replanning in dynamic environments, and planning under uncertainty are discussed.

When these products include sophisticated electronics encased in 3D packaging with complex geometries and intricate detail, TTM can be compromised—resulting in lost opportunity. The use of advanced 3D printing technology enhanced with component placement and electrical interconnect deposition can provide electronic prototypes that now can be rapidly fabricated in comparable time frames as traditional 2D bread-boarded prototypes; however, these 3D prototypes include the advantage of being embedded within more appropriate shapes in order to authentically prototype products earlier in the development cycle. The fabrication freedom offered by 3D printing techniques, such as stereolithography and fused deposition modeling have recently been explored in the context of 3D electronics integration—referred to as 3D structural electronics or 3D printed electronics. Enhanced 3D printing may eventually be employed to manufacture end-use parts and thus offer unit-level customization with local manufacturing; however, until the materials and dimensional accuracies improve (an eventuality), 3D printing technologies can be employed to reduce development times by providing advanced geometrically appropriate electronic prototypes.

With the increasing popularity of digital slide scanners, decision support systems based on the analysis of digital pathology images are in high demand. However, computerized decision support systems are fraught with problems that stem from color variations in tissue appearance due to variation in tissue preparation, variation in stain reactivity from different manufacturers/batches, user or protocol variation, and the use of scanners from different manufacturers. In this paper, we present a novel approach to stain normalization in histopathology images. The method is based on nonlinear mapping of a source image to a target image using a representation derived from color deconvolution. Color deconvolution is a method to obtain stain concentration values when the stain matrix, describing how the color is affected by the stain concentration, is given. Rather than relying on standard stain matrices, which may be inappropriate for a given image, we propose the use of a color-based classifier that incorporates a novel stain color descriptor to calculate image-specific stain matrix. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed stain matrix estimation and stain normalization methods, they are applied to the problem of tumor segmentation in breast histopathology images. The experimental results suggest that the paradigm of color normalization, as a preprocessing step, can significantly help histological image analysis algorithms to demonstrate stable performance which is insensitive to imaging conditions in general and scanner variations in particular.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2303294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727397","Histopathology images analysis;nonlinear mapping;principal color histograms (PCH);stain color descriptor (SCD);stain estimation;stain normalization","Image color analysis;Histograms;Deconvolution;Estimation;Image analysis;Licenses;Training","Breast;Coloring Agents;Esophagus;Female;Histocytochemistry;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Liver;Microscopy;Nonlinear Dynamics","414","","25","OAPA","28 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We study the asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE) in a framework, where the matrix size is large compared with the rank of the matrix to be recovered, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the low-rank piece stays constant. The AMSE-optimal choice of hard threshold, in the case of  $n$ -by- $n$  matrix in white noise of level  $\sigma $ , is simply  $(4/\sqrt {3}) \sqrt {n}\sigma \approx 2.309 \sqrt {n}\sigma $  when  $\sigma $  is known, or simply  $2.858\cdot y_{\mathrm{ med}}$  when  $\sigma $  is unknown, where  $y_{\mathrm{ med}}$  is the median empirical singular value. For nonsquare,  $m$  by  $n$  matrices with  $m \neq n$  the thresholding coefficients  $4/\sqrt {3}$  and 2.858 are replaced with different provided constants that depend on  $m/n$ . Asymptotically, this thresholding rule adapts to unknown rank and unknown noise level in an optimal manner: it is always better than hard thresholding at any other value, and is always better than ideal truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), which truncates at the true rank of the low-rank matrix we are trying to recover. Hard thresholding at the recommended value to recover an  $n$ -by- $n$  matrix of rank  $ r$  guarantees an AMSE at most  $3\, n r \sigma ^{2}$ . In comparison, the guarantees provided by TSVD, optimally tuned singular value soft thresholding and the best guarantee achievable by any shrinkage of the data singular values are  $5\, n r \sigma ^{2}$ ,  $6\, n r \sigma ^{2}$ , and  $2\, n r \sigma ^{2}$ , respectively. The recommended value for hard threshold also offers, among hard thresholds, the best possible AMSE guarantees for recovering matrices with bounded nuclear norm. Empirical evidence suggests that performance improvement over TSVD and other popular shrinkage rules can be substantial, for different noise distributions, even in relatively small  $n$ .","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2014.2323359","NSF DMS(grant numbers:0906812); William R. and Sara Hart Kimball Stanford Graduate Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846297","Singular values shrinkage;optimal threshold;low-rank matrix denoising;unique admissible;scree plot elbow truncation;quarter circle law;bulk edge","Noise level;Approximation methods;White noise;Noise reduction;Vectors;Information theory;Signal to noise ratio","","409","","34","OAPA","30 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An emerging research topic in data mining, known as privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM), has been extensively studied in recent years. The basic idea of PPDM is to modify the data in such a way so as to perform data mining algorithms effectively without compromising the security of sensitive information contained in the data. Current studies of PPDM mainly focus on how to reduce the privacy risk brought by data mining operations, while in fact, unwanted disclosure of sensitive information may also happen in the process of data collecting, data publishing, and information (i.e., the data mining results) delivering. In this paper, we view the privacy issues related to data mining from a wider perspective and investigate various approaches that can help to protect sensitive information. In particular, we identify four different types of users involved in data mining applications, namely, data provider, data collector, data miner, and decision maker. For each type of user, we discuss his privacy concerns and the methods that can be adopted to protect sensitive information. We briefly introduce the basics of related research topics, review state-of-the-art approaches, and present some preliminary thoughts on future research directions. Besides exploring the privacy-preserving approaches for each type of user, we also review the game theoretical approaches, which are proposed for analyzing the interactions among different users in a data mining scenario, each of whom has his own valuation on the sensitive information. By differentiating the responsibilities of different users with respect to security of sensitive information, we would like to provide some useful insights into the study of PPDM.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2362522","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371079,61273214,61271267,91338203); Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(grant numbers:20110002110060); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2013CB329105); Post-Doctoral Science Foundation Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6919256","data mining;sensitive information;privacypreserving data mining;anonymization;provenance;game theory;privacy auction;anti-tracking;Data mining;sensitive information;privacy-preserving data mining;anonymization;provenance;game theory;privacy auction;anti-tracking","Privacy;Data mining;Game theory;Tracking;Computer security;Data privacy;Algorithm design and analysis","","367","1","121","OAPA","9 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a hybrid between the modular multilevel converter, because of the presence of H-bridge cells, and the two-level converter, in the form of director switches in each arm. This converter is able to generate a multilevel ac voltage and since its stacks of cells consist of H-bridge cells instead of half-bridge cells, they are able to generate higher ac voltage than the dc terminal voltage. This allows the AAC to operate at an optimal point, called the “sweet spot,” where the ac and dc energy flows equal. The director switches in the AAC are responsible for alternating the conduction period of each arm, leading to a significant reduction in the number of cells in the stacks. Furthermore, the AAC can keep control of the current in the phase reactor even in case of a dc-side fault and support the ac grid, through a STATCOM mode. Simulation results and loss calculations are presented in this paper in order to support the claimed features of the AAC.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2282171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6623197","AC–DC power converters;emerging topologies;fault tolerance;HVDC transmission;multilevel converters;power system faults;STATCOM","Topology;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Mathematical model;Automatic voltage control;Power conversion","","347","4","21","IEEE","7 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each user is associated with a user-centric cluster of BSs; the central processor shares the user's data with the BSs in the cluster, which then cooperatively serve the user through joint beamforming. Under this setup, this paper investigates the user scheduling, BS clustering, and beamforming design problem from a network utility maximization perspective. Differing from previous works, this paper explicitly considers the per-BS backhaul capacity constraints. We formulate the network utility maximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models depending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over different user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS cluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the beamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, whereas in the latter case, the user-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user scheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints. In both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using the reweighted ℓ1-norm technique. This approximation allows us to reformulate the per-BS backhaul constraints into weighted per-BS power constraints and solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem through a generalized weighted minimum mean square error approach. This paper shows that the proposed dynamic clustering algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over existing naive clustering schemes. This paper also proposes two heuristic static clustering schemes that can already achieve a substantial portion of the gain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2362860","Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd., Ottawa, ON, Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920005","Cloud radio access network (C-RAN);network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);multi-point (CoMP);limited backhaul;user scheduling;base station clustering;beamforming;weighted sum rate;weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE);Cloud radio access network (C-RAN);network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);coordinated multi-point (CoMP);limited backhaul;user scheduling;base-station clustering;beamforming;weighted sum rate maximization;weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)","Array signal processing;Dynamic scheduling;Radio access networks;Downlink;Heuristic algorithms;Approximation methods;Cloud computing","","306","1","47","OAPA","13 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This path of technological evolution has naturally led to a critical issue that has only started to be addressed recently: the resistance of this rapidly emerging technology to external attacks and, in particular, to spoofing. Spoofing, referred to by the term presentation attack in current standards, is a purely biometric vulnerability that is not shared with other IT security solutions. It refers to the ability to fool a biometric system into recognizing an illegitimate user as a genuine one by means of presenting a synthetic forged version of the original biometric trait to the sensor. The entire biometric community, including researchers, developers, standardizing bodies, and vendors, has thrown itself into the challenging task of proposing and developing efficient protection methods against this threat.

The control accuracy is reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in clinical practice. The results showed that KRR, a nonparametric statistical learning method, outperformed the other methods.

DC/DC conversion at HV is required for interconnection of such HVdc schemes as well as to interface dc wind farms. Modular multilevel voltage source converters (VSCs), such as the modular multilevel converter (MMC) or the alternate arm converter (AAC), have been shown to incur significantly lower switching losses than previous two- or three-level VSCs. This paper presents a dc/ac/dc system using a transformer coupling two modular multilevel VSCs. In such a system, the capacitors occupy a large fraction of the volume of the cells but a significant reduction in volume can be achieved by raising the ac frequency. Using high frequency can also bring benefits to other passive components such as the transformer but also results in higher switching losses due to the higher number of waveform steps per second. This leads to a tradeoff between volume and losses which has been explored in this study and verified by simulation results with a transistor level model of 30-MW case study. The outcome of the study shows that a frequency of 350 Hz provides a significant improvement in volume but also a penalty in losses compared to 50 Hz.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2013.2292614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6675087","DC–DC power conversion;HVdc converters;HVdc transmission;multilevel converters","Valves;HVDC transmission;Capacitors;Topology;Power conversion;Switching loss","","282","","16","IEEE","25 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is particularly true for ac loss calculation since a sufficiently low ac loss value is imperative to make these materials attractive for commercialization. In recent years, a large variety of numerical models, which are based on different techniques and implementations, has been proposed by researchers around the world, with the purpose of being able to estimate ac losses in HTSs quickly and accurately. This paper presents a literature review of the methods for computing ac losses in HTS tapes, wires, and devices. Technical superconductors have a relatively complex geometry (filaments, which might be twisted or transposed, or layers) and consist of different materials.

Implementing this type of processor at a scale of 512 qubits and 1472 programmable interqubit couplers and operating at ~ 20 mK has required attention to a number of considerations that one may ignore at the smaller scale of a few dozen or so devices. Here, we discuss some of these considerations, and the delicate balance necessary for the construction of a practical processor that respects the demanding physical requirements imposed by a quantum algorithm. In particular, we will review some of the design tradeoffs at play in the floor planning of the physical layout, driven by the desire to have an algorithmically useful set of interqubit couplers, and the simultaneous need to embed programmable control circuitry into the processor fabric. In this context, we have developed a new ultralow-power embedded superconducting digital-to-analog flux converter (DAC) used to program the processor with zero static power dissipation, optimized to achieve maximum flux storage density per unit area. The 512 single-stage, 3520 two-stage, and 512 three-stage flux DACs are controlled with an XYZ addressing scheme requiring 56 wires. Our estimate of on-chip dissipated energy for worst-case reprogramming of the whole processor is ~ 65 fJ. Several chips based on this architecture have been fabricated and operated successfully at our facility, as well as two outside facilities (see, for example, the recent reporting by Jones).","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2014.2318294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802426","Computational physics;quantum computing;superconducting integrated circuits;Computational physics;quantum computing;superconducting integrated circuits","Couplers;Network architecture;Topology;Couplings;Hardware;Quantum processors;Annealing","","272","4","20","OAPA","18 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Parallel optics appears as a valid short-term solution. It is, however, not a viable solution in the long-term because of its complex optical packaging. Therefore, increasing effort is now put into the possibility of exploiting higher order modulation formats with increased spectral efficiency and reduced optical transceiver complexity. As these type of links are based on intensity modulation and direct detection, modulation formats relying on optical coherent detection can not be straight forwardly employed. As an alternative and more viable solution, this paper proposes the use of carrierless amplitude phase (CAP) in a novel multiband approach (MultiCAP) that achieves record spectral efficiency, increases tolerance towards dispersion and bandwidth limitations, and reduces the complexity of the transceiver. We report on numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations with capacity beyond 100 Gb/s transmission using a single externally modulated laser. In addition, an extensive comparison with conventional CAP is also provided. The reported experiment uses MultiCAP to achieve 102.4 Gb/s transmission, corresponding to a data payload of 95.2 Gb/s error free transmission by using a 7% forward error correction code.

Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","1007-0214","","10.1109/TST.2014.6787363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","smart grid;Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);security;energy-theft detection","Electricity;Companies;Smart grids;Security;Wide area networks;Power system reliability;Reliability","","254","9","","","15 Apr 2014","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

An aggregated model of renewable wind and solar power generation forecast is proposed to support the quantification of the operational reserve for day-ahead and real-time scheduling. Then, a droop control for power electronic converters connected to battery storage is developed and tested. Compared with the existing droop controls, it is distinguished in that the droop curves are set as a function of the storage state-of-charge (SOC) and can become asymmetric. The adaptation of the slopes ensures that the power output supports the terminal voltage while at the same keeping the SOC within a target range of desired operational reserve. This is shown to maintain the equilibrium of the microgrid's real-time supply and demand. The controls are implemented for the special case of a dc microgrid that is vertically integrated within a high-rise host building of an urban area. Previously untapped wind and solar power are harvested on the roof and sides of a tower, thereby supporting delivery to electric vehicles on the ground.

These features are derived from across the scientific time-series analysis literature, and include summaries of time series in terms of their correlation structure, distribution, entropy, stationarity, scaling properties, and fits to a range of time-series models. After computing thousands of features for each time series in a training set, those that are most informative of the class structure are selected using greedy forward feature selection with a linear classifier. The resulting feature-based classifiers automatically learn the differences between classes using a reduced number of time-series properties, and circumvent the need to calculate distances between time series. Representing time series in this way results in orders of magnitude of dimensionality reduction, allowing the method to perform well on very large data sets containing long time series or time series of different lengths. For many of the data sets studied, classification performance exceeded that of conventional instance-based classifiers, including one nearest neighbor classifiers using euclidean distances and dynamic time warping and, most importantly, the features selected provide an understanding of the properties of the data set, insight that can guide further scientific investigation.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2014.2316504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786425","Time-series analysis;classification;data mining","Time series analysis;Feature extraction;Time measurement;Data mining;Databases;Market research","","228","","42","CCBY","10 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, like any other optimization algorithm, the success of DE is highly dependent on the search operators and control parameters that are often decided a priori. The selection of the parameter values is itself a combinatorial optimization problem. Although a considerable number of investigations have been conducted with regards to parameter selection, it is known to be a tedious task. In this paper, a DE algorithm is proposed that uses a new mechanism to dynamically select the best performing combinations of parameters (amplification factor, crossover rate, and the population size) for a problem during the course of a single run. The performance of the algorithm is judged by solving three well known sets of optimization test problems (two constrained and one unconstrained). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only saves the computational time, but also shows better performance over the state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed mechanism can easily be applied to other population-based algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6600821","Constrained optimization;differential evolution;parameter selection;parameter adaptation;Constrained optimization;differential evolution (DE);parameter adaptation;parameter selection","Sociology;Statistics;Vectors;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Equations","","222","","52","OAPA","16 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our approach combines two computer vision techniques-shape-based fall characterization and a learning-based classifier to distinguish falls from other daily actions. Given a fall video clip, we extract curvature scale space (CSS) features of human silhouettes at each frame and represent the action by a bag of CSS words (BoCSS). Then, we utilize the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier to identify the BoCSS representation of a fall from those of other actions. In order to eliminate the sensitivity of ELM to its hyperparameters, we present a variable-length particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the number of hidden neurons, corresponding input weights, and biases of ELM. Using a low-cost Kinect depth camera, we build an action dataset that consists of six types of actions (falling, bending, sitting, squatting, walking, and lying) from ten subjects.

Specifically, this paper applies a layered architecture approach, traditionally used in communication networks, to molecular communication, decomposes complex molecular communication functionality into a set of manageable layers, identifies basic functionalities of each layer, and develops a descriptive model consisting of key components of the layer for each layer. This paper also discusses open research issues that need to be addressed at each layer. In addition, this paper provides an example design of targeted drug delivery, a nanomedical application, to illustrate how the layered architecture helps design an application of molecular communication. The primary contribution of this paper is to provide an in-depth architectural view of molecular communication.

Gas-fired generating units act as a link between the gas and electricity networks. The variability of wind power is, therefore, transferred to the gas network by influencing the gas demand for electricity generation. Operation of a GB integrated gas and electricity network considering the uncertainty in wind power forecast was investigated using three operational planning methods: deterministic, two-stage stochastic programming, and multistage stochastic programming. These methods were benchmarked against a perfect foresight model which has no uncertainty associated with the wind power forecast. In all the methods, thermal generators were controlled through an integrated unit commitment and economic dispatch algorithm that used mixed integer programming. The nonlinear characteristics of the gas network, including the gas flow along pipes and the operation of compressors, were taken into account and the resultant nonlinear problem was solved using successive linear programming. The operational strategies determined by the stochastic programming methods showed reductions of the operational costs compared to the solution of the deterministic method by almost 1%. Also, using the stochastic programming methods to schedule the thermal units was shown to make a better use of pumped storage plants to mitigate the variability and uncertainty of the net demand.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2013.2274818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589136","Integrated gas and electricity network;stochastic programming;wind power forecast uncertainty","Wind power generation;Wind forecasting;Electricity;Uncertainty;Stochastic processes;Programming;Compressors","","196","","29","CCBY","5 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each algorithm has specific input data requirements and makes certain assumptions that may or may not hold true in a particular fault location scenario. Without a detailed understanding of the principle of each fault-locating method, choosing the most suitable fault location algorithm can be a challenging task. This paper, therefore, presents the theory of one-ended (simple reactance, Takagi, modified Takagi, Eriksson, and Novosel et al.) and two-ended (synchronized, unsynchronized, and current-only) impedance-based fault location algorithms and demonstrates their application in locating real-world faults. The theory details the formulation and input data requirement of each fault-locating algorithm and evaluates the sensitivity of each to the following error sources: 1) load; 2) remote infeed; 3) fault resistance; 4) mutual coupling; 5) inaccurate line impedances; 6) DC offset and CT saturation; 7) three-terminal lines; and 8) tapped radial lines. From the theoretical analysis and field data testing, the following criteria are recommended for choosing the most suitable fault-locating algorithm: 1) data availability and 2) fault location application scenario. Another objective of this paper is to assess what additional information can be gleaned from waveforms recorded by intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) during a fault. Actual fault event data captured in utility networks is exploited to gain valuable feedback about the transmission network upstream from the IED device, and estimate the value of fault resistance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2323353","Electric Power Research Institute, Knoxville, TN, USA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814841","Fault location;impedance-measurement;intelligent electronic devices (IED);power system faults;power system reliability;transmission line measurements","Fault location;Algorithm design and analysis;Resistance;Impedance;Synchronization;Mutual coupling;Fault currents;Estimation;Transmission lines","","188","2","26","OAPA","13 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spectral clustering uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix associated to the network, it is computationally very efficient, and it works for any choice of weights. When using line admittances, it reveals the static internal connectivity structure of the underlying network, while using power flows highlights islands with minimal power flow disruption, and thus it naturally relates to controlled islanding.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive DE (ADE) algorithm with a new mutation strategy DE/lbest/1 and a two-level adaptive parameter control scheme. The DE/lbest/1 strategy is a variant of the greedy DE/best/1 strategy. However, the population is mutated under the guide of multiple locally best individuals in DE/lbest/1 instead of one globally best individual in DE/best/1. This strategy is beneficial to the balance between fast convergence and population diversity. The two-level adaptive parameter control scheme is implemented mainly in two steps. In the first step, the population-level parameters Fp and CRp for the whole population are adaptively controlled according to the optimization states, namely, the exploration state and the exploitation state in each generation. These optimization states are estimated by measuring the population distribution. Then, the individual-level parameters Fi and CRi for each individual are generated by adjusting the population-level parameters. The adjustment is based on considering the individual's fitness value and its distance from the globally best individual. This way, the parameters can be adapted to not only the overall state of the population but also the characteristics of different individuals. The performance of the proposed ADE is evaluated on a suite of benchmark functions. Experimental results show that ADE generally outperforms four state-of-the-art DE variants on different kinds of optimization problems. The effects of ADE components, parameter properties of ADE, search behavior of ADE, and parameter sensitivity of ADE are also studied. Finally, we investigate the capability of ADE for solving three real-world optimization problems.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2279211","National High-Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China(grant numbers:2013AA01A212); NSFC for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61125205); NSFC(grant numbers:61332002,61300044,61070004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6588590","Adaptive parameter control;differential evolution (DE);global optimization;Adaptive parameter control;differential evolution (DE);global optimization","Sociology;Statistics;Vectors;Optimization;Convergence;Process control;Diversity reception","","183","","46","IEEE","5 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a framework where IoT can enhance public safety by crowd management via sensing services that are provided by smart phones equipped with various types of sensors. In order to ensure trustworthiness in the presented framework, we propose a reputation-based ${\bf S}^{\bf 2}{\bf aaS}$ scheme, namely, Trustworthy Sensing for Crowd Management (TSCM) for front-end access to the IoT. TSCM collects sensing data based on a cloud model and an auction procedure which selects mobile devices for particular sensing tasks and determines the payments to the users of the mobile devices that provide data. Performance evaluation of TSCM shows that the impact of malicious users in the crowdsourced data can be degraded by 75% while trustworthiness of a malicious user converges to a value below 40% following few auctions. Moreover, we show that TSCM can enhance the utility of the public safety authority up to 85%.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2337886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6851843","Auction theory;cloud computing;crowd management;Internet of Things (IoT);public safety;Sensing-as-a-Service ( ${\rm S}^2{\rm aaS}$ );smart phone sensing;social networking","Safety;Social network services;Cloud computing;Clouds;Intelligent sensors;Smart phones","","182","","32","OAPA","10 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

GaN has electron mobility comparable with silicon, but with a bandgap that is three times larger, making it an excellent candidate for high-power applications and high-temperature operation. The ability to form thin-AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, which exhibit the 2-D electron gas phenomenon leads to high-electron mobility transistors, which exhibit high Johnson's figure of merit. Another interesting direction for GaN research, which is largely unexplored, is GaN-based micromechanical devices or GaN microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). To fully unlock the potential of GaN and realize new advanced all-GaN integrated circuits, it is essential to cointegrate passive devices (such as resonators and filters), sensors (such as temperature and gas sensors), and other more than Moore functional devices with GaN active electronics. Therefore, there is a growing interest in the use of GaN as a mechanical material.

Polynomial regression is studied as the benchmark parametric model, and issues associated with this technique are discussed. We then introduce the locally weighted polynomial regression method, and show its advantages over the polynomial regression. Also, the spline regression method is examined to achieve more flexibility for fitting the power curve. Finally, we develop a penalized spline regression model to address the issues of choosing the number and location of knots in the spline regression.

Based on such self-organization rule and taking realistic resource allocation constraints into account, we also propose two novel resource allocation algorithms, being autonomous and coordinated, respectively. Performance of the proposed self-organization rule and resource allocation algorithms are evaluated using system-level simulations, and show that power efficiency is not necessarily in conflict with capacity improvements at the network level.

Over the past several decades, many albedo products are generated from remote-sensing data sets. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/Albedo algorithm is used to routinely produce eight day (16-day composite), 1-km resolution MODIS albedo products. When some natural processes or human activities occur, the land-surface broadband albedo can change rapidly, so it is necessary to enhance the temporal resolution of albedo product. We present a direct-estimation algorithm for mapping daily land-surface broadband albedo from MODIS data. The polarization and directionality of the Earth's reflectance-3/polarization and anisotropy of reflectances for atmospheric sciences coupled with observations from a Lidar BRDF database is employed as a training data set, and the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer code is used to simulate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectances. Then a relationship between TOA reflectances and land-surface broadband albedos is developed using an angular bin regression method. The robustness of this method for different angular bins, aerosol conditions, and land-cover types is analyzed. Simulation results show that the absolute error of this algorithm is ${\sim}{0.009}$ for vegetation, 0.012 for soil, and 0.030 for snow/ice. Validation of the direct-estimation algorithm against in situ measurement data shows that the proposed method is capable of characterizing the temporal variation of albedo, especially when the land-surface BRDF changes rapidly.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2245670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514500","Angular bin regression;direct-estimation algorithm;land-surface broadband albedo;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);polarization and directionality of the Earth's reflectance (POLDER) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) database","","","156","","43","IEEE","7 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the vector of each pixel constructed by computing the values between the referenced pixel and the adjacent pixels with diverse distances from different directions, the vector representation of the referenced pixel is generated to provide the 1D structure of micropatterns. With the devise of pairwise direction of vector for each pixel, the LVP reduces the feature length via comparative space transform to encode various spatial surrounding relationships between the referenced pixel and its neighborhood pixels. Besides, the concatenation of LVPs is compacted to produce more distinctive features. To effectively extract more detailed discriminative information in a given subregion, the vector of LVP is refined by varying local derivative directions from the  \(n\) th-order LVP in  \((n-1)\) th-order derivative space, which is a much more resilient structure of micropatterns than standard local pattern descriptors. The proposed LVP is compared with the existing local pattern descriptors including local binary pattern (LBP), local derivative pattern (LDP), and local tetra pattern (LTrP) to evaluate the performances from input grayscale face images. In addition, extensive experiments conducting on benchmark face image databases, FERET, CAS-PEAL, CMU-PIE, Extended Yale B, and LFW, demonstrate that the proposed LVP in high-order derivative space indeed performs much better than LBP, LDP, and LTrP in face recognition.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2014.2321495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6809981","Local pattern descriptors;local binary pattern (LBP);local derivative pattern (LDP);local tetra pattern (LTrP);local vector pattern (LVP);comparative space transform (CST);face recognition","Vectors;Feature extraction;Image coding;Face recognition;Face;Transforms;Encoding","","155","","37","OAPA","2 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our method takes as first step the extraction of the retina vascular tree using the graph cut technique. The blood vessel information is then used to estimate the location of the optic disk. The optic disk segmentation is performed using two alternative methods. The Markov random field (MRF) image reconstruction method segments the optic disk by removing vessels from the optic disk region, and the compensation factor method segments the optic disk using the prior local intensity knowledge of the vessels.

A cost-benefit analysis approach using the M-OPF model as the calculation engine is proposed to determine the preferred VSC-MTDC alternative to be installed in an existing ac transmission system. In this approach, the operational benefits of VSC–MTDC systems are evaluated against their investment costs to derive the benefit-to-cost ratios (BCR) which reflect the cost-effectiveness of the alternatives.

The results of the study show that VSC–MTDC systems might lead to a reduction in total operation cost, and the reduction of the total system transmission loss depends to a large extent on the VSC–MTDC configuration. The results from sensitivity analyses show that if the VSC loss could be reduced to a third of the original level, the total benefit from the system would be increased by about 70%.

Most currently fielded GPR-based landmine detection algorithms utilize feature extraction and statistical learning to develop robust classifiers capable of discriminating buried threats from inert subsurface structures. Analysis of these techniques indicates strong underlying similarities between efficient landmine detection algorithms and modern techniques for feature extraction in the computer vision literature. This paper explores the relationship between and application of one modern computer vision feature extraction technique, namely histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), to landmine detection in GPR data.

To do so, dedicated torque-vectoring (TV) controllers that allow optimal wheel torque distribution under all possible driving conditions have to be developed. Commonly, vehicle TV controllers are based on a hierarchical approach, consisting of a high-level supervisory controller that evaluates a corrective yaw moment and a low-level controller that defines the individual wheel torque reference values. The problem of the optimal individual wheel torque distribution for a particular driving condition can be solved through an optimization-based control-allocation (CA) algorithm, which must rely on the appropriate selection of the objective function. With a newly developed offline optimization procedure, this paper assesses the performance of alternative objective functions for the optimal wheel torque distribution of a four-wheel-drive (4WD) fully electric vehicle. Results show that objective functions based on the minimum tire slip criterion provide better control performance than functions based on energy efficiency.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2013.2289371","European Union through the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007¿2013)(grant numbers:284708); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6656947","Torque-vectoring control;Fully electric vehicle;Control allocation;Optimization;Control allocation (CA);fully electric vehicle;optimization;torque-vectoring (TV) control","Vehicles;TV;Torque;Wheels;Optimization;Tires;Linear programming","","151","","38","IEEE","6 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Other RRM aspects, such as radio resource utilization, fairness, complexity, and QoS, have not been given much attention. In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of the key challenges arising from HetNets and highlight their importance. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive survey of the RRM schemes that have been studied in recent years for LTE/LTE-A HetNets, with a particular focus on those for femtocells and relay nodes. Furthermore, we classify these RRM schemes according to their underlying approaches. In addition, these RRM schemes are qualitatively analyzed and compared to each other. We also identify a number of potential research directions for future RRM development.

"The Generalized TP Model Transformation for T–S Fuzzy Model Manipulation and Generalized Stability Verification","P. Baranyi","Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Computer and Automation Research Institute, Budapest, H-1111, Hungary",IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,"29 Jul 2014","2014","22","4","934","948","This paper integrates various ideas about the tensor product (TP) model transformation into one conceptual framework and formulates it in terms of the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model manipulation and control design framework. Several new extensions of the TP model transformation are proposed, such as the quasi and “full,” compact and rank-reduced higher order singular-value-decomposition-based canonical form of T–S fuzzy models, and the bilinear-, multi, pseudo-, convex-, partial TP model transformations. All of these extensions together form the generalized TP model transformation, which provides an effective tool to freely and readily manipulate the antecedent sets and rules of T–S fuzzy models and also provides main fuzzy rule component analysis, as well as a means for complexity and accuracy tradeoffs. It is demonstrated in this paper that the proposed manipulation forms a new, effective, and necessary optimization step of T–S fuzzy or polytopic models and linear-matrix-inequality-based control design, and can also decrease conservativeness. Identification techniques are typically constructed according to the available data and measurement set, as well as the type of system to be identified. As a result, they may not always provide good representations for control design frameworks. This paper demonstrates that the proposed TP model transformation is unique in that it bridges between various soft-computing-based identification techniques and T–S fuzzy model-based approaches. Finally, this paper proposes the multi-TP model transformation, which is a tractable and nonheuristic framework to verify the stability of the result of fuzzy or various soft-computing-based control designs. The multi-TP model transformation could provide an answer to the frequently emerging criticisms regarding the lack of mathematical stability verification techniques in the soft-computing-based control design. Control examples are provided in this paper.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2278982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583324","Complexity tradeoff;control optimization;parallel distributed compensation (PDC);stability verification;Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model;tensor product (TP) model transformation","Numerical models;Tensile stress;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Control design;Vectors;Stability analysis","","145","","84","OAPA","21 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since social learning is a key element of scalable education on MOOC and is done via online discussion forums, our main focus is on understanding forum activities. Two salient features of these activities drive our research: (1) high decline rate: for each course studied, the volume of discussion declined continuously throughout the duration of the course; (2) high-volume, noisy discussions: at least 30 percent of the courses produced new threads at rates that are infeasible for students or teaching staff to read through. Further, a substantial portion of these discussions are not directly course-related. In our analysis, we investigate factors that are associated with the decline of activity on MOOC forums, and we find effective strategies to classify threads and rank their relevance. Specifically, we first use linear regression models to analyze the forum activity count data over time, and make a number of observations; for instance, the teaching staff’s active participation in the discussions is correlated with an increase in the discussion volume but does not slow down the decline rate. We then propose a unified generative model for the discussion threads, which allows us both to choose efficient thread classifiers and to design an effective algorithm for ranking thread relevance. Further, our algorithm is compared against two baselines using human evaluation from Amazon Mechanical Turk.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2014.2337900","ARO(grant numbers:W911 NF-14-1-0190); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6851916","MOOC;social learning networks;data mining;regression;concept learning","Message systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Statistical analysis;Analytical models","","144","","34","IEEE","10 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although many community detection (CD) algorithms have been proposed, most of them were designed primarily for networks containing only positive links. Thus, it is important to design CD algorithms which can handle large-scale SNs. To this purpose, we first extend the original similarity to the signed similarity based on the social balance theory. Then, based on the signed similarity and the natural contradiction between positive and negative links, two objective functions are designed to model the problem of detecting communities in SNs as a multiobjective problem. Afterward, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called MEAsSN. In MEAs-SN, to overcome the defects of direct and indirect representations for communities, a direct and indirect combined representation is designed. Attributing to this representation, MEAs-SN can switch between different representations during the evolutionary process. As a result, MEAs-SN can benefit from both representations. Moreover, owing to this representation, MEAs-SN can also detect overlapping communities directly. In the experiments, both benchmark problems and large-scale synthetic networks generated by various parameter settings are used to validate the performance of MEAs-SN. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficacy of MEAs-SN on networks with 1000, 5000, and 10000 nodes and also in various noisy situations. A thorough comparison is also made between MEAs-SN and three existing algorithms, and the results show that MEAs-SN outperforms other algorithms.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2305974","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61103119,61271301); Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China(grant numbers:20130203110010); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:K5051202052); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755451","Community detection problems;direct representation;indirect representation;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;signed social networks;similarity;Community detection problems;direct representation;indirect representation;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;signed social networks;similarity","Communities;Decoding;Social network services;Time complexity;Vectors;Linear programming;Evolutionary computation","","139","","65","OAPA","4 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finite size data buffers are assumed to be available at every relay in order to avoid having to select concurrently the best source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links. A new max-ratio relay selection policy is proposed to optimize the secrecy transmission by considering all the possible source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links and selecting the relay having the link which maximizes the signal to eavesdropper channel gain ratio. Two cases are considered in terms of knowledge of the eavesdropper channel strengths: exact and average gains, respectively. Closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability for both cases are obtained, which are verified by simulations.

The proposed protocols do not follow the classic paradigm of exposing the full PUF responses or a transformation of them. Instead, random subsets of the PUF response strings are sent to the verifier so the exact position of the subset is obfuscated for the third-party channel observers. Authentication of the responses at the verifier side is done by matching the substring to the available full response string; the index of the matching point is the actual obfuscated secret (or key) and not the response substring itself. We perform a thorough analysis of resiliency of the protocols against various adversarial acts, including machine learning and statistical attacks.

Such patients are well suited to having their physiological condition monitored using low-power, minimally intrusive wearable sensors. Despite data-collection systems now being manufactured commercially, allowing physiological data to be acquired from mobile patients, little work has been undertaken on the use of the resultant data in a principled manner for robust patient care, including predictive monitoring. Most current devices generate so many false-positive alerts that devices cannot be used for routine clinical practice. This paper explores principled machine learning approaches to interpreting large quantities of continuously acquired, multivariate physiological data, using wearable patient monitors, where the goal is to provide early warning of serious physiological determination, such that a degree of predictive care may be provided. We adopt a one-class support vector machine formulation, proposing a formulation for determining the free parameters of the model using partial area under the ROC curve, a method arising from the unique requirements of performing online analysis with data from patient-worn sensors. There are few clinical evaluations of machine learning techniques in the literature, so we present results from a study at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust devised to investigate the large-scale clinical use of patient-worn sensors for predictive monitoring in a ward with a high incidence of patient mortality. We show that our system can combine routine manual observations made by clinical staff with the continuous data acquired from wearable sensors. Practical considerations and recommendations based on our experiences of this clinical study are discussed, in the context of a framework for personalized monitoring.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2013.2293059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6675775","E-health;novelty detection;personalized monitoring;predictive monitoring","Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Support vector machines;Manuals;Kernel;Wearable sensors;Hospitals","Clothing;Humans;Medical Informatics Applications;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Precision Medicine;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Support Vector Machine;Telemedicine","134","","32","OAPA","26 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The challenge was set to compare and evaluate current fetal ultrasound image segmentation methods. It consisted of automatically segmenting fetal anatomical structures to measure standard obstetric biometric parameters, from 2D fetal ultrasound images taken on fetuses at different gestational ages (21 weeks, 28 weeks, and 33 weeks) and with varying image quality to reflect data encountered in real clinical environments. Four independent sub-challenges were proposed, according to the objects of interest measured in clinical practice: abdomen, head, femur, and whole fetus. Five teams participated in the head sub-challenge and two teams in the femur sub-challenge, including one team who tackled both. Nobody attempted the abdomen and whole fetus sub-challenges. The challenge goals were two-fold and the participants were asked to submit the segmentation results as well as the measurements derived from the segmented objects. Extensive quantitative (region-based, distance-based, and Bland–Altman measurements) and qualitative evaluation was performed to compare the results from a representative selection of current methods submitted to the challenge. Several experts (three for the head sub-challenge and two for the femur sub-challenge), with different degrees of expertise, manually delineated the objects of interest to define the ground truth used within the evaluation framework. For the head sub-challenge, several groups produced results that could be potentially used in clinical settings, with comparable performance to manual delineations. The femur sub-challenge had inferior performance to the head sub-challenge due to the fact that it is a harder segmentation problem and that the techniques presented relied more on the femur's appearance.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2013.2276943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575204","Challenge;evaluation;fetal biometry;image quality;segmentation;ultrasound (US)","Image segmentation;Head;Ultrasonic imaging;Biomedical imaging;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Magnetic heads","Biometry;Female;Gestational Age;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Pregnancy;Ultrasonography, Prenatal","133","","53","IEEE","6 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies mainly focus on time division duplexing (TDD) systems, which are more amenable to practical implementations due to channel reciprocity. However, there are many frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems deployed worldwide. Consequently, it is of great importance to investigate the design and performance of FDD massive MIMO systems. To reduce the overhead of channel estimation in FDD systems, a two-stage precoding scheme was recently proposed to decompose the precoding procedure into intergroup precoding and intragroup precoding. The problem of user grouping and scheduling thus arises. In this paper, we first propose three novel similarity measures for user grouping based on weighted likelihood, subspace projection, and Fubini-Study, respectively, as well as two novel clustering methods, including hierarchical and K-medoids clustering. We then propose a dynamic user scheduling scheme to further enhance the system throughput once the user groups are formed. The load balancing problem is considered when few users are active and solved with an effective algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed schemes are validated with theoretical analysis and simulations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2353297","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1247955,CNS-1320664); Broadband Wireless Access and Applications Center, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888467","Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);frequency division duplexing (FDD);precoding;user grouping;load balancing","MIMO;Design methodology;Throughtput;Dynamic scheduling;Frequency conversion;Channel estimation;Clustering methods;Weight measurement;Costs;Finite difference methods;Time division multiplexing","","131","2","21","OAPA","29 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we investigate different classification strategies for individual and simultaneous movements based on pattern recognition of myoelectric signals. Our results suggest that any classifier can be potentially employed in the prediction of simultaneous movements if arranged in a distributed topology. On the other hand, classifiers inherently capable of simultaneous predictions, such as the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were found to be more cost effective, as they can be successfully employed in their simplest form. In the prediction of individual movements, the one-vs-one (OVO) topology was found to improve classification accuracy across different classifiers and it was therefore used to benchmark the benefits of simultaneous control. As opposed to previous work reporting only offline accuracy, the classification performance and the resulting controllability are evaluated in real time using the motion test and target achievement control (TAC) test, respectively. We propose a simultaneous classification strategy based on MLP that outperformed a top classifier for individual movements (LDA-OVO), thus improving the state-of-the-art classification approach.

Rather than focusing on either SE or EE separately, recent works have focused on the relationship between EE and SE and provided good insight into the joint EE–SE tradeoff. However, such works have assumed that the bandwidth was fully occupied regardless of the transmission requirements and therefore are only valid for this type of scenario. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for EE–SE tradeoff, namely the resource efficiency (RE) for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular network in which we take into consideration different transmission-bandwidth requirements. We analyse the properties of the proposed RE and prove that it is capable of exploiting the tradeoff between EE and SE by balancing consumption power and occupied bandwidth; hence simultaneously optimizing both EE and SE. We then formulate the generalized RE optimization problem with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) and provide a gradient based optimal power adaptation scheme to solve it. We also provide an upper bound near optimal method to jointly solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm based on a uniform power allocation scheme is proposed to reduce the complexity. Numerical results confirm the analytical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation schemes for efficient resource usage.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2316791","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/J021768/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787103","Green radio (GR);orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA);resource efficiency (RE);energy efficiency (EE);spectral efficiency (SE)","Bandwidth;Optimization;Resource management;Wireless communication;Downlink;Measurement;Quality of service","","130","","30","OAPA","11 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, D2D communications can also serve as a technology component for providing public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) and national security and public safety (NSPS) services. In the United States, for example, spectrum has been reserved in the 700-MHz band for an LTE-based public safety network. The key requirement for the evolving broadband PPDR and NSPS services capable systems is to provide access to cellular services when the infrastructure is available and to efficiently support local services even if a subset or all of the network nodes become dysfunctional due to public disaster or emergency situations. This paper reviews some of the key requirements, technology challenges, and solution approaches that must be in place in order to enable LTE networks and, in particular, D2D communications, to meet PPDR and NSPS-related requirements. In particular, we propose a clustering-procedure-based approach to the design of a system that integrates cellular and ad hoc operation modes depending on the availability of infrastructure nodes.

To this end, we present novel semantic level interoperability architecture for pervasive computing and IoTs. There are two main principles in the proposed architecture. First, information and capabilities of devices are represented with semantic web knowledge representation technologies and interaction with devices and the physical world is achieved by accessing and modifying their virtual representations. Second, global IoT is divided into numerous local smart spaces managed by a semantic information broker (SIB) that provides a means to monitor and update the virtual representation of the physical world. An integral part of the architecture is a resolution infrastructure that provides a means to resolve the network address of a SIB either using a physical object identifier as a pointer to information or by searching SIBs matching a specification represented with SPARQL. We present several reference implementations and applications that we have developed to evaluate the architecture in practice. The evaluation also includes performance studies that, together with the applications, demonstrate the suitability of the architecture to real-life IoT scenarios.

Method. We performed SLR based on the search of digital libraries. We implemented four second order mutation (SOM) strategies, in addition to first order mutation (FOM), and compared them from different perspectives. Results. Our SLR identified 17 relevant techniques (in 22 articles) and three categories of techniques: detecting (DEM); suggesting (SEM); and avoiding equivalent mutant generation (AEMG). The experiment indicated that SOM in general and JudyDiffOp strategy in particular provide the best results in the following areas: total number of mutants generated; the association between the type of mutation strategy and whether the generated mutants were equivalent or not; the number of not killed mutants; mutation testing time; time needed for manual classification. Conclusions . The results in the DEM category are still far from perfect. Thus, the SEM and AEMG categories have been developed.

To reduce expensive redesign steps, this control problem is generally addressed by minor incremental changes on top of consolidated solutions. A more systematic approach is hindered by a lack of rigorous design methodologies that allow estimating the impact of earlier design decisions on the final implementation. To achieve an optimal implementation that satisfies a set of requirements, we propose a platform-based methodology for electric power system design, which enables independent implementation of system topology (i.e., interconnection among elements) and control protocol by using a compositional approach. In our flow, design space exploration is carried out as a sequence of refinement steps from the initial specification toward a final implementation by mapping higher level behavioral and performance models into a set of either existing or virtual library components at the lower level of abstraction. Specifications are first expressed using the formalisms of linear temporal logic, signal temporal logic, and arithmetic constraints on Boolean variables. To reason about different requirements, we use specialized analysis and synthesis frameworks and formulate assume guarantee contracts at the articulation points in the design flow.

The rapid increase number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In this paper, the semantic link network model is used for organizing multimedia resources. A whole model for generating the association relation between multimedia resources using semantic link network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, and mechanisms of the semantic link network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the semantic link network and multimedia resources provides a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. The tags and the surrounding texts of multimedia resources are used to measure their semantic association.

This avoids additional preparations, such as physical sensor attachment or special clothing, which can be useful for certain healthcare applications. Furthermore, robustness of Doppler radar against environmental factors, such as light, ambient temperature, interference from other signals occupying the same bandwidth, fading effects, reduce environmental constraints and strengthens the possibility of employing Doppler radar in long-term respiration detection, and monitoring applications such as sleep studies. This paper presents an evaluation in the of use of microwave Doppler radar for capturing different dynamics of breathing patterns in addition to the respiration rate. Although finding the respiration rate is essential, identifying abnormal breathing patterns in real-time could be used to gain further insights into respiratory disorders and refine diagnostic procedures. Several known breathing disorders were professionally role played and captured in a real-time laboratory environment using a noncontact Doppler radar to evaluate the feasibility of this noncontact form of measurement in capturing breathing patterns under different conditions associated with certain breathing disorders. In addition to that, inhalation and exhalation flow patterns under different breathing scenarios were investigated to further support the feasibility of Doppler radar to accurately estimate the tidal volume. The results obtained for both experiments were compared with the gold standard measurement schemes, such as respiration belt and spirometry readings, yielding significant correlations with the Doppler radar-based information. In summary, Doppler radar is highlighted as an alternative approach not only for determining respiration rates, but also for identifying breathing patterns and tidal volumes as a preferred nonwearable alternative to the conventional contact sensing methods.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2365776","Australian Government through the ICT Centre of Excellence Program, National ICT Australia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942141","Breathing Patterns;Doppler Radar;Respiration Rate;Tidal Volume;Breathing patterns;Doppler radar;respiration rate;tidal volume","Doppler radar;Sleep apnea;Continuous wavelet transforms;Time-frequency analysis","","121","1","25","OAPA","31 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We investigate network related factors including the centralization versus distribution of clouds and the impact of demand, content popularity and access frequency on the clouds placement, and cloud capability factors including the number of servers, switches and routers and amount of storage required in each cloud. We study the optimization of three cloud services: cloud content delivery, storage as a service (StaaS), and virtual machines (VMS) placement for processing applications. First, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize cloud content delivery services. Our results indicate that replicating content into multiple clouds based on content popularity yields 43% total saving in power consumption compared to power un-aware centralized content delivery. Based on the model insights, we develop an energy efficient cloud content delivery heuristic, DEER-CD, with comparable power efficiency to the MILP results. Second, we extend the content delivery model to optimize StaaS applications. The results show that migrating content according to its access frequency yields up to 48% network power savings compared to serving content from a single central location. Third, we optimize the placement of VMs to minimize the total power consumption. Our results show that slicing the VMs into smaller VMs and placing them in proximity to their users saves 25% of the total power compared to a single virtualized cloud scenario. We also develop a heuristic for real time VM placement (DEER-VM) that achieves comparable power savings.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2014.2301450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6716972","Cloud computing;content delivery;energy consumption;IP/WDM;popularity;StaaS;virtual machines","IP networks;Power demand;WDM networks;Optical switches;Cloud computing;Energy efficiency;Servers","","114","","36","OAPA","20 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A wide spectrum of CF schemes has been proposed. However, most of them cannot deal with the cold-start problem that denotes a situation that social media sites fail to draw recommendation for new items, users or both. In addition, they regard that all ratings equally contribute to the social media recommendation. This supposition is against the fact that low-level ratings contribute little to suggesting items that are likely to be of interest of users. To this end, we propose bi-clustering and fusion (BiFu)-a newly-fashioned scheme for the cold-start problem based on the BiFu techniques under a cloud computing setting. To identify the rating sources for recommendation, it introduces the concepts of popular items and frequent raters. To reduce the dimensionality of the rating matrix, BiFu leverages the bi-clustering technique. To overcome the data sparsity and rating diversity, it employs the smoothing and fusion technique. Finally, BiFu recommends social media contents from both item and user clusters.

The reconstruction model is based on a low-rank plus sparse decomposition prior, which is related to robust principal component analysis. An algorithm is proposed to solve the convex optimization problem based on an alternating direction method of multipliers. The method is validated with numerical phantom simulations and cardiac MRI data against state of the art dynamic MRI reconstruction methods.

This paper presents a method that utilizes residuals from harmonic regression over years of Landsat data, in conjunction with statistical quality control charts, to signal subtle disturbances in vegetative cover. These charts are able to detect changes from both deforestation and subtler forest degradation and thinning. First, harmonic regression residuals are computed after fitting models to interannual training data. These residual time series are then subjected to Shewhart X-bar control charts and exponentially weighted moving average charts. The Shewhart X-bar charts are also utilized in the algorithm to generate a data-driven cloud filter, effectively removing clouds and cloud shadows on a location-specific basis. Disturbed pixels are indicated when the charts signal a deviation from data-driven control limits. The methods are applied to a collection of loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda) stands in Alabama, USA. The results are compared with stands for which known thinning has occurred at known times. The method yielded an overall accuracy of 85%, with the particular result that it provided afforestation/deforestation maps on a per-image basis, producing new maps with each successive incorporated image. These maps matched very well with observed changes in aerial photography over the test period. Accordingly, the method is highly recommended for on-the-fly change detection, for changes in both land use and land management within a given land use.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2272545","U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Cooperative Agreement with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech)(grant numbers:10-CA-11330145-158); Landsat Science Team under U.S. Geological Survey(grant numbers:G12PC00073); Pine Integrated Network: Education, Mitigation, and Adaptation Project (PINEMAP, Coordinated Agricultural Project funded in 2011 by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture)(grant numbers:VA-136614); McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research ProgramProject VA-136614; Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation at Virginia Tech.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573358","Degradation;statistical process control;thinning;trajectory;Degradation;statistical process control;thinning;trajectory","Satellites;Earth;Remote sensing;Harmonic analysis;Control charts;Time series analysis;Indexes","","109","","30","IEEE","2 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, the precise positioning of liquid-metal slugs is achieved using CEW actuation in conjunction with channels designed to minimize the liquid-metal surface energy at discrete locations. This approach leverages the high surface tension of liquid metal to control its resting position with submillimeter accuracy. The CEW actuation and fluidic channel design were optimized to create reconfigurable RF devices. In addition, solutions for the reliable actuation of a gallium-based, non-toxic liquid-metal alloy (Galinstan) are presented that mitigate the tendency of the alloy to form a surface oxide layer capable of wetting to the channel walls, inhibiting motion.

The proposed cooperative droop control is shown to include other controls as special cases, its performance is superior to the conventional droop control, and it is robust with respect to uncertain changes in both distribution network and sensing/communication network.

The methodology encompasses all GEO SAR mission concepts proposed to date. Important classifications of missions are: 1) those that require atmospheric phase compensation to achieve their design spatial resolution; and 2) those that achieve full spatial resolution without phase compensation. Means of estimating the atmospheric phase screen are noted, including a novel measurement of the mean rate of change of the atmospheric phase delay, which GEO SAR enables.

The radar antennas are intrinsically modeled using an equivalent set of infinitesimal electric dipoles and characteristic, frequency-dependent, global reflection, and transmission coefficients. These coefficients determine through a plane wave decomposition wave propagation between the radar reference plane, point sources, and field points. The interactions between the antenna and layered medium are thereby inherently accounted for. The fields are calculated using 3-D Green's functions. We validated the model using an ultrawideband frequency-domain radar with a transmitting and receiving Vivaldi antenna operating in the range 0.8-4 GHz. The antenna characteristic coefficients are obtained from near- and far-field measurements over a copper plane. The proposed model provides unprecedented accuracy for describing near-field radar measurements collected over a water layer, the frequency-dependent electrical properties of which were described using the Debye model.

We further propose an adaptive graph filter for semi-supervised classification that allows for classifying unlabeled as well as unseen signals and for correcting mislabeled signals. We validate the proposed framework on indirect bridge structural health monitoring and show that it performs significantly better than previous approaches.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2014.2313528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778068","Multiresolution classification;semi-supervised learning;discrete signal processing on graphs;adaptive graph filter;indirect bridge structural health monitoring","Feature extraction;Signal resolution;Bridges;Monitoring;Semisupervised learning;Signal processing algorithms;Image resolution","","101","","59","OAPA","25 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main contribution is the extension of particle swarm optimization (PSO) from the continuous domain to the binary or discrete domain. First, a novel bi-velocity strategy is developed to represent the possibilities of each dimension being 1 and 0. This strategy is suitable to describe the binary characteristic of the MRP, where 1 stands for a node being selected to construct the multicast tree, whereas 0 stands for being otherwise. Second, BVDPSO updates the velocity and position according to the learning mechanism of the original PSO in the continuous domain. This maintains the fast convergence speed and global search ability of the original PSO. Experiments are comprehensively conducted on all of the 58 instances with small, medium, and large scales in the Operation Research Library (OR-library). The results confirm that BVDPSO can obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions rapidly since it only needs to generate a few multicast trees. BVDPSO outperforms not only several state-of-the-art and recent heuristic algorithms for the MRP problems, but also algorithms based on genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and PSO.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2014.2314075","National High-Technology Research and Development Program (¿863¿ Program) of China(grant numbers:2013AA01A212); Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61332002); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:61125205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779598","Communication networks;multicast routing problem (MRP);particle swarm optimization (PSO);Steiner tree problem (STP)","Communication networks;Steiner trees;Routing;Particle swarm optimization;Multicast communication","","101","","35","OAPA","27 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A general trend in these medical devices is toward increased functional complexity, software programmability, and connectivity to body area networks (BANs). However, as IWMDs become more “intelligent,” they also become less trustworthy-less reliable and more prone to attacks. Various shortcomings-hardware failures, software errors, wireless attacks, malware and software exploits, and side-channel attacks-could undermine the trustworthiness of IWMDs and BANs. While these concerns have been recognized for some time, recent demonstrations of security attacks on commercial products, e.g., pacemakers and insulin pumps, have elevated medical device security from the realm of theoretical possibility to an immediate concern. The trustworthiness of IWMDs must be addressed aggressively and proactively due to the potential for catastrophic consequences. Conventional fault tolerance and information security solutions, e.g., redundancy and cryptography, that have been employed in general-purpose and embedded computing systems cannot be applied to many IWMDs due to their extreme size and power constraints and unique usage models. While several recent efforts address defense of IWMDs against specific security attacks, a holistic strategy that considers all concerns and types of threats is required. This paper discusses trustworthiness concerns in IWMDs and BANs through a comprehensive identification and analysis of potential threats and, for each threat, provides a discussion of the merits and inadequacies of current solutions.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2322103","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-0914787,CNS-1219570); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827202","Body area networks (BANs);medical devices;personal healthcare systems;privacy;reliability;security;Body area networks (BANs);medical devices;personal healthcare systems;privacy;reliability;security","Software engineering;Medical diagnostic imaging;Integrated circuit modeling;Medical services;Body area networks;Security;Biomedical monitoring","","99","","85","IEEE","6 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this study developed an educational robot-based learning system that provides an attractive teaching application that combines multimedia objects with an educational robot. This study examined the impact of the proposed learning system on student learning performance and motivation. The four-stage experimental procedure involved a pre-test, post-test, learning activities, and questionnaire survey. The participants comprised one homeroom teacher and 52 second-grade students from two classes at an elementary school in Taiwan. All of the students were assigned to use either the proposed learning system or a PowerPoint-based learning system. The pre-test and post-test results show that the proposed learning system improved student performance more than the PowerPoint-based learning system did. A questionnaire based on the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was employed to measure four motivational factors (attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction). The IMMS survey results show that satisfaction and relevance were the highest rated motivational factors among students who used the proposed learning system. The experimental results indicate that the students were motivated to use the educational robot-based learning system. Thus, using educational robot-based learning systems in classrooms demonstrates a significant advantage for students, by improving overall learning interest and motivation.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2014.2346756","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:NSC 102-2221-E-156-009,MOST-103-2622-E-027 -007-CC2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875949","Commercial robots and applications;computer-assisted instruction;educational technology;student motivation","Learning systems;Educational robots;Materials;Education;Multimedia communication;Speech processing","","98","","43","IEEE","11 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the highly anticipated key contributors of the big data in the future networks is the distributed wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Although the data generated by an individual sensor may not appear to be significant, the overall data generated across numerous sensors in the densely distributed WSNs can produce a significant portion of the big data. Energy-efficient big data gathering in the densely distributed sensor networks is, therefore, a challenging research area. One of the most effective solutions to address this challenge is to utilize the sink node's mobility to facilitate the data gathering. While this technique can reduce energy consumption of the sensor nodes, the use of mobile sink presents additional challenges such as determining the sink node's trajectory and cluster formation prior to data collection. In this paper, we propose a new mobile sink routing and data gathering method through network clustering based on modified expectation-maximization technique. In addition, we derive an optimal number of clusters to minimize the energy consumption. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified through numerical results.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2318177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800057","Big data;wireless sensor networks (WSNs);clustering;optimization;data gathering;energy efficiency","Clustering algorithms;Wireless sensor networks;Mobile communication;Information management;Data handling;Data storage systems;Energy consumption;Big data","","96","","26","OAPA","17 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This makes the channel spectrum heavily shared by various underwater acoustic systems. Nevertheless, the precious spectrum resource is still underutilized temporally and spatially in underwater environments. To efficiently utilize the spectrum while avoiding harmful interference with other acoustic systems, a smart UAN should be aware of the surrounding environment and reconfigure their operation parameters. Unfortunately, existing UAN designs have mainly focused on the single network scenario, and very few studies have considered the presence of nearby acoustic activities. In this paper, we advocate cognitive acoustic as a promising technique to develop an environment-friendly UAN with high spectrum utilization. However, underwater cognitive acoustic networks (UCANs) also pose grand challenges due to the unique features of underwater channel and acoustic systems.

In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of a prototype multispectral LiDAR system and demonstrate the measurement of leaf and bark area and abundance profiles using a series of experiments on tree samples “viewed from above” by tilting living conifers such that the apex is directed on the viewing axis. As the complete recovery of all structural and physiological parameters is ill posed with a restricted set of four wavelengths, we used leaf and bark spectra measured in the laboratory to constrain parameter inversion by an extended reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. However, we also show in a separate experiment how the multispectral LiDAR can recover directly a profile of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is verified against the laboratory spectral measurements. Our work shows the potential of multispectral LiDAR to recover both structural and physiological data and also highlights the fine spatial resolution that can be achieved with time-correlated single-photon counting.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2285942","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/H022414/1); Centre for Earth Observation and Instrumentation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6672004","Leaf area profile;leaf physiology;light detection and ranging (LiDAR);multispectral;parameter inversion;Leaf area profile;leaf physiology;light detection and ranging (LiDAR);multispectral;parameter inversion","Laser radar;Wavelength measurement;Optical imaging;Physiology;Vegetation;Optical sensors;Instruments","","91","","46","CCBY","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper demonstrates both qualitatively and quantitatively that not only physically based quantities are necessary to consistently and efficiently analyze these data sets but also the angular information of the acquisitions should not be neglected as it can provide unique features on the scenes being analyzed. The data set used is composed of 21 images acquired between 2002 and 2009 by QuickBird over the city of Denver, Colorado. The images were collected near the downtown area and include single family houses, skyscrapers, apartment complexes, industrial buildings, roads/highways, urban parks, and bodies of water. Experiments show that atmospheric and geometric properties of the acquisitions substantially affect the pixel values and, more specifically, that the raw counts are significantly correlated to the atmospheric visibility. Results of a 22-class urban land cover experiment show that an improvement of 0.374 in terms of Kappa coefficient can be achieved over the base case of raw pixels when surface reflectance values are combined to the angular decomposition of the time series.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2295819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737293","Angular decomposition;bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF);multiangular analysis;multitemporal analysis;optical very high spatial resolution;QuickBird (QB);surface anisotropy;surface reflectance;urban change detection;urban classification;WorldView-2;Angular decomposition;bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF);multiangular analysis;multitemporal analysis;optical very high spatial resolution;QuickBird (QB);surface anisotropy;surface reflectance;urban change detection;urban classification;WorldView-2","Sensors;Atmospheric measurements;Scattering;Geometry;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Time series analysis","","91","","58","OAPA","11 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The described solution includes thermal management of an UltraBattery bank, an inverter/charger, and smart grid management, which can monitor the state of charge (SoC) and the state of health (SoH) of the battery during system operation. With such features, it can allow the battery to operate within an optimum SoC window and thus can further maximize the longevity of the UltraBattery. Importantly, the smart battery management can trend the SoH of the battery and allow cell replacement at a convenient time without affecting the system operation. Furthermore, the advanced system package allows remote monitoring and control of operation, thus reducing the running cost of the system. It is clear that the widespread use of renewable-energy systems, in turn, would lead to a reduction in global consumption of the limited supplies of the fossil fuels and in the associated production of greenhouse-gas emissions.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2316823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6809148","Batteries;battery management systems;energy storage;power grids;smart grid;Batteries;battery management systems;energy storage;power grids;smart grid","Batteries;Lead acid batteries;Energy storage;Discharges (electric);Electrodes;Power grids;Smart grids;Battery management systems;Energy conversion","","90","","30","IEEE","1 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Contrary to past research efforts, our proposal is transparent and compatible both with the underlying low-layer protocols and diverse applications, and preserving energy-efficiency in the long run without sacrificing the QoI levels attained. In particular, we first introduce the novel concept of QoI-aware sensor-to-task relevancy to explicitly consider the sensing capabilities offered by a sensor to the IoT sensory environments, and QoI requirements required by a task. Second, we propose a novel concept of the critical covering set of any given task in selecting the sensors to service a task over time. Third, energy management decision is made dynamically at runtime, to reach the optimum for long-term application arrivals and departures under the constraint of their service delay. We show a case study to utilize sensors to perform environmental monitoring with a complete set of performance analysis. We further consider the signal propagation and processing latency into the proposal, and provide a thorough analysis on its impact on average measured delay probability.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2364915","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61300179); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6935003","Internet-of-Things;Energy Management;Quality-of-Information;Internet-of-Things;energy management;quality-of-information","Sensors;Energy management;Logic gates;Sensor fusion;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Internet of Things","","89","","34","OAPA","23 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, one critical challenge to WSNs implementation is source location privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based diversionary routing scheme for preserving source location privacy using hide and seek strategy to create diversionary or decoy routes along the path to the sink from the real source, where the end of each diversionary route is a decoy (fake source node), which periodically emits fake events. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme is able to maximize the network lifetime of WSNs. The main idea is that the lifetime of WSNs depends on the nodes with high energy consumption or hotspot, and then the proposed scheme minimizes energy consumption in hotspot and creates redundancy diversionary routes in nonhotspot regions with abundant energy. Hence, it achieves not only privacy preservation, but also network lifetime maximization. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the energy consumption in WSNs, and provide guidance on the number of diversionary routes, which can be created in different regions away from the sink. In addition, we identify a novel attack against phantom routing, which is widely used for source location privacy preservation, namely, direction-oriented attack. We also perform a comprehensive analysis on how the direction-oriented attack can be defeated by the proposed scheme. Theoretical and experimental results show that our scheme is very effective to improve the privacy protection while maximizing the network lifetime.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2332817","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61272150,61379110); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)(grant numbers:2012AA010105); Open Research Project, State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China(grant numbers:ICT1407); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(grant numbers:25880002,26730056); JSPS A3 Foresight Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6842655","wireless sensor networks;source location privacy;network lifetime;Wireless sensor networks;source location privacy;network lifetime;tree based routing;performance optimization","Wireless sensor networks;Privacy;Position measurement;Energy consumption;Routing protocols;Source location","","88","","35","OAPA","24 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MFEIT could provide emergency diagnosis of pathologies such as acute stroke, brain injury and breast cancer. We present a method for performing MFEIT using spectral constraints. Boundary voltage data is employed directly to reconstruct the volume fraction distribution of component tissues using a nonlinear method. Given that the reconstructed parameter is frequency independent, this approach allows for the simultaneous use of all multifrequency data, thus reducing the degrees of freedom of the reconstruction problem. Furthermore, this method allows for the use of frequency difference data in a nonlinear reconstruction algorithm. Results from empirical phantom measurements suggest that our fraction reconstruction method points to a new direction for the development of multifrequency EIT algorithms in the case that the spectral constraints are known, and may provide a unifying framework for static EIT imaging.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2013.2284966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6626670","Electrical impedance tomography (EIT);image reconstruction–iterative;inverse methods","Conductivity;Image reconstruction;Frequency measurement;Tomography;Impedance;Voltage measurement","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Electric Impedance;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Biological;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Tomography;Vegetables","85","1","22","CCBY","9 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

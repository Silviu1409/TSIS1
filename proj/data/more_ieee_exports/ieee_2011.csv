However, unlike traditional EAs, the DE-variants perturb the current-generation population members with the scaled differences of randomly selected and distinct population members. Therefore, no separate probability distribution has to be used for generating the offspring. Since its inception in 1995, DE has drawn the attention of many researchers all over the world resulting in a lot of variants of the basic algorithm with improved performance. This paper presents a detailed review of the basic concepts of DE and a survey of its major variants, its application to multiobjective, constrained, large scale, and uncertain optimization problems, and the theoretical studies conducted on DE so far.

The well-known structural similarity index brings IQA from pixel- to structure-based stage. In this paper, a novel feature similarity (FSIM) index for full reference IQA is proposed based on the fact that human visual system (HVS) understands an image mainly according to its low-level features. Specifically, the phase congruency (PC), which is a dimensionless measure of the significance of a local structure, is used as the primary feature in FSIM. Considering that PC is contrast invariant while the contrast information does affect HVS' perception of image quality, the image gradient magnitude (GM) is employed as the secondary feature in FSIM. PC and GM play complementary roles in characterizing the image local quality. After obtaining the local quality map, we use PC again as a weighting function to derive a single quality score. Extensive experiments performed on six benchmark IQA databases demonstrate that FSIM can achieve much higher consistency with the subjective evaluations than state-of-the-art IQA metrics.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2109730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705575","Gradient;image quality assessment (IQA);low-level feature;phase congruency (PC)","Measurement;Gabor filters;Indexes;Feature extraction;Visualization;Image color analysis","Algorithms;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Theoretical;Reproducibility of Results;Visual Perception","3736","6","39","IEEE","31 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we first propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using maximum mean miscrepancy. In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data properties are preserved and data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. Furthermore, in order to uncover the knowledge hidden in the relations between the data labels from the source and target domains, we extend TCA in a semisupervised learning setting, which encodes label information into transfer components learning. We call this extension semisupervised TCA. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the distance between domains in a latent space for domain adaptation. We propose both unsupervised and semisupervised feature extraction approaches, which can dramatically reduce the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Finally, our approach can handle large datasets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by experiments on five toy datasets and two real-world applications: cross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text classification.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2091281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640675","Dimensionality reduction;domain adaptation;Hilbert space embedding of distributions;transfer learning","Kernel;Optimization;Manifolds;Hilbert space;Learning systems;Feature extraction;Noise measurement","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Computer Simulation;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Transfer (Psychology)","3241","7","37","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These models have been used extensively but suffer from being both highly idealized and not very tractable, so complex system-level simulations are used to evaluate coverage/outage probability and rate. More tractable models have long been desirable. We develop new general models for the multi-cell signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) using stochastic geometry. Under very general assumptions, the resulting expressions for the downlink SINR CCDF (equivalent to the coverage probability) involve quickly computable integrals, and in some practical special cases can be simplified to common integrals (e.g., the Q-function) or even to simple closed-form expressions. We also derive the mean rate, and then the coverage gain (and mean rate loss) from static frequency reuse. We compare our coverage predictions to the grid model and an actual base station deployment, and observe that the proposed model is pessimistic (a lower bound on coverage) whereas the grid model is optimistic, and that both are about equally accurate. In addition to being more tractable, the proposed model may better capture the increasingly opportunistic and dense placement of base stations in future networks.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2011.100411.100541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042301","Cellular systems;outage probability;SINR;stochastic geometry","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Base stations;Fading channels;Mobile communication;Shadow mapping","","2564","3","34","IEEE","13 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system.

Experiences have shown that the hierarchical, centrally controlled grid of the 20th Century is ill-suited to the needs of the 21st Century. To address the challenges of the existing power grid, the new concept of smart grid has emerged. The smart grid can be considered as a modern electric power grid infrastructure for enhanced efficiency and reliability through automated control, high-power converters, modern communications infrastructure, sensing and metering technologies, and modern energy management techniques based on the optimization of demand, energy and network availability, and so on. While current power systems are based on a solid information and communication infrastructure, the new smart grid needs a different and much more complex one, as its dimension is much larger. This paper addresses critical issues on smart grid technologies primarily in terms of information and communication technology (ICT) issues and opportunities. The main objective of this paper is to provide a contemporary look at the current state of the art in smart grid communications as well as to discuss the still-open research issues in this field. It is expected that this paper will provide a better understanding of the technologies, potential advantages and research challenges of the smart grid and provoke interest among the research community to further explore this promising research area.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2011.2166794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6011696","Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI);communication technologies;quality-of-service (QoS);smart grid;standards","Smart grids;Communications technology;Power system security;Power system reliability;Quality of service;Standards","","2001","13","37","IEEE","5 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It will be shown that a grid-connected inverter will remain stable if the ratio between the grid impedance and the inverter output impedance satisfies the Nyquist stability criterion.

The automotive industry is working to develop the dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology, for use in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communication. The effectiveness of this technology is highly dependent on cooperative standards for interoperability. This paper explains the content and status of the DSRC standards being developed for deployment in the United States. Included in the discussion are the IEEE 802.11p amendment for wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), the IEEE 1609.2, 1609.3, and 1609.4 standards for Security, Network Services and Multi-Channel Operation, the SAE J2735 Message Set Dictionary, and the emerging SAE J2945.1 Communication Minimum Performance Requirements standard. The paper shows how these standards fit together to provide a comprehensive solution for DSRC. Most of the key standards are either recently published or expected to be completed in the coming year. A reader will gain a thorough understanding of DSRC technology for vehicular communication, including insights into why specific technical solutions are being adopted, and key challenges remaining for successful DSRC deployment.

Recently, a class of tracking techniques called “tracking by detection” has been shown to give promising results at real-time speeds. These methods train a discriminative classifier in an online manner to separate the object from the background. This classifier bootstraps itself by using the current tracker state to extract positive and negative examples from the current frame. Slight inaccuracies in the tracker can therefore lead to incorrectly labeled training examples, which degrade the classifier and can cause drift. In this paper, we show that using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) instead of traditional supervised learning avoids these problems and can therefore lead to a more robust tracker with fewer parameter tweaks. We propose a novel online MIL algorithm for object tracking that achieves superior results with real-time performance. We present thorough experimental results (both qualitative and quantitative) on a number of challenging video clips.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5674053","Visual Tracking;multiple instance learning;online boosting.","Boosting;Training;Target tracking;Agriculture;Adaptation model","","1681","6","47","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An asymmetric version increases precision, as it computes the approximate distance between a vector and a code. Experimental results show that our approach searches for nearest neighbors efficiently, in particular in combination with an inverted file system.

For example, our proposed technique stores, for each pixel, a set of values taken in the past at the same location or in the neighborhood. It then compares this set to the current pixel value in order to determine whether that pixel belongs to the background, and adapts the model by choosing randomly which values to substitute from the background model. This approach differs from those based upon the classical belief that the oldest values should be replaced first. Finally, when the pixel is found to be part of the background, its value is propagated into the background model of a neighboring pixel. We describe our method in full details (including pseudo-code and the parameter values used) and compare it to other background subtraction techniques. Efficiency figures show that our method outperforms recent and proven state-of-the-art methods in terms of both computation speed and detection rate. We also analyze the performance of a downscaled version of our algorithm to the absolute minimum of one comparison and one byte of memory per pixel.

On the other hand, from the geometric perspective, the data is usually sampled from a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. One then hopes to find a compact representation,which uncovers the hidden semantics and simultaneously respects the intrinsic geometric structure. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called Graph Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (GNMF), for this purpose.

However, in already dense deployments in today's networks, cell splitting gains can be severely limited by high inter-cell interference. Moreover, high capital expenditure cost associated with high power macro nodes further limits viability of such an approach. This article discusses the need for an alternative strategy, where low power nodes are overlaid within a macro network, creating what is referred to as a heterogeneous network. We survey current state of the art in heterogeneous deployments and focus on 3GPP LTE air interface to describe future trends. A high-level overview of the 3GPP LTE air interface, network nodes, and spectrum allocation options is provided, along with the enabling mechanisms for heterogeneous deployments. Interference management techniques that are critical for LTE heterogeneous deployments are discussed in greater detail. Cell range expansion, enabled through cell biasing and adaptive resource partitioning, is seen as an effective method to balance the load among the nodes in the network and improve overall trunking efficiency. An interference cancellation receiver plays a crucial role in ensuring acquisition of weak cells and reliability of control and data reception in the presence of legacy signals.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2011.5876496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876496","","Interference;Cellular networks;OFDM;Computer architecture;Downlink;Microprocessors","","1378","37","19","IEEE","16 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; <; 0.8° static RMS error, <; 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.","1945-7901","978-1-4244-9862-8","10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975346","","Equations;Mathematical model;Magnetometers;Gyroscopes;Heuristic algorithms;Quaternions;Accelerometers","Algorithms;Biomechanics;Humans;Orientation","1371","14","43","IEEE","11 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on this theory, we propose an (NR)/blind algorithm-the Distortion Identification-based Image Verity and INtegrity Evaluation (DIIVINE) index-that assesses the quality of a distorted image without need for a reference image. DIIVINE is based on a 2-stage framework involving distortion identification followed by distortion-specific quality assessment. DIIVINE is capable of assessing the quality of a distorted image across multiple distortion categories, as against most NR IQA algorithms that are distortion-specific in nature. DIIVINE is based on natural scene statistics which govern the behavior of natural images. In this paper, we detail the principles underlying DIIVINE, the statistical features extracted and their relevance to perception and thoroughly evaluate the algorithm on the popular LIVE IQA database. Further, we compare the performance of DIIVINE against leading full-reference (FR) IQA algorithms and demonstrate that DIIVINE is statistically superior to the often used measure of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and statistically equivalent to the popular structural similarity index (SSIM).

Several properties and applications of co-prime samplers are developed. First, for uniform spatial sampling with M and N sensors where M and N are co-prime with appropriate interelement spacings, the difference co-array has O(MN) freedoms which can be exploited in beamforming and in direction of arrival estimation. An M -point DFT filter bank and an N-point DFT filter bank can be used at the outputs of the two sensor arrays and their outputs combined in such a way that there are effectively MN bands (i.e., MN narrow beams with beamwidths proportional to 1/MN), a result following from co-primality. The ideas are applicable to both active and passive sensing, though the details and tradeoffs are different. Time domain sparse co-prime samplers also generate a time domain co-array with O(MN) freedoms, which can be used to estimate the autocorrelation at much finer lags than the sample spacings. This allows estimation of power spectrum of an arbitrary signal with a frequency resolution proportional to 2π/(MNT) even though the pairs of sampled sequences xc(NTn) and xc(MTn) in the time domain can be arbitrarily sparse - in fact from the sparse set of samples xc(NTn) and xc(MTn) one can estimate O(MN) frequencies in the range |ω| <; π/T. It will be shown that the co-array based method for estimating sinusoids in noise offers many advantages over methods based on the use of Chinese remainder theorem and its extensions. Examples are presented throughout to illustrate the various concepts.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2089682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5609222","Co-arrays;co-prime arrays;sampling;sparse sensing","Sensor arrays;Manganese;Correlation;Time domain analysis;Discrete Fourier transforms;Estimation","","1329","6","26","IEEE","25 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These targets often correspond to point-wise, man-made objects widely available over a city, but less present in non-urban areas. To overcome the limits of PSInSAR, analysis of interferometric data-stacks should aim at extracting geophysical parameters not only from point-wise deterministic objects (i.e., PS), but also from distributed scatterers (DS). Rather than developing hybrid processing chains where two or more algorithms are applied to the same data-stack, and results are then combined, in this paper we introduce a new approach, SqueeSAR, to jointly process PS and DS, taking into account their different statistical behavior. As it will be shown, PS and DS can be jointly processed without the need for significant changes to the traditional PSInSAR processing chain and without the need to unwrap hundreds of interferograms, provided that the coherence matrix associated with each DS is properly “squeezed” to provide a vector of optimum (wrapped) phase values. Results on real SAR data, acquired over an Alpine area, challenging for any InSAR analysis, confirm the effectiveness of this new approach.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2124465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5765671","Coherence matrix;distributed scatterers (DS);InSAR;permanent scatterers;space-adaptive filtering","Pixel;Coherence;Covariance matrix;Estimation;Decorrelation;Radar imaging","","1326","","40","IEEE","12 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They have been the chief reason for the considerable progress in the field, not just as source of large amounts of training data, but also as means of measuring and comparing performance of competing algorithms. At the same time, datasets have often been blamed for narrowing the focus of object recognition research, reducing it to a single benchmark performance number. Indeed, some datasets, that started out as data capture efforts aimed at representing the visual world, have become closed worlds unto themselves (e.g. the Corel world, the Caltech-101 world, the PASCAL VOC world). With the focus on beating the latest benchmark numbers on the latest dataset, have we perhaps lost sight of the original purpose? The goal of this paper is to take stock of the current state of recognition datasets. We present a comparison study using a set of popular datasets, evaluated based on a number of criteria including: relative data bias, cross-dataset generalization, effects of closed-world assumption, and sample value. The experimental results, some rather surprising, suggest directions that can improve dataset collection as well as algorithm evaluation protocols.

Current approaches treat the tracking problem as a classification task and use online learning techniques to update the object model. However, for these updates to happen one needs to convert the estimated object position into a set of labelled training examples, and it is not clear how best to perform this intermediate step. Furthermore, the objective for the classifier (label prediction) is not explicitly coupled to the objective for the tracker (accurate estimation of object position). In this paper, we present a framework for adaptive visual object tracking based on structured output prediction. By explicitly allowing the output space to express the needs of the tracker, we are able to avoid the need for an intermediate classification step. Our method uses a kernelized structured output support vector machine (SVM), which is learned online to provide adaptive tracking. To allow for real-time application, we introduce a budgeting mechanism which prevents the unbounded growth in the number of support vectors which would otherwise occur during tracking. Experimentally, we show that our algorithm is able to outperform state-of-the-art trackers on various benchmark videos. Additionally, we show that we can easily incorporate additional features and kernels into our framework, which results in increased performance.","2380-7504","978-1-4577-1102-2","10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126251","","Support vector machines;Training;Target tracking;Kernel;Robustness;Labeling","","1270","11","23","IEEE","26 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we discuss the need for bidirectional coupling of network simulation and road traffic microsimulation for evaluating IVC protocols. As the selection of a mobility model influences the outcome of simulations to a great extent, the use of a representative model is necessary for producing meaningful evaluation results. Based on these observations, we developed the hybrid simulation framework Veins (Vehicles in Network Simulation), composed of the network simulator OMNeT++ and the road traffic simulator SUMO.

The SIFT flow algorithm consists of matching densely sampled, pixelwise SIFT features between two images while preserving spatial discontinuities. The SIFT features allow robust matching across different scene/object appearances, whereas the discontinuity-preserving spatial model allows matching of objects located at different parts of the scene. Experiments show that the proposed approach robustly aligns complex scene pairs containing significant spatial differences. Based on SIFT flow, we propose an alignment-based large database framework for image analysis and synthesis, where image information is transferred from the nearest neighbors to a query image according to the dense scene correspondence.

SRC first codes a testing sample as a sparse linear combination of all the training samples, and then classifies the testing sample by evaluating which class leads to the minimum representation error. While the importance of sparsity is much emphasized in SRC and many related works, the use of collaborative representation (CR) in SRC is ignored by most literature. However, is it really the l1-norm sparsity that improves the FR accuracy? This paper devotes to analyze the working mechanism of SRC, and indicates that it is the CR but not the l1-norm sparsity that makes SRC powerful for face classification. Consequently, we propose a very simple yet much more efficient face classification scheme, namely CR based classification with regularized least square (CRC_RLS). The extensive experiments clearly show that CRC_RLS has very competitive classification results, while it has significantly less complexity than SRC.","2380-7504","978-1-4577-1102-2","10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126277","","Training;Face;Dictionaries;Encoding;Minimization;Collaboration;Testing","","1185","","30","IEEE","12 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A new research trend in the residential generation system is to employ the PV parallel-connected configuration rather than the series-connected configuration to satisfy the safety requirements and to make full use of the PV generated power. How to achieve high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency dc/dc conversion is the major consideration due to the low PV output voltage with the parallel-connected structure. The limitations of the conventional boost converters in these applications are analyzed. Then, most of the topologies with high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency performance are covered and classified into several categories. The advantages and disadvantages of these converters are discussed. Furthermore, a general conceptual circuit for high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency dc/dc conversion is proposed to derive the next-generation topologies for the PV grid-connected power system. Finally, the major challenges of high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency dc/dc converters are summarized.

Simulation results based on a detailed PSCAD/EMTDC model prove the effectiveness of the modified PSC-PWM method and the RSF voltage-balancing algorithm.

The term was chosen for its similarity to wheel odometry, which incrementally estimates the motion of a vehicle by integrating the number of turns of its wheels over time. Likewise, VO operates by incrementally estimating the pose of the vehicle through examination of the changes that motion induces on the images of its onboard cameras. For VO to work effectively, there should be sufficient illumination in the environment and a static scene with enough texture to allow apparent motion to be extracted. Furthermore, consecutive frames should be captured by ensuring that they have sufficient scene overlap.","1558-223X","","10.1109/MRA.2011.943233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096039","","Cameras;Wheels;Robot vision systems;Detectors;Motion estimation;Bundle adjustment","","1108","26","82","IEEE","8 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper mathematically characterizes the impact that uplink training has on the performance of such multi-cell multiple antenna systems. When non-orthogonal training sequences are used for uplink training, the paper shows that the precoding matrix used by the base station in one cell becomes corrupted by the channel between that base station and the users in other cells in an undesirable manner. This paper analyzes this fundamental problem of pilot contamination in multi-cell systems. Furthermore, it develops a new multi-cell MMSE-based precoding method that mitigates this problem.

In this paper, we present a way to approach this problem by integrating rich descriptors into the variational optical flow setting.

The concept of cognitive radio is proposed to address the issue of spectrum efficiency and has been receiving an increasing attention in recent years, since it equips wireless users the capability to optimally adapt their operating parameters according to the interactions with the surrounding radio environment.

Considering that the contents can vary significantly across different images or different patches in a single image, we propose to learn various sets of bases from a precollected dataset of example image patches, and then, for a given patch to be processed, one set of bases are adaptively selected to characterize the local sparse domain. We further introduce two adaptive regularization terms into the sparse representation framework. First, a set of autoregressive (AR) models are learned from the dataset of example image patches. The best fitted AR models to a given patch are adaptively selected to regularize the image local structures. Second, the image nonlocal self-similarity is introduced as another regularization term. In addition, the sparsity regularization parameter is adaptively estimated for better image restoration performance. Extensive experiments on image deblurring and super-resolution validate that by using adaptive sparse domain selection and adaptive regularization, the proposed method achieves much better results than many state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both PSNR and visual perception.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2108306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5701777","Deblurring;image restoration (IR);regularization;sparse representation;super-resolution","Dictionaries;Adaptation model;Image restoration;TV;Image resolution;Image reconstruction;Computational modeling","Algorithms;Animals;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Plants;Regression Analysis","1033","5","63","IEEE","28 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a distributed event-triggering scheme, where a subsystem broadcasts its state information to its neighbors only when the subsystem's local state error exceeds a specified threshold. In this scheme, a subsystem is able to make broadcast decisions using its locally sampled data. It can also locally predict the maximal allowable number of successive data dropouts (MANSD) and the state-based deadlines for transmission delays. Moreover, the designer's selection of the local event for a subsystem only requires information on that individual subsystem. Our analysis applies to both linear and nonlinear subsystems. Designing local events for a nonlinear subsystem requires us to find a controller that ensures that subsystem to be input-to-state stable. For linear subsystems, the design problem becomes a linear matrix inequality feasibility problem. With the assumption that the number of each subsystem's successive data dropouts is less than its MANSD, we show that if the transmission delays are zero, the resulting system is finite-gain Lp stable. If the delays are bounded by given deadlines, the system is asymptotically stable. We also show that those state-based deadlines for transmission delays are always greater than a positive constant.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2010.2057951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510124","Distributed systems;event-triggering;networked control systems (NCS)","Networked control systems;Delay;Communication system control;Broadcasting;Control systems;Costs;Postal services;Propagation losses;Linear matrix inequalities;Filtering theory","","1021","","28","IEEE","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed algorithm relies on the observation that a hyperspectral pixel can be sparsely represented by a linear combination of a few training samples from a structured dictionary. The sparse representation of an unknown pixel is expressed as a sparse vector whose nonzero entries correspond to the weights of the selected training samples. The sparse vector is recovered by solving a sparsity-constrained optimization problem, and it can directly determine the class label of the test sample. Two different approaches are proposed to incorporate the contextual information into the sparse recovery optimization problem in order to improve the classification performance. In the first approach, an explicit smoothing constraint is imposed on the problem formulation by forcing the vector Laplacian of the reconstructed image to become zero. In this approach, the reconstructed pixel of interest has similar spectral characteristics to its four nearest neighbors. The second approach is via a joint sparsity model where hyperspectral pixels in a small neighborhood around the test pixel are simultaneously represented by linear combinations of a few common training samples, which are weighted with a different set of coefficients for each pixel. The proposed sparsity-based algorithm is applied to several real hyperspectral images for classification. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the classical supervised classifier support vector machines in most cases.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2129595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5766028","Classification;hyperspectral imagery;joint sparsity model;simultaneous sparse recovery;sparse representation;spatial correlation","Pixel;Training;Dictionaries;Hyperspectral imaging;Matching pursuit algorithms;Image reconstruction;Approximation algorithms","","1018","1","60","IEEE","12 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following a brief introduction to the common types of EV batteries and their charging characteristics, an analytical solution for predicting the EV charging load is developed. The method is stochastically formulated so as to account for the stochastic nature of the start time of individual battery charging and the initial battery state-of-charge. A comparative study is carried out by simulating four EV charging scenarios, i.e., uncontrolled domestic charging, uncontrolled off-peak domestic charging, “smart” domestic charging and uncontrolled public charging-commuters capable of recharging at the workplace. The proposed four EVs charging scenarios take into account the expected future changes to the electricity tariffs in the electricity market place and appropriate regulation of EVs battery charging loads. A typical U.K. distribution system is adopted as an example. The time-series data of EV charging loads is taken from two commercially available EV batteries: lead-acid and lithium-ion. Results show that a 10% market penetration of EVs in the studied system would result in an increase in daily peak demand by up to 17.9%, while a 20% level of EV penetration would lead to a 35.8% increase in peak load, for the scenario of uncontrolled domestic charging-the “worst-case” scenario.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2057456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5535237","Battery;charging;electrical distribution system;electric vehicle (EV);load model","Load modeling;Batteries;Electric vehicles;Power systems;Power generation;Stochastic processes;Employment;Electricity supply industry;Roads","","998","","17","IEEE","3 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Learning priors and optimizing over whole images can lead to tremendous computational challenges. In contrast, when we work with small image patches, it is possible to learn priors and perform patch restoration very efficiently. This raises three questions - do priors that give high likelihood to the data also lead to good performance in restoration? Can we use such patch based priors to restore a full image? Can we learn better patch priors? In this work we answer these questions. We compare the likelihood of several patch models and show that priors that give high likelihood to data perform better in patch restoration. Motivated by this result, we propose a generic framework which allows for whole image restoration using any patch based prior for which a MAP (or approximate MAP) estimate can be calculated. We show how to derive an appropriate cost function, how to optimize it and how to use it to restore whole images. Finally, we present a generic, surprisingly simple Gaussian Mixture prior, learned from a set of natural images. When used with the proposed framework, this Gaussian Mixture Model outperforms all other generic prior methods for image denoising, deblurring and inpainting.","2380-7504","978-1-4577-1102-2","10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126278","","Image restoration;Noise reduction;Equations;Noise measurement;Image reconstruction;Mathematical model;Estimation","","990","4","16","IEEE","12 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While significant progress has been made in measuring local image quality/distortion, the pooling stage is often done in ad-hoc ways, lacking theoretical principles and reliable computational models. This paper aims to test the hypothesis that when viewing natural images, the optimal perceptual weights for pooling should be proportional to local information content, which can be estimated in units of bit using advanced statistical models of natural images. Our extensive studies based upon six publicly-available subject-rated image databases concluded with three useful findings. First, information content weighting leads to consistent improvement in the performance of IQA algorithms. Second, surprisingly, with information content weighting, even the widely criticized peak signal-to-noise-ratio can be converted to a competitive perceptual quality measure when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

Such networks, also referred as pocket switched networks (PSNs), are intermittently connected and represent a paradigm shift of forwarding data in an ad hoc manner. The social structure and interaction of users of such devices dictate the performance of routing protocols in PSNs. To that end, social information is an essential metric for designing forwarding algorithms for such types of networks. Previous methods relied on building and updating routing tables to cope with dynamic network conditions. On the downside, it has been shown that such approaches end up being cost ineffective due to the partial capture of the transient network behavior. A more promising approach would be to capture the intrinsic characteristics of such networks and utilize them in the design of routing algorithms. In this paper, we exploit two social and structural metrics, namely centrality and community, using real human mobility traces. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we design and evaluate BUBBLE, a novel social-based forwarding algorithm, that utilizes the aforementioned metrics to enhance delivery performance. Second, we empirically show that BUBBLE can substantially improve forwarding performance compared to a number of previously proposed algorithms including the benchmarking history-based PROPHET algorithm, and social-based forwarding SimBet algorithm.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2010.246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677535","Social networks;forwarding algorithms;delay-tolerant networks;pocket-switched networks;centrality;community detection.","Communities;Algorithm design and analysis;Humans;Relays;Delay;Routing","","952","","34","IEEE","30 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, transmission policies of the nodes need to adapt to these harvested energy arrivals. In this paper, we consider optimization of point-to-point data transmission with an energy harvesting transmitter which has a limited battery capacity, communicating in a wireless fading channel. We consider two objectives: maximizing the throughput by a deadline, and minimizing the transmission completion time of the communication session. We optimize these objectives by controlling the time sequence of transmit powers subject to energy storage capacity and causality constraints. We, first, study optimal offline policies. We introduce a directional water-filling algorithm which provides a simple and concise interpretation of the necessary optimality conditions. We show the optimality of an adaptive directional water-filling algorithm for the throughput maximization problem. We solve the transmission completion time minimization problem by utilizing its equivalence to its throughput maximization counterpart. Next, we consider online policies. We use stochastic dynamic programming to solve for the optimal online policy that maximizes the average number of bits delivered by a deadline under stochastic fading and energy arrival processes with causal channel state feedback. We also propose near-optimal policies with reduced complexity, and numerically study their performances along with the performances of the offline and online optimal policies under various different configurations.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992841","Energy harvesting;rechargeable wireless networks;throughput maximization;transmission completion time minimization;directional water-filling;dynamic programming","Fading;Batteries;Transmitters;Throughput;Energy harvesting;Optimization;Resource management","","922","4","16","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the high volume of reviews that are typically published for a single product makes harder for individuals as well as manufacturers to locate the best reviews and understand the true underlying quality of a product. In this paper, we reexamine the impact of reviews on economic outcomes like product sales and see how different factors affect social outcomes such as their perceived usefulness. Our approach explores multiple aspects of review text, such as subjectivity levels, various measures of readability and extent of spelling errors to identify important text-based features. In addition, we also examine multiple reviewer-level features such as average usefulness of past reviews and the self-disclosed identity measures of reviewers that are displayed next to a review. Our econometric analysis reveals that the extent of subjectivity, informativeness, readability, and linguistic correctness in reviews matters in influencing sales and perceived usefulness. Reviews that have a mixture of objective, and highly subjective sentences are negatively associated with product sales, compared to reviews that tend to include only subjective or only objective information. However, such reviews are rated more informative (or helpful) by other users. By using Random Forest-based classifiers, we show that we can accurately predict the impact of reviews on sales and their perceived usefulness. We examine the relative importance of the three broad feature categories: “reviewer-related” features, “review subjectivity” features, and “review readability” features, and find that using any of the three feature sets results in a statistically equivalent performance as in the case of using all available features. This paper is the first study that integrates econometric, text mining, and predictive modeling techniques toward a more complete analysis of the information captured by user-generated online reviews in order to estimate their helpfulness and economic impact.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5590249","Internet commerce;social media;user-generated content;textmining;word-of-mouth;product reviews;economics;sentiment analysis;online communities.","Marketing and sales;History;Economics;Communities;Measurement","","917","2","59","IEEE","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

OMP is an iterative greedy algorithm that selects at each step the column, which is most correlated with the current residuals.

It is shown that under conditions on the mutual incoherence and the minimum magnitude of the nonzero components of the signal, the support of the signal can be recovered exactly by the OMP algorithm with high probability. In addition, we also consider the problem of identifying significant components in the case where some of the nonzero components are possibly small. It is shown that in this case the OMP algorithm will still select all the significant components before possibly selecting incorrect ones. Moreover, with modified stopping rules, the OMP algorithm can ensure that no zero components are selected.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2146090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5895106"," $\ell_{1}$ minimization;compressed sensing;mutual incoherence;orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP);signal reconstruction;support recovery","Matching pursuit algorithms;Gaussian noise;Signal processing algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Equations","","913","9","19","IEEE","20 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most widely used image segmentation algorithms are region-based and typically rely on the homogeneity of the image intensities in the regions of interest, which often fail to provide accurate segmentation results due to the intensity inhomogeneity. This paper proposes a novel region-based method for image segmentation, which is able to deal with intensity inhomogeneities in the segmentation. First, based on the model of images with intensity inhomogeneities, we derive a local intensity clustering property of the image intensities, and define a local clustering criterion function for the image intensities in a neighborhood of each point. This local clustering criterion function is then integrated with respect to the neighborhood center to give a global criterion of image segmentation. In a level set formulation, this criterion defines an energy in terms of the level set functions that represent a partition of the image domain and a bias field that accounts for the intensity inhomogeneity of the image. Therefore, by minimizing this energy, our method is able to simultaneously segment the image and estimate the bias field, and the estimated bias field can be used for intensity inhomogeneity correction (or bias correction). Our method has been validated on synthetic images and real images of various modalities, with desirable performance in the presence of intensity inhomogeneities. Experiments show that our method is more robust to initialization, faster and more accurate than the well-known piecewise smooth model. As an application, our method has been used for segmentation and bias correction of magnetic resonance (MR) images with promising results.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2146190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5754584","Bias correction;image segmentation;intensity inhomogeneity;level set;MRI","Level set;Image segmentation;Nonhomogeneous media;Minimization;Estimation;Imaging;Electronic mail","","911","2","23","IEEE","21 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From these relationships, three optimal charging algorithms are developed which minimize the impacts of PHEV charging on the connected distribution system. The application of the algorithms to two test systems verifies these relationships approximately hold independent of system topology.

We then generate high-resolution maps of the environment which are subsequently used for online localization with centimeter accuracy. Improved perception and recognition algorithms now enable Junior to track and classify obstacles as cyclists, pedestrians, and vehicles; traffic lights are detected as well. A new planning system uses this incoming data to generate thousands of candidate trajectories per second, choosing the optimal path dynamically. The improved controller continuously selects throttle, brake, and steering actuations that maximize comfort and minimize trajectory error.

However, it is crucial to minimize relay self-interference to render full duplex feasible. For this purpose, we analyze a broad range of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mitigation schemes: natural isolation, time-domain cancellation, and spatial suppression. Cancellation subtracts replicated interference signal from the relay input while suppression reserves spatial dimensions for receive and transmit filtering. Spatial suppression can be achieved by antenna subset selection, null-space projection, i.e., receiving and transmitting in orthogonal subspaces, or joint transmit and receive beam selection to support more spatial streams by choosing the minimum eigenmodes for overlapping subspaces. In addition, minimum mean square error (MMSE) filtering can be employed to maintain the desired signal quality, which is inherent for cancellation, and the combination of time- and spatial-domain processing may be better than either alone. Targeting at minimal interference power, we solve optimal filters for each scheme in the cases of joint, separate and independent design. The performance of mitigation schemes is evaluated and compared by simulations. The results confirm that self-interference can be mitigated effectively also in the presence of imperfect side information.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2164910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985554","Amplify-and-forward (AF);antenna selection (AS);beam selection (BS);decode-and-forward (DF);full-duplex;interference cancellation;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay;minimum mean square error (MMSE);null-space projection;self-interference","Relays;Noise;MIMO;Mean square error methods;Interference cancellation","","871","26","34","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Utilities are becoming concerned about the potential stresses, performance degradations and overloads that may occur in distribution systems with multiple domestic PEV charging activities. Uncontrolled and random PEV charging can cause increased power losses, overloads and voltage fluctuations, which are all detrimental to the reliability and security of newly developing smart grids. Therefore, a real-time smart load management (RT-SLM) control strategy is proposed and developed for the coordination of PEV charging based on real-time (e.g., every 5 min) minimization of total cost of generating the energy plus the associated grid energy losses. The approach reduces generation cost by incorporating time-varying market energy prices and PEV owner preferred charging time zones based on priority selection. The RT-SLM algorithm appropriately considers random plug-in of PEVs and utilizes the maximum sensitivities selection (MSS) optimization. This approach enables PEVs to begin charging as soon as possible considering priority-charging time zones while complying with network operation criteria (such as losses, generation limits, and voltage profile).

It aims at estimating the fractional abundances of pure spectral signatures (also called as endmembers) in each mixed pixel collected by an imaging spectrometer. In many situations, the identification of the end-member signatures in the original data set may be challenging due to insufficient spatial resolution, mixtures happening at different scales, and unavailability of completely pure spectral signatures in the scene. However, the unmixing problem can also be approached in semisupervised fashion, i.e., by assuming that the observed image signatures can be expressed in the form of linear combinations of a number of pure spectral signatures known in advance (e.g., spectra collected on the ground by a field spectroradiometer). Unmixing then amounts to finding the optimal subset of signatures in a (potentially very large) spectral library that can best model each mixed pixel in the scene. In practice, this is a combinatorial problem which calls for efficient linear sparse regression (SR) techniques based on sparsity-inducing regularizers, since the number of endmembers participating in a mixed pixel is usually very small compared with the (ever-growing) dimensionality (and availability) of spectral libraries. Linear SR is an area of very active research, with strong links to compressed sensing, basis pursuit (BP), BP denoising, and matching pursuit. In this paper, we study the linear spectral unmixing problem under the light of recent theoretical results published in those referred to areas. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of several available and new linear SR algorithms, with the ultimate goal of analyzing their potential in solving the spectral unmixing problem by resorting to available spectral libraries. Our experimental results, conducted using both simulated and real hyperspectral data sets collected by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer and spectral libraries publicly available from the U.S. Geological Survey, indicate the potential of SR techniques in the task of accurately characterizing the mixed pixels using the library spectra. This opens new perspectives for spectral unmixing, since the abundance estimation process no longer depends on the availability of pure spectral signatures in the input data nor on the capacity of a certain endmember extraction algorithm to identify such pure signatures.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2098413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5692827","Abundance estimation;convex optimization;hyperspectral imaging;sparse regression (SR);spectral unmixing","Pixel;Hyperspectral imaging;Libraries;Strontium;Coherence;Materials","","866","1","46","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One way to approach distribution system problems is to rethinking our distribution system to include the integration of high levels of distributed energy resources, using microgrid concepts.

Managing significant levels of distributed energy resources (DERs) with a wide and dynamic set of resources and control points can become overwhelming. The best way to manage such a system is to break the distribution system down into small clusters or microgrids, with distributed optimizing controls coordinating multimicrogrids. The Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTSs) concept views clustered generation and associated loads as a grid resource or a “microgrid.” The clustered sources and loads can operate in parallel to the grid or as an island. This grid resource can disconnect from the utility during events (i.e., faults, voltage collapses), but may also intentionally disconnect when the quality of power from the grid falls below certain standards.

We then discuss some of the challenges to achieving a load control scheme that balances device-level objectives with power system-level objectives. One of the central premises of the paper is that, in order to achieve full responsiveness, direct load control (as opposed to price response) is required to enable fast time scale, predictable control opportunities, especially for the provision of ancillary services such as regulation and contingency reserves. Centralized, hierarchical, and distributed control architectures are discussed along with benefits and disadvantages, especially in relation to integration with the legacy power system control architecture.

Inductive power transfer (IPT) is capable of meeting these needs, however, the main limiting factor is the performance of the magnetic structures (termed power pads) that help transfer power efficiently. These should transfer 2-5 kW with a large air gap and have good tolerance to misalignment. Durability, low weight, and cost efficiency are also critical. 3-D finite-element analysis modeling is used to optimize circular power pads. This technique is viable, since measured and simulated results differ by 10% at most. A sample of power pads was considered in this work, and key design parameters were investigated to determine their influence on coupled power and operation. A final 2 kW 700-mm-diameter pad was constructed and tested having a horizontal radial tolerance of 130 mm (equivalent to a circular charging zone of diameter 260 mm) with a 200 mm air gap. The leakage magnetic flux of a charging system was investigated via simulation and measurement. The proposed pads meet human exposure regulations with measurement techniques specific by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) which uses the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines as a foundation.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2011.2143730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5752254","Electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic coupling;inductive power transmission","Coils;Ferrites;Receivers;Transmitters;Inductance;Power supplies;Optimization","","842","17","31","IEEE","19 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It moves the application software and databases to the centralized large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique paradigm brings about many new security challenges, which have not been well understood. This work studies the problem of ensuring the integrity of data storage in Cloud Computing. In particular, we consider the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of the client through the auditing of whether his data stored in the cloud are indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion, and deletion, is also a significant step toward practicality, since services in Cloud Computing are not limited to archive or backup data only. While prior works on ensuring remote data integrity often lacks the support of either public auditability or dynamic data operations, this paper achieves both. We first identify the difficulties and potential security problems of direct extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for the seamless integration of these two salient features in our protocol design. In particular, to achieve efficient data dynamics, we improve the existing proof of storage models by manipulating the classic Merkle Hash Tree construction for block tag authentication. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multiuser setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously. Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed schemes are highly efficient and provably secure.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611497","Data storage;public auditability;data dynamics;cloud computing.","Clouds;Security;Servers;Memory;Data models;Protocols;Cloud computing","","833","1","20","IEEE","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous review articles in CS limit their scope to standard discrete-to-discrete measurement architectures using matrices of randomized nature and signal models based on standard sparsity. In recent years, CS has worked its way into several new application areas. This, in turn, necessitates a fresh look on many of the basics of CS. The random matrix measurement operator must be replaced by more structured sensing architectures that correspond to the characteristics of feasible acquisition hardware. The standard sparsity prior has to be extended to include a much richer class of signals and to encode broader data models, including continuous-time signals. In our overview, the theme is exploiting signal and measurement structure in compressive sensing. The prime focus is bridging theory and practice; that is, to pinpoint the potential of structured CS strategies to emerge from the math to the hardware. Our summary highlights new directions as well as relations to more traditional CS, with the hope of serving both as a review to practitioners wanting to join this emerging field, and as a reference for researchers that attempts to put some of the existing ideas in perspective of practical applications.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2161982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954192","Approximation algorithms;compressed sensing;compression algorithms;data acquisition;data compression;sampling methods","Hardware;Sparks;Coherence;Digital signal processing;Sensors;Vectors;Compressed sensing","","823","14","184","IEEE","14 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Communication among nanomachines will allow them to accomplish more complex functions in a distributed manner. In this paper, the state of the art in molecular electronics is reviewed to motivate the study of the Terahertz Band (0.1-10.0 THz) for electromagnetic (EM) communication among nano-devices. A new propagation model for EM communications in the Terahertz Band is developed based on radiative transfer theory and in light of molecular absorption. This model accounts for the total path loss and the molecular absorption noise that a wave in the Terahertz Band suffers when propagating over very short distances. Finally, the channel capacity of the Terahertz Band is investigated by using this model for different power allocation schemes, including a scheme based on the transmission of femtosecond-long pulses. The results show that for very short transmission distances, in the order of several tens of millimeters, the Terahertz channel supports very large bit-rates, up to few terabits per second, which enables a radically different communication paradigm for nanonetworks.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2011.081011.100545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995306","Nanonetworks;channel model;channel capacity;Terahertz Band;molecular electronics;graphene","Noise measurement;Nanobioscience;Resonant frequency;Nanoscale devices;Wireless communication;Databases","","822","1","36","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a simple and unifying theoretical framework to design such a regularized CSP (RCSP). We then present a review of existing RCSP algorithms and describe how to cast them in this framework. We also propose four new RCSP algorithms. Finally, we compare the performances of 11 different RCSP (including the four new ones and the original CSP), on electroencephalography data from 17 subjects, from BCI competition datasets. Results showed that the best RCSP methods can outperform CSP by nearly 10% in median classification accuracy and lead to more neurophysiologically relevant spatial filters. They also enable us to perform efficient subject-to-subject transfer. Overall, the best RCSP algorithms were CSP with Tikhonov regularization and weighted Tikhonov regularization, both proposed in this paper.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2010.2082539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593210","Brain–computer interfaces (BCI);common spatial patterns (CSP);electroencephalography (EEG);regularization;subject-to-subject transfer","Covariance matrix;Electroencephalography;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Training;Algorithm design and analysis;Electrodes;Noise","Algorithms;Electroencephalography;Humans;Man-Machine Systems;Models, Neurological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Regression Analysis;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","817","","32","IEEE","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This technique typically uses four coils as opposed to two coils used in conventional inductive links. In the four-coil system, the adverse effects of a low coupling coefficient between primary and secondary coils are compensated by using high-quality (Q) factor coils, and the efficiency of the system is improved. Unlike its two-coil counterpart, the efficiency profile of the power transfer is not a monotonically decreasing function of the operating distance and is less sensitive to changes in the distance between the primary and secondary coils. A four-coil energy transfer system can be optimized to provide maximum efficiency at a given operating distance. We have analyzed the four-coil energy transfer systems and outlined the effect of design parameters on power-transfer efficiency. Design steps to obtain the efficient power-transfer system are presented and a design example is provided.

We then address Smart Grid applications as instances of sensor networking and network control problems and discuss the main conclusions one can draw from the literature on these subjects. The application scenario of PLC within the Smart Grid is then analyzed in detail. Because a necessary ingredient of network planning is modeling, we also discuss two aspects of engineering modeling that relate to our question.

Such an approach can be made very robust to the occasional detection failure: If an object is not detected in a frame but is in previous and following ones, a correct trajectory will nevertheless be produced. By contrast, a false-positive detection in a few frames will be ignored. However, when dealing with a multiple target problem, the linking step results in a difficult optimization problem in the space of all possible families of trajectories. This is usually dealt with by sampling or greedy search based on variants of Dynamic Programming which can easily miss the global optimum. In this paper, we show that reformulating that step as a constrained flow optimization results in a convex problem. We take advantage of its particular structure to solve it using the k-shortest paths algorithm, which is very fast. This new approach is far simpler formally and algorithmically than existing techniques and lets us demonstrate excellent performance in two very different contexts.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708151","Data association;multiobject tracking;K-shortest paths;linear programming.","Trajectory;Optimization;Linear programming;Object detection;Tracking;Detectors;Cameras","","777","9","47","IEEE","4 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since then, HVDC technology has advanced considerably and, despite numerous technical challenges, the realization of large-scale HVDC networks is now seriously discussed and considered. For the acceptance and reliability of these networks, the availability of HVDC circuit breakers (CBs) will be critical, making them one of the key enabling technologies. Numerous ideas for HVDC breaker schemes have been published and patented, but no acceptable solution has been found to interrupt HVDC short-circuit currents. This paper aims to summarize the literature, especially that of the last two decades, on technology areas that are relevant to HVDC breakers.

Recent CS methods have employed analytical sparsifying transforms such as wavelets, curvelets, and finite differences. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the sparsifying transform (dictionary), and reconstructing the image simultaneously from highly undersampled k-space data. The sparsity in this framework is enforced on overlapping image patches emphasizing local structure. Moreover, the dictionary is adapted to the particular image instance thereby favoring better sparsities and consequently much higher undersampling rates. The proposed alternating reconstruction algorithm learns the sparsifying dictionary, and uses it to remove aliasing and noise in one step, and subsequently restores and fills-in the k-space data in the other step. Numerical experiments are conducted on MR images and on real MR data of several anatomies with a variety of sampling schemes. The results demonstrate dramatic improvements on the order of 4-18 dB in reconstruction error and doubling of the acceptable undersampling factor using the proposed adaptive dictionary as compared to previous CS methods. These improvements persist over a wide range of practical data signal-to-noise ratios, without any parameter tuning.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2010.2090538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5617283","Compressed sensing (CS);dictionary learning;image reconstruction;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);reduced encoding;sparse representation","Dictionaries;Image reconstruction;Wavelet transforms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Pixel;Noise","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Lumbosacral Region;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Theoretical","773","3","61","IEEE","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a novel approach to build 3d maps from high-resolution stereo sequences in real-time. Inspired by recent progress in stereo matching, we propose a sparse feature matcher in conjunction with an efficient and robust visual odometry algorithm. Our reconstruction pipeline combines both techniques with efficient stereo matching and a multi-view linking scheme for generating consistent 3d point clouds. In our experiments we show that the proposed odometry method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Including feature matching, the visual odometry part of our algorithm runs at 25 frames per second, while - at the same time - we obtain new depth maps at 3-4 fps, sufficient for online 3d reconstructions.","1931-0587","978-1-4577-0891-6","10.1109/IVS.2011.5940405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5940405","","Three dimensional displays;Visualization;Real time systems;Image reconstruction;Stereo image processing;Cameras;Estimation","","755","5","26","IEEE","4 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider the planning problem of an OFDM optical network, where we are given a traffic matrix that includes the requested transmission rates of the connections to be served. Connections are provisioned for their requested rate by elastically allocating spectrum using a variable number of OFDM subcarriers and choosing an appropriate modulation level, taking into account the transmission distance. We introduce the Routing, Modulation Level and Spectrum Allocation (RMLSA) problem, as opposed to the typical Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem of traditional WDM networks, prove that is also NP-complete and present various algorithms to solve it. We start by presenting an optimal ILP RMLSA algorithm that minimizes the spectrum used to serve the traffic matrix, and also present a decomposition method that breaks RMLSA into its two substituent subproblems, namely 1) routing and modulation level and 2) spectrum allocation $({\rm RML}+{\rm SA})$, and solves them sequentially. We also propose a heuristic algorithm that serves connections one-by-one and use it to solve the planning problem by sequentially serving all the connections in the traffic matrix. In the sequential algorithm, we investigate two policies for defining the order in which connections are considered. We also use a simulated annealing meta-heuristic to obtain even better orderings. We examine the performance of the proposed algorithms through simulation experiments and evaluate the spectrum utilization benefits that can be obtained by utilizing OFDM elastic bandwidth allocation, when compared to a traditional WDM network.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2011.2125777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5727897","Elastic/flexible spectrum optical paths;non-overlapping spectrum contraints;optical OFDM;planning (offline) problem;routing modulation level and spectrum allocation;spectrum continuity constraint","OFDM;Optical modulation;WDM networks;Resource management;Algorithm design and analysis;Routing","","751","8","22","IEEE","10 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This can be a crucial task when images are used as basic evidence to influence judgment like, for example, in a court of law. To carry out such forensic analysis, various technological instruments have been developed in the literature. In this paper, the problem of detecting if an image has been forged is investigated; in particular, attention has been paid to the case in which an area of an image is copied and then pasted onto another zone to create a duplication or to cancel something that was awkward. Generally, to adapt the image patch to the new context a geometric transformation is needed. To detect such modifications, a novel methodology based on scale invariant features transform (SIFT) is proposed. Such a method allows us to both understand if a copy-move attack has occurred and, furthermore, to recover the geometric transformation used to perform cloning. Extensive experimental results are presented to confirm that the technique is able to precisely individuate the altered area and, in addition, to estimate the geometric transformation parameters with high reliability. The method also deals with multiple cloning.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2011.2129512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734842","Authenticity verification;copy–move attack;digital image forensics;geometric transformation recovery","Forensics;Forgery;Cloning;Feature extraction;Digital images;Discrete cosine transforms","","747","2","40","IEEE","17 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose ilastik as an easy-to-use tool which allows the user without expertise in image processing to perform segmentation and classification in a unified way. ilastik learns from labels provided by the user through a convenient mouse interface. Based on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation. A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier. An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of representative images, it can be exported and used to automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using the CellProfiler pipeline). ilastik is an open source project and released under the BSD license at www.ilastik.org.","1945-8452","978-1-4244-4127-3","10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5872394","Interactive classification;image segmentation;machine learning;software tools","Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Three dimensional displays;Neurons;Retina;Observers;Image color analysis","","741","1","16","IEEE","9 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a new strategy, compute-and-forward, that exploits interference to obtain significantly higher rates between users in a network. The key idea is that relays should decode linear functions of transmitted messages according to their observed channel coefficients rather than ignoring the interference as noise. After decoding these linear equations, the relays simply send them towards the destinations, which given enough equations, can recover their desired messages. The underlying codes are based on nested lattices whose algebraic structure ensures that integer combinations of codewords can be decoded reliably. Encoders map messages from a finite field to a lattice and decoders recover equations of lattice points which are then mapped back to equations over the finite field. This scheme is applicable even if the transmitters lack channel state information.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2165816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6034734","Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) networks;cooperative communication;interference;nested lattice codes;relaying;reliable computation;structured codes","Relays;Equations;Lattices;Transmitters;Mathematical model;AWGN;Encoding","","740","11","76","IEEE","6 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we introduce a new type of image regularization which gives lowest cost for the true sharp image. This allows a very simple cost formulation to be used for the blind deconvolution model, obviating the need for additional methods. Due to its simplicity the algorithm is fast and very robust.

Optimality is discussed under practical constraints such as minimum and maximum spectral efficiency restrictions, and maximum transmit power or energy limitation. It is found that in most of the considered cases, optimum power control and resource allocation for the considered resource sharing modes can either be solved in closed form or searched from a finite set.

These features include heavy-tail flight and pause-time distributions and the super-diffusive nature of mobility. Human walks are not random walks, but it is surprising that the patterns of human walks and Levy walks contain some statistical similarity. Our study is based on 226 daily GPS traces collected from 101 volunteers in five different outdoor sites. The heavy-tail flight distribution of human mobility induces the super-diffusivity of travel, but up to 30 min to 1 h due to the boundary effect of people's daily movement, which is caused by the tendency of people to move within a predefined (also confined) area of daily activities. These tendencies are not captured in common mobility models such as random way point (RWP). To evaluate the impact of these tendencies on the performance of mobile networks, we construct a simple truncated Levy walk mobility (TLW) model that emulates the statistical features observed in our analysis and under which we measure the performance of routing protocols in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The results indicate the following. Higher diffusivity induces shorter intercontact times in DTN and shorter path durations with higher success probability in MANET. The diffusivity of TLW is in between those of RWP and Brownian motion (BM). Therefore, the routing performance under RWP as commonly used in mobile network studies and tends to be overestimated for DTNs and underestimated for MANETs compared to the performance under TLW.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2120618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5750071","Delay-tolerant network (DTN);human mobility;Levy walk;mobile ad hoc network (MANET);mobile network;mobility model","Humans;Mobile computing;Global Positioning System;Mobile communication;Computational modeling;Ad hoc networks;Biological system modeling","","712","","46","IEEE","15 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This controller can simplify the coupled active and reactive power relationships, which are caused by the complex impedance in the parallel system. In addition, a virtual complex impedance loop is included in the proposed controller to minimize the fundamental and harmonic circulating current that flows in the parallel system.

For imaging problems in spectrum analysis, and passive and active radar/sonar, this basis is usually taken to be a DFT basis. However, in reality no physical field is sparse in the DFT basis or in any apriori known basis. No matter how finely we grid the parameter space the sources may not lie in the center of the grid cells and consequently there is mismatch between the assumed and the actual bases for sparsity. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of compressed sensing to mismatch between the assumed and the actual sparsity bases. We start by analyzing the effect of basis mismatch on the best k-term approximation error, which is central to providing exact sparse recovery guarantees. We establish achievable bounds for the l1 error of the best k -term approximation and show that these bounds grow linearly with the image (or grid) dimension and the mismatch level between the assumed and actual bases for sparsity. We then derive bounds, with similar growth behavior, for the basis pursuit l1 recovery error, indicating that the sparse recovery may suffer large errors in the presence of basis mismatch. Although, we present our results in the context of basis pursuit, our analysis applies to any sparse recovery principle that relies on the accuracy of best k-term approximations for its performance guarantees. We particularly highlight the problematic nature of basis mismatch in Fourier imaging, where spillage from off-grid DFT components turns a sparse representation into an incompressible one. We substantiate our mathematical analysis by numerical examples that demonstrate a considerable performance degradation for image inversion from compressed sensing measurements in the presence of basis mismatch, for problem sizes common to radar and sonar.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2112650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710590","Compressed sensing;image inversion;modal analysis;sensitivity to basis mismatch;sparse recovery","Compressed sensing;Approximation methods;Radar imaging;Discrete Fourier transforms;Sparse matrices;Sonar","","694","","48","IEEE","10 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, Bayati and Montanari have provided a rigorous and extremely general analysis of a large class of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms that includes many Gaussian approximate BP methods. This paper extends their analysis to a larger class of algorithms to include what we call generalized AMP (G-AMP). G-AMP incorporates general (possibly non-AWGN) measurement channels. Similar to the AWGN output channel case, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the G-AMP algorithm under large i.i.d. Gaussian transform matrices is described by a simple set of state evolution (SE) equations. The general SE equations recover and extend several earlier results, including SE equations for approximate BP on general output channels by Guo and Wang.","2157-8117","978-1-4577-0595-3","10.1109/ISIT.2011.6033942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033942","Optimization;random matrices;estimation;belief propagation;compressed sensing","Equations;Estimation;Approximation algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Mathematical model;Belief propagation;Approximation methods","","691","4","27","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Likewise, next-generation plug-in vehicles, which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) and EVs with vehicle-to-grid capability, referred to as “gridable vehicles” (GVs) by the authors, can reduce emission from the transportation industry. GVs can be used as loads, energy sources (small portable power plants), and energy storages in a smart grid integrated with renewable energy sources (RESs). Smart grid operation to reduce both cost and emission simultaneously is a very complex task considering smart charging and discharging of GVs in a distributed energy source and load environment. If a large number of GVs is connected to the electric grid randomly, peak load will be very high. The use of traditional thermal power plants will be economically and environmentally expensive to support the electrified transportation. The intelligent scheduling and control of GVs as loads and/or sources have great potential for evolving a sustainable integrated electricity and transportation infrastructure. Cost and emission reductions in a smart grid by maximum utilization of GVs and RESs are presented in this paper.

In addition, the need for higher overall grid efficiency and reliability has boosted the interest in the microgrid concept. High-efficiency PV-based microgrids require maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controllers to maximize the harvested energy due to the nonlinearity in PV module characteristics. Perturb and observe (P&O) techniques, although thoroughly investigated in previous research, still suffer from several disadvantages, such as sustained oscillation around the MPP, fast tracking versus oscillation tradeoffs, and user predefined constants. In this paper, a modified P&O MPPT technique, applicable for PV systems, is presented. The proposed technique achieves: first, adaptive tracking; second, no steady-state oscillations around the MPP; and lastly, no need for predefined system-dependent constants, hence provides a generic design core.

Motivated by incremental learning, we create intermediate representations of data between the two domains by viewing the generative subspaces (of same dimension) created from these domains as points on the Grassmann manifold, and sampling points along the geodesic between them to obtain subspaces that provide a meaningful description of the underlying domain shift. We then obtain the projections of labeled source domain data onto these subspaces, from which a discriminative classifier is learnt to classify projected data from the target domain. We discuss extensions of our approach for semi-supervised adaptation, and for cases with multiple source and target domains, and report competitive results on standard datasets.","2380-7504","978-1-4577-1102-2","10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126344","","Manifolds;Object recognition;Vectors;Feature extraction;Measurement;Data models;Principal component analysis","","669","11","43","IEEE","12 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We derive two sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithms, which have superior recovery performance compared to existing algorithms, especially in the presence of high temporal correlation. Furthermore, our algorithms are better at handling highly underdetermined problems and require less row-sparsity on the solution matrix. We also provide analysis of the global and local minima of their cost function, and show that the SBL cost function has the very desirable property that the global minimum is at the sparsest solution to the MMV problem.

In this paper, we provide rigorous foundation to state evolution. We prove that indeed it holds asymptotically in the large system limit for sensing matrices with independent and identically distributed Gaussian entries. While our focus is on message passing algorithms for compressed sensing, the analysis extends beyond this setting, to a general class of algorithms on dense graphs. In this context, state evolution plays the role that density evolution has for sparse graphs. The proof technique is fundamentally different from the standard approach to density evolution, in that it copes with a large number of short cycles in the underlying factor graph. It relies instead on a conditioning technique recently developed by Erwin Bolthausen in the context of spin glass theory.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2094817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5695122","Compressed sensing;density evolution;message passing algorithms;random matrix theory;state evolution","Message passing;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Convergence;Compressed sensing;Context;Sensors","","663","4","34","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among the many transmission principles that exploit multiple-antenna at either the transmitter, the receiver, or both, Spatial Modulation (SM) is a novel and recently proposed multiple-antenna transmission technique that can offer, with a very low system complexity, improved data rates compared to Single-Input- Single-Output (SISO) systems, and robust error performance even in correlated channel environments. SM is an entirely new modulation concept that exploits the uniqueness and randomness properties of the wireless channel for communication. This is achieved by adopting a simple but effective coding mechanism that establishes a one-to-one mapping between blocks of information bits to be transmitted and the spatial positions of the transmit-antenna in the antenna-array. In this article, we summarize the latest research achievements and outline some relevant open research issues of this recently proposed transmission technique.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2011.6094024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6094024","","Receivers;Wireless communication;Modulation;Transmitting antennas;MIMO;Encoding;Multiplexing","","661","1","16","IEEE","5 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Two schemes are proposed and tested in a typical 240-V/75-kVA Canadian suburban distribution feeder with 12 houses with roof-top PV systems. In the first scheme, all PV inverters have the same droop coefficients. In the second, the droop coefficients are different so as to share the total active power curtailed among all PV inverters/houses. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and that the option of sharing the power curtailment among all customers comes at the cost of an overall higher amount of power curtailed.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2010.2098483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664808","Power distribution;power quality and voltage control;power systems;solar power generation","Inverters;Voltage control;Reactive power;Load modeling;Sensitivity;Load flow;Power generation","","660","3","30","IEEE","10 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The databases are either limited to frontal views, provide only a small number of annotated images or have been acquired under controlled conditions. Hence, we introduce a novel database overcoming these limitations: Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (AFLW). AFLW provides a large-scale collection of images gathered from Flickr, exhibiting a large variety in face appearance (e.g., pose, expression, ethnicity, age, gender) as well as general imaging and environmental conditions. In total 25,993 faces in 21,997 real-world images are annotated with up to 21 landmarks per image. Due to the comprehensive set of annotations AFLW is well suited to train and test algorithms for multi-view face detection, facial landmark localization and face pose estimation. Further, we offer a rich set of tools that ease the integration of other face databases and associated annotations into our joint framework.","","978-1-4673-0063-6","10.1109/ICCVW.2011.6130513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6130513","","Face;Databases;Face recognition;Image color analysis;Face detection;Nose","","656","5","31","IEEE","16 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Let every possible value of every stego element be assigned a scalar expressing the distortion of an embedding change done by replacing the cover element by this value. The total distortion is assumed to be a sum of per-element distortions. Both the payload-limited sender (minimizing the total distortion while embedding a fixed payload) and the distortion-limited sender (maximizing the payload while introducing a fixed total distortion) are considered. Without any loss of performance, the nonbinary case is decomposed into several binary cases by replacing individual bits in cover elements. The binary case is approached using a novel syndrome-coding scheme based on dual convolutional codes equipped with the Viterbi algorithm. This fast and very versatile solution achieves state-of-the-art results in steganographic applications while having linear time and space complexity w.r.t. the number of cover elements. We report extensive experimental results for a large set of relative payloads and for different distortion profiles, including the wet paper channel. Practical merit of this approach is validated by constructing and testing adaptive embedding schemes for digital images in raster and transform domains.

The proposed algorithm, named Learn++.NSE, learns from consecutive batches of data without making any assumptions on the nature or rate of drift; it can learn from such environments that experience constant or variable rate of drift, addition or deletion of concept classes, as well as cyclical drift. The algorithm learns incrementally, as other members of the Learn++ family of algorithms, that is, without requiring access to previously seen data. Learn++.NSE trains one new classifier for each batch of data it receives, and combines these classifiers using a dynamically weighted majority voting. The novelty of the approach is in determining the voting weights, based on each classifier's time-adjusted accuracy on current and past environments. This approach allows the algorithm to recognize, and act accordingly, to the changes in underlying data distributions, as well as to a possible reoccurrence of an earlier distribution. We evaluate the algorithm on several synthetic datasets designed to simulate a variety of nonstationary environments, as well as a real-world weather prediction dataset. Comparisons with several other approaches are also included. Results indicate that Learn++.NSE can track the changing environments very closely, regardless of the type of concept drift.

This paper presents a novel bidirectional IPT system, which is particularly suitable for applications such as plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems, where two-way power transfer is advantageous. The proposed IPT system facilitates simultaneous and controlled charging or discharging of multiple EVs through loose magnetic coupling and without any physical connections. A mathematical model is presented to show that both the amount and direction of power flow between EVs or multiple systems can be controlled through either phase or/and magnitude modulation of voltages generated by converters of each system. The validity of the concept is verified by theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental results of a 1.5-kW prototype bidirectional IPT system with a 4-cm air gap.

We make progress on this long standing problem through a two-step approach. First, we propose a deterministic channel model which captures the key wireless properties of signal strength, broadcast and superposition. We obtain an exact characterization of the capacity of a network with nodes connected by such deterministic channels. This result is a natural generalization of the celebrated max-flow min-cut theorem for wired networks. Second, we use the insights obtained from the deterministic analysis to design a new quantize-map-and-forward scheme for Gaussian networks. In this scheme, each relay quantizes the received signal at the noise level and maps it to a random Gaussian codeword for forwarding, and the final destination decodes the source's message based on the received signal. We show that, in contrast to existing schemes, this scheme can achieve the cut-set upper bound to within a gap which is independent of the channel parameters. In the case of the relay channel with a single relay as well as the two-relay Gaussian diamond network, the gap is 1 bit/s/Hz. Moreover, the scheme is universal in the sense that the relays need no knowledge of the values of the channel parameters to (approximately) achieve the rate supportable by the network. We also present extensions of the results to multicast networks, half-duplex networks, and ergodic networks.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2110110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730555","Information flow;network capacity;network information theory;relay networks;wireless networks","Relays;Wireless networks;Noise level;Receivers;Noise;Channel models","","640","3","30","IEEE","14 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we consider households that operate different appliances including PHEVs and batteries and propose a demand response approach based on utility maximization. Each appliance provides a certain benefit depending on the pattern or volume of power it consumes. Each household wishes to optimally schedule its power consumption so as to maximize its individual net benefit subject to various consumption and power flow constraints. We show that there exist time-varying prices that can align individual optimality with social optimality, i.e., under such prices, when the households selfishly optimize their own benefits, they automatically also maximize the social welfare. The utility company can thus use dynamic pricing to coordinate demand responses to the benefit of the overall system.

The paper presents a method based on partitioning the system's admittance matrix and deriving an efficient time-varying Thévenin's equivalent for the converter part. The proposed method does not make use of approximate interfaced models, and mathematically, is exactly equivalent to modelling the entire network (converter and external system) as one large network.

Two regimes of attacks are considered. The strong attack regime is where the adversary attacks a sufficient number of meters so that the network state becomes unobservable by the control center. For attacks in this regime, the smallest set of attacked meters capable of causing network unobservability is characterized using a graph theoretic approach. By casting the problem as one of minimizing a supermodular graph functional, the problem of identifying the smallest set of vulnerable meters is shown to have polynomial complexity. For the weak attack regime where the adversary controls only a small number of meters, the problem is examined from a decision theoretic perspective for both the control center and the adversary. For the control center, a generalized likelihood ratio detector is proposed that incorporates historical data. For the adversary, the trade-off between maximizing estimation error at the control center and minimizing detection probability of the launched attack is examined. An optimal attack based on minimum energy leakage is proposed.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2163807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032057","Bad data detection;false data attack;power network observability;power system state estimation;smart grid security","Transmission line measurements;Power measurement;Computer security;Power transmission lines;State estimation","","637","1","31","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The computational efficiency and predictive performance of LP is challenged by application domains with large number of labels and training examples. In these cases, the number of classes may become very large and at the same time many classes are associated with very few training examples. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes breaking the initial set of labels into a number of small random subsets, called labelsets and employing LP to train a corresponding classifier. The labelsets can be either disjoint or overlapping depending on which of two strategies is used to construct them. The proposed method is called RAkEL (RAndom k labELsets), where k is a parameter that specifies the size of the subsets. Empirical evidence indicates that RAkEL manages to improve substantially over LP, especially in domains with large number of labels and exhibits competitive performance against other high-performing multilabel learning methods.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567103","Categorization;multilabel;ensembles;labelset;classification.","Classification;Predictive models;Learning systems;Complexity theory;Decision trees;Prediction algorithms","","633","2","43","IEEE","9 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, vehicular networks may exchange vehicle position and velocity information to enable safety applications. The number of nodes in one-hop communication range in such networks can be very large, leading to congestion and undesirable levels of packet collisions. Earlier work has examined such broadcasting protocols primarily from a MAC perspective and focused on selective aspects such as packet error rate. In this work, we propose a more comprehensive metric, the average system information age, which captures the requirement of such applications to maintain current state information from all other nearby nodes. We show that information age is minimized at an optimal operating point that lies between the extremes of maximum throughput and minimum delay. Further, while age can be minimized by saturating the MAC and setting the CW size to its throughput-optimal value, the same cannot be achieved without changes in existing hardware. Also, via simulations we show that simple contention window size adaptations like increasing or decreasing the window size are unsuitable for reducing age. This motivates our design of an application-layer broadcast rate adaptation algorithm. It uses local decisions at nodes in the network to adapt their messaging rate to keep the system age to a minimum. Our simulations and experiments with 300 ORBIT nodes show that the algorithm effectively adapts the messaging rates and minimizes the system age.","2155-5494","978-1-4577-0093-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5984917","","Delay;Vehicles;Throughput;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Multiaccess communication;Algorithm design and analysis;Wireless communication","","626","","26","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose to model relative attributes. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We then build a generative model over the joint space of attribute ranking outputs, and propose a novel form of zero-shot learning in which the supervisor relates the unseen object category to previously seen objects via attributes (for example, `bears are furrier than giraffes'). We further show how the proposed relative attributes enable richer textual descriptions for new images, which in practice are more precise for human interpretation.

Traditionally, each particle utilizes its historical best experience and its neighborhood's best experience through linear summation. Such a learning strategy is easy to use, but is inefficient when searching in complex problem spaces. Hence, designing learning strategies that can utilize previous search information (experience) more efficiently has become one of the most salient and active PSO research topics. In this paper, we proposes an orthogonal learning (OL) strategy for PSO to discover more useful information that lies in the above two experiences via orthogonal experimental design. We name this PSO as orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization (OLPSO). The OL strategy can guide particles to fly in better directions by constructing a much promising and efficient exemplar. The OL strategy can be applied to PSO with any topological structure. In this paper, it is applied to both global and local versions of PSO, yielding the OLPSO-G and OLPSO-L algorithms, respectively. This new learning strategy and the new algorithms are tested on a set of 16 benchmark functions, and are compared with other PSO algorithms and some state of the art evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed learning strategy and algorithms.

A P300 speller is based on this principle, where the detection of P300 waves allows the user to write characters. The P300 speller is composed of two classification problems. The first classification is to detect the presence of a P300 in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The second one corresponds to the combination of different P300 responses for determining the right character to spell. A new method for the detection of P300 waves is presented. This model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The topology of the network is adapted to the detection of P300 waves in the time domain. Seven classifiers based on the CNN are proposed: four single classifiers with different features set and three multiclassifiers. These models are tested and compared on the Data set II of the third BCI competition.

Generally, the Kalman filter algorithm is selected to dynamically estimate the SOC. However, it easily causes divergence due to the uncertainty of the battery model and system noise. To obtain a better convergent and robust result, an adaptive Kalman filter algorithm that can greatly improve the dependence of the traditional filter algorithm on the battery model is employed. In this paper, the typical characteristics of the lithium-ion battery are analyzed by experiment, such as hysteresis, polarization, Coulomb efficiency, etc. In addition, an improved Thevenin battery model is achieved by adding an extra RC branch to the Thevenin model, and model parameters are identified by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm. Further, an adaptive EKF (AEKF) algorithm is adopted to the SOC estimation of the lithium-ion battery. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated by experiments with federal urban driving schedules. The proposed SOC estimation using AEKF is more accurate and reliable than that using EKF. The comparison shows that the maximum SOC estimation error decreases from 14.96% to 2.54% and that the mean SOC estimation error reduces from 3.19% to 1.06%.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2011.2132812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5739545","Adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF);battery model;electric vehicles (EVs);parameter identification;state of charge (SOC)","Batteries;System-on-a-chip;Estimation;Adaptation model;Kalman filters;Integrated circuit modeling;Electric potential","","591","12","29","IEEE","28 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As cloud computing becomes more widespread, the energy consumption of the network and computing resources that underpin the cloud will grow. This is happening at a time when there is increasing attention being paid to the need to manage energy consumption across the entire information and communications technology (ICT) sector. While data center energy use has received much attention recently, there has been less attention paid to the energy consumption of the transmission and switching networks that are key to connecting users to the cloud. In this paper, we present an analysis of energy consumption in cloud computing. The analysis considers both public and private clouds, and includes energy consumption in switching and transmission as well as data processing and data storage. We show that energy consumption in transport and switching can be a significant percentage of total energy consumption in cloud computing. Cloud computing can enable more energy-efficient use of computing power, especially when the computing tasks are of low intensity or infrequent. However, under some circumstances cloud computing can consume more energy than conventional computing where each user performs all computing on their own personal computer (PC).","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2060451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559320","Cloud computing;core networks;data centers;energy consumption","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Green design;Computational modeling;Energy conservation;Power demand","","588","2","59","IEEE","30 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rapidly varying irradiance conditions may cause voltage sags and swells that cannot be compensated by slowly responding utility equipment resulting in a degradation of power quality. Although not permitted under current standards for interconnection of distributed generation, fast-reacting, VAR-capable PV inverters may provide the necessary reactive power injection or consumption to maintain voltage regulation under difficult transient conditions. As side benefit, the control of reactive power injection at each PV inverter provides an opportunity and a new tool for distribution utilities to optimize the performance of distribution circuits, e.g., by minimizing thermal losses. We discuss and compare via simulation various design options for control systems to manage the reactive power generated by these inverters. An important design decision that weighs on the speed and quality of communication required is whether the control should be centralized or distributed (i.e., local). In general, we find that local control schemes are able to maintain voltage within acceptable bounds. We consider the benefits of choosing different local variables on which to control and how the control system can be continuously tuned between robust voltage control, suitable for daytime operation when circuit conditions can change rapidly, and loss minimization better suited for nighttime operation.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2011.2116750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5768094","Distributed generation;feeder line;photovoltaic (PV) power generation;power flow;voltage control","Reactive power;Generators;Inverters;Voltage control;Capacitors;Power demand;Photovoltaic systems","","587","6","19","IEEE","16 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, state-of-the-art WBSN-enabled ECG monitors still fall short of the required functionality, miniaturization, and energy efficiency. Among others, energy efficiency can be improved through embedded ECG compression, in order to reduce airtime over energy-hungry wireless links. In this paper, we quantify the potential of the emerging compressed sensing (CS) signal acquisition/compression paradigm for low-complexity energy-efficient ECG compression on the state-of-the-art Shimmer WBSN mote. Interestingly, our results show that CS represents a competitive alternative to state-of-the-art digital wavelet transform (DWT)-based ECG compression solutions in the context of WBSN-based ECG monitoring systems. More specifically, while expectedly exhibiting inferior compression performance than its DWT-based counterpart for a given reconstructed signal quality, its substantially lower complexity and CPU execution time enables it to ultimately outperform DWT-based ECG compression in terms of overall energy efficiency. CS-based ECG compression is accordingly shown to achieve a 37.1% extension in node lifetime relative to its DWT-based counterpart for “good” reconstruction quality.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2011.2156795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771056","Compressed sensing (CS);ECG compression;real-time ambulatory ECG monitoring;wireless body sensor nodes","Electrocardiography;Wireless communication;Sensors;Discrete wavelet transforms;Monitoring;Real time systems;Wireless sensor networks","Algorithms;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Telemedicine;Wavelet Analysis;Wireless Technology","577","6","39","IEEE","19 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on training a separate linear SVM classifier for every exemplar in the training set. Each of these Exemplar-SVMs is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives. While each detector is quite specific to its exemplar, we empirically observe that an ensemble of such Exemplar-SVMs offers surprisingly good generalization. Our performance on the PASCAL VOC detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part-based model of Felzenszwalb et al., at only a modest computational cost increase. But the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar. Because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar, it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta-data (segmentation, geometric structure, 3D model, etc.) directly onto the detections, which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding.","2380-7504","978-1-4577-1102-2","10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126229","","Training;Support vector machines;Detectors;Calibration;Object detection;Vectors;Three dimensional displays","","574","4","22","IEEE","12 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CRDSA relies on MAC bursts repetition and on interference cancellation (IC), achieving a peak throughput T ≅ 0.55, whereas for slotted ALOHA T ≅ 0.37. In this paper we show that the IC process of CRDSA can be conveniently described by a bipartite graph, establishing a bridge between the IC process and the iterative erasure decoding of graph-based codes. Exploiting this analogy, we show how a high throughput can be achieved by selecting variable burst repetition rates according to given probability distributions, leading to irregular graphs. A framework for the probability distribution optimization is provided. Based on that, we propose a novel scheme, named irregular repetition slotted ALOHA, that can achieve a throughput T ≅ 0.97 for large frames and near to T ≅ 0.8 in practical implementations, resulting in a gain of ~ 45% w.r.t.

In this framework, occlusion, noise, and other challenging issues are addressed seamlessly through a set of trivial templates. Specifically, to find the tracking target in a new frame, each target candidate is sparsely represented in the space spanned by target templates and trivial templates. The sparsity is achieved by solving an ℓ1-regularized least-squares problem. Then, the candidate with the smallest projection error is taken as the tracking target. After that, tracking is continued using a Bayesian state inference framework. Two strategies are used to further improve the tracking performance. First, target templates are dynamically updated to capture appearance changes. Second, nonnegativity constraints are enforced to filter out clutter which negatively resembles tracking targets. We test the proposed approach on numerous sequences involving different types of challenges, including occlusion and variations in illumination, scale, and pose. The proposed approach demonstrates excellent performance in comparison with previously proposed trackers. We also extend the method for simultaneous tracking and recognition by introducing a static template set which stores target images from different classes. The recognition result at each frame is propagated to produce the final result for the whole video. The approach is validated on a vehicle tracking and classification task using outdoor infrared video sequences.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740923","Visual tracking;sparse representation;compressive sensing;simultaneous tracking and recognition;particle filter;\ell_1 minimization.","Target tracking;Pixel;Robustness;Visualization;Noise;Least squares approximation","","571","5","47","IEEE","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks. We experimentally show that the stochastic nature of STOMP allows it to overcome local minima that gradient-based methods like CHOMP can get stuck in.","1050-4729","978-1-61284-385-8","10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5980280","","Trajectory;Noise measurement;Cost function;Optimal control;Acceleration;Planning","","568","3","20","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, issues related to the reduction of PWM harmonics injection in the power grid are becoming more relevant. The use of high-order filters like LCL filters is a standard solution to provide the proper attenuation of PWM carrier and sideband voltage harmonics. However, those grid filters introduce potentially unstable dynamics that should be properly damped either passively or actively. The second solution suffers from control and system complexity (a high number of sensors and a high-order controller), even if it is more attractive due to the absence of losses in the damping resistors and due to its flexibility. An interesting and straightforward active damping solution consists in plugging in, in cascade to the main controller, a filter that should damp the unstable dynamics. No more sensors are needed, but there are open issues such as preserving the bandwidth, robustness, and limited complexity. This paper provides a systematic approach to the design of filter-based active damping methods. The tuning procedures, performance, robustness, and limitations of the different solutions are discussed with theoretical analysis, selected simulation, and experimental results.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2010.2081952","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587887","Active resonance damping;current control;grid-connected pulsewidth modulation (PWM) converters;$LCL$ filters","Resonant frequency;Damping;Converters;Frequency control;Lead;Bandwidth;Gain","","564","1","51","IEEE","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ABC algorithm is a new metaheuristic, population-based optimization technique inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of the honeybee swarm.

Furthermore, the results obtained by the proposed ABC algorithm are compared with those attained via other methods. The outcomes verify that the ABC algorithm is efficient, robust, and capable of handling mixed integer nonlinear optimization problems. The ABC algorithm has only two parameters to be tuned.

Usage of energy storage becomes mandatory when such microgrids are used to supply quality power to the loads. Microgrids have two modes of operation, namely, grid-connected and islanding modes. During islanding mode, the main responsibility of the storage is to perform energy balance. During grid-connected mode, the goal is to prevent propagation of the renewable source intermittency and load fluctuations to the grid. Energy storage of a single type cannot perform all these jobs efficiently in a renewable powered microgrid. The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) demands usage of storage with high energy density. At the same time, quick fluctuation of load demands storage with high power density. This paper proposes a composite energy storage system (CESS) that contains both high energy density storage battery and high power density storage ultracapacitor to meet the aforementioned requirements. The proposed power converter configuration and the energy management scheme can actively distribute the power demand among the different energy storages.

A distributed control strategy based on improved dc bus signaling is proposed for a modular photovoltaic (PV) generation system with battery energy storage elements. In this paper, the modular PV generation system is composed of three modular dc/dc converters for PV arrays, two grid-connected dc/ac converters, and one dc/dc converter for battery charging/discharging and local loads, which is available of either grid-connected operation or islanding operation. By using the proposed control strategy, the operations of a modular PV generation system are categorized into four modes: islanding with battery discharging, grid-connected rectification, grid-connected inversion, and islanding with constant voltage (CV) generation. The power balance of the system under extreme conditions such as the islanding operation with a full-charged battery is taken into account in this control strategy. The dc bus voltage level is employed as an information carrier to distinguish different modes and determine mode switching. Control methods of modular dc/dc converters, battery converter, and grid-connected converter are addressed. An autonomous control method for modular dc/dc converters is proposed to realize smooth switching between CV operation and maximum power point tracking operation, which enables the dc bus voltage regulation capability of modular dc/dc converters. Seamless switching of a battery converter between charging and discharging and that of a grid-connected converter between rectification and inversion are ensured by the proposed control methods. Experiments verify the practical feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2011.2127488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730500","Battery energy storage;dc bus signaling (DBS);distributed control;modular system;photovoltaic (PV) generation","Batteries;DC-DC power converters;Bidirectional control;Photovoltaic systems;Voltage control","","559","1","25","IEEE","14 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To condense the size of the dictionary, a novel dictionary selection method is designed with sparsity consistency constraint.

In this brief, the global optimality of the principle under reasonable assumptions is described from a mathematical viewpoint. Instantaneous optimal control with an appropriate equivalent parameter for battery usage is shown to be possibly a global optimal solution under the assumption that the internal resistance and open-circuit voltage of a battery are independent of the state-of-charge (SOC). This brief also demonstrates that the optimality of the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) results from the close relation of ECMS to the optimal-control-theoretic concept of PMP. In static simulation for a power-split hybrid vehicle, the fuel economy of the vehicle using the control algorithm proposed in this brief is found to be very close-typically within 1%-to the fuel economy through global optimal control that is based on dynamic programming (DP).","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2010.2061232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556022","Cost optimal control;dynamic programming (DP);fuel optimal control;Pontryagin maximum principle;road vehicle control","Optimal control;Trajectory;Hybrid electric vehicles;Dynamic programming;Fuel economy","","555","1","27","IEEE","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To rationalize the system design, the classic three-node full-duplex relay link is first amended by explicitly modeling residual relay self-interference, i.e., a loopback signal from the transmit antenna to the receive antenna remaining after cancellation. The motivation for opportunistic mode selection stems then from the fundamental trade-off determining the spectral efficiency: The half-duplex mode avoids inherently the self-interference at the cost of halving the end-to-end symbol rate while the full-duplex mode achieves full symbol rate but, in practice, suffers from residual interference even after cancellation. We propose the combination of opportunistic mode selection and transmit power adaptation for maximizing instantaneous and average spectral efficiency after noting that the trade-off favors alternately the modes during operation. The analysis covers both common relaying protocols (amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward) as well as reflects the difference of downlink and uplink systems. The results show that opportunistic mode selection offers significant performance gain over system design that is confined to either mode without rationalization.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2011.071411.102266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5961159","Full duplex;half duplex;infrastructure relays;power control;self-interference;spectral efficiency","Relays;High definition video;Interference;Protocols;Signal to noise ratio;Strontium;Switches","","553","9","42","IEEE","25 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to overcome the time delay caused by the low-pass filter, in this research, a sigmoid function is used for the switching function instead of the signum function.

Exposure measurements are initiated and carried out locally by the individual pixel that has detected a change of brightness in its field-of-view. Pixels do not rely on external timing signals and independently and asynchronously request access to an (asynchronous arbitrated) output channel when they have new grayscale values to communicate. Pixels that are not stimulated visually do not produce output. The visual information acquired from the scene, temporal contrast and grayscale data, are communicated in the form of asynchronous address-events (AER), with the grayscale values being encoded in inter-event intervals. The pixel-autonomous and massively parallel operation ideally results in lossless video compression through complete temporal redundancy suppression at the pixel level. Compression factors depend on scene activity and peak at ~1000 for static scenes.

Driver inattention is a major factor in most traffic accidents. Research and development has actively been carried out for decades, with the goal of precisely determining the drivers' state of mind. In this paper, we summarize these approaches by dividing them into the following five different types of measures: 1) subjective report measures; 2) driver biological measures; 3) driver physical measures; 4) driving performance measures; and 5) hybrid measures. Among these approaches, subjective report measures and driver biological measures are not suitable under real driving conditions but could serve as some rough ground-truth indicators. The hybrid measures are believed to give more reliable solutions compared with single driver physical measures or driving performance measures, because the hybrid measures minimize the number of false alarms and maintain a high recognition rate, which promote the acceptance of the system.

Besides the widespread sensitivity to ecological issues, such interest also stems from economic needs, since both energy costs and electrical requirements of telcos' and Internet Service Providers' infrastructures around the world show a continuously growing trend. In this respect, a common opinion among networking researchers is that the sole introduction of low consumption silicon technologies may not be enough to effectively curb energy requirements. Thus, for disruptively boosting the network energy efficiency, these hardware enhancements must be integrated with ad-hoc mechanisms that explicitly manage energy saving, by exploiting network-specific features. This paper aims at providing a twofold contribution to green networking. At first, we explore current perspectives in power consumption for next generation networks. Secondly, we provide a detailed survey on emerging technologies, projects, and work-in-progress standards, which can be adopted in networks and related infrastructures in order to reduce their carbon footprint. The considered approaches range from energy saving techniques for networked hosts, to technologies and mechanisms for designing next-generation and energy-aware networks and networking equipment.","1553-877X","","10.1109/SURV.2011.071410.00073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522467","Green networking;wired networks' energy efficiency;energy efficient network devices","Energy efficiency;IP networks;Next generation networking;Power generation economics;Environmental economics;Costs;Web and internet services;Silicon;Boosting;Hardware","","527","10","154","IEEE","26 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional methods for construction of neural network (NN) based PIs suffer from restrictive assumptions about data distribution and massive computational loads. In this paper, we propose a new, fast, yet reliable method for the construction of PIs for NN predictions. The proposed lower upper bound estimation (LUBE) method constructs an NN with two outputs for estimating the prediction interval bounds. NN training is achieved through the minimization of a proposed PI-based objective function, which covers both interval width and coverage probability. The method does not require any information about the upper and lower bounds of PIs for training the NN. The simulated annealing method is applied for minimization of the cost function and adjustment of NN parameters. The demonstrated results for 10 benchmark regression case studies clearly show the LUBE method to be capable of generating high-quality PIs in a short time. Also, the quantitative comparison with three traditional techniques for prediction interval construction reveals that the LUBE method is simpler, faster, and more reliable.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2096824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672788","Neural network;prediction interval;simulated annealing;uncertainty","Artificial neural networks;Cost function;Training;Minimization;Bayesian methods;Uncertainty","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Models, Neurological;Neural Networks (Computer);Predictive Value of Tests;Software Design","527","","37","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The power quality standards and the system resonances burden the task. In order to deal with resonances, system damping has to be implemented. Active damping is preferred to passive damping so as to improve the efficiency of the conversion. In addition, paralleled grid-connected inverters in photovoltaic (PV) plants are coupled due to grid impedance. Generally, this coupling is not taken into account when designing the control laws. In consequence, depending on the number of paralleled grid-connected inverters and the grid impedance, the inverters installed in PV plants do not behave as expected. In this paper, the inverters of a PV plant are modeled as a multivariable system. The analysis carried out enables to obtain an equivalent inverter that describes the totality of inverters of a PV plant. The study is validated through simulation and field experiments. The coupling effect is described and the control law design of paralleled grid-connected inverters with LCL filters in PV plants is clarified.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2010.2095429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645691","Active damping;grid-connected inverter;LCL filter;photovoltaic (PV) power systems","Inverters;Power harmonic filters;Damping;Approximation methods;Impedance;Transfer functions;Resonant frequency","","526","","29","IEEE","29 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Paradigms of computational intelligence (CI) have been successfully used in recent years to address various challenges such as data aggregation and fusion, energy aware routing, task scheduling, security, optimal deployment and localization. CI provides adaptive mechanisms that exhibit intelligent behavior in complex and dynamic environments like WSNs. CI brings about flexibility, autonomous behavior, and robustness against topology changes, communication failures and scenario changes. However, WSN developers are usually not or not completely aware of the potential CI algorithms offer. On the other side, CI researchers are not familiar with all real problems and subtle requirements of WSNs. This mismatch makes collaboration and development difficult. This paper intends to close this gap and foster collaboration by offering a detailed introduction to WSNs and their properties. An extensive survey of CI applications to various problems in WSNs from various research areas and publication venues is presented in the paper. Besides, a discussion on advantages and disadvantages of CI algorithms over traditional WSN solutions is offered.

This property is of high interest and relevance for problems involving a large number of objective functions. However, the high computational effort required for hypervolume calculation has so far prevented the full exploitation of this indicator's potential; current hypervolume-based search algorithms are limited to problems with only a few objectives. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a fast search algorithm that uses Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the exact hypervolume values. The main idea is not that the actual indicator values are important, but rather that the rankings of solutions induced by the hypervolume indicator. In detail, we present HypE, a hypervolume estimation algorithm for multi-objective optimization, by which the accuracy of the estimates and the available computing resources can be traded off; thereby, not only do many-objective problems become feasible with hypervolume-based search, but also the runtime can be flexibly adapted. Moreover, we show how the same principle can be used to statistically compare the outcomes of different multi-objective optimizers with respect to the hypervolume—so far, statistical testing has been restricted to scenarios with few objectives. The experimental results indicate that HypE is highly effective for many-objective problems in comparison to existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

The first optimizes the charging time and energy flows. It reduces daily electricity cost substantially without increasing battery degradation. The latter also takes into account vehicle to grid support as a means of generating additional profits by participating in ancillary service markets. Constraints caused by vehicle utilization as well as technical limitations are taken into account. An analysis, based on data of the California independent system operator, indicates that smart charge timing reduces daily electricity costs for driving from $0.43 to $0.2.

We provide a breakdown of the global carbon footprint, which reveals that production of mobile devices and global radio access network operation will remain the major contributors, accompanied by an increasing share of emissions due to data transfer in the backbone resulting from rising mobile traffic volumes. The energy bill due to network operation will gain increasing importance in cellular business models. Furthermore, technologies to reduce energy consumption are considered a key enabler for the spread of mobile communications in developing countries. Taking into account several scenarios of technological advancement and rollout, we analyze the overall energy consumption of global radio access networks and illustrate the saving potential of green communication technologies.

Neglecting the finite communication data rate constraint and under undirected graphs, a necessary and sufficient condition for consensusability under a common control protocol is given, which explicitly reveals how the intrinsic entropy rate of the agent dynamic and the communication graph jointly affect consensusability. The result is established by solving a discrete-time simultaneous stabilization problem. A lower bound of the optimal convergence rate to consensus, which is shown to be tight for some special cases, is provided as well. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition for formationability of multi-agent systems is obtained. As a special case, the discrete-time second-order consensus is discussed where an optimal control gain is designed to achieve the fastest convergence. The effects of undirected graphs on consensability/formationability and optimal convergence rate are exactly quantified by the ratio of the second smallest to the largest eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix.

Motivated by the desire to represent attitude both globally and uniquely in the analysis of rigid-body rotational motion, this article uses orthogonal matrices exclusively to represent attitude and to develop results on rigid-body attitude control. An advantage of using orthogonal matrices is that these control results, which include open-loop attitude control maneuvers and stabilization using continuous feedback control, do not require reinterpretation on the set of attitudes viewed as orthogonal matrices. The main objec tive of this article is to demonstrate how to characterize properties of attitude control systems for arbitrary attitude maneuvers without using attitude parameterizations.","1941-000X","","10.1109/MCS.2011.940459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5766283","","Attitude control;Quaternions;Aerospace electronics;Angular velocity;Orbits;Trajectory;Asymptotic stability","","514","1","41","IEEE","12 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

DC microgrids typically have distributed power architectures in which point-of-load converters behave as instantaneous CPLs to line regulating converters located upstream. Constant-power loads introduce a destabilizing effect in dc microgrids that may cause their main bus voltages to show significant oscillations or to collapse. This paper also discusses stabilization strategies to prevent these undesired behaviors from occurring. Mitigating strategies such as load shedding, addition of resistive loads, filters, or energy storage directly connected to the main bus, and control methods are investigated. Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed and recommendations are made.

In contrast to classical model based cine MRI schemes that rely on the sparsity or banded structure in Fourier space, we use the compact representation of the data in the Karhunen Louve transform (KLT) domain to exploit the correlations in the dataset. The use of the data-dependent KL transform makes our approach ideally suited to a range of dynamic imaging problems, even when the motion is not periodic. In comparison to current KLT-based methods that rely on a two-step approach to first estimate the basis functions and then use it for reconstruction, we pose the problem as a spectrally regularized matrix recovery problem. By simultaneously determining the temporal basis functions and its spatial weights from the entire measured data, the proposed scheme is capable of providing high quality reconstructions at a range of accelerations. In addition to using the compact representation in the KLT domain, we also exploit the sparsity of the data to further improve the recovery rate. Validations using numerical phantoms and in vivo cardiac perfusion MRI data demonstrate the significant improvement in performance offered by the proposed scheme over existing methods.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2010.2100850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705578","Data driven transforms;dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);low rank and sparse matrix recovery;k-t SLR","Magnetic resonance imaging;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Image reconstruction;Transforms;Minimization","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Heart;Heart;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine;Models, Cardiovascular;Phantoms, Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Respiratory Mechanics;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","514","9","45","IEEE","31 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this situation, it is important for the microgrid to continue to provide adequate power to the load. Under normal operation, each DG inverter system in the microgrid usually works in constant current control mode in order to provide a preset power to the main grid. When the microgrid is cut off from the main grid, each DG inverter system must detect this islanding situation and must switch to a voltage control mode. In this mode, the microgrid will provide a constant voltage to the local load. This paper describes a control strategy that is used to implement grid-connected and intentional-islanding operations of distributed power generation.

Several variations on the basic theme have been proposed to date, all of which share the good performance characteristics of convolutional LDPC ensembles. We describe the fundamental mechanism that explains why “convolutional-like” or “spatially coupled” codes perform so well. In essence, the spatial coupling of individual codes increases the belief-propagation (BP) threshold of the new ensemble to its maximum possible value, namely the maximum a posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. For this reason, we call this phenomenon “threshold saturation.” This gives an entirely new way of approaching capacity. One significant advantage of this construction is that one can create capacity-approaching ensembles with an error correcting radius that is increasing in the blocklength. Although we prove the “threshold saturation” only for a specific ensemble and for the binary erasure channel (BEC), empirically the phenomenon occurs for a wide class of ensembles and channels. More generally, we conjecture that for a large range of graphical systems a similar saturation of the “dynamical” threshold occurs once individual components are coupled sufficiently strongly. This might give rise to improved algorithms and new techniques for analysis.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2095072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5695130","Belief-propagation (BP) decoder;capacity-achieving codes;convolutional low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes;density evolution (DE);EXIT curves;maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder;protographs","Parity check codes;Convolutional codes;Decoding;Couplings;Sockets;Equations;Constellation diagram","","510","10","27","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reservoir is supposed to be sufficiently complex so as to capture a large number of features of the input stream that can be exploited by the reservoir-to-output readout mapping. The field of RC has been growing rapidly with many successful applications. However, RC has been criticized for not being principled enough. Reservoir construction is largely driven by a series of randomized model-building stages, with both researchers and practitioners having to rely on a series of trials and errors. To initialize a systematic study of the field, we concentrate on one of the most popular classes of RC methods, namely echo state network, and ask: What is the minimal complexity of reservoir construction for obtaining competitive models and what is the memory capacity (MC) of such simplified reservoirs? On a number of widely used time series benchmarks of different origin and characteristics, as well as by conducting a theoretical analysis we show that a simple deterministically constructed cycle reservoir is comparable to the standard echo state network methodology. The (short-term) $MC$  of linear cyclic reservoirs can be made arbitrarily close to the proved optimal value.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2089641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5629375","Echo state networks;memory capability;neural networks;reservoir computing;simple recurrent time-series prediction","Reservoirs;Thyristors;Training;Time series analysis;Topology;Communication channels;Computational modeling","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Linear Models;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics;Software Design;Time Factors","506","","42","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the clock synchronization problem is inherently related to parameter estimation, and, recently, studies on clock synchronization began to emerge by adopting a statistical signal processing framework. In this article, a survey on the latest advances in the field of clock synchronization of WSNs is provided by following a signal processing viewpoint.

Power transfer efficiency (PTE) and power delivered to the load (PDL) are two key parameters in wireless links, which affect the energy source specifications, heat dissipation, power transmission range, and interference with other devices. To improve the PTE, a 4-coil inductive link has been recently proposed. Through a comprehensive circuit-based analysis that can guide a design and optimization scheme, we have shown that despite achieving high PTE at larger coil separations, the 4-coil inductive links fail to achieve a high PDL. Instead, we have proposed a 3-coil inductive power transfer link with comparable PTE over its 4-coil counterpart at large coupling distances, which can also achieve high PDL. We have also devised an iterative design methodology that provides the optimal coil geometries in a 3-coil inductive power transfer link. Design examples of 2-, 3-, and 4-coil inductive links have been presented, and optimized for a 13.56-MHz carrier frequency and 12-cm coupling distance, showing PTEs of 15%, 37%, and 35%, respectively. At this distance, the PDL of the proposed 3-coil inductive link is 1.5 and 59 times higher than its equivalent 2- and 4-coil links, respectively. For short coupling distances, however, 2-coil links remain the optimal choice when a high PDL is required, while 4-coil links are preferred when the driver has large output resistance or small power is needed. These results have been verified through simulations and measurements.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2011.2158431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5951804","Implantable microelectronic devices;inductive links;power transfer efficiency;wireless power transmission","Coils;Implantable biomedical devices;Microelectronics;Inductive power transmission","","497","6","43","IEEE","14 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper studies methods for reducing the energy storage capacitor for single-phase rectifiers. The minimum ripple energy storage requirement is derived independently of a specific topology.

Terabit superchannels are obtained through the aggregation of multiple subcarriers using the Nyquist-WDM technique, based on a tight spectral shaping of each subcarrier which allows very narrow spacing. We first studied the optimum transmitter/receiver filtering in a back-to-back configuration. Then we investigated the maximum reach for different spectral efficiencies, after nonlinear propagation over uncompensated links with lumped amplification. Performance for systems based on both standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) and large effective area non-zero dispersion-shifted fiber (NZDSF) has been analyzed. Assuming SSMF with 25-dB span loss, we found that PM-BPSK can reach 6480 km at a net capacity of 4 Tb/s across the C band. Conversely, PM-16QAM can deliver 27 Tb/s, but over 270 km only. Note that a lower span length, the use of Raman amplification and/or pure silica-core fibers (PSCFs) can significantly increase the maximum reach, but without changing the hierarchy among the performance of modulation formats. We also show that the maximum reachable distance is approximately 2/3 of the one achievable in linear propagation at the optimum launch power, regardless of the modulation format, spacing and fiber type. As additional results, we also verified that the optimum launch power per subcarrier linearly depends on the span loss, varies with the fiber type, but it is independent of the modulation format, and that the relationship between the maximum reachable distance and the span loss is almost linear.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2010.2091254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5624553","Coherent detection;nonlinear propagation;Nyquist-WDM;PDM-BPSK;PDM-QPSK;PDM-8QAM;PM-BPSK;PM-QPSK;PM-8QAM;PM-16QAM;PDM-16QAM;superchannel","Bandwidth;Optical noise;Signal to noise ratio;Bit error rate;Optical attenuators;Optical modulation","","494","21","28","IEEE","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More often than not, drivers are unaware that they commit potentially-aggressive actions daily. To increase awareness and promote driver safety, we are proposing a novel system that uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and smartphone based sensor-fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, video) to detect, recognize and record these actions without external processing. Our system differs from past driving pattern recognition research by fusing related inter-axial data from multiple sensors into a single classifier.

The optimal solution is efficiently obtained using the K-SVD algorithm. Our algorithm learns a single over-complete dictionary and an optimal linear classifier jointly.

Furthermore, its v-i characteristic exhibits multiple local maximum power points (MPPs) during partial shading, making it difficult to find the global MPP using conventional single-stage (CSS) tracking. To overcome this difficulty, the authors propose a novel MPPT algorithm by introducing a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The proposed algorithm uses only one pair of sensors to control multiple PV arrays, thereby resulting in lower cost, higher overall efficiency, and simplicity with respect to its implementation. The validity of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through experimental studies. In addition, a detailed performance comparison with conventional fixed voltage, hill climbing, and Fibonacci search MPPT schemes are presented. Algorithm robustness was verified for several complicated partial shading conditions, and in all cases this method took about 2 s to find the global MPP.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2011.5705681","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705681","","Sensors;Photovoltaic systems;Real time systems;Voltage control;Algorithm design and analysis;Particle swarm optimization","","487","","24","IEEE","31 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance.

It is demonstrated that it is possible to defend against malicious data injection if a small subset of measurements can be made immune to the attacks. However, selecting such subsets is a high-complexity combinatorial problem given the typically large size of electrical grids. To address the complexity issue, a fast greedy algorithm to select a subset of measurements to be protected is proposed.

For the first case, we propose two distributed containment control algorithms to solve, respectively, asymptotic containment control under a switching directed network topology and finite-time containment control under a fixed directed network topology. In particular, asymptotic containment control can be achieved for any dimensional space if the network topology is fixed and for only the 1-D space if the network topology is switching.

To address these challenges, most previous approaches aim to extract visual features that are both distinctive and stable under appearance changes. However, most visual features and their combinations under realistic conditions are neither stable nor distinctive thus should not be used indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose to formulate person re-identification as a distance learning problem, which aims to learn the optimal distance that can maximises matching accuracy regardless the choice of representation. To that end, we introduce a novel Probabilistic Relative Distance Comparison (PRDC) model, which differs from most existing distance learning methods in that, rather than minimising intra-class variation whilst maximising intra-class variation, it aims to maximise the probability of a pair of true match having a smaller distance than that of a wrong match pair. This makes our model more tolerant to appearance changes and less susceptible to model over-fitting. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that 1) by formulating the person re-identification problem as a distance learning problem, notable improvement on matching accuracy can be obtained against conventional person re-identification techniques, which is particularly significant when the training sample size is small; and 2) our PRDC outperforms not only existing distance learning methods but also alternative learning methods based on boosting and learning to rank.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995598","","Computer aided instruction;Cameras;Probabilistic logic;Training;Optimization;Learning systems;Feature extraction","","479","8","18","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since developing this standard, the Joint Video Team of the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has also standardized an extension of that technology that is referred to as multiview video coding (MVC). MVC provides a compact representation for multiple views of a video scene, such as multiple synchronized video cameras. Stereo-paired video for 3-D viewing is an important special case of MVC. The standard enables inter-view prediction to improve compression capability, as well as supporting ordinary temporal and spatial prediction. It also supports backward compatibility with existing legacy systems by structuring the MVC bitstream to include a compatible “base view.” Each other view is encoded at the same picture resolution as the base view. In recognition of its high-quality encoding capability and support for backward compatibility, the stereo high profile of the MVC extension was selected by the Blu-Ray Disc Association as the coding format for 3-D video with high-definition resolution. This paper provides an overview of the algorithmic design used for extending H.264/MPEG-4 AVC towards MVC. The basic approach of MVC for enabling inter-view prediction and view scalability in the context of H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is reviewed. Related supplemental enhancement information (SEI) metadata is also described. Various “frame compatible” approaches for support of stereo-view video as an alternative to MVC are also discussed. A summary of the coding performance achieved by MVC for both stereo- and multiview video is also provided. Future directions and challenges related to 3-D video are also briefly discussed.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2098830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705534","Advanced video coding (AVC);Blu-Ray disc;H.264;inter-view prediction;MPEG-4;multiview video coding (MVC);standards;stereo video;3-D video","Transform coding;Encoding;Automatic voltage control;Video coding;Decoding;Three dimensional displays;Audio-visual systems","","476","72","61","IEEE","31 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The methods are both considerably simpler and more general than previous approaches. It is shown that an unknown matrix of rank can be efficiently reconstructed from only randomly sampled expansion coefficients with respect to any given matrix basis. The number quantifies the “degree of incoherence” between the unknown matrix and the basis. Existing work concentrated mostly on the problem of “matrix completion” where one aims to recover a low-rank matrix from randomly selected matrix elements. Our result covers this situation as a special case. The proof consists of a series of relatively elementary steps, which stands in contrast to the highly involved methods previously employed to obtain comparable results. In cases where bounds had been known before, our estimates are slightly tighter. We discuss operator bases which are incoherent to all low-rank matrices simultaneously. For these bases, we show that randomly sampled expansion coefficients suffice to recover any low-rank matrix with high probability. The latter bound is tight up to multiplicative constants.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2104999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714248","Compressed sensing;matrix completion;matrix recovery;operator large-deviation bound;quantum-state tomography","Coherence;Random variables;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Linear matrix inequalities;Compressed sensing;Convex functions","","476","","37","IEEE","17 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, their flexibility permits extensions of the Hough transform to new domains such as object tracking and action recognition. Hough forests can be regarded as task-adapted codebooks of local appearance that allow fast supervised training and fast matching at test time. They achieve high detection accuracy since the entries of such codebooks are optimized to cast Hough votes with small variance and since their efficiency permits dense sampling of local image patches or video cuboids during detection.

We propose a novel approach for multiperson tracking-by-detection in a particle filtering framework. In addition to final high-confidence detections, our algorithm uses the continuous confidence of pedestrian detectors and online-trained, instance-specific classifiers as a graded observation model. Thus, generic object category knowledge is complemented by instance-specific information. The main contribution of this paper is to explore how these unreliable information sources can be used for robust multiperson tracking. The algorithm detects and tracks a large number of dynamically moving people in complex scenes with occlusions, does not rely on background modeling, requires no camera or ground plane calibration, and only makes use of information from the past. Hence, it imposes very few restrictions and is suitable for online applications. Our experiments show that the method yields good tracking performance in a large variety of highly dynamic scenarios, such as typical surveillance videos, webcam footage, or sports sequences. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other methods that rely on additional information.

The RFT realizes the echoes spatial-temporal decoupling via joint searching along range and velocity directions, as well as the successive coherent integration via the Doppler filter bank. Besides, four equivalent RFTs are obtained with respect to the different searching parameters. Furthermore, a generalized form of RFT, i.e., generalized Radon-Fourier transform (GRFT), is also defined for target detection with arbitrary parameterized motion. Due to the similarity between the RFT and the well-known moving target detection (MTD) method, this paper provides detailed comparisons between them on five aspects, i.e., coherent integration time, filter bank structure, blind speed response, detection performance, and computational complexity. It is shown that MTD is actually a special case of RFT and RFT is a kind of generalized Doppler filter bank processing for targets with across range unit (ARU) range walk. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the equivalence among four kinds of RFTs. Also, it is shown that the RFT may obtain the coherent integration gain in the different noisy background and the target's blind speed effect may be effectively suppressed. In the meantime, both the weak target detection performance and the radar coverage of high-speed targets may be significantly improved via RFT without change of the radar hardware system.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2011.5751251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751251","","Doppler effect;Signal to noise ratio;Radar detection;Object detection;Radar cross section;Transforms","","471","","28","IEEE","15 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This clear scale separation makes the WKS well suited for a large variety of applications. Both theoretically and in quantitative experiments we demonstrate that the WKS is substantially more discriminative and therefore allows for better feature matching than the commonly used Heat Kernel Signature (HKS).

In the last decade, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and its extensions have been intensively studied to unmix hyperspectral imagery and recover the material end-members. As an important constraint for NMF, sparsity has been modeled making use of the $L_{1}$ regularizer. Unfortunately, the $L_{1}$ regularizer cannot enforce further sparsity when the full additivity constraint of material abundances is used, hence limiting the practical efficacy of NMF methods in hyperspectral unmixing. In this paper, we extend the NMF method by incorporating the  $L_{1/2}$ sparsity constraint, which we name $L_{1/2}$ -NMF. The $L_{1/2}$ regularizer not only induces sparsity but is also a better choice among $L_{q}(0 < q < 1)$  regularizers. We propose an iterative estimation algorithm for  $L_{1/2}$-NMF, which provides sparser and more accurate results than those delivered using the $L_{1}$ norm. We illustrate the utility of our method on synthetic and real hyperspectral data and compare our results to those yielded by other state-of-the-art methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2144605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5871318","Hyperspectral unmixing;$L_{1/2}$  regularizer;nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF);sparse coding","Hyperspectral imaging;Pixel;Materials;Convergence;Optimization;Matrix decomposition","","469","","51","IEEE","9 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these issues, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis and experimental results with pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) control of the DAB. The PWM control is in addition to phase-shift modulation between the two H-bridges. The analysis addresses PWM of one bridge at a time and of both bridges simultaneously. In the latter, five distinct modes arise based on the choice of PWM and load condition. The possibilities are analyzed for optimizing power density and efficiency for low-load operation.

Using a representative system model consisting of a voltage source, an LC filter, and an ideal CPL, we demonstrate that a CPL system can be stabilized by a simple passive damping circuit added to one of the filter elements.

This field is of increasing relevance for intelligent transport systems (ITSs). The decreasing hardware cost and, therefore, the increasing deployment of cameras have opened a wide application field for video analytics. Several monitoring objectives such as congestion, traffic rule violation, and vehicle interaction can be targeted using cameras that were typically originally installed for human operators. Systems for the detection and classification of vehicles on highways have successfully been using classical visual surveillance techniques such as background estimation and motion tracking for some time. The urban domain is more challenging with respect to traffic density, lower camera angles that lead to a high degree of occlusion, and the variety of road users. Methods from object categorization and 3-D modeling have inspired more advanced techniques to tackle these challenges. There is no commonly used data set or benchmark challenge, which makes the direct comparison of the proposed algorithms difficult. In addition, evaluation under challenging weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and darkness) would be desirable but is rarely performed. Future work should be directed toward robust combined detectors and classifiers for all road users, with a focus on realistic conditions during evaluation.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2011.2119372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734852","Closed-circuit television (CCTV);intersection monitoring;road user counting;road users;traffic analysis;urban traffic;vehicle classification;vehicle detection;visual surveillance","Cameras;Surveillance;Vehicles;Pixel;Roads;Computer vision","","464","3","164","IEEE","17 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In previous research, various algorithms have been proposed. Although they have been successful, there are still some margins of spatial and spectral quality that can be improved. In addition, a new method that can be used for various types of sensors is required. In this paper, a new adaptive fusion method based on component substitution is proposed to merge a high-spatial-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a multispectral image. This method generates high-/low-resolution synthetic component images by partial replacement and uses statistical ratio-based high-frequency injection. Various remote sensing satellite images, such as IKONOS-2, QuickBird, LANDSAT ETM+, and SPOT-5, were employed in the evaluation. Experiments showed that this approach can resolve spectral distortion problems and successfully conserve the spatial information of a PAN image. Thus, the fused image obtained from the proposed method gave higher fusion quality than the images from some other methods. In addition, the proposed method worked efficiently with the different sensors considered in the evaluation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2051674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5523973","Adaptive fusion framework;color distortion;component substitution (CS) fusion;high-/low-resolution synthetic component image;partial replacement","Satellites;Image fusion;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Image sensors;Image generation;Multispectral imaging;Fusion power generation;Image resolution;Data visualization","","462","","45","IEEE","26 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automatic power balancing during a grid ac fault is achieved by coordinating the battery energy storage system and the grid converter. To ensure that the system can operate under island conditions, a coordinated strategy for the battery system, wind turbine, and load management, including load shedding, are proposed.

Although many proposed average-consensus protocols are available, a fundamental theoretic problem remains open, namely, how many bits of information are necessary for each pair of adjacent agents to exchange at each time step to ensure average consensus? In this paper, we consider average-consensus control of undirected networks of discrete-time first-order agents under communication constraints. Each agent has a real-valued state but can only exchange symbolic data with its neighbors. A distributed protocol is proposed based on dynamic encoding and decoding. It is proved that under the protocol designed, for a connected network, average consensus can be achieved with an exponential convergence rate based on merely one bit information exchange between each pair of adjacent agents at each time step. An explicit form of the asymptotic convergence rate is given. It is shown that as the number of agents increases, the asymptotic convergence rate is related to the scale of the network, the number of quantization levels and the ratio of the second smallest eigenvalue to the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the communication graph. We also give a performance index to characterize the total communication energy to achieve average consensus and show that the minimization of the communication energy leads to a tradeoff between the convergence rate and the number of quantization levels.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2010.2052384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482198","Average-consensus;communication energy;data rate;distributed consensus;distributed coordination;distributed estimation;multi-agent systems;quantization;sensor network","Protocols;Convergence;Communication system control;Quantization;Space technology;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Laboratories;Control systems;Mathematics;Distributed control","","461","","43","IEEE","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the first element in the chain, its robustness is critical for the overall performance of the system. Many skull stripping methods have been proposed, but the problem is not considered to be completely solved yet. Many systems in the literature have good performance on certain datasets (mostly the datasets they were trained/tuned on), but fail to produce satisfactory results when the acquisition conditions or study populations are different. In this paper we introduce a robust, learning-based brain extraction system (ROBEX). The method combines a discriminative and a generative model to achieve the final result. The discriminative model is a Random Forest classifier trained to detect the brain boundary; the generative model is a point distribution model that ensures that the result is plausible. When a new image is presented to the system, the generative model is explored to find the contour with highest likelihood according to the discriminative model. Because the target shape is in general not perfectly represented by the generative model, the contour is refined using graph cuts to obtain the final segmentation. Both models were trained using 92 scans from a proprietary dataset but they achieve a high degree of robustness on a variety of other datasets. ROBEX was compared with six other popular, publicly available methods (BET, BSE, FreeSurfer, AFNI, BridgeBurner, and GCUT) on three publicly available datasets (IBSR, LPBA40, and OASIS, 137 scans in total) that include a wide range of acquisition hardware and a highly variable population (different age groups, healthy/diseased). The results show that ROBEX provides significantly improved performance measures for almost every method/dataset combination.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2011.2138152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5742706","Comparison;minimum s-t cut;point distribution models;random forests;skull stripping","Brain modeling;Training;Vegetation;Skull;Magnetic resonance imaging;Accuracy;Shape","Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Automatic Data Processing;Brain;Brain;Computer Simulation;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Discriminant Analysis;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Anatomic;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Skull","460","3","10","IEEE","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to develop a more tractable and practical approach, we in particular impose nonnegativity constraint on the variables in the maximum correntropy criterion and develop a half-quadratic optimization technique to approximately maximize the objective function in an alternating way so that the complex optimization problem is reduced to learning a sparse representation through a weighted linear least squares problem with nonnegativity constraint at each iteration. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust and efficient in dealing with the occlusion and corruption problems in face recognition as compared to the related state-of-the-art methods. In particular, it shows that the proposed method can improve both recognition accuracy and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, while the computational cost is much lower than the SRC algorithms.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5661789","Information theoretical learning;correntropy;linear least squares;half-quadratic optimization;sparse representation;M-estimator;face recognition;occlusion and corruption.","Robustness;Face recognition;Optimization;Noise;Training;Face;Kernel","Algorithms;Biometric Identification;Face;Female;Humans;Male;ROC Curve","458","","59","IEEE","10 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the next step, the topology of the conventional (direct) matrix converter (CMC) is introduced, and the relationship between the IMC and the CMCs is discussed in a figurative manner by investigating the switching states.

Communication constraints impose that, per transmission, only one node can access the network and send its information. The order in which nodes send their information is orchestrated by a network protocol, such as, the Round-Robin (RR) and the Try-Once-Discard (TOD) protocol. In this paper, we generalize the mentioned protocols to novel classes of so-called “periodic” and “quadratic” protocols. By focusing on linear plants and controllers, we present a modeling framework for NCSs based on discrete-time switched linear uncertain systems. This framework allows the controller to be given in discrete time as well as in continuous time. To analyze stability of such systems for a range of possible transmission intervals and delays, with a possible nonzero lower bound, we propose a new procedure to obtain a convex overapproximation in the form of a polytopic system with norm-bounded additive uncertainty. We show that this approximation can be made arbitrarily tight in an appropriate sense. Based on this overapproximation, we derive stability results in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). We illustrate our stability analysis on the benchmark example of a batch reactor and show how this leads to tradeoffs between different protocols, allowable ranges of transmission intervals and delays. In addition, we show that the exploitation of the linearity of the system and controller leads to a significant reduction in conservatism with respect to existing approaches in the literature.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2107631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5699348","Communication constraints;networked control systems (NCSs);stability;switched systems;time-varying systems;uncertain systems","Protocols;Delay;Switches;Uncertain systems;Stability criteria","","455","","52","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most prior robots have used tendons routed in straight paths along the robot. However, routing tendons through general curved paths within the robot offers potential advantages in reshaping the workspace and enabling a single section of the robot to achieve a wider variety of desired shapes. In this paper, we provide a new model for the statics and dynamics of robots with general tendon routing paths that is derived by coupling the classical Cosserat-rod and Cosserat-string models. This model also accounts for general external loading conditions and includes traditional axially routed tendons as a special case. The advantage of the usage of this coupled model for straight-tendon robots is that it accounts for the distributed wrenches that tendons apply along the robot. We show that these are necessary to consider when the robot is subjected to out-of-plane external loads.

We model rumor spreading in a network with the popular susceptible-infected (SI) model and then construct an estimator for the rumor source. This estimator is based upon a novel topological quantity which we term rumor centrality. We establish that this is a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for a class of graphs. We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on trees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has nontrivial detection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection probability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on synthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and on real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power grid network, show that the estimator either finds the source exactly or within a few hops of the true source across different network topologies. We compare rumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance centrality. We prove that on trees, the rumor center and distance center are equivalent, but on general networks, they may differ. Indeed, simulations show that rumor centrality outperforms distance centrality in finding rumor sources in networks which are not tree-like.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2158885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5961801","Complex networks;detection algorithms;graph theory;inference algorithms;maximum likelihood (ML) detection;probability","Maximum likelihood estimation;Silicon;Context;Maximum likelihood detection;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic","","452","3","27","IEEE","25 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we use the conventional mechanism which limits the maximum transmit power of the D2D transmitter so as not to generate harmful interference from D2D systems to CNs. Second, we propose a δD-interference limited area (ILA) control scheme to manage interference from CNs to D2D systems. The method does not allow the coexistence (i.e., use of the same resources) of CUEs and a D2D pair if the CUEs are located in the δD-ILA defined as the area in which the interference to signal ratio (ISR) at the D2D receiver is greater than the predetermined threshold, δD.

Usually, the observed data matrix itself is chosen as the dictionary, which is a key aspect of LRR. However, such a strategy may depress the performance, especially when the observations are insufficient and/or grossly corrupted. In this paper we therefore propose to construct the dictionary by using both observed and unobserved, hidden data. We show that the effects of the hidden data can be approximately recovered by solving a nuclear norm minimization problem, which is convex and can be solved efficiently. The formulation of the proposed method, called Latent Low-Rank Representation (LatLRR), seamlessly integrates subspace segmentation and feature extraction into a unified framework, and thus provides us with a solution for both subspace segmentation and feature extraction. As a subspace segmentation algorithm, LatLRR is an enhanced version of LRR and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Being an unsupervised feature extraction algorithm, LatLRR is able to robustly extract salient features from corrupted data, and thus can work much better than the benchmark that utilizes the original data vectors as features for classification. Compared to dimension reduction based methods, LatLRR is more robust to noise.","2380-7504","978-1-4577-1102-2","10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126422","","Feature extraction;Robustness;Motion segmentation;Noise;Vectors;Dictionaries;Strontium","","447","","29","IEEE","12 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a response to these issues, a number of Location-Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) have been proposed during the last decade. However, their assessment and comparison remains problematic because of the absence of a systematic method to quantify them. In particular, the assumptions about the attacker's model tend to be incomplete, with the risk of a possibly wrong estimation of the users' location privacy. In this paper, we address these issues by providing a formal framework for the analysis of LPPMs, it captures, in particular, the prior information that might be available to the attacker, and various attacks that he can perform. The privacy of users and the success of the adversary in his location-inference attacks are two sides of the same coin. We revise location privacy by giving a simple, yet comprehensive, model to formulate all types of location-information disclosure attacks. Thus, by formalizing the adversary's performance, we propose and justify the right metric to quantify location privacy. We clarify the difference between three aspects of the adversary's inference attacks, namely their accuracy, certainty, and correctness. We show that correctness determines the privacy of users. In other words, the expected estimation error of the adversary is the metric of users' location privacy. We rely on well-established statistical methods to formalize and implement the attacks in a tool: the Location-Privacy Meter that measures the location privacy of mobile users, given various LPPMs. In addition to evaluating some example LPPMs, by using our tool, we assess the appropriateness of some popular metrics for location privacy: entropy and k-anonymity. The results show a lack of satisfactory correlation between these two metrics and the success of the adversary in inferring the users' actual locations.","2375-1207","978-0-7695-4402-1","10.1109/SP.2011.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958033","Location Privacy;Evaluation Framework;Location Traces;Quantifying Metric;Location-Privacy Meter","Privacy;Measurement;Accuracy;Mobile communication;Gold;Random variables;Data privacy","","447","1","25","IEEE","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the capability to control the filament resistance and the reset current through the compliance current during filament formation may provide a key signature to clarify the switching mechanism. This paper provides a physically based explanation for the universal resistance switching in bipolar RRAM devices. A numerical model of filament growth based on thermally activated ion migration accounts for the resistance switching characteristics.

However, most of the existing approaches to sparse coding fail to consider the geometrical structure of the data space. In many real applications, the data is more likely to reside on a low-dimensional submanifold embedded in the high-dimensional ambient space. It has been shown that the geometrical information of the data is important for discrimination.

This paper adds three original contributions to this literature. First, it uses stochastic dynamic programming to optimize PHEV power management over a distribution of drive cycles, rather than a single cycle. Second, it explicitly trades off fuel and electricity usage in a PHEV, thereby systematically exploring the potential benefits of controlled charge depletion over aggressive charge depletion followed by charge sustenance. Finally, it examines the impact of variations in relative fuel-to-electricity pricing on optimal PHEV power management.

The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now), 21% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more than 50%. Through 2024, only 7.9× average speedup is possible across commonly used parallel workloads, leaving a nearly 24-fold gap from a target of doubled performance per generation.","1063-6897","978-1-4503-0472-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6307773","Dark Silicon;Modeling;Power;Technology Scaling;Multicore","Multicore processing;Topology;Performance evaluation;Organizations;Transistors;Microarchitecture;Instruction sets","","438","13","28","","20 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ternary logic is a promising alternative to the conventional binary logic design technique, since it is possible to accomplish simplicity and energy efficiency in modern digital design due to the reduced circuit overhead such as interconnects and chip area. A resistive-load CNTFET-based ternary logic design has been proposed to implement ternary logic based on CNTFET. In this paper, a novel design technique for ternary logic gates based on CNTFETs is proposed and compared with the existing resistive-load CNTFET logic gate designs. Especially, the proposed ternary logic gate design technique combined with the conventional binary logic gate design technique provides an excellent speed and power consumption characteristics in datapath circuit such as full adder and multiplier. Extensive simulation results using SPICE are reported to show that the proposed ternary logic gates consume significantly lower power and delay than the previous resistive-load CNTFET gates implementations. In realistic circuit application, the utilization of the proposed ternary gates combined with binary gates results in over 90% reductions in terms of the power delay product.","1941-0085","","10.1109/TNANO.2009.2036845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340626","Carbon nanotube (CNT) FET (CNTFET);multiple-valued logic (MVL) design","Multivalued logic;Arithmetic;Logic design;Logic gates;Delay;Energy efficiency;Integrated circuit interconnections;Logic circuits;Energy consumption;Adders","","436","3","23","IEEE","24 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of an in-home energy management (iHEM) application. The performance of iHEM is compared with an optimization-based residential energy management (OREM) scheme whose objective is to minimize the energy expenses of the consumers. We show that iHEM decreases energy expenses, reduces the contribution of the consumers to the peak load, reduces the carbon emissions of the household, and its savings are close to OREM. On the other hand, iHEM application is more flexible as it allows communication between the controller and the consumer utilizing the wireless sensor home area network (WSHAN). We evaluate the performance of iHEM under the presence of local energy generation capability, prioritized appliances, and for real-time pricing. We show that iHEM reduces the expenses of the consumers for each case. Furthermore, we show that packet delivery ratio, delay, and jitter of the WSHAN improve as the packet size of the monitoring applications, that also utilize the WSHAN, decreases.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2114678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734885","Cost optimization;energy and demand management;home automation;smart grid;wireless sensor networks","Home appliances;Energy management;Zigbee;Smart grids;Wireless sensor networks;Delay;Schedules","","436","3","34","IEEE","17 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent research shows that a key to success is to consider the overall shape of the posterior distribution p(x, k\y) and not only its mode. This leads to a distinction between MAPx, k strategies which estimate the mode pair x, k and often lead to undesired results, and MAPk strategies which select the best k while marginalizing over all possible x images. The MAPk principle is significantly more robust than the MAPx, k one, yet, it involves a challenging marginalization over latent images. As a result, MAPk techniques are considered complicated, and have not been widely exploited. This paper derives a simple approximated MAPk algorithm which involves only a modest modification of common MAPx, k algorithms.

In this paper, we propose an access control mechanism using ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption to enforce access control policies with efficient attribute and user revocation capability. The fine-grained access control can be achieved by dual encryption mechanism which takes advantage of the attribute-based encryption and selective group key distribution in each attribute group.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the same amount of reactive power becomes more effective for grid voltage support if the solar inverter is located at the end of a feeder. Based on this fundamental knowledge, a location-dependent power factor set value can be assigned to each inverter, and the grid voltage support can be achieved with less total reactive power consumption. In order to prevent unnecessary reactive power absorption from the grid during admissible voltage range or to increase reactive power contribution from the inverters that are closest to the transformer during grid overvoltage condition, the proposed method combines two droop functions that are inherited from the standard cos φ(P) and Q(U) strategies. Its performance comparison in terms of grid losses and voltage variation with different reactive power strategies is provided by modeling and simulating a real suburban LV network.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2011.2174821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096349","Low-voltage (LV) network;reactive power control;solar inverters","Inverters;Reactive power;Voltage control;Reactive power control;Low voltage;Sensitivity analysis;Impedance","","428","1","15","IEEE","7 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The currents are controlled in a synchronous orthogonal d,q frame using a decoupled feedback control. The reference current of proportional-integral (PI) d-axis controller is extracted from the dc-side voltage regulator by applying the energy-balancing control. Furthermore, in order to achieve a unity power factor, the q-axis reference is set to zero. The MPPT controller is applied to the reference of the outer loop control dc voltage photovoltaic (PV). Without PV array power measurement, the proposed MPPT identifies the correct direction of the MPP by processing the d-axis current reflecting the power grid side and the signal error of the PI outer loop designed to only represent the change in power due to the changing atmospheric conditions. The robust tracking capability under rapidly increasing and decreasing irradiance is verified experimentally with a PV array emulator.

Moreover, the proposed algorithm reduces the reactive power and thus reducing the converter conduction losses. An experimental prototype was implemented and some experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.

State estimation collects information from a large number of meter measurements and analyzes it in a centralized manner at the control center. Existing state estimation approaches were traditionally assumed to be able to tolerate and detect random bad measurements. They were, however, recently shown to be vulnerable to intentional false data injection attacks. This paper fully develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attacks, a special type of false data injection attacks, and analyzes their damage to power system operation in different time steps with different attacking resource limitations. Based on damaging effect analysis, we differentiate two attacking goals from the adversary's perspective, i.e., immediate attacking goal and delayed attacking goal. For the immediate attacking goal, this paper identifies the most damaging LR attack through a max-min attacker-defender model. Then, the criterion of determining effective protection strategies is explained. The effectiveness of the proposed model is tested on a 14-bus system. To the author's best knowledge, this is the first work of its kind, which quantitatively analyzes the damage of the false data injection attacks to power system operation and security. Our analysis hence provides an in-depth insight on effective attack prevention with limited protection resource budget.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2123925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5754636","Delayed LR attacks;effective protection strategies;false data injection attacks;immediate LR attacks;load redistribution attacks;state estimation","Transmission line measurements;State estimation;Power measurement;Security;Generators;Power transmission lines","","425","","23","IEEE","21 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this technical note, the stage cost is an arbitrary economic objective, which may not depend on a steady state, and the optimal cost is not a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system. For a class of nonlinear systems and economic stage costs, this technical note constructs a suitable Lyapunov function, and the optimal steady-state solution of the economic stage cost is an asymptotically stable solution of the closed-loop system under economic MPC. Both finite and infinite horizons are treated. The class of nonlinear systems is defined by satisfaction of a strong duality property of the steady-state problem.

The second phase represents the test sample as a linear combination of the determined M nearest neighbors and uses the representation result to perform classification. We propose this method with the following assumption: the test sample and its some neighbors are probably from the same class. Thus, we use the first phase to detect the training samples that are far from the test sample and assume that these samples have no effects on the ultimate classification decision. This is helpful to accurately classify the test sample. We will also show the probability explanation of the proposed method.

Bilinear pairing maps were first used to break cryptosystems (see, for example, ) and later it was realized that the extra structure could be exploited to build cryptosystems with extra properties. Boneh and Franklins identity-based encryption scheme is the most famous early example of what could be achieved using bilinear maps. After that, a plethora of cryptosystems have been designed using bilinear maps. No full and freely available implementation of pairing based cryptography was available until this work. Recent proposals fall short of this goal as either their source code is not available or because they support a limited range of elliptic curve. Moreover, neither one of implements preprocessing that is crucial to reduce the computation time. In this work, we present jPBC a Java port of the PBC library written in C. jPBC provides a full ecosystem of interfaces and classes to simplify the use of the bilinear maps even for a non-cryptographer. jPBC supports different types of elliptic curves, preprocessing which can speedup the computation significantly and it is ready for the mobile world.

In grid-connected mode, to strictly control the power factor in the point of common coupling (PCC), a droop method combined with an integral controller is adopted. Small-signal analysis of the proposed control is shown both in islanded and grid-connected mode. The proposed control scheme does not need any mode switching action.

By performing data association over a sliding window of frames, we are able to correct many data association errors and fill in gaps where observations are missed. The approach is multi-threaded and combines asynchronous HOG detections with simultaneous KLT tracking and Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo Data Association (MCM-CDA) to provide guaranteed real-time tracking in high definition video.

In this paper, we show how to implement ADP methods using only measured input/output data from the system. Linear dynamical systems with deterministic behavior are considered herein, which are systems of great interest in the control system community. In control system theory, these types of methods are referred to as output feedback (OPFB). The stochastic equivalent of the systems dealt with in this paper is a class of partially observable Markov decision processes. We develop both policy iteration and value iteration algorithms that converge to an optimal controller that requires only OPFB. It is shown that, similar to Q-learning, the new methods have the important advantage that knowledge of the system dynamics is not needed for the implementation of these learning algorithms or for the OPFB control. Only the order of the system, as well as an upper bound on its ""observability index,"" must be known. The learned OPFB controller is in the form of a polynomial autoregressive moving-average controller that has equivalent performance with the optimal state variable feedback gain.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2043839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439950","Approximate dynamic programming (ADP);data-based optimal control;policy iteration (PI);output feedback (OPFB);value iteration (VI)","Dynamic programming;Learning;Control systems;Optimal control;Feedback control;Output feedback;Stochastic systems;Upper bound;Polynomials;State feedback","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Feedback;Learning;Markov Chains;Reinforcement (Psychology)","413","4","44","IEEE","29 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Theoretical analysis reveals that this requirement can be met using wireless inter-vehicle communication to provide real-time information of the preceding vehicle, in addition to the information obtained by common Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) sensors. In order to validate these theoretical results and to demonstrate the technical feasibility, the resulting control system, known as Cooperative ACC (CACC), is implemented on a test fleet consisting of six passenger vehicles.

Most of them make a tradeoff between the accuracy and dynamic response under severe distorted and unbalanced conditions. In this paper, a multiple-complex coefficient-filter-based PLL is presented, and its unique feature lies in the accurate and rapid extraction of the positive and negative sequence components from the polluted grid voltage, and the harmonic components can also be estimated precisely, which has the potential use for selective compensation in active filter applications.

A spoofing attack occurs when a person tries to masquerade as someone else by falsifying data and thereby gaining illegitimate access. Inspired by image quality assessment, characterization of printing artifacts, and differences in light reflection, we propose to approach the problem of spoofing detection from texture analysis point of view. Indeed, face prints usually contain printing quality defects that can be well detected using texture features. Hence, we present a novel approach based on analyzing facial image textures for detecting whether there is a live person in front of the camera or a face print. The proposed approach analyzes the texture of the facial images using multi-scale local binary patterns (LBP). Compared to many previous works, our proposed approach is robust, computationally fast and does not require user-cooperation. In addition, the texture features that are used for spoofing detection can also be used for face recognition. This provides a unique feature space for coupling spoofing detection and face recognition. Extensive experimental analysis on a publicly avail able database showed excellent results compared to existing works.","","978-1-4577-1359-0","10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6117510","","Face;Histograms;Image resolution;Gray-scale","","405","26","14","IEEE","29 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the amount of intermittent renewable generation increases and the proportion of flexible conventional generating units decreases, a contribution from the demand side to primary frequency control becomes technically and economically desirable. One of the reasons why this has not been done was the perceived difficulties in dealing with many small loads rather than a limited number of generating units. In particular, the cost and complexity associated with two-way communications between many loads and the control center appeared to be insurmountable obstacles. This paper argues that this two-way communication is not essential and that the demand can respond to the frequency error in a manner similar to the generators. Simulation results show that, using this approach, the demand side can make a significant and reliable contribution to primary frequency response while preserving the benefits that consumers derive from their supply of electric energy.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2048223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5471113","Decentralized control;demand-side response;load frequency control;primary frequency control","Frequency control;Power system control;Power systems;Control systems;Production systems;Distributed power generation;Power generation;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Costs","","400","7","28","IEEE","24 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed list decoder, up to L decoding paths are considered concurrently at each decoding stage. Simulation results show that the resulting performance is very close to that of a maximum-likelihood decoder, even for moderate values of L. Thus it appears that the proposed list decoder bridges the gap between successive-cancellation and maximum-likelihood decoding of polar codes. The specific list-decoding algorithm that achieves this performance doubles the number of decoding paths at each decoding step, and then uses a pruning procedure to discard all but the L “best” paths. In order to implement this algorithm, we introduce a natural pruning criterion that can be easily evaluated. Nevertheless, straightforward implementation still requires O(L · n2) time, which is in stark contrast with the O(n log n) complexity of the original successive-cancellation decoder. We utilize the structure of polar codes to overcome this problem. Specifically, we devise an efficient, numerically stable, implementation taking only O(L · n log n) time and O(L · n) space.","2157-8117","978-1-4577-0595-3","10.1109/ISIT.2011.6033904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033904","","Arrays;Maximum likelihood decoding;Complexity theory;Equations;Error analysis;Mathematical model","","400","92","6","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their reaction–diffusion model subsequently became the dominant explanation of the phenomenon. While Jeppson and Svensson gave a preliminary study of the recovery of the degradation, this issue received only limited attention for many years. In the last decade, however, a large number of detailed recovery studies have been published, showing clearly that the reaction–diffusion mechanism is inconsistent with the data. As a consequence, the research focus shifted back toward charge trapping.

This is achieved using satellite broad-band instruments to map the top-of-atmosphere radiation fields with coincident data from satellite narrow-band imagers employed to retrieve the properties of clouds associated with those fields. This paper documents the CERES Edition-2 cloud property retrieval system used to analyze data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Visible and Infrared Scanner and by the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites covering the period 1998 through 2007. Two daytime retrieval methods are explained: the Visible Infrared Shortwave-infrared Split-window Technique for snow-free surfaces and the Shortwave-infrared Infrared Near-infrared Technique for snow or ice-covered surfaces. The Shortwave-infrared Infrared Split-window Technique is used for all surfaces at night. These methods, along with the ancillary data and empirical parameterizations of cloud thickness, are used to derive cloud boundaries, phase, optical depth, effective particle size, and condensed/frozen water path at both pixel and CERES footprint levels. Additional information is presented, detailing the potential effects of satellite calibration differences, highlighting methods to compensate for spectral differences and correct for atmospheric absorption and emissivity, and discussing known errors in the code. Because a consistent set of algorithms, auxiliary input, and calibrations across platforms are used, instrument and algorithm-induced changes in the data record are minimized. This facilitates the use of the CERES data products for studying climate-scale trends.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2144601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5783916","Climate;cloud;cloud remote sensing;Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES);MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS);Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS)","Clouds;MODIS;Ocean temperature;Land surface;Satellites;Pixel;Sea surface","","396","","58","IEEE","6 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analysis of the negative effect of the parasitic time delays and lags on the string stability indicates that the negative effect of the time delays is larger than that of the time lags.

We investigated whether software metrics obtained from source code and development history are discriminative and predictive of vulnerable code locations. If so, security experts can use this prediction to prioritize security inspection and testing efforts. The metrics we investigated fall into three categories: complexity, code churn, and developer activity metrics. We performed two empirical case studies on large, widely used open-source projects: the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel. The results indicate that 24 of the 28 metrics collected are discriminative of vulnerabilities for both projects. The models using all three types of metrics together predicted over 80 percent of the known vulnerable files with less than 25 percent false positives for both projects.

Grid-enabled passenger vehicles, like electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) can help address environmental and energy issues. Automakers have recognized that electric drive vehicles are critical to the future of the industry. However, some challenges exist to greater adoption: the perception of cost, EV range, access to charging, potential impacts to the grid, and lack of public awareness about the availability and practicality of these vehicles. Although the current initial price for EV's is higher, their operating costs are lower. Policies that reduce the total cost of ownership of EVs and PHEVs, compared to conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, will lead to faster market penetration. Greater access to charging infrastructure will also accelerate public adoption. Smart grid technology will optimize the vehicle integration with the grid, allowing intelligent and efficient use of energy. By coordinating efforts and using a systems perspective, the advantages of EVs and PHEVs can be achieved using the least resources. This paper analyzes these factors, their rate of acceleration and how they may synergistically align for the electrification of vehicles.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2011.2112750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5768097","Batteries;climate change;electric vehicle charging infrastructure;road vehicle electric propulsion","Hybrid electric vehicles;Smart grids;Energy conservation;Electric vehicles;Energy storage;Environmental factors","","393","2","167","IEEE","16 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fast and scalable simulations are therefore needed to allow for sufficient exploration of large multi-core systems within a limited simulation time budget. By bringing together accurate high-abstraction analytical models with fast parallel simulation, architects can trade off accuracy with simulation speed to allow for longer application runs, covering a larger portion of the hardware design space. Interval simulation provides this balance between detailed cycle-accurate simulation and one-IPC simulation, allowing long-running simulations to be modeled much faster than with detailed cycle-accurate simulation, while still providing the detail necessary to observe core-uncore interactions across the entire system. Validations against real hardware show average absolute errors within 25% for a variety of multi-threaded workloads; more than twice as accurate on average as one-IPC simulation. Further, we demonstrate scalable simulation speed of up to 2.0 MIPS when simulating a 16-core system on an 8-core SMP machine.","2167-4337","978-1-4503-0771-0","10.1145/2063384.2063454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6114398","Interval simulation;interval model;performance modeling;multi-core processor","Multicore processing;Load modeling;Synchronization;Accuracy;Analytical models;Kernel","","390","5","32","","29 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, customers with high rates of mission-critical transactions have split their data into two separate systems, one database for OLTP and one so-called data warehouse for OLAP. While allowing for decent transaction rates, this separation has many disadvantages including data freshness issues due to the delay caused by only periodically initiating the Extract Transform Load-data staging and excessive resource consumption due to maintaining two separate information systems. We present an efficient hybrid system, called HyPer, that can handle both OLTP and OLAP simultaneously by using hardware-assisted replication mechanisms to maintain consistent snapshots of the transactional data. HyPer is a main-memory database system that guarantees the ACID properties of OLTP transactions and executes OLAP query sessions (multiple queries) on the same, arbitrarily current and consistent snapshot. The utilization of the processor-inherent support for virtual memory management (address translation, caching, copy on update) yields both at the same time: unprecedentedly high transaction rates as high as 100000 per second and very fast OLAP query response times on a single system executing both workloads in parallel.

We first set up a general EE-SE tradeoff framework, where the overall EE, SE and per-user quality-of-service (QoS) are all considered, and prove that under this framework, EE is strictly quasiconcave in SE. We then discuss some basic properties, such as the impact of channel power gain and circuit power on the EE-SE relation. We also find a tight upper bound and a tight lower bound on the EE-SE curve for general scenarios, which reflect the actual EE-SE relation. We then focus on a special case that priority and fairness are considered and suggest an alternative upper bound, which is proved to be achievable for flat fading channels. We also develop a low-complexity but near-optimal resource allocation algorithm for practical application of the EE-SE tradeoff.

Comparison is made between V2G in the U.K., where annual electricity peak demand is reached in winter, and in China, where peak demand is reached in summer due to the air conditioning load. This paper presents mathematical correlations between charging-discharging, ambient temperature, depth of discharge (DoD), and the degradation of electric vehicle batteries based on manufacturer's data. Simulation studies were carried out for V2G in both the U.K. and China. Numerical results show that ambient temperature and DoD of a BEV battery play a crucial role in the cost of battery wear. Lead-acid and NiMH battery powered BEVs are not cost effective in V2G use due to the present electricity tariff.

In SRC, the testing image is represented as a sparse linear combination of the training samples, and the representation fidelity is measured by the l2-norm or l1-norm of coding residual. Such a sparse coding model actually assumes that the coding residual follows Gaussian or Laplacian distribution, which may not be accurate enough to describe the coding errors in practice. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, namely the robust sparse coding (RSC), by modeling the sparse coding as a sparsity-constrained robust regression problem. The RSC seeks for the MLE (maximum likelihood estimation) solution of the sparse coding problem, and it is much more robust to outliers (e.g., occlusions, corruptions, etc.) than SRC. An efficient iteratively reweighted sparse coding algorithm is proposed to solve the RSC model. Extensive experiments on representative face databases demonstrate that the RSC scheme is much more effective than state-of-the-art methods in dealing with face occlusion, corruption, lighting and expression changes, etc.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995393","","Encoding;Face;Image coding;Robustness;Maximum likelihood estimation;Training;Databases","","387","","29","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, they would be essential in developing local and global control schemes aimed at enhancing system stability and reliability. In this paper, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) technique for dynamic state estimation of a synchronous machine using phasor measurement unit (PMU) quantities is developed. The simulation results of the EKF approach show the accuracy of the resulting state estimates. However, the traditional EKF method requires that all externally observed variables, including input signals, be measured or available, which may not always be the case. In synchronous machines, for example, the exciter output voltage $E_{fd}$ may not be available for measuring in all cases. As a result, the extended Kalman filter with unknown inputs, referred to as EKF-UI, is proposed for identifying and estimating the states and the unknown inputs of the synchronous machine simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the EKF-UI method under noisy or fault conditions, compared to the classic EKF approach and confirms its great potential in cases where there is no access to the input signals of the system.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2145396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5871327","Dynamic state estimation;extended Kalman filtering;phasor measurements;power grid monitoring;power system operation;state estimation;synchronous generator","Power system dynamics;Synchronous generators;State estimation;Kalman filters;Phasor measurement units","","383","4","22","IEEE","9 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These rates represent a major technical challenge for ultrasound systems because a compromise between spatial and temporal resolution must be made in conventional approaches. Consequently, ultrasound scanners can either provide full quantitative Doppler information on a limited sample volume (spectral Doppler), or averaged Doppler velocity and/or power estimation on a large region of interest (Doppler flow imaging). In this work, we investigate a different strategy for acquiring Doppler information that can overcome the limitations of the existing Doppler modes by significantly reducing the required acquisition time. This technique is called ultrafast compound Doppler imaging and is based on the following concept: instead of successively insonifying the medium with focused beams, several tilted plane waves are sent into the medium and the backscattered signals are coherently summed to produce high-resolution ultrasound images. We demonstrate that this strategy allows reduction of the acquisition time by a factor of up to of 16 while keeping the same Doppler performance. Depending on the application, different directions to increase performance of Doppler analysis are proposed and the improvement is quantified: the ultrafast compound Doppler method allows faster acquisition frame rates for high-velocity flow imaging, or very high sensitivity for low-flow applications. Full quantitative Doppler flow analysis can be performed on a large region of interest, leading to much more information and improved functionality for the physician. By leveraging the recent emergence of ultrafast parallel beamforming systems, this paper demonstrates that breakthrough performances in flow analysis can be reached using this concept of ultrafast compound Doppler.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5688407","","Imaging;Compounds;Image color analysis;Ultrasonic imaging;Doppler effect;Image resolution;Signal resolution","Algorithms;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Phantoms, Imaging;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors;Ultrasonography, Doppler","382","8","26","IEEE","17 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Renewable energy resources must take a bigger share in the generation mix, effective demand response must be widely implemented, and high-capacity energy storage systems must be developed. A smart grid is necessary to manage and control the increasingly complex future grid. Certain smart grid elements—renewables, storage, microgrid, consumer choice, and smart appliances—increase uncertainty in both supply and demand of electric power. Other smart gird elements—sensors, smart meters, demand response, and communications—provide more accurate information about the power system and more refined means of control. Simply building hardware for renewable generators and the smart grid, but still using the same operating paradigm of the grid, will not realize the full potential for overall system efficiency and carbon reduction. In this paper, a new operating paradigm, called risk-limiting dispatch, is proposed. It treats generation as a heterogeneous commodity of intermittent or stochastic power and uses information and control to design hedging techniques to manage the risk of uncertainty.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2080250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5618534","Power system control;power system operation;real-time control;smart grid","Smart grids;Generators;Load management;Meteorology;Renewable energy resources;Load flow control;Climate change","","382","4","46","IEEE","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a fully unsupervised dynamic sparse coding approach for detecting unusual events in videos based on online sparse re-constructibility of query signals from an atomically learned event dictionary, which forms a sparse coding bases. Based on an intuition that usual events in a video are more likely to be reconstructible from an event dictionary, whereas unusual events are not, our algorithm employs a principled convex optimization formulation that allows both a sparse reconstruction code, and an online dictionary to be jointly inferred and updated. Our algorithm is completely un-supervised, making no prior assumptions of what unusual events may look like and the settings of the cameras. The fact that the bases dictionary is updated in an online fashion as the algorithm observes more data, avoids any issues with concept drift.

Then, the model matrix is considered as the measurement matrix in CS, so pan-sharpening is converted into signal restoration problem with sparsity regularization. Finally, the basis pursuit (BP) algorithm is used to resolve the restoration problem, which can recover the high-resolution MS image effectively. The QuickBird and IKONOS satellite images are used to test the proposed method.

In order to overcome the limitations by other systems, surveillance with satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is used because of its possibility to provide ship detection at high resolution over wide swaths and in all weather conditions. A new X-band radar onboard the TerraSAR-X (TS-X) satellite gives access to spatial resolution as fine as 1 m. In this paper, first results on the combined use of TS-X ship detection, automatic identification system (AIS), and satellite AIS (SatAIS) is presented. The AIS system is an effective terrestrial method for tracking vessels in real time typically up to 40 km off the coast. SatAIS, as a space-based system, allows almost global coverage for monitoring of ships since not all ships operate their AIS and smaller ships are not equipped with AIS. The system is considered to be of cooperative nature. In this paper, the quality of TS-X images with respect to ship detection is evaluated, and a first assessment of its performance for ship detection is given. The velocity of a moving ship is estimated using complex TS-X data. As test cases, images were acquired over the North Sea, Baltic Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and Pacific Ocean in Stripmap mode with a resolution of 3 m at a coverage of 30 km $\times$ 100 km.

He holds an input x ∈ {0,01l}n and wishes to broadcast a single message so that each receiver Ri can recover the bit xi. Each Ri has prior side information about x, induced by a directed graph Grain nodes; Ri knows the bits of a; in the positions {j | (i,j) is an edge of G}.G is known to the sender and to the receivers. We call encoding schemes that achieve this goal INDEXcodes for {0,1}n with side information graph G. In this paper we identify a measure on graphs, the minrank, which exactly characterizes the minimum length of linear and certain types of nonlinear INDEX codes. We show that for natural classes of side information graphs, including directed acyclic graphs, perfect graphs, odd holes, and odd anti-holes, minrank is the optimal length of arbitrary INDEX codes. For arbitrary INDEX codes and arbitrary graphs, we obtain a lower bound in terms of the size of the maximum acyclic induced subgraph. This bound holds even for randomized codes, but has been shown not to be tight.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2103753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714242","Broadcast channels;code length;error correction coding;information cost","Indexes;Receivers;Decoding;Channel coding;Servers;Vectors","","376","","30","IEEE","17 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A statistical model relating variance to spatial locations of movement is presented and used as a framework for the estimation of a motion image. From the motion image, the Kalman filter is applied to recursively track the coordinates of a moving target.

Based on the proposed scalable model, we analyze the electrical behaviors of a TSV channel with design parameter variations in the frequency domain. According to the frequency-domain analysis, the capacitive effect of a TSV is dominant under 2 GHz. On the other hand, as frequency increases over 2 GHz, the inductive effect from the RDLs becomes significant. The frequency dependent loss of a TSV channel, which is capacitive and resistive, is also analyzed in the time domain by eye-diagram measurements.

The inverter can thus be utilized as: 1) power converter to inject power generated from RES to the grid, and 2) shunt APF to compensate current unbalance, load current harmonics, load reactive power demand and load neutral current. All of these functions may be accomplished either individually or simultaneously. With such a control, the combination of grid-interfacing inverter and the 3-phase 4-wire linear/non-linear unbalanced load at point of common coupling appears as balanced linear load to the grid.

A major factor causing tracking failure is the emergence of regions having similar appearance as the target. It is even more challenging when the target leaves the field of view (FoV) leading the tracker to follow another similar object, and not reacquire the right target when it reappears. This paper presents a method to address this problem by exploiting the context on-the-fly in two terms: Distracters and Supporters. Both of them are automatically explored using a sequential randomized forest, an online template-based appearance model, and local features. Distracters are regions which have similar appearance as the target and consistently co-occur with high confidence score. The tracker must keep tracking these distracters to avoid drifting. Supporters, on the other hand, are local key-points around the target with consistent co-occurrence and motion correlation in a short time span. They play an important role in verifying the genuine target. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world video sequences show the tracking improvement when using this context information.

At the same time, practical security metrics and measurements are essential for secure software development. Hence, the need for metrics is more pressing now due to a growing demand for secure software. In this paper, we propose using a software system's attack surface measurement as an indicator of the system's security. We formalize the notion of a system's attack surface and introduce an attack surface metric to measure the attack surface in a systematic manner. Our measurement method is agnostic to a software system's implementation language and is applicable to systems of all sizes; we demonstrate our method by measuring the attack surfaces of small desktop applications and large enterprise systems implemented in C and Java. We conducted three exploratory empirical studies to validate our method. Software developers can mitigate their software's security risk by measuring and reducing their software's attack surfaces. Our attack surface reduction approach complements the software industry's traditional code quality improvement approach for security risk mitigation and is useful in multiple phases of the software development lifecycle. Our collaboration with SAP demonstrates the use of our metric in the software development process.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482589","Code design;life cycle;product metrics;protection mechanisms;risk mitigation;software security.","Software measurement;Security;Programming;Software systems;Size measurement;Time measurement;Pressing;Application software;Java;Software quality","","370","10","53","IEEE","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to limited sensor resolution capabilities, group targets (i.e., a number of closely spaced targets moving in a coordinated fashion) may show a similar detection pattern as extended objects, namely a varying number of detections whose spread is determined by both the statistical sensor errors as well as the physical extension of the group or extended object. In both cases, tracking and data association under the “one target-one detection” assumption are no longer applicable. This paper deals with the problem of maintaining a track for an extended object or group target with varying number of detections. Herein, object extension is represented by a symmetric positive definite random matrix. A recently published Bayesian approach to tackling this problem is analyzed and discussed.

The four-parameter representations (quaternion) are used to describe the spacecraft attitude for global representation without singularities. The attitude state (i.e., attitude and velocity) error dynamics is transformed to a double integrator dynamics with a constraint on the spacecraft attitude. With consideration of this constraint, a novel terminal sliding manifold is proposed for the spacecraft. In order to guarantee that the output of the NN used in the controller is bounded by the corresponding bound of the approximated unknown function, a switch function is applied to generate a switching between the adaptive NN control and the robust controller. Meanwhile, a CNN, whose basis functions are implemented using only desired signals, is introduced to approximate the desired nonlinear function and bounded external disturbances online, and the robust term based on the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to counteract NN approximation errors in the adaptive neural control scheme. Most importantly, the finite-time stability in both the reaching phase and the sliding phase can be guaranteed by a Lyapunov-based approach. Finally, numerical simulations on the attitude tracking control of spacecraft in the presence of an unknown mass moment of inertia matrix, bounded external disturbances, and control input constraints are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2101592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5699934","Adaptive control;attitude tracking;Chebyshev neural network (NN) (CNN);spacecraft;terminal sliding mode (TSM)","Space vehicles;Manifolds;Attitude control;Artificial neural networks;Chebyshev approximation;Quaternions;Polynomials","","367","","28","IEEE","24 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Human activity prediction is a probabilistic process of inferring ongoing activities from videos only containing onsets (i.e. the beginning part) of the activities. The goal is to enable early recognition of unfinished activities as opposed to the after-the-fact classification of completed activities. Activity prediction methodologies are particularly necessary for surveillance systems which are required to prevent crimes and dangerous activities from occurring. We probabilistically formulate the activity prediction problem, and introduce new methodologies designed for the prediction. We represent an activity as an integral histogram of spatio-temporal features, efficiently modeling how feature distributions change over time. The new recognition methodology named dynamic bag-of-words is developed, which considers sequential nature of human activities while maintaining advantages of the bag-of-words to handle noisy observations.

In particular, we focus on the judicious transmission of artificial interference to mask the desired signal at the time it is broadcast. Unlike previous work that assumes some prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's channel and focuses on maximizing secrecy capacity, we consider the case where no information regarding the eavesdropper is available, and we use signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) as our performance metric. Specifically, we focus on the problem of maximizing the amount of power available to broadcast a jamming signal intended to hide the desired signal from a potential eavesdropper, while maintaining a prespecified SINR at the desired receiver. The jamming signal is designed to be orthogonal to the information signal when it reaches the desired receiver, assuming both the receiver and the eavesdropper employ optimal beamformers and possess exact channel state information (CSI). In practice, the assumption of perfect CSI at the transmitter is often difficult to justify. Therefore, we also study the resulting performance degradation due to the presence of imperfect CSI, and we present robust beamforming schemes that recover a large fraction of the performance in the perfect CSI case. Numerical simulations verify our analytical performance predictions, and illustrate the benefit of the robust beamforming schemes.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2078810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580113","Imperfect CSI;MIMO wiretap channel;physical layer security;robust beamforming","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Receivers;Array signal processing;Transmitters;Robustness;Antennas","","367","4","26","IEEE","20 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Exploring the decisive influence of the system's fractional bandwidth (instead of previously claimed aperture sparsity) on the imaging capabilities of sparse aperture arrays, a MIMO linear array is designed based on the principle of effective aperture. For the antenna array, an optimized UWB antenna is designed allowing for distortionless impulse radiation with more than 150% fractional bandwidth. By combining the digital beamforming in the MIMO array with the SAR in the orthogonal direction, a high-resolution 3-D volumetric imaging system with a significantly reduced number of antenna elements is proposed.

We prove that if the probability distribution F obeys a simple incoherence property and an isotropy property, one can faithfully recover approximately sparse signals from a minimal number of noisy measurements. The novelty is that our recovery results do not require the restricted isometry property (RIP) to hold near the sparsity level in question, nor a random model for the signal.

In this paper, the PEE technique is further investigated and an efficient reversible watermarking scheme is proposed, by incorporating in PEE two new strategies, namely, adaptive embedding and pixel selection. Unlike conventional PEE which embeds data uniformly, we propose to adaptively embed 1 or 2 bits into expandable pixel according to the local complexity. This avoids expanding pixels with large prediction-errors, and thus, it reduces embedding impact by decreasing the maximum modification to pixel values. Meanwhile, adaptive PEE allows very large payload in a single embedding pass, and it improves the capacity limit of conventional PEE. We also propose to select pixels of smooth area for data embedding and leave rough pixels unchanged. In this way, compared with conventional PEE, a more sharply distributed prediction-error histogram is obtained and a better visual quality of watermarked image is observed. With these improvements, our method outperforms conventional PEE. Its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods is also demonstrated experimentally.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2150233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5762603","Adaptive embedding;pixel selection;prediction-error expansion (PEE);reversible watermarking","Distortion;Histograms;Payloads;Embedded systems;Watermarking;Decoding","","362","1","28","IEEE","5 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional design procedures of grid filters for lower power and higher switching frequency converters are not valid for a multi-MW filter connecting a medium-voltage converter switching at low frequency to the electric grid. This paper demonstrates a frequency-domain-model-based approach to determine the optimum filter parameters that provide the necessary performance under all operating conditions given the necessary design constraints. To achieve this goal, new concepts, such as virtual-harmonic content and virtual filter losses are introduced.

Our scheme assumes a broadcast model of communication (where all nodes transmit the same value to all of their neighbors) and utilizes a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each node updates its value to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors. We consider a node to be malicious or faulty if, instead of following the predefined linear strategy, it updates its value arbitrarily at each time-step (perhaps conspiring with other malicious nodes in the process). We show that the topology of the network completely characterizes the resilience of linear iterative strategies to this kind of malicious behavior. First, when the network contains 2f or fewer vertex-disjoint paths from some node xj to another node xi , we provide an explicit strategy for f malicious nodes to follow in order to prevent node xi from receiving any information about xj's value. Next, if node xi has at least 2f+1 vertex-disjoint paths from every other (non-neighboring) node, we show that xi is guaranteed to be able to calculate any arbitrary function of all node values when the number of malicious nodes is f or less. Furthermore, we show that this function can be calculated after running the linear iteration for a finite number of time-steps (upper bounded by the number of nodes in the network) with almost any set of weights (i.e., for all weights except for a set of measure zero).","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2010.2088690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5605238","Distributed consensus;distributed function calculation;fault-tolerant consensus;multi-agent systems;networked control;observability theory;structured systems;wireless broadcast model","Network topology;Multiagent systems;Sensors;Nickel;Communities;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","","362","1","38","IEEE","18 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Further, with high probability, the recovery error from noisy data is within a constant of three targets: (1) the minimax risk, (2) an “oracle” error that would be available if the column space of the matrix were known, and (3) a more adaptive “oracle” error which would be available with the knowledge of the column space corresponding to the part of the matrix that stands above the noise. Lastly, the error bounds regarding low-rank matrices are extended to provide an error bound when the matrix has full rank with decaying singular values.

Terrain variations affect not only the position of a given point on the Earth's surface but also the brightness of the radar return as expressed in radar geometry. Without treatment, the hill-slope modulations of the radiometry threaten to overwhelm weaker thematic land cover induced backscatter differences, and comparison of backscatter from multiple satellites, modes, or tracks loses meaning. The ASAR & PALSAR sensors provide state vectors and timing with higher absolute accuracy than was previously available, allowing them to directly support accurate tie-point-free geolocation and radiometric normalization of their imagery. Given accurate knowledge of the acquisition geometry of a SAR image together with a digital height model (DHM) of the area imaged, radiometric image simulation is applied to estimate the local illuminated area for each point in the image. Ellipsoid-based or sigma naught (σ0) based incident angle approximations that fail to reproduce the effect of topographic variation in their sensor model are contrasted with a new method that integrates terrain variations with the concept of gamma naught (γ0) backscatter, converting directly from beta naught (β0) to a newly introduced terrain-flattened γ0 normalization convention. The interpretability of imagery treated in this manner is improved in comparison to processing based on conventional ellipsoid or local incident angle based σ0 normalization.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2120616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5752845","Radar cross sections;radar scattering;radar terrain factors","Geometry;Backscatter;Radar imaging;Sensors;Spaceborne radar;Radiometry","","360","","23","IEEE","21 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is done by using a recently introduced logistic regression via splitting and augmented Lagrangian algorithm. Second, we use the information acquired in the previous step to segment the hyperspectral image using a multilevel logistic prior that encodes the spatial information. In order to reduce the cost of acquiring large training sets, active learning is performed based on the MLR posterior probabilities. Another contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new active sampling approach, called modified breaking ties, which is able to provide an unbiased sampling. Furthermore, we have implemented our proposed method in an efficient way. For instance, in order to obtain the time-consuming maximum a posteriori segmentation, we use the α-expansion min-cut-based integer optimization algorithm.

This algorithm is based on the concept that a pixel in HSI lies in a low-dimensional subspace and thus can be represented as a sparse linear combination of the training samples. The sparse representation (a sparse vector corresponding to the linear combination of a few selected training samples) of a test sample can be recovered by solving an l0-norm minimization problem. With the recent development of the compressed sensing theory, such minimization problem can be recast as a standard linear programming problem or efficiently approximated by greedy pursuit algorithms. Once the sparse vector is obtained, the class of the test sample can be determined by the characteristics of the sparse vector on reconstruction. In addition to the constraints on sparsity and reconstruction accuracy, we also exploit the fact that in HSI the neighboring pixels have a similar spectral characteristic (smoothness). In our proposed algorithm, a smoothness constraint is also imposed by forcing the vector Laplacian at each reconstructed pixel to be minimum all the time within the minimization process. The proposed sparsity-based algorithm is applied to several hyperspectral imagery to detect targets of interest. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms the classical hyperspectral target detection algorithms, such as the popular spectral matched filters, matched subspace detectors, adaptive subspace detectors, as well as binary classifiers such as support vector machines.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2113170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5711635","Hyperspectral imagery;sparse recovery;sparse representation;spatial correlation;target detection","Pixel;Training;Dictionaries;Support vector machines;Detectors;Object detection;Kernel","","357","","40","IEEE","10 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem is known to provide up to four solutions that can then be disambiguated using a fourth point. All existing solutions attempt to first solve for the position of the points in the camera reference frame, and then compute the position and orientation of the camera in the world frame, which alignes the two point sets. In contrast, in this paper we propose a novel closed-form solution to the P3P problem, which computes the aligning transformation directly in a single stage, without the intermediate derivation of the points in the camera frame. This is made possible by introducing intermediate camera and world reference frames, and expressing their relative position and orientation using only two parameters. The projection of a world point into the parametrized camera pose then leads to two conditions and finally a quartic equation for finding up to four solutions for the parameter pair. A subsequent backsubstitution directly leads to the corresponding camera poses with respect to the world reference frame. We show that the proposed algorithm offers accuracy and precision comparable to a popular, standard, state-of-the-art approach but at much lower computational cost (15 times faster). Furthermore, it provides improved numerical stability and is less affected by degenerate configurations of the selected world points. The superior computational efficiency is particularly suitable for any RANSAC-outlier-rejection step, which is always recommended before applying PnP or non-linear optimization of the final solution.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995464","","Cameras;Three dimensional displays;Closed-form solution;Polynomials;Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Optimization","","354","8","35","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such services require dependable wireless vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communications providing robust connectivity at moderate data rates. The development of such dependable vehicular communication systems and standards requires accurate models of the propagation channel in all relevant environments and scenarios. Key characteristics of vehicular channels are shadowing by other vehicles, high Doppler shifts, and inherent nonstationarity. All have major impact on the data packet transmission reliability and latency. This paper provides an overview of the existing vehicular channel measurements in a variety of important environments, and the observed channel characteristics (such as delay spreads and Doppler spreads) therein. We briefly discuss the available vehicular channel models and their respective merits and deficiencies. Finally, we discuss the implications for wireless system design with a strong focus on IEEE 802.11p. On the road towards a dependable vehicular network, room for improvements in coverage, reliability, scalability, and delay are highlighted, calling for evolutionary improvements in the IEEE 802.11p standard.

In this paper, the analytical inverse of a generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is formulated to compensate for hysteresis nonlinearities of smart actuators. The generalized model was modified to ensure its continuity, and its validity in characterizing different hysteresis properties is briefly demonstrated by comparing the model responses with the measured data for the magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys (SMA), and piezo micropositioning actuators. Since the proposed generalized model is a mere extension of the analytically invertible classical Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, an inverse of the generalized model is formulated using the inverse of the classical model together with those of the envelope functions of the generalized play operator. The effectiveness of the inverse of the generalized model in compensating for the symmetric and asymmetric saturated hysteresis effects is subsequently investigated through simulations for a magnetostrictive and a SMA actuators, and through preliminary experiments performed on a piezo micropositioning stage. The simulation results suggest that the inverse of the generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model can be conveniently applied as a feedforward compensator to effectively mitigate the effects of the asymmetric and saturated hysteresis in magnetostrictive and SMA actuators. The experimental results further revealed that the proposed generalized analytical inverse model can be conveniently implemented as a real-time feedforward compensator to compensate for hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezo micropositioining stage.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2010.2052366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510155","Analytical inversion;asymmetric hysteresis;generalized Prandtl–Ishlinskii model;hysteresis compensation;micropositioning;piezo micropositioning stage;smart actuators","Analytical models;Hysteresis;Magnetic analysis;Magnetostriction;Saturation magnetization;Intelligent actuators;Inverse problems;Magnetic properties;Shape measurement;Shape memory alloys","","352","1","29","IEEE","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has proved to be effective since most approaches are generally able to also result in minimum overall energy losses. However, the increasing penetration of (firm and variable) distributed generation (DG) raises concerns on the actual benefits of loss minimization studies that are limited to a single demand/generation scenario. Here, a multiperiod AC optimal power flow (OPF) is used to determine the optimal accommodation of (renewable) DG in a way that minimizes the system energy losses. In addition, control schemes expected to be part of the future Smart Grid, such as coordinated voltage control and dispatchable DG power factor, are embedded in the OPF formulation to explore the extra loss reduction benefits that can be harnessed with such technologies. The trade-off between energy losses and more generation capacity is also investigated. The methodology is applied to a generic U.K. distribution network and results demonstrate the significant impact that considering time-varying characteristics has on the energy loss minimization problem and highlight the gains that the flexibility provided by innovative control strategies can have on both loss minimization and generation capacity.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2049036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5471114","Distributed generation;distribution networks;energy losses;optimal power flow;smart grids;wind power","Energy loss;Distributed control;Load flow;Power generation economics;Environmental economics;Voltage control;Smart grids;Reactive power;Minimization methods;Wind energy generation","","350","1","40","IEEE","24 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, there has been a shift toward subtle, continuous, and context-specific interpretations of affective displays recorded in naturalistic and real-world settings, and toward multimodal analysis and recognition of human affect. Converging with this shift, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach in the literature that: 1) fuses facial expression, shoulder gesture, and audio cues for dimensional and continuous prediction of emotions in valence and arousal space, 2) compares the performance of two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques applied to the target problem, the bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (BLSTM-NNs), and Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR), and 3) proposes an output-associative fusion framework that incorporates correlations and covariances between the emotion dimensions. Evaluation of the proposed approach has been done using the spontaneous SAL data from four subjects and subject-dependent leave-one-sequence-out cross validation. The experimental results obtained show that: 1) on average, BLSTM-NNs outperform SVR due to their ability to learn past and future context, 2) the proposed output-associative fusion framework outperforms feature-level and model-level fusion by modeling and learning correlations and patterns between the valence and arousal dimensions, and 3) the proposed system is well able to reproduce the valence and arousal ground truth obtained from human coders.","1949-3045","","10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740839","Dimensional affect recognition;continuous affect prediction;valence and arousal dimensions;facial expressions;shoulder gestures;emotional acoustic signals;multicue and multimodal fusion;output-associative fusion.","Feature extraction;Visualization;Emotion recognition;Acoustics;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Sensors","","349","14","67","IEEE","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the grid inductive impedance increases, the low-frequency gain and bandwidth of the PI controller have to be decreased to keep the system stable, thus degrading the tracking performance and disturbance rejection capability. To deal with this stability problem, an H∞ controller with explicit robustness in terms of grid-impedance variations is proposed to incorporate the desired tracking performance and the stability margin. By properly selecting the weighting functions, the synthesized H∞ controller exhibits high gains at the vicinity of the line frequency, similar to the traditional proportional-resonant controller; meanwhile, it has enough high-frequency attenuation to keep the control loop stable. An inner inverter-output-current loop with high bandwidth is also designed to get better disturbance rejection capability. The selection of weighting functions, inner inverter-output-current loop design, and system disturbance rejection capability are discussed in detail in this paper. Both simulation and experimental results of the proposed H∞ controller as well as the conventional PI controller are given and compared, which validates the performance of the proposed control scheme.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2010.2045998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437252","Current control;distributed generation (DG);grid impedance;proportional-resonant (PR) controller;robust control;voltage-source inverter (VSI)","Robust control;Inverters;Proportional control;Robust stability;Stability analysis;Control systems;Bandwidth;Filters;Voltage control;Current control","","347","","25","IEEE","22 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By using the recently proposed power-synchronization control, the short-circuit capacities of the ac systems are no longer the limiting factors, but rather the load angles. For the analysis of the stability, the Jacobian transfer matrix concept has been introduced. The right-half plane (RHP) transmission zero of the ac Jacobian transfer matrix moves closer to the origin with larger load angles. The paper shows that, due to the bandwidth limitation imposed by the RHP zero on the direct-voltage control of the VSC, high dc-capacitance values are needed for such applications. In addition, the paper proposes a control structure particularly designed for weak-ac-system interconnections. As an example, it is shown that the proposed control structure enables a power transmission of 0.86 p.u. from a system with the short-circuit ratio (SCR) of 1.2 to a system with an SCR of 1.0. This should be compared to previous results for VSC based HVDC using vector current control. In this case, only 0.4 p.u. power transmission can be achieved for dc link where only one of the ac systems has an SCR of 1.0.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2047875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5471091","Control;converters;HVDC;power systems;stability","Power system interconnection;Control systems;Converters;Power conversion;Jacobian matrices;Thyristors;HVDC transmission;Power transmission;Voltage control;Analog-digital conversion","","346","3","22","IEEE","24 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two different cooperation schemes are considered. In the first scheme, cooperating nodes retransmit a weighted version of the source signal in a decode-and-forward (DF) fashion. In the second scheme, referred to as cooperative jamming (CJ), while the source is transmitting, cooperating nodes transmit weighted noise to confound the eavesdropper. We investigate two objectives: i) maximization of the achievable secrecy rate subject to a total power constraint and ii) minimization of the total power transmit power under a secrecy rate constraint. For the first design objective, we obtain the exact solution for the DF scheme for the case of a single or multiple eavasdroppers, while for the CJ scheme with a single eavesdropper we reduce the multivariate problem to a problem of one variable. For the second design objective, existing work introduces additional constraints in order to reduce the degree of difficulty, thus resulting in suboptimal solutions. Our work raises those constraints, and obtains either an analytical solution for the DF scheme with a single eavesdropper, or reduces the multivariate problem to a problem of one variable for the CJ scheme with a single eavesdropper. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed results and compare them to existing work.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2159598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876337","Node cooperation;physical layer based security;secrecy rate;semi-definite programming","Relays;Protocols;Security;Jamming;Optimization;Noise;Physical layer","","345","","31","IEEE","16 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In most multimedia applications, the final output is interpreted by human senses, which are not perfect. This fact obviates the need to produce exactly correct numerical outputs. Previous research in this context exploits error-resiliency primarily through voltage over-scaling, utilizing algorithmic and architectural techniques to mitigate the resulting errors. In this paper, we propose logic complexity reduction as an alternative approach to take advantage of the relaxation of numerical accuracy. We demonstrate this concept by proposing various imprecise or approximate Full Adder (FA) cells with reduced complexity at the transistor level, and utilize them to design approximate multi-bit adders. In addition to the inherent reduction in switched capacitance, our techniques result in significantly shorter critical paths, enabling voltage scaling. We design architectures for video and image compression algorithms using the proposed approximate arithmetic units, and evaluate them to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Post-layout simulations indicate power savings of up to 60% and area savings of up to 37% with an insignificant loss in output quality, when compared to existing implementations.","","978-1-61284-660-6","10.1109/ISLPED.2011.5993675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5993675","Approximate computing;Low-power;Mirror adder","Approximation methods;Adders;Capacitance;Discrete cosine transforms;Digital signal processing;Approximation algorithms;Transistors","","344","2","18","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a secret transmit beamforming approach using a quality-of-service (QoS)-based perspective. Specifically, we establish design formulations that: i) constrain the maximum allowable signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) of the eavesdroppers, and that ii) provide the intended receiver with a satisfactory SINR through either a guaranteed SINR constraint or SINR maximization. The proposed designs incorporate a relatively new idea called artificial noise (AN), where a suitable amount of AN is added in the transmitted signal to confuse the eavesdroppers. Our designs advocate joint optimization of the transmit weights and AN spatial distribution in accordance with the channel state information (CSI) of the intended receiver and eavesdroppers. Our formulated design problems are shown to be NP-hard in general. We deal with this difficulty by using semidefinite relaxation (SDR), an approximation technique based on convex optimization. Interestingly, we prove that SDR can exactly solve the design problems for a practically representative class of problem instances; e.g., when the intended receiver's instantaneous CSI is known. Extensions to the colluding-eavesdropper scenario and the multi-intended-receiver scenario are also examined. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed AN-aided designs can yield significant power savings or SINR enhancement compared to some other methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2094610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5643181","Artificial noise;physical-layer secure communications;semidefinite relaxation;transmit beamforming","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Array signal processing;Receivers;Optimization;Minimization;Quality of service","","344","3","38","IEEE","22 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given this background, under the chance constrained programming (CCP) framework, a new method is presented to handle these uncertainties in the optimal siting and sizing of DGs. First, a mathematical model of CCP is developed with the minimization of the DGs' investment cost, operating cost, maintenance cost, network loss cost, as well as the capacity adequacy cost as the objective, security limitations as constraints, and the siting and sizing of DGs as optimization variables. Then, a Monte Carlo simulation-embedded genetic-algorithm-based approach is employed to solve the developed CCP model. Finally, the IEEE 37-node test feeder is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed model and method, and the test results have demonstrated that the voltage profile and power-supply reliability for customers can be significantly improved and the network loss substantially reduced.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2165972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026244","Chance-constrained programming;distributed generator;distribution system;genetic algorithm;Monte Carlo simulation;plug-in electric vehicle;siting and sizing","Distributed power generation;Monte Carlo methods;Uncertainty;Electric vehicles;Genetic algorithms","","343","","30","IEEE","23 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples of face attributes include gender, age, jaw shape, nose size, etc. The advantages of an attribute-based representation for vision tasks are manifold: They can be composed to create descriptions at various levels of specificity; they are generalizable, as they can be learned once and then applied to recognize new objects or categories without any further training; and they are efficient, possibly requiring exponentially fewer attributes (and training data) than explicitly naming each category. We show how one can create and label large data sets of real-world images to train classifiers which measure the presence, absence, or degree to which an attribute is expressed in images. These classifiers can then automatically label new images. We demonstrate the current effectiveness-and explore the future potential-of using attributes for face verification and image search via human and computational experiments.

The analysis and design of PR controllers is usually performed by Bode diagrams and phase-margin criterion. However, this approach presents some limitations when resonant frequencies are higher than the crossover frequency defined by the proportional gain. This condition occurs in selective harmonic control and applications with high reference frequency with respect to the switching frequency, e.g., high-power converters with a low switching frequency. In such cases, additional 0-dB crossings (phase margins) appear; therefore, the usual methods for simple systems are no longer valid. In addition, VPI controllers always present multiple 0-dB crossings in their frequency response. In this paper, the proximity to the instability of PR and VPI controllers is evaluated and optimized through Nyquist diagrams. A systematic method is proposed to obtain the highest stability and avoidance of closed-loop anomalous peaks: it is achieved by the minimization of the inverse of the Nyquist trajectory distance to the critical point, i.e., the sensitivity function. Finally, several experimental tests, including an active power filter that operates at a low switching frequency and compensates harmonics up to the Nyquist frequency, validate the theoretical approach.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2011.2126535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5729363","Current control;power conditioning;pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) power converters;resonant controllers","Resonant frequency;Stability analysis;Sensitivity;Frequency control;Harmonic analysis;Current control","","341","2","53","IEEE","10 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ICDA is a nonparametric method for discriminant analysis based on the application of a Bayesian classification rule on a signal composed by ICs. The method uses IC Analysis (ICA) to choose a transform matrix so that the transformed components are as independent as possible. When the data are projected in an independent space, the estimates of their multivariate density function can be computed in a much easier way as the product of univariate densities. A nonparametric kernel density estimator is used to compute the density functions of each IC. Finally, the Bayes rule is applied for the classification assignment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using ICDA for the classification of hyperspectral images. We study the influence of the algorithm used to enforce independence and of the number of IC retained for the classification, proposing an effective method to estimate the most suitable number. The proposed method is applied to several hyperspectral images, in order to test different data set conditions (urban/agricultural area, size of the training set, and type of sensor).

By referring to an impulsive delay differential inequality, we investigate the globally exponential synchronization of linearly coupled NNs with impulsive disturbances. The derived sufficient condition is closely related with the time delay, impulse strengths, average impulsive interval, and coupling structure of the systems.

Given this level of the SNR, the noise level of the data cubes is relatively low. The conventional image denoising methods are likely to remove the fine features of the data cubes during the denoising process. We propose to decorrelate the image information of hyperspectral data cubes from the noise by using principal component analysis (PCA) and removing the noise in the low-energy PCA output channels. The first PCA output channels contain a majority of the total energy of a data cube, and the rest PCA output channels contain a small amount of energy. It is believed that the low-energy channels also contain a large amount of noise. Removing noise in the low-energy PCA output channels will not harm the fine features of the data cubes. A 2-D bivariate wavelet thresholding method is used to remove the noise for low-energy PCA channels, and a 1-D dual-tree complex wavelet transform denoising method is used to remove the noise of the spectrum of each pixel of the data cube. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed denoising method produces better denoising results than other denoising methods published in the literature.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2075937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607305","Denoising;hyperspectral imagery;principal component analysis (PCA);wavelet shrinkage","Noise reduction;Principal component analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Wavelet transforms;Hyperspectral imaging","","341","","31","Crown","21 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We provide a practical approximation of this theoretical MSE estimate for the tractable optimization of arbitrary transform-domain thresholding. We then propose a pointwise estimator for undecimated filterbank transforms, which consists of subband-adaptive thresholding functions with signal-dependent thresholds that are globally optimized in the image domain. We finally demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques that are specifically tailored to the estimation of Poisson intensities.

It combines spatial modulation (SM) and space-time block coding (STBC) to take advantage of the benefits of both while avoiding their drawbacks. In the STBC-SM scheme, the transmitted information symbols are expanded not only to the space and time domains but also to the spatial (antenna) domain which corresponds to the on/off status of the transmit antennas available at the space domain, and therefore both core STBC and antenna indices carry information. A general technique is presented for the design of the STBC-SM scheme for any number of transmit antennas. Besides the high spectral efficiency advantage provided by the antenna domain, the proposed scheme is also optimized by deriving its diversity and coding gains to exploit the diversity advantage of STBC. A low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoder is given for the new scheme which profits from the orthogonality of the core STBC. The performance advantages of the STBC-SM over simple SM and over V-BLAST are shown by simulation results for various spectral efficiencies and are supported by the derivation of a closed form expression for the union bound on the bit error probability.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121410.100149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672371","Maximum likelihood decoding;MIMO systems;space-time block codes/coding;spatial modulation","Transmitting antennas;Binary phase shift keying;MIMO;Decoding","","338","","23","IEEE","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But for protecting data privacy, sensitive data has to be encrypted before outsourcing, which obsoletes traditional data utilization based on plaintext keyword search. Thus, enabling an encrypted cloud data search service is of paramount importance. Considering the large number of data users and documents in the cloud, it is necessary to allow multiple keywords in the search request and return documents in the order of their relevance to these keywords. Related works on searchable encryption focus on single keyword search or Boolean keyword search, and rarely sort the search results. In this paper, for the first time, we define and solve the challenging problem of privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data (MRSE). We establish a set of strict privacy requirements for such a secure cloud data utilization system. Among various multi-keyword semantics, we choose the efficient similarity measure of “coordinate matching”, i.e., as many matches as possible, to capture the relevance of data documents to the search query. We further use “inner product similarity” to quantitatively evaluate such similarity measure. We first propose a basic idea for the MRSE based on secure inner product computation, and then give two significantly improved MRSE schemes to achieve various stringent privacy requirements in two different threat models. Thorough analysis investigating privacy and efficiency guarantees of proposed schemes is given. Experiments on the real-world dataset further show proposed schemes indeed introduce low overhead on computation and communication.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9921-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935306","","Servers;Data privacy;Indexes;Privacy;Cloud computing;Encryption","","338","","29","IEEE","30 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is the wiretap channel model introduced by Wyner in 1975. The goal is to design a coding scheme that makes it possible for Alice to communicate both reliably and securely. Reliability is measured in terms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security is measured in terms of the mutual information between the message and Eve's observations. Wyner showed that the situation is characterized by a single constant ${\cal C}_{s}$, called the secrecy capacity, which has the following meaning: for all $\varepsilon \!\! > \!\! 0$ , there exist coding schemes of rate $R\! \geqslant {\cal C}_{s} \! \! - \! \varepsilon$ that asymptotically achieve the reliability and security objectives. However, his proof of this result is based upon a random-coding argument. To date, despite considerable research effort, the only case where we know how to construct coding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when Eve's channel $C_{2}$ is an erasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2162275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6034749","Channel polarization;information-theoretic security;polar codes;secrecy capacity;strong security;wiretap channel","Encoding;Decoding;Argon;Security;Reliability;Monte Carlo methods;Channel capacity","","338","4","43","IEEE","6 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The general effects of metasurface modulation are similar to those obtained in solid (volumetric) inhomogeneous metamaterial as predicted by the transformation optics-namely, readdressing the propagation path of an incident wave.

To explore the relationship between classification error, controller delay, and real-time controllability, 13 able-bodied subjects were trained to operate a virtual upper-limb prosthesis using pattern recognition of electromyogram (EMG) signals. Classification error and controller delay were varied by training different classifiers with a variety of analysis window lengths ranging from 50 to 550 ms and either two or four EMG input channels. Offline analysis showed that classification error decreased with longer window lengths ( p <; 0.01). Real-time controllability was evaluated with the target achievement control (TAC) test, which prompted users to maneuver the virtual prosthesis into various target postures. The results indicated that user performance improved with lower classification error (p <; 0.01 ) and was reduced with longer controller delay ( p <; 0.01), as determined by the window length. Therefore, both of these effects should be considered when choosing a window length; it may be beneficial to increase the window length if this results in a reduced classification error, despite the corresponding increase in controller delay. For the system employed in this study, the optimal window length was found to be between 150 and 250 ms , which is within acceptable controller delays for conventional multistate amplitude controllers.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2100828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676233","Controller delay;myoelectric control;pattern recognition;prosthesis;surface electromyography","Delay;Pattern recognition;Electromyography;Classification algorithms;Real time systems;Prosthetics;Controllability","Algorithms;Artificial Limbs;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electrodes;Electromyography;Electrophysiological Phenomena;Humans;Linear Models;Muscle, Skeletal;Pattern Recognition, Visual;Prosthesis Design;Software;User-Computer Interface","337","2","26","IEEE","30 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We analyze cost as well as the sources of error: approximation, quantization, and random fluctuations. We study the effectiveness of the architecture on a collection of benchmarks for image processing. The stochastic architecture requires less area than conventional hardware implementations.

Our method obtains as input a single image and uses a mere single 3D reference model of a different person's face. Classical reconstruction methods from single images, i.e., shape-from-shading, require knowledge of the reflectance properties and lighting as well as depth values for boundary conditions. Recent methods circumvent these requirements by representing input faces as combinations (of hundreds) of stored 3D models. We propose instead to use the input image as a guide to ""mold” a single reference model to reach a reconstruction of the sought 3D shape. Our method assumes Lambertian reflectance and uses harmonic representations of lighting. It has been tested on images taken under controlled viewing conditions as well as on uncontrolled images downloaded from the Internet, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness under a variety of imaging conditions and overcoming significant differences in shape between the input and reference individuals including differences in facial expressions, gender, and race.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432208","Computer vision;photometry;shape from shading;3D reconstruction;lighting;single images;face;depth reconstruction.","Image reconstruction;Reflectivity;Shape control;Humans;Face;Reconstruction algorithms;Boundary conditions;Testing;Internet;Robust control","Adult;Algorithms;Databases, Factual;Face;Female;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Lighting;Male;Photometry","337","3","38","IEEE","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Appropriate priors are chosen for its parameters to satisfy the positivity and sum-to-one constraints for the abundances. The joint posterior distribution of the unknown parameter vector is then derived. Unfortunately, this posterior is too complex to obtain analytical expressions of the standard Bayesian estimators.

The ISOP modular structure enables the use of low-voltage MOSFETs, featuring low on-state resistance and resulted conduction losses, to address medium-voltage input. A phase-shift dual-half-bridge (DHB) converter is employed to achieve high-frequency galvanic isolation, bidirectional power flow, and zero voltage switching (ZVS) of all switching devices, which leads to low switching losses even with high-frequency operation. Furthermore, an adaptive inductor is proposed as the main energy transfer element of a phase-shift DHB converter so that the circulating energy can be optimized to maintain ZVS at light load and minimize the conduction losses at heavy load as well. As a result, high efficiency over wide load range and high power density can be achieved. In addition, current stress of switching devices can be reduced. A planar transformer adopting printed-circuit-board windings arranged in an interleaved structure is designed to obtain low core and winding loss, solid isolation, and identical parameters in multiple modules. Moreover, the modular structure along with a distributed control provides plug-and-play capability and possible high-level fault tolerance.

The authors conducted an online survey with members of major carsharing organizations and evaluated the change in annual household emissions (e.g., impact) of respondents that joined carsharing. The results show that a majority of households joining carsharing are increasing their emissions by gaining access to automobiles. However, individually, these increases are small. In contrast, the remaining households are decreasing their emissions by shedding vehicles and driving less. The collective emission reductions outweigh the collective emission increases, which implies that carsharing reduces GHG emissions as a whole. The results are reported in the form of an observed impact, which strictly evaluates the changes in emissions that physically occur, and a full impact, which also considers emissions that would have happened but were avoided due to carsharing. The mean observed impact is $-$0.58 t GHG/year per household, whereas the mean full impact is $-$0.84 t GHG/year per household. Both means are statistically significant. We present a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the results and find that the overall results hold across a variety of assumptions. The average observed vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) per year was found to decline by 27%.

By avoiding the use of individual power management circuits for multiple energy sources, the number of components used in the hybrid energy harvesting (HEH) system is reduced and the system form factor, cost and power losses are thus reduced. An efficient microcontroller-based ultra low power management circuit with fixed voltage reference based maximum power point tracking is implemented with closed-loop voltage feedback control to ensure near maximum power transfer from the two energy sources to its connected electronic load over a wide range of operating conditions. From the experimental test results obtained, an average electrical power of 621 μW is harvested by the optimized HEH system at an average indoor solar irradiance of 1010 lux and a thermal gradient of 10 K, which is almost triple of that can be obtained with conventional single-source thermal energy harvesting method.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2010.2102321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5675682","Hybrid energy harvesting (HEH);near maximum power point tracking (MPPT);solar and thermal energy sources;wireless sensor nodes","Energy harvesting;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Lighting;Thermal sensors;Thermal resistance","","335","","24","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each of these will expose the power grid to cybersecurity threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid-the home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)-where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks. AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection. Simulation results demonstrate that this is a promising methodology for supporting the optimal communication routing and improving system security through the identification of malicious network traffic.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2159818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963752","Artificial immune system;cybersecurity;data classification;intrusion detection;smart grid;support vector machine;wireless mesh networks","Computer security;Wireless communication;Support vector machines;Intrusion detection;Wide area networks;Communication system security;Wireless mesh networks","","335","","54","IEEE","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Owing to TCP's reliable service, the picture and sound quality would not be degraded by network impairments, such as high delay and packet loss. However, the network impairments can cause rebuffering events which would result in jerky playback and deform the video's temporal structure. These quality degradations could adversely affect users' quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we investigate the relationship among three levels of quality of service (QoS) of HTTP video streaming: network QoS, application QoS, and user QoS (i.e., QoE). Our ultimate goal is to understand how the network QoS affects the QoE of HTTP video streaming. Our approach is to first characterize the correlation between the application and network QoS using analytical models and empirical evaluation. The second step is to perform subjective experiments to evaluate the relationship between application QoS and QoE. Our analysis reveals that the frequency of rebuffering is the main factor responsible for the variations in the QoE.","1573-0077","978-1-4244-9221-3","10.1109/INM.2011.5990550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990550","","Streaming media;Reliability;TV;Web sites;Games;Codecs;Quality of service","","335","6","30","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm is based on the so-called “universal triangle” concept that relates VIS/IR parameters, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Land Surface Temperature (Ts), to the soil moisture status. It combines the accuracy of SMOS observations with the high spatial resolution of VIS/IR satellite data into accurate soil moisture estimates at high spatial resolution. In preparation for the SMOS launch, the algorithm was tested using observations of the UPC Airborne RadIomEter at L-band (ARIEL) over the Soil Moisture Measurement Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS) in Zamora (Spain), and LANDSAT imagery. Results showed fairly good agreement with ground-based soil moisture measurements and illustrated the strength of the link between VIS/IR satellite data and soil moisture status. Following the SMOS launch, a downscaling strategy for the estimation of soil moisture at high resolution from SMOS using MODIS VIS/IR data has been developed. The method has been applied to some of the first SMOS images acquired during the commissioning phase and is validated against in situ soil moisture data from the OZnet soil moisture monitoring network, in South-Eastern Australia. Results show that the soil moisture variability is effectively captured at 10 and 1 km spatial scales without a significant degradation of the root mean square error.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2120615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5756664","Downscaling algorithm;MODIS;passive microwave remote sensing;SMOS;soil moisture;spatial resolution","Soil moisture;MODIS;Spatial resolution;Joining processes;Satellites;Vegetation mapping","","333","1","31","IEEE","29 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed SCSP algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem to select the least number of channels within a constraint of classification accuracy. As such, the proposed approach can be customized to yield the best classification accuracy by removing the noisy and irrelevant channels, or retain the least number of channels without compromising the classification accuracy obtained by using all the channels. The proposed SCSP algorithm is evaluated using two motor imagery datasets, one with a moderate number of channels and another with a large number of channels. In both datasets, the proposed SCSP channel selection significantly reduced the number of channels, and outperformed existing channel selection methods based on Fisher criterion, mutual information, support vector machine, common spatial pattern, and regularized common spatial pattern in classification accuracy. The proposed SCSP algorithm also yielded an average improvement of 10% in classification accuracy compared to the use of three channels (C3, C4, and Cz).","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2011.2131142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5737770","Brain–computer interface (BCI);EEG channel selection;motor imagery;sparse common spatial pattern (SCSP)","Accuracy;Electroencephalography;Covariance matrix;Optimization;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Support vector machines;Testing","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Databases, Factual;Electrocardiography;Humans;Imagination;Motor Activity;Neural Prostheses;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","333","","34","IEEE","22 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, learning algorithms have been successfully applied to grasp novel objects—ones not seen by the robot before. While these approaches use low-dimensional representations such as a ‘grasping point’ or a ‘pair of points’ that are perhaps easier to learn, they only partly represent the gripper configuration and hence are sub-optimal. We propose to learn a new ‘grasping rectangle’ representation: an oriented rectangle in the image plane. It takes into account the location, the orientation as well as the gripper opening width. However, inference with such a representation is computationally expensive. In this work, we present a two step process in which the first step prunes the search space efficiently using certain features that are fast to compute. For the remaining few cases, the second step uses advanced features to accurately select a good grasp. In our extensive experiments, we show that our robot successfully uses our algorithm to pick up a variety of novel objects.","1050-4729","978-1-61284-385-8","10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5980145","","Grasping;Grippers;Histograms;Three dimensional displays;Robots;Complexity theory;Image edge detection","","333","3","38","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technology enables inspection of the digestive system without discomfort or need for sedation, thus preventing the risks of conventional endoscopy, and has the potential of encouraging patients to undergo gastrointestinal (GI) tract examinations. However, currently available clinical products are passive devices whose locomotion is driven by natural peristalsis, with the drawback of failing to capture the images of important GI tract regions, since the doctor is unable to control the capsule's motion and orientation. To address these limitations, many research groups are working to develop active locomotion devices that allow capsule endoscopy to be performed in a totally controlled manner. This would enable the doctor to steer the capsule towards interesting pathological areas and to accomplish medical tasks.

Even contrast and brightness adjustments are challenging because they require taking into account the image content. Photographers are also known for having different retouching preferences. As the result of this complexity, rule-based, one-size-fits-all automatic techniques often fail. This problem can greatly benefit from supervised machine learning but the lack of training data has impeded work in this area. Our first contribution is the creation of a high-quality reference dataset. We collected 5,000 photos, manually annotated them, and hired 5 trained photographers to retouch each picture. The result is a collection of 5 sets of 5,000 example input-output pairs that enable supervised learning. We first use this dataset to predict a user's adjustment from a large training set. We then show that our dataset and features enable the accurate adjustment personalization using a carefully chosen set of training photos. Finally, we introduce difference learning: this method models and predicts difference between users. It frees the user from using predetermined photos for training. We show that difference learning enables accurate prediction using only a handful of examples.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995332","","Training;Measurement;Ground penetrating radar;Cameras;Histograms;Supervised learning;Machine learning","","329","14","18","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing TLS approaches do not account for sparsity possibly present in the unknown vector of regression coefficients. On the other hand, sparsity is the key attribute exploited by modern compressive sampling and variable selection approaches to linear regression, which include noise in the data, but do not account for perturbations in the regression matrix. The present paper fills this gap by formulating and solving (regularized) TLS optimization problems under sparsity constraints. Near-optimum and reduced-complexity suboptimum sparse (S-) TLS algorithms are developed to address the perturbed compressive sampling (and the related dictionary learning) challenge, when there is a mismatch between the true and adopted bases over which the unknown vector is sparse. The novel S-TLS schemes also allow for perturbations in the regression matrix of the least-absolute selection and shrinkage selection operator (Lasso), and endow TLS approaches with ability to cope with sparse, under-determined “errors-in-variables” models. Interesting generalizations can further exploit prior knowledge on the perturbations to obtain novel weighted and structured S-TLS solvers. Analysis and simulations demonstrate the practical impact of S-TLS in calibrating the mismatch effects of contemporary grid-based approaches to cognitive radio sensing, and robust direction-of-arrival estimation using antenna arrays.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2109956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706373","Direction-of-arrival estimation;errors-in-variables models;sparsity;spectrum sensing;total least-squares","Vectors;Sparse matrices;Convergence;Image reconstruction;Covariance matrix;Antenna arrays;Data models","","329","1","33","IEEE","4 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Market-driven spectrum trading is an efficient way to achieve dynamic spectrum accessing/sharing. In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum trading with single primary spectrum owner (or primary user, PO) selling his idle spectrum to multiple SUs. We model the trading process as a monopoly market, in which the PO acts as monopolist who sets the qualities and prices for the spectrum he sells, and the SUs act as consumers who choose the spectrum with appropriate quality and price for purchasing. We design a monopolist-dominated quality-price contract, which is offered by the PO and contains a set of quality-price combinations each intended for a consumer type. A contract is feasible if it is incentive compatible (IC) and individually rational (IR) for each SU to purchase the spectrum with the quality-price intended for his type. We propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for the contract to be feasible. We further derive the optimal contract, which is feasible and maximizes the utility of the PO, for both discrete-consumer-type model and continuous-consumer-type model. Moreover, we analyze the social surplus, i.e., the aggregate utility of both PO and SUs, and we find that, depending on the distribution of consumer types, the social surplus under the optimal contract may be less than or close to the maximum social surplus.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738226","Cognitive Radio;Spectrum Trading;Contract Theory;Quality Discrimination","Contracts;Cognitive radio;Integrated circuits;Biological system modeling;Cost accounting;Pricing;Supply chains","","328","","30","IEEE","24 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This EHPS is composed of a fuel cell system as the main source and two energy storage sources (ESSs)-a bank of supercapacitors (SCs) and a bank of batteries (BATs)-as the auxiliary source. With this hybridization, the volume and mass of the EHPS can be reduced, because the high energy density of BAT and high power density of SC are utilized. In the proposed novel control strategy, the FCT is used to manage the energy between the main and the auxiliary sources, and the FLC is employed to share the power flow in the ESS between the SC and the BAT. The power sharing depends on the load power and the state of charge of the SC and the BAT. EHPS is controlled by the regulation of the stored electrostatic energy in the dc buses. The main property of this strategy is that the energy management in the power source is carried out with a single general control algorithm in different operating modes, consequently avoiding any algorithm commutation. An EHPS test bench has been assembled and equipped with a real-time system controller based on a dSPACE.

Our controller processes measurements from the gripper's fingertip pressure arrays and hand-mounted accelerometer in real time to generate robotic tactile signals that are designed to mimic human SA-I, FA-I, and FA-II channels. These signals are combined into tactile event cues that drive the transitions between six discrete states in the grasp controller: Close, Load, Lift and Hold, Replace, Unload, and Open. The controller selects an appropriate initial grasping force, detects when an object is slipping from the grasp, increases the grasp force as needed, and judges when to release an object to set it down.

Using a linear periodically time-variant (LPTV) model, exact expressions for the filter transfer function are derived. The behavior of the circuit including non-idealities such as maximum rejection, spectral aliasing, noise and effects due to mismatch in the paths is modeled and verified via measurements.

Since there are a number of submodules (SMs) in high-voltage applications of MMC and all SM voltages are required to be measured and sorted, if the uniform sampling frequency is not high enough, the SM will not be triggered as quickly as possible. Thus, the converter-output voltage levels and voltage harmonics will be affected. A method to systematically analyze the voltage harmonics is presented, considering the uniform sampling frequency. In order to select a proper sampling frequency, two critical values, which significantly influence the output voltage levels and voltage total harmonic distortions, are calculated.

The presented solution not only solves the tracking speed versus control efficiency tradeoff problem of HCS but also makes sure that the changing wind conditions do not lead HCS in the wrong direction. It intelligently adapts the variable step size to keep up with the rapid changes in the wind and seizes the perturbation at the maxima to yield 100% control efficiency. For this purpose, a novel peak detection capability has been devised which, in contrast with conventional peak detection, can work robustly under changing wind conditions. The proposed MPPT performs self-tuning to cope with the nonconstant efficiencies of the generator-converter subsystems-a phenomenon quite rarely discussed in research papers so far. In addition, a smart speed-sensorless scheme has been developed to avoid the use of mechanical sensors. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm is remarkably faster and more efficient than the conventional HCS.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2010.2044732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5427015","Hill climb searching (HCS);maximum power point (MPP) tracking (MPPT);speed sensorless;wind energy conversion system (WECS)","Wind energy;Wind energy generation;Wind turbines;Permission;Size control;Robustness;Mechanical sensors;Sensorless control;Control systems;Character generation","","324","","20","IEEE","8 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While detecting specific face parts like the nose is sensitive to occlusions, learning the regression on rather generic surface patches requires enormous amount of training data in order to achieve accurate estimates. We propose to use random regression forests for the task at hand, given their capability to handle large training datasets. Moreover, we synthesize a great amount of annotated training data using a statistical model of the human face. In our experiments, we show that our approach can handle real data presenting large pose changes, partial occlusions, and facial expressions, even though it is trained only on synthetic neutral face data.

For multi-message multicast networks, the scheme naturally generalizes network coding over noiseless networks by Ahlswede, Cai, Li, and Yeung, and compress-forward coding for the relay channel by Cover and El Gamal to discrete memoryless and Gaussian networks. The scheme also extends the results on coding for wireless relay networks and deterministic networks by Avestimehr, Diggavi, and Tse, and coding for wireless erasure networks by Dana, Gowaikar, Palanki, Hassibi, and Effros. The scheme involves lossy compression by the relay as in the compress-forward coding scheme for the relay channel. However, unlike previous compress-forward schemes in which independent messages are sent over multiple blocks, the same message is sent multiple times using independent codebooks as in the network coding scheme for cyclic networks. Furthermore, the relays do not use Wyner-Ziv binning as in previous compress-forward schemes, and each decoder performs simultaneous decoding of the received signals from all the blocks without uniquely decoding the compression indices. A consequence of this new scheme is that achievability is proved simply and more generally without resorting to time expansion to extend results for acyclic networks to networks with cycles. The noisy network coding scheme is then extended to general multi-message networks by combining it with decoding techniques for the interference channel. For the Gaussian multicast network, noisy network coding improves the previously established gap to the cutset bound. We also demonstrate through two popular Gaussian network examples that noisy network coding can outperform conventional compress-forward, amplify-forward, and hash-forward coding schemes.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2119930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5752460","Compress-forward;discrete memoryless network;Gaussian network;interference relay channel;network coding;noisy network coding;relaying;two-way relay channel","Network coding;Noise measurement;Relays;Encoding;Decoding;Interference;Indexes","","322","7","31","IEEE","19 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, major achievements were made for the class of so called access-driven cache attacks. Such attacks exploit the leakage of the memory locations accessed by a victim process. In this paper we consider the AES block cipher and present an attack which is capable of recovering the full secret key in almost real time for AES-128, requiring only a very limited number of observed encryptions. Unlike previous attacks, we do not require any information about the plaintext (such as its distribution, etc.). Moreover, for the first time, we also show how the plaintext can be recovered without having access to the cipher text at all. It is the first working attack on AES implementations using compressed tables. There, no efficient techniques to identify the beginning of AES rounds is known, which is the fundamental assumption underlying previous attacks. We have a fully working implementation of our attack which is able to recover AES keys after observing as little as 100 encryptions. It works against the OpenS SL 0.9.8n implementation of AES on Linux systems. Our spy process does not require any special privileges beyond those of a standard Linux user. A contribution of probably independent interest is a denial of service attack on the task scheduler of current Linux systems (CFS), which allows one to observe (on average) every single memory access of a victim process.","2375-1207","978-0-7695-4402-1","10.1109/SP.2011.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958048","AES;side channel;access-based cache attacks","Cryptography;Random access memory;Linux;Matrices;Memory management;Monitoring","","322","3","42","IEEE","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The single-phase SST consists of a modular multilevel ac-dc rectifier, a modular dual active bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter with high-frequency transformers, and a dc-ac inverter stage. However, due to dc bus voltage and power unbalancing in each module, the modular SST often presents instability problems making its design difficult and causing unpredictable behavior. Moreover, the unbalanced dc-link voltages increase the stress of the semiconductor devices, and also cause high harmonic distortions of grid current, therefore, necessitating the use of a bigger ac filter. This paper presents a novel single-phase d-q vector-based common-duty-ratio control method for the multilevel rectifier, and a voltage feedforward and feedback based controller for the modular DAB converter. With the proposed control methods, the dc-link voltage and power in each module can be balanced.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) technology is one of the most promising solutions to tackle the situation. While PHEVs partially rely on electricity from the power grid, they raise concerns about their negative impacts on power generation, transmission, and distribution installations. On the other hand, they have the potential to be used as a distributed energy storage system for the grid. Therefore, they can pave the way for a more sustainable power grid in which renewable resources are widely employed. Positive and negative impacts of PHEVs on the power grid cannot be thoroughly examined unless extensive data on the utilization of each individual PHEV are available. For instance, in order to estimate the aggregated impact of PHEVs on the electricity demand profile, one needs to know 1) when each PHEV would begin its charging process, 2) how much electrical energy it would require, and 3) how much power would be needed. This paper extracts and analyzes the data that are available through national household travel surveys (NHTS). Three charging scenarios are considered in order to obtain various PHEV charging load profiles (PCLPs). Further, the characteristics of each developed PCLP are studied. Finally, the effects of three suggested policies on the derived PCLPs are examined.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2011.2158123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5779754","Demand profile;load profile;national household travel survey (NHTS);plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV);transportation electrification;vehicle-to-grid","Hybrid electric vehicles;Power distribution;Data mining;Power grids","","320","1","25","IEEE","31 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We discuss proximity-based communication models composed of disk-based or uniformly-fading-signal-strength communication links. A graph-theoretic definition of connectivity is provided, as well as an equivalent definition based on algebraic graph theory, which employs the adjacency and Laplacian matrices of the graph and their spectral properties. Based on these results, we discuss centralized and distributed algorithms to maintain, increase, and control connectivity in mobile robot networks. The various approaches discussed in this paper range from convex optimization and subgradient-descent algorithms, for the maximization of the algebraic connectivity of the network, to potential fields and hybrid systems that maintain communication links or control the network topology in a least restrictive manner. Common to these approaches is the use of mobility to control the topology of the underlying communication network. We discuss applications of connectivity control to multirobot rendezvous, flocking and formation control, where so far, network connectivity has been considered an assumption.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2011.2157884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5948318","Algebraic graph theory;convex and subgradient optimization;graph connectivity;hybrid systems","Laplace equations;Symmetric matrices;Mobile robots;Network topology;Algebra;Graph theory;Optimization","","319","","87","IEEE","11 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We illustrate, with examples, the problems that arise when using continuous and (memoryless) discontinuous quaternion-based state-feedback control laws for global attitude stabilization. We propose a quaternion-based hybrid feedback scheme that solves the global attitude tracking problem in three scenarios: full state measurements, only measurements of attitude, and measurements of attitude with angular velocity measurements corrupted by a constant bias. In each case, the hybrid feedback is dynamic and incorporates hysteresis-based switching using a single binary logic variable for each quaternion error state. When only attitude measurements are available or the angular rate is corrupted by a constant bias, the proposed controller is observer-based and incorporates an additional quaternion filter and bias observer. The hysteresis mechanism enables the proposed scheme to simultaneously avoid the “unwinding phenomenon” and sensitivity to arbitrarily small measurement noise that is present in discontinuous feedbacks. These properties are shown using a general framework for hybrid systems, and the results are demonstrated by simulation.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2108490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5701762","Attitude control;hybrid control;output feedback;robustness;spacecraft","Quaternions;Noise;Attitude control;Robustness;Asymptotic stability;Noise measurement;Trajectory","","318","","44","IEEE","28 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper instead focuses on analytically evaluating the two main types of FFR deployments - Strict FFR and Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) - using a Poisson point process to model the base station locations. The results are compared with the standard grid model and an actual urban deployment. Under reasonable special cases for modern cellular networks, our results reduce to simple closed-form expressions, which provide insight into system design guidelines and the relative merits of Strict FFR, SFR, universal reuse, and fixed frequency reuse.

For the first time, the effects of coil misalignment and geometry are addressed in a single mathematical expression. In the applications envisaged, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and biomedical implants, the receiving coil is normally significantly smaller than the transmitting coil. Formulas are derived for the magnetic field at the receiving coil when it is laterally and angularly misaligned from the transmitting coil. Incorporating this magnetic field solution with an equivalent circuit for the inductive link allows us to introduce a power transfer formula that combines coil characteristics and misalignment factors. The coil geometries considered are spiral and short solenoid structures which are currently popular in the RFID and biomedical domains. The novel analytical power transfer efficiency expressions introduced in this study allow the optimization of coil geometry for maximum power transfer and misalignment tolerance. The experimental results show close correlation with the theoretical predictions.

However, in the near future, utilities are expected to impose additional regulations and restrictions on the power being injected by large centralized PV systems because of their possible adverse impacts. One of the main issues associated with large PV systems is the fluctuation of their output power. These fluctuations can negatively impact the performance of the electric networks to which these systems are connected, especially if the penetration levels of these systems are high. Moreover, the fluctuations in the power of PV systems make it difficult to predict their output, and thus, to consider them when scheduling the generating units in the network. The main objective of this paper is to investigate some methods that can be used to reduce the fluctuations in the power generated from a large customer-owned PV system, in the order of megawatts. This paper focuses on three methods: 1) the use of battery storage systems; 2) the use of dump loads; and 3) curtailment of the generated power by operating the power-conditioning unit of the PV system below the maximum power point. The emphasis in the analysis presented in this paper is on investigating the impacts of implementing these methods on the economical benefits that the PV system owner gains. To estimate the maximum revenues gained by the system owner, an linear programming optimization problem is formulated and solved. Moreover, the effect of varying different parameters of the problem is investigated through sensitivity analysis.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2010.2062515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677463","Battery storage system;dump load;economic;grid connected;power curtailment;photovoltaic (PV) systems;storage","Batteries;Power generation;Optimization;Niobium;Equations;Fluctuations;Bridges","","317","1","42","IEEE","30 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These systems use stereo video coding for pictures delivered by two input cameras. Typically, such stereo systems only reproduce these two camera views at the receiver and stereoscopic displays for multiple viewers require wearing special 3-D glasses. On the other hand, emerging autostereoscopic multiview displays emit a large numbers of views to enable 3-D viewing for multiple users without requiring 3-D glasses. For representing a large number of views, a multiview extension of stereo video coding is used, typically requiring a bit rate that is proportional to the number of views. However, since the quality improvement of multiview displays will be governed by an increase of emitted views, a format is needed that allows the generation of arbitrary numbers of views with the transmission bit rate being constant. Such a format is the combination of video signals and associated depth maps. The depth maps provide disparities associated with every sample of the video signal that can be used to render arbitrary numbers of additional views via view synthesis. This paper describes efficient coding methods for video and depth data. For the generation of views, synthesis methods are presented, which mitigate errors from depth estimation and coding.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2091090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5668523","Advanced video coding (AVC);depth estimation;H.264;multiview coding (MVC);multiview video plus depth (MVD);platelet coding;view synthesis;3-D video (3DV) coding","Video signal processing;Encoding;Three dimensional displays;Stereo image processing;Automatic voltage control;Receivers","","317","7","53","IEEE","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of a two-mass model is motivated by the need to deal with flexible modes induced by the low-speed shaft stiffness. The main objective of the proposed controllers is the wind power capture optimization while limiting transient loads on the drive-train components. This paper starts by an adaptation of some existing control strategies. However, their performance are weak, as the dynamics aspects of the wind and aeroturbine are not taken into consideration. In order to bring some improvements, nonlinear static and dynamic state feedback controllers, with a wind speed estimator, are then proposed. Concerning the wind speed estimator, the idea behind this is to exploit the WT dynamics by itself as a measurement device. All these methods have been first tested and validated using an aeroelastic WT simulator. A comparative study between the proposed controllers is performed. The results show better performance for the nonlinear dynamic controller with estimator in comparison with the adapted existing methods.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2010.2090155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5675666","Nonlinear control;power capture optimization;two-mass model;variable-speed wind turbines (VSWT)","Torque;Aerodynamics;Shafts;Wind speed;Adaptation model;Rotors;Generators","","316","1","40","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Local and nonlocal image models have supplied complementary views toward the regularity in natural images — the former attempts to construct or learn a dictionary of basis functions that promotes the sparsity; while the latter connects the sparsity with the self-similarity of the image source by clustering. In this paper, we present a variational framework for unifying the above two views and propose a new denoising algorithm built upon clustering-based sparse representation (CSR). Inspired by the success of l1-optimization, we have formulated a double-header l1-optimization problem where the regularization involves both dictionary learning and structural structuring. A surrogate-function based iterative shrinkage solution has been developed to solve the double-header l1-optimization problem and a probabilistic interpretation of CSR model is also included. Our experimental results have shown convincing improvements over state-of-the-art denoising technique BM3D on the class of regular texture images. The PSNR performance of CSR denoising is at least comparable and often superior to other competing schemes including BM3D on a collection of 12 generic natural images.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995478","","Dictionaries;Noise reduction;PSNR;Clustering algorithms;Image denoising;Manifolds;Optimization","","316","5","18","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our aesthetic quality estimation method explicitly predicts some of the possible image cues that a human might use to evaluate an image and then uses them in a discriminative approach. These cues or high level describable image attributes fall into three broad types: 1) compositional attributes related to image layout or configuration, 2) content attributes related to the objects or scene types depicted, and 3) sky-illumination attributes related to the natural lighting conditions.

A task, in velocity-resolved inverse kinematics, is a desired value for a function of the robot configuration that can be regulated with an ordinary differential equation (ODE). When facing simultaneous tasks, the corresponding equations can be grouped in a single system or, better, sorted in priority and solved each in the solutions set of higher priority tasks. This elegant framework for hierarchical task regulation has been implemented as a sequence of least-squares problems. Its limitation lies in the handling of inequality constraints, which are usually transformed into more restrictive equality constraints through potential fields. In this paper, we propose a new prioritized task-regulation framework based on a sequence of quadratic programs (QP) that removes the limitation. At the basis of the proposed algorithm, there is a study of the optimal sets resulting from the sequence of QPs. The algorithm is implemented and illustrated in simulation on the humanoid robot HRP-2.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2011.2142450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5766760","Control;hierarchy;humanoid robot;inequality constraints;inverse kinematics;redundancy;task priority","Kinematics;Humanoid robots;Manipulators;Linear matrix inequalities;Silicon;Joints","","310","","18","IEEE","12 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent algorithms have afforded dramatic progress, yet many aspects of the problem remain challenging and hard to understand. The goal of this paper is to analyze and evaluate recent blind deconvolution algorithms both theoretically and experimentally. We explain the previously reported failure of the naive MAP approach by demonstrating that it mostly favors no-blur explanations. We show that, using reasonable image priors, a naive simulations MAP estimation of both latent image and blur kernel is guaranteed to fail even with infinitely large images sampled from the prior. On the other hand, we show that since the kernel size is often smaller than the image size, a MAP estimation of the kernel alone is well constrained and is guaranteed to succeed to recover the true blur. The plethora of recent deconvolution techniques makes an experimental evaluation on ground-truth data important. As a first step toward this experimental evaluation, we have collected blur data with ground truth and compared recent algorithms under equal settings. Additionally, our data demonstrate that the shift-invariant blur assumption made by most algorithms is often violated.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963691","Blind deconvolution;motion deblurring;natrual image statistics;statistical estimation.","Statistical analysis;Deconvolution;Image enhancement;Blind equalizers;Algorithm design and analysis;Convolution;Motion analysis","","310","10","32","IEEE","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We explore self-similarities of action sequences over time and observe the striking stability of such measures across views. Building upon this key observation, we develop an action descriptor that captures the structure of temporal similarities and dissimilarities within an action sequence. Despite this temporal self-similarity descriptor not being strictly view-invariant, we provide intuition and experimental validation demonstrating its high stability under view changes. Self-similarity descriptors are also shown to be stable under performance variations within a class of actions when individual speed fluctuations are ignored. If required, such fluctuations between two different instances of the same action class can be explicitly recovered with dynamic time warping, as will be demonstrated, to achieve cross-view action synchronization. More central to the current work, temporal ordering of local self-similarity descriptors can simply be ignored within a bag-of-features type of approach. Sufficient action discrimination is still retained in this way to build a view-independent action recognition system. Interestingly, self-similarities computed from different image features possess similar properties and can be used in a complementary fashion. Our method is simple and requires neither structure recovery nor multiview correspondence estimation. Instead, it relies on weak geometric properties and combines them with machine learning for efficient cross-view action recognition. The method is validated on three public data sets. It has similar or superior performance compared to related methods and it performs well even in extreme conditions, such as when recognizing actions from top views while using side views only for training.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432213","Human action recognition;human action synchronization;view invariance;temporal self-similarities;local temporal descriptors.","Humans;Cameras;Hidden Markov models;Stability;Fluctuations;Machine learning;Shape;Support vector machines;Time measurement;Buildings","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Humans;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated","309","4","53","IEEE","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes cooperative jamming strategies for two-hop relay networks where the eavesdropper can wiretap the relay channels in both hops. In these approaches, the normally inactive nodes in the relay network can be used as cooperative jamming sources to confuse the eavesdropper. Linear precoding schemes are investigated for two scenarios where single or multiple data streams are transmitted via a decode-and-forward (DF) relay, under the assumption that global channel state information (CSI) is available. For the case of single data stream transmission, we derive closed-form jamming beamformers and the corresponding optimal power allocation. Generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based secure relaying schemes are proposed for the transmission of multiple data streams. The optimal power allocation is found for the GSVD relaying scheme via geometric programming. Based on this result, a GSVD-based cooperative jamming scheme is proposed that shows significant improvement in terms of secrecy rate compared to the approach without jamming. Furthermore, the case involving an eavesdropper with unknown CSI is also investigated in this paper. Simulation results show that the secrecy rate is dramatically increased when inactive nodes in the relay network participate in cooperative jamming.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2161295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5940246","Interference;jamming;physical layer security;relay networks;secrecy;wiretap channel","Relays;Jamming;Resource management;Interference;Optimization;Argon;Antennas","","309","2","37","IEEE","4 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This surpasses the previous record, for conversion efficiency of a single-junction device under non-concentrated light, by more than 1%. This is due largely to the high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of this device. The high Voc results from precise control of the dark current. The fact that this record result has been achieved with a thin-film shows that, for GaAs material systems, the majority of the growth substrate is not needed for device performance.

Small cells have a big role to play in orchestrating a cellular network that can overcome the explosive mobile traffic upsurge at little cost to the network operator. However, if left unchecked, a large-scale small cell deployment can substantially increase the network energy consumption with strong ecological and economic implications. In this article, we introduce energy-efficient SLEEP mode algorithms for small cell base stations in a bid to reduce cellular networks' power consumption. The designed algorithms allow the hardware components in the BS to be astutely switched off in idle conditions, such that the energy consumption is modulated over the variations in traffic load. Three different strategies for algorithm control are discussed, relying on small cell driven, core network driven, and user equipment driven approaches. Based on a mixed voice and data traffic model, the algorithms present energy saving opportunities of approximately 10-60 percent in the network with respect to no SLEEP mode activation in small cells, coupled with additional capacity incentives.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2011.5978418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978418","","Macrocell networks;Microprocessors;Computer architecture;Radio frequency;Energy consumption;Cellular networks;Energy efficiency","","306","9","7","IEEE","11 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Over the past decade, an increasing number of studies has explored the use of electro-corticographic (ECoG) activity recorded directly from the surface of the brain. ECoG has attracted substantial and increasing interest, because it has been shown to reflect specific details of actual and imagined actions, and because its technical characteristics should readily support robust and chronic implementations of BCI systems in humans. This review provides general perspectives on the ECoG platform; describes the different electrophysiological features that can be detected in ECoG; elaborates on the signal acquisition issues, protocols, and online performance of ECoG- based BCI studies to date; presents important limitations of current ECoG studies; discusses opportunities for further research; and finally presents a vision for eventual clinical implementation.

"Performance Analysis of ZF and MMSE Equalizers for MIMO Systems: An In-Depth Study of the High SNR Regime","Y. Jiang; M. K. Varanasi; J.

In spite of much prior work on this subject, we reveal several new and surprising analytical results in terms of output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), uncoded error and outage probabilities, diversity-multiplexing (D-M) gain tradeoff and coding gain. Contrary to the common perception that ZF and MMSE are asymptotically equivalent at high SNR, we show that the output SNR of the MMSE equalizer (conditioned on the channel realization) is $\rho_{\rm mmse} = \rho_{\rm zf}+\eta_{\ssr snr}$, where $\rho_{\rm zf}$ is the output SNR of the ZF equalizer and that the gap  $\eta_{\ssr snr}$ is statistically independent of  $\rho_{\rm zf}$ and is a nondecreasing function of input SNR. Furthermore, as ${\ssr snr}\ura{} \infty$, $\eta_{\ssr snr}$ converges with probability one to a scaled ${\cal F}$ random variable. It is also shown that at the output of the MMSE equalizer, the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) is tightly upper bounded by  ${{\eta_{\ssr snr}}\over {\rho_{\rm zf}}}$. Using the decomposition of the output SNR of MMSE, we can approximate its uncoded error, as well as outage probabilities through a numerical integral which accurately reflects the respective SNR gains of the MMSE equalizer relative to its ZF counterpart. The  $\epsilon$-outage capacities of the two equalizers, however, coincide in the asymptotically high SNR regime. We also provide the solution to a long-standing open problem: applying optimal detection ordering does not improve the D-M tradeoff of the vertical Bell Labs layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) architecture. It is shown that optimal ordering yields a SNR gain of $10\log_{10}N$ dB in the ZF-V-BLAST architecture (where $N$ is the number of transmit antennas) whereas for the MMSE-V-BLAST architecture, the SNR gain due to ordered detection is even better and significantly so.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2112070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5730587","Diversity gain;error probability;MIMO;minimum mean squared error;outage capacity;outage probability;spatial multiplexing gain;tradeoff;V-BLAST;zero forcing","Signal to noise ratio;Equalizers;Gain;Error probability;Random variables;MIMO;Approximation methods","","302","","33","IEEE","14 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The existing literature have proposed some methods to reduce torque and flux ripple by optimizing the duty ratio of the active vector. However, these methods are usually complicated and parameter dependent. This paper first compares the performances of three duty determination methods in detail and then proposes a very simple but effective method to obtain the duty ratio. The novel method is superior to the existing methods in terms of simplicity and robustness. By appropriately arranging the sequence of the vectors, the commutation frequency is reduced effectively without performance degradation. To further improve the performance of system, a low-pass filter-based voltage model with compensations of amplitude and phase is employed to acquire accurate stator flux estimation. The proposed scheme is able to reduce the torque and flux ripple significantly while maintaining the simplicity and robustness of conventional DTC at the most.

Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness. The manual examination of optic disk (OD) is a standard procedure used for detecting glaucoma. In this paper, we present an automatic OD parameterization technique based on segmented OD and cup regions obtained from monocular retinal images. A novel OD segmentation method is proposed which integrates the local image information around each point of interest in multidimensional feature space to provide robustness against variations found in and around the OD region. We also propose a novel cup segmentation method which is based on anatomical evidence such as vessel bends at the cup boundary, considered relevant by glaucoma experts. Bends in a vessel are robustly detected using a region of support concept, which automatically selects the right scale for analysis. A multi-stage strategy is employed to derive a reliable subset of vessel bends called r-bends followed by a local spline fitting to derive the desired cup boundary. The method has been evaluated on 138 images comprising 33 normal and 105 glaucomatous images against three glaucoma experts. The obtained segmentation results show consistency in handling various geometric and photometric variations found across the dataset. The estimation error of the method for vertical cup-to-disk diameter ratio is 0.09/0.08 (mean/standard deviation) while for cup-to-disk area ratio it is 0.12/0.10. Overall, the obtained qualitative and quantitative results show effectiveness in both segmentation and subsequent OD parameterization for glaucoma assessment.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2011.2106509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5762351","Active contour;cup;cup-to-disk ratio (CDR);glaucoma;neuroretinal rim;optic disk (OD);retinal images;segmentation;vessel bend","Image segmentation;Active contours;Retina;Image color analysis;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Capacitance-voltage characteristics","Algorithms;Color;Colorimetry;Fluorescein Angiography;Glaucoma;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Optic Disk;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Retinoscopy;Sensitivity and Specificity","301","1","51","IEEE","2 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The work is motivated by planning domains involving nontrivial dynamics, spatially varying measurement properties, and obstacle constraints. To make the problem tractable, we restrict the motion plan to a nominal trajectory stabilized with a linear estimator and controller. This allows us to predict distributions over future states given a candidate nominal trajectory. Using these distributions to ensure a bounded probability of collision, the algorithm incrementally constructs a graph of trajectories through state space, while efficiently searching over candidate paths through the graph at each iteration. This process results in a search tree in belief space that provably converges to the optimal path. We analyze the algorithm theoretically and also provide simulation results demonstrating its utility for balancing information gathering to reduce uncertainty and finding low cost paths.","1050-4729","978-1-61284-385-8","10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5980508","","Heuristic algorithms;Trajectory;Uncertainty;Equations;Planning;Vehicle dynamics;Kalman filters","","301","2","23","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The difference between the constrained nature in which such data are often collected and the unpredictable nature of prosthetic use is an example of the semantic gap between research findings and a viable clinical implementation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the variations in limb position associated with normal use can have a substantial impact on the robustness of EMG pattern recognition, as illustrated by an in- crease in average classification error from 3.8% to 18%. We propose to solve this problem by: 1) collecting EMG data and training the classifier in multiple limb positions and by 2) measuring the limb position with accelerometers. Applying these two methods to data from ten normally limbed subjects, we reduce the average classification error from 18% to 5.7% and 5.0%, respectively. Our study shows how sensor fusion (using EMG and accelerometers) may be an efficient method to mitigate the effect of limb position and improve classification accuracy.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2163529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985538","Accelerometer;electromyography;prosthetic hands;prosthetics","Accelerometers;Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Prosthetics","Adolescent;Adult;Artificial Intelligence;Artificial Limbs;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electric Stimulation;Electromyography;Electromyography;Extremities;Extremities;Female;Hand;Humans;Male;Motion;Muscle Contraction;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Prosthesis Design;Young Adult","297","2","25","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To quantify link performance, we define the ergodic normalized transmission rate (ENTR) for the links between the ground nodes and the relay, and derive a closed-form expression for it in terms of the eigenvalues of the channel correlation matrix. We show that the ENTR can be approximated as a sinusoid with an offset that depends on the heading of the UAV. Using this observation, we develop a closed-form expression for the UAV heading that maximizes the uplink network data rate while keeping the rate of each individual link above a certain threshold. When the current UAV relay assignments cannot meet the minimum link requirements, we investigate the deployment and heading control problem for new UAV relays as they are added to the network, and propose a smart handoff algorithm that updates node and relay assignments as the topology of the network evolves.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2011.5937283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5937283","","Relays;Modulation;Signal to noise ratio;Correlation;Optimization;Wireless communication;Closed-form solution","","297","3","30","IEEE","4 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This analysis confirms that the different difficulty levels correspond to distinguishable emotions, and that, playing several times at the same difficulty level gives rise to boredom. The next step was to train several classifiers to automatically detect the three emotional classes from EEG and peripheral signals in a player-independent framework. By using either type of signals, the emotional classes were successfully recovered, with EEG having a better accuracy than peripheral signals on short periods of time.

In the past, it has often been assumed, usually implicitly, that complex random signals are proper or circular. A proper complex random variable is uncorrelated with its complex conjugate, and a circular complex random variable has a probability distribution that is invariant under rotation in the complex plane. While these assumptions are convenient because they simplify computations, there are many cases where proper and circular random signals are very poor models of the underlying physics. When taking impropriety and noncircularity into account, the right type of processing can provide significant performance gains. There are two key ingredients in the statistical signal processing of complex-valued data: 1) utilizing the complete statistical characterization of complex-valued random signals; and 2) the optimization of real-valued cost functions with respect to complex parameters. In this overview article, we review the necessary tools, among which are widely linear transformations, augmented statistical descriptions, and Wirtinger calculus.

Fuel consumed in a vehicle is greatly influenced by road gradients, aside from its velocity and acceleration characteristics. Therefore, optimum control inputs can only be computed through anticipated rigorous reasoning using information concerning road terrain, model of the vehicle dynamics, and fuel consumption characteristics. In this development, a nonlinear model predictive control method with a fast optimization algorithm is implemented to derive the vehicle control inputs based on road gradient conditions obtained from digital road maps. The fuel consumption model of a typical vehicle is formulated using engine efficiency characteristics and used in the objective function to ensure fuel economy driving.

One challenge with integrating renewables into the grid is that their power generation is intermittent and uncontrollable. Thus, predicting future renewable generation is important, since the grid must dispatch generators to satisfy demand as generation varies. While manually developing sophisticated prediction models may be feasible for large-scale solar farms, developing them for distributed generation at millions of homes throughout the grid is a challenging problem. To address the problem, in this paper, we explore automatically creating site-specific prediction models for solar power generation from National Weather Service (NWS) weather forecasts using machine learning techniques. We compare multiple regression techniques for generating prediction models, including linear least squares and support vector machines using multiple kernel functions. We evaluate the accuracy of each model using historical NWS forecasts and solar intensity readings from a weather station deployment for nearly a year. Our results show that SVM-based prediction models built using seven distinct weather forecast metrics are 27% more accurate for our site than existing forecast-based models.","","978-1-4577-1702-4","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102379","","Predictive models;Weather forecasting;Measurement;Kernel;Support vector machines;Correlation","","292","4","11","IEEE","15 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Along this line, link prediction between co-authors in a co-author network is a frequently studied problem. In most of these studies, authors are considered in a homogeneous network, i.e., only one type of objects (author type) and one type of links (co-authorship) exist in the network. However, in a real bibliographic network, there are multiple types of objects (e.g., venues, topics, papers) and multiple types of links among these objects. In this paper, we study the problem of co-author relationship prediction in the heterogeneous bibliographic network, and a new methodology called PathPredict, i.e., meta path-based relationship prediction model, is proposed to solve this problem. First, meta path-based topological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then, a supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-author relationships. We present experiments on a real bibliographic network, the DBLP network, which show that metapath-based heterogeneous topological features can generate more accurate prediction results as compared to homogeneous topological features. In addition, the level of significance of each topological feature can be learned from the model, which is helpful in understanding the mechanism behind the relationship building.","","978-1-61284-758-0","10.1109/ASONAM.2011.112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992571","heterogeneous information networks;link prediction;relationship prediction","Feature extraction;Predictive models;Accuracy;Training;Buildings;Network topology;Semantics","","291","2","15","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New results on the stability and l2-gain analyses for the systems are first given where the Lyapunov-like functions during the running time of subsystems are allowed to increase. In light of the proposed Lyapunov-like functions, the desired mode-dependent filters can be designed in that the unmatched filters are allowed to perform in the interval of the asynchronous switching before the matched ones are applied.

Our fully digital implementation is able to leverage favorable CMOS scaling trends, while ensuring one-to-one correspondence between hardware and software. In contrast to a conventional von Neumann architecture, our core tightly integrates computation (neurons) alongside memory (synapses), which allows us to implement efficient fan-out (communication) in a naturally parallel and event-driven manner, leading to ultra-low active power consumption of 45pJ/spike. The core is fully configurable in terms of neuron parameters, axon types, and synapse states and is thus amenable to a wide range of applications.

The interest is rapidly growing for these devices in high power and high temperature applications. The main advantages of wide bandgap semiconductors are their very high critical electric field capability. From a power device perspective the high critical field strength can be used to design switching devices with much lower losses than conventional silicon based devices both for on-state losses and reduced switching losses. This paper reviews the current state of the art in active switching device performance for both SiC and GaN. SiC material quality and epitaxy processes have greatly improved and degradation free 100 mm wafers are readily available. The SiC wafer roadmap looks very favorable as volume production takes off. For GaN materials the main application area is geared towards the lower power rating level up to 1 kV on mostly lateral FET designs. Power module demonstrations are beginning to appear in scientific reports and real applications. A short review is therefore given. Other advantages of SiC is the possibility of high temperature operation (>; 300°C) and in radiation hard environments, which could offer considerable system advantages.","1946-0201","978-1-4244-8424-9","10.1109/ISPSD.2011.5890778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5890778","","Silicon carbide;Gallium nitride;Silicon;JFETs;Aluminum gallium nitride;MOSFETs","","289","","31","IEEE","1 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method exhibits the following benefits: 1) it is robust to outliers through the mechanism of MCC which can be more theoretically solid than a heuristic rule based on MSE; 2) it requires no assumption about the zero-mean of data for processing and can estimate data mean during optimization; and 3) its optimal solution consists of principal eigenvectors of a robust covariance matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. In addition, kernel techniques are further introduced in the proposed method to deal with nonlinearly distributed data. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform robust rotational-invariant PCAs based on $L_{1}$  norm when outliers occur.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2103949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680649","Correntropy;half-quadratic optimization;principal component analysis (PCA);robust","Principal component analysis;Robustness;Optimization;Kernel;Covariance matrix;Algorithm design and analysis;Mean square error methods","Algorithms;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Entropy;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","286","1","38","IEEE","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main practical problem of having high-gain-based design is that it amplifies the input and output disturbance as well as excites hidden unmodeled dynamics, causing poor tracking performance. In this paper, a multiple model/control-based SMC technique is proposed to reduce the level of parametric uncertainty to reduce observer-controller gains. To this end, we split uniformly the compact set of unknown parameters into a finite number of smaller compact subsets. Then, we design a candidate SMC corresponding to each of these smaller subsets. The derivative of the Lyapunov function candidate is used as a resetting criterion to identify a candidate model that approximates closely the plant at each instant of time. The key idea is to allow the parameter estimate of conventional adaptive sliding mode control design to be reset into a model that best estimates the plant among a finite set of candidate models. The proposed method is evaluated on a 2-DOF robot manipulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical development.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2010.2062472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5530377","Adaptive control;output feedback;robotics;robust control","Robust control;Sliding mode control;Robots;Manipulators;Uncertainty;Large-scale systems;Performance gain;Lyapunov method;Parameter estimation;Programmable control","","285","","46","IEEE","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new approach to extract the document concepts which are consistent with the manifold geometry such that each concept corresponds to a connected component. Central to our approach is a graph model which captures the local geometry of the document submanifold. Thus, we call it Locally Consistent Concept Factorization (LCCF). By using the graph Laplacian to smooth the document-to-concept mapping, LCCF can extract concepts with respect to the intrinsic manifold structure and thus documents associated with the same concept can be well clustered. The experimental results on TDT2 and Reuters-21578 have shown that the proposed approach provides a better representation and achieves better clustering results in terms of accuracy and mutual information.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567104","Nonnegative matrix factorization;concept factorization;graph Laplacian;manifold regularization;clustering.","Manifolds;Geometry;Linear approximation;Laplace equations;Nearest neighbor searches;Vectors","","283","","28","IEEE","9 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, for the first time, we comprehensively study the routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) problem in the SLICE network. After proving the NP-hardness of the static RSA problem, we formulate the RSA problem using the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations to optimally minimize the maximum number of sub-carriers required on any fiber of a SLICE network. We then analyze the lower/upper bounds for the sub-carrier number in a network with general or specific topology.

We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time Tc is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay Tl is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming. We show how to make fast and correct classification decisions under these constraints and apply them to real benchmark data.

The variability of the custom-designed capacitors is estimated by a specialized CAD tool and verified by chip measurements. An implemented 8-bit prototype in a 90 nm CMOS technology occupies 228 μm × 240 μm including decoupling capacitors, and achieves an ENOB of 7.77 bit at a sampling frequency of 10.24 MS/s.

The paper also proposes the idea of adjusting pitch compensation and maximum active power order to the converter in order to improve inertial response during the transient with response to drop in grid frequency. Results obtained on a large realistic power system indicate that the frequency nadir following a large power impact in the form of generators dropping out is effectively improved with the proposed control strategy. The proposed control is also validated against the sudden wind speed change in the form of wind gust downs and wind ramp downs occurring in conjunction with the generators dropping out. A beneficial impact in terms of damping power system oscillations is also observed, which is validated by eigenvalue analysis. The affected mode is then excited with a large disturbance in time domain. The damping improvement observed in time domain and subsequent Prony analysis support the result obtained from eigenvalue analysis.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2051690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508309","Doubly fed induction generator;frequency response inertia;transient stability;wind turbine generators","Control systems;Induction generators;Power system control;Power systems;Wind energy generation;Power generation;Power system transients;Damping;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Wind power generation","","281","","18","IEEE","12 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Useful models accounting for vehicles as obstacles must satisfy a number of requirements, most notably accurate positioning, realistic mobility patterns, realistic propagation characteristics, and manageable complexity. We present a model that satisfies all of these requirements. Vehicles are modeled as physical obstacles affecting the V2V communication. The proposed model accounts for vehicles as three-dimensional obstacles and takes into account their impact on the LOS obstruction, received signal power, and the packet reception rate. We utilize two real world highway datasets collected via stereoscopic aerial photography to test our proposed model, and we confirm the importance of modeling the effects of obstructing vehicles through experimental measurements. Our results show considerable obstruction of LOS due to vehicles. By obstructing the LOS, vehicles induce significant attenuation and packet loss. The algorithm behind the proposed model allows for computationally efficient implementation in VANET simulators. It is also shown that by modeling the vehicles as obstacles, significant realism can be added to existing simulators with clear implications on the design of upper layer protocols.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678778","VANET;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;simulation;signal propagation modeling;channel model","Vehicles;Computational modeling;Ellipsoids;Receivers;Attenuation;Analytical models;Road transportation","","281","2","49","IEEE","30 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Forensic sketches differ from viewed sketches in that they are drawn by a police sketch artist using the description of the subject provided by an eyewitness. To identify forensic sketches, we present a framework called local feature-based discriminant analysis (LFDA). In LFDA, we individually represent both sketches and photos using SIFT feature descriptors and multiscale local binary patterns (MLBP). Multiple discriminant projections are then used on partitioned vectors of the feature-based representation for minimum distance matching. We apply this method to match a data set of 159 forensic sketches against a mug shot gallery containing 10,159 images. Compared to a leading commercial face recognition system, LFDA offers substantial improvements in matching forensic sketches to the corresponding face images. We were able to further improve the matching performance using race and gender information to reduce the target gallery size. Additional experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to state-of-the-art accuracys when matching viewed sketches.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601735","Face recognition;forensic sketch;viewed sketch;local feature discriminant analysis;feature selection;heterogeneous face recognition.","Forensics;Face;Feature extraction;Face recognition;Training;Accuracy;Principal component analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometry;Face;Forensic Medicine;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Paintings;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Subtraction Technique","280","3","35","IEEE","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traffic management is necessary to effectively utilize the bisection bandwidth provided by these topologies. This requires timely detection of elephant flows-flows that carry large amount of data-and managing those flows. Previously proposed approaches incur high monitoring overheads, consume significant switch resources, and/or have long detection times. We propose, instead, to detect elephant flows at the end hosts. We do this by observing the end hosts's socket buffers, which provide better, more efficient visibility of flow behavior. We present Mahout, a low-overhead yet effective traffic management system that follows OpenFlow-like central controller approach for network management but augments the design with our novel end host mechanism. Once an elephant flow is detected, an end host signals the network controller using in-band signaling with low overheads. Through analytical evaluation and experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of Mahout over previous solutions.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9921-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934956","","Switches;Heating","","279","6","30","IEEE","30 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) approach, as a well-known feature-based image matching algorithm, has been successfully applied in a number of automatic registration of remote sensing images. Regardless of its distinctiveness and robustness, the SIFT algorithm suffers from some problems in the quality, quantity, and distribution of extracted features particularly in multisource remote sensing imageries. In this paper, an improved SIFT algorithm is introduced that is fully automated and applicable to various kinds of optical remote sensing images, even with those that are five times the difference in scale. The main key of the proposed approach is a selection strategy of SIFT features in the full distribution of location and scale where the feature qualities are quarantined based on the stability and distinctiveness constraints. Then, the extracted features are introduced to an initial cross-matching process followed by a consistency check in the projective transformation model. Comprehensive evaluation of efficiency, distribution quality, and positional accuracy of the extracted point pairs proves the capabilities of the proposed matching algorithm on a variety of optical remote sensing images.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2144607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5782957","Feature distinctiveness;image matching;scale invariant;uniform spatial distribution","Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Robustness;Image matching;Optical sensors;Lighting","","279","","46","IEEE","31 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These variations arise from different clothing, anatomy, imaging conditions and the large number of poses it is possible for a human body to take. Recent work has shown state-of-the-art results by partitioning the pose space and using strong nonlinear classifiers such that the pose dependence and multi-modal nature of body part appearance can be captured. We propose to extend these methods to handle much larger quantities of training data, an order of magnitude larger than current datasets, and show how to utilize Amazon Mechanical Turk and a latent annotation update scheme to achieve high quality annotations at low cost. We demonstrate a significant increase in pose estimation accuracy, while simultaneously reducing computational expense by a factor of 10, and contribute a dataset of 10,000 highly articulated poses.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995318","","Estimation;Training;Humans;Joints;Training data;Image color analysis;Head","","279","2","27","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To better address this need, we present Monarch, a real-time system that crawls URLs as they are submitted to web services and determines whether the URLs direct to spam. We evaluate the viability of Monarch and the fundamental challenges that arise due to the diversity of web service spam. We show that Monarch can provide accurate, real-time protection, but that the underlying characteristics of spam do not generalize across web services. In particular, we find that spam targeting email qualitatively differs in significant ways from spam campaigns targeting Twitter. We explore the distinctions between email and Twitter spam, including the abuse of public web hosting and redirector services. Finally, we demonstrate Monarch's scalability, showing our system could protect a service such as Twitter -- which needs to process 15 million URLs/day -- for a bit under $800/day.","2375-1207","978-0-7695-4402-1","10.1109/SP.2011.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958045","","Browsers;Web services;Feature extraction;HTML;Electronic mail;Real time systems;IP networks","","278","8","61","IEEE","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A new face descriptor based on coupled information-theoretic encoding is used to capture discriminative local face structures and to effectively match photos and sketches. Guided by maximizing the mutual information between photos and sketches in the quantized feature spaces, the coupled encoding is achieved by the proposed coupled information-theoretic projection tree, which is extended to the randomized forest to further boost the performance. We create the largest face sketch database including sketches of 1, 194 people from the FERET database.

The objective of this paper is the analysis of the noise sources in diffusion-based MC using tools from signal processing, statistics and communication engineering. The reference diffusion-based MC system for this analysis is the physical end-to-end model introduced in a previous work by the same authors. The particle sampling noise and the particle counting noise are analyzed as the most relevant diffusion-based noise sources. The analysis of each noise source results in two types of models, namely, the physical model and the stochastic model. The physical model mathematically expresses the processes underlying the physics of the noise source. The stochastic model captures the noise source behavior through statistical parameters. The physical model results in block schemes, while the stochastic model results in the characterization of the noises using random processes.

This paper introduces two novel multi-objective formulations of the software module clustering problem, in which several different objectives (including cohesion and coupling) are represented separately. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-objective approach, a set of experiments was performed on 17 real-world module clustering problems.

Such type of mathematical models can represent a large number of practical systems in the actual engineering. A new estimation technique (named proportional and derivative sliding mode observer) is developed to deal with this design problem. The proposed observer is mode-dependent type in which a derivative gain and a proportional gain are introduced to provide more design freedom, and a discontinuous input term is introduced to eliminate the effects of sensor faults. By employing the developed estimation technique, the asymptotic estimations of system states and sensor faults can be obtained simultaneously. Based on the estimation, an observer-based fault-tolerant control scheme is developed to stabilize the resulting closed-loop system.

In this paper, we innovatively propose using two new information metrics such as the generalized entropy metric and the information distance metric to detect low-rate DDoS attacks by measuring the difference between legitimate traffic and attack traffic. The proposed generalized entropy metric can detect attacks several hops earlier (three hops earlier while the order α = 10 ) than the traditional Shannon metric. The proposed information distance metric outperforms (six hops earlier while the order α = 10) the popular Kullback-Leibler divergence approach as it can clearly enlarge the adjudication distance and then obtain the optimal detection sensitivity. The experimental results show that the proposed information metrics can effectively detect low-rate DDoS attacks and clearly reduce the false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed IP traceback algorithm can find all attacks as well as attackers from their own local area networks (LANs) and discard attack traffic.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2011.2107320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5696753","Attack detection;information metrics;IP traceback;low-rate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack","Measurement;Entropy;Computer crime;IP networks;Probability distribution;Information entropy;Collaboration","","276","2","30","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is because the learned bases can be interpreted as a natural parts-based representation of data and this interpretation is consistent with the psychological intuition of combining parts to form a whole. For practical classification tasks, however, NMF ignores both the local geometry of data and the discriminative information of different classes. In addition, existing research results show that the learned basis is unnecessarily parts-based because there is neither explicit nor implicit constraint to ensure the representation parts-based. In this paper, we introduce the manifold regularization and the margin maximization to NMF and obtain the manifold regularized discriminative NMF (MD-NMF) to overcome the aforementioned problems. The multiplicative update rule (MUR) can be applied to optimizing MD-NMF, but it converges slowly. In this paper, we propose a fast gradient descent (FGD) to optimize MD-NMF. FGD contains a Newton method that searches the optimal step length, and thus, FGD converges much faster than MUR. In addition, FGD includes MUR as a special case and can be applied to optimizing NMF and its variants. For a problem with 165 samples in R1600 , FGD converges in 28 s, while MUR requires 282 s. We also apply FGD in a variant of MD-NMF and experimental results confirm its efficiency. Experimental results on several face image datasets suggest the effectiveness of MD-NMF.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2105496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5685567","Gradient descent;nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF);manifold regularization","Manifolds;Face;Image coding;Psychology;Vectors;Pattern recognition","Algorithms;Biometric Identification;Databases, Factual;Face;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","276","","51","IEEE","13 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During the information discovery process, agents only communicate with their direct neighbors, and the global information is discovered based on the Average-Consensus Theorem. In this way, total net power, indexes and demands of loads that are ready for restoration can be obtained. Then the load restoration problem can be modeled and solved using existing algorithms for the 0–1 Knapsack problem. To achieve adaptivity and stability, a distributed algorithm for coefficient setting is proposed and compared against existing algorithms and a particle swarm optimization based algorithm. Theoretically, the proposed load restoration algorithm can be applied to systems of any size and structure.

In this paper, we propose a tracking method from the perspective of mid-level vision with structural information captured in superpixels. We present a discriminative appearance model based on superpixels, thereby facilitating a tracker to distinguish the target and the background with mid-level cues. The tracking task is then formulated by computing a target-background confidence map, and obtaining the best candidate by maximum a posterior estimate.

This type of algorithms employ a degree of randomness as part of their logic. Randomized algorithms are useful for difficult problems where a precise solution cannot be derived in a deterministic way within reasonable time. However, randomized algorithms produce different results on every run when applied to the same problem instance. It is hence important to assess the effectiveness of randomized algorithms by collecting data from a large enough number of runs. The use of rigorous statistical tests is then essential to provide support to the conclusions derived by analyzing such data. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the use of randomized algorithms in selected software engineering venues in 2009. Its goal is not to perform a complete survey but to get a representative snapshot of current practice in software engineering research. We show that randomized algorithms are used in a significant percentage of papers but that, in most cases, randomness is not properly accounted for. This casts doubts on the validity of most empirical results assessing randomized algorithms. There are numerous statistical tests, based on different assumptions, and it is not always clear when and how to use these tests.

Most prior work on IA, however, neglects interference from other nodes in the network that are not participating in the alignment operation. This paper proposes three generalizations of IA for the multiple-antenna interference channel with multiple users that account for colored noise, which models uncoordinated interference. First, a minimum interference-plus-noise leakage (INL) algorithm is presented and shown to be equivalent to previous subspace methods when noise is spatially white or negligible. This algorithm results in orthonormal precoders that are desirable for practical implementation with limited feedback. A joint minimum mean square error design that jointly optimizes the transmit precoders and receive spatial filters is then proposed, whereas previous designs neglect the receive spatial filter. Finally, a maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) algorithm is developed and proven to converge, unlike previous maximum SINR algorithms. The sum throughput of these algorithms is simulated in the context of a network with uncoordinated cochannel interferers that are not participating in the alignment protocol. It is found that a network with cochannel interference can benefit from employing precoders that are designed to consider that interference, but in extreme cases, such as when only one receiver has a large amount of interference, ignoring that the cochannel interference is advantageous.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2010.2085459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5604709","Cooperative systems;distributed algorithms;interference channels;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);wireless communication","Receivers;Interference channels;Algorithm design and analysis;Transmitters;Signal to noise ratio","","275","5","32","IEEE","18 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are two main reasons for the limited effort on large-scale image classification. First, until the emergence of ImageNet dataset, there was almost no publicly available large-scale benchmark data for image classification. This is mostly because class labels are expensive to obtain. Second, large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve efficiency in both feature extraction and classifier training without compromising performance. This paper is to show how we address this challenge using ImageNet dataset as an example. For feature extraction, we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature extraction in parallel using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly sophisticated features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all 1000-class SVM classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing with terabytes of training data and converges very fast-typically 5 epochs are sufficient. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification, i.e., 52.9% in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995477","","Encoding;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Training;Training data;Image coding;Kernel","","274","8","28","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unordered image sets as samples from a finite-dimensional linear subspace naturally fall under this framework. We show that an inference over subspaces can be naturally cast as an inference problem on the Grassmann manifold. To perform recognition using subspace-based models, we need tools from the Riemannian geometry of the Grassmann manifold. This involves a study of the geometric properties of the space, appropriate definitions of Riemannian metrics, and definition of geodesics. Further, we derive statistical modeling of inter and intraclass variations that respect the geometry of the space. We apply techniques such as intrinsic and extrinsic statistics to enable maximum-likelihood classification.

The co-saliency is modeled as a linear combination of the single-image saliency map (SISM) and the multi-image saliency map (MISM). The first term is designed to describe the local attention, which is computed by using three saliency detection techniques available in literature. To compute the MISM, a co-multilayer graph is constructed by dividing the image pair into a spatial pyramid representation. Each node in the graph is described by two types of visual descriptors, which are extracted from a representation of some aspects of local appearance, e.g., color and texture properties. In order to evaluate the similarity between two nodes, we employ a normalized single-pair SimRank algorithm to compute the similarity score. Experimental evaluation on a number of image pairs demonstrates the good performance of the proposed method on the co-saliency detection task.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2156803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771591","Attention model;co-saliency;similarity;SimRank","Image color analysis;Computational modeling;Histograms;Feature extraction;Visualization;Image texture;Image segmentation;Image representation","","273","","45","IEEE","19 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new approach plans the future probabilistic distribution of the vehicle state so that the probability of failure is below a specified threshold. Failure occurs when the vehicle collides with an obstacle or leaves an operator-specified region. The key idea behind the approach is to use bounds on the probability of collision to show that, for linear-Gaussian systems, we can approximate the nonconvex chance-constrained optimization problem as a disjunctive convex program. This can be solved to global optimality using branch-and-bound techniques. In order to improve computation time, we introduce a customized solution method that returns almost-optimal solutions along with a hard bound on the level of suboptimality.

The method can even be applied to an underdetermined case where there are fewer microphones than sources. The separation operation is performed in the frequency domain and consists of two stages. In the first stage, frequency-domain mixture samples are clustered into each source by an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Since the clustering is performed in a frequency bin-wise manner, the permutation ambiguities of the bin-wise clustered samples should be aligned. This is solved in the second stage by using the probability on how likely each sample belongs to the assigned class. This two-stage structure makes it possible to attain a good separation even under reverberant conditions. Experimental results for separating four speech signals with three microphones under reverberant conditions show the superiority of the new method over existing methods.

In this paper, we propose a fuzzy association rule-based classification method for high-dimensional problems, which is based on three stages to obtain an accurate and compact fuzzy rule-based classifier with a low computational cost. This method limits the order of the associations in the association rule extraction and considers the use of subgroup discovery, which is based on an improved weighted relative accuracy measure to preselect the most interesting rules before a genetic postprocessing process for rule selection and parameter tuning.

The repetitive nature of object trajectories is utilized to automatically build activity models in a 3-stage hierarchical learning process. Interesting nodes are learned through Gaussian mixture modeling, connecting routes formed through trajectory clustering, and spatio-temporal dynamics of activities probabilistically encoded using hidden Markov models. Activity models are adapted to small temporal variations in an online fashion using maximum likelihood regression and new behaviors are discovered from a periodic retraining for long-term monitoring.

We demonstrate visualization rhetoric as an analytical framework for understanding how design techniques that prioritize particular interpretations in visualizations that ""tell a story"" can significantly affect end-user interpretation. We draw a parallel between narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. Devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels−the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity−and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations.

A novel concept of bounded H∞ synchronization is proposed to handle the time-varying nature of the complex networks. Such a concept captures the transient behavior of the time-varying complex network over a finite horizon, where the degree of bounded synchronization is quantified in terms of the H∞-norm. A general sector-like nonlinear function is employed to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. By utilizing a timevarying real-valued function and the Kronecker product, criteria are established that ensure the bounded H∞ synchronization in terms of a set of recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs), where the RLMIs can be computed recursively by employing available MATLAB toolboxes. The bounded H∞ state estimation problem is then studied for the same complex network, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that, over a finite horizon, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be bounded with a given disturbance attenuation level. Again, an RLMI approach is developed for the state estimation problem.

Our framework incorporates information of neighboring individuals, in an attempt to efficiently guide the evolution of the population toward the global optimum, without sacrificing the search capabilities of the algorithm. More specifically, the random selection of parents during mutation is modified, by assigning to each individual a probability of selection that is inversely proportional to its distance from the mutated individual. The proposed framework can be applied to any mutation strategy with minimal changes. In this paper, we incorporate this framework in the original differential evolution algorithm, as well as other recently proposed differential evolution variants.

It is shown that active and reactive power can be independently controlled with two individually adaptable parameters. By changing these parameters, the relative amplitudes of oscillating power can be smoothly regulated, as well as the peak values of three-phase grid currents. As a result, the power control of grid-interactive inverters becomes quite flexible and adaptable to various grid requirements or design constraints.

It is based on multipass SAR data obtained usually by nonuniformly spaced acquisition orbits. A common 3-D SAR focusing approach is Fourier-based SAR tomography, but this technique brings about image quality problems because of the low number of acquisitions and their not regular spacing. Moreover, attained resolution in elevation is limited by the overall acquisitions baseline extent. In this paper, a novel 3-D SAR data imaging based on Compressive Sampling theory is presented. It is shown that since the image to be focused has usually a sparse representation along the elevation direction (i.e., only few scatterers with different elevation are present in the same range-azimuth resolution cell), it suffices to have a small number of measurements to construct the 3-D image. Furthermore, the method allows super-resolution imaging, overcoming the limitation imposed by the overall baseline span. Tomographic imaging is performed by solving an optimization problem which enforces sparsity through ℓ1-norm minimization. Numerical results on simulated and real data validate the method and have been compared with the truncated singular value decomposition technique.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2054099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5549892","SAR imaging;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);tomography","Sampling methods;Focusing;Image coding;Image sampling;Tomography;Image resolution;Synthetic aperture radar;Layout;Reflectivity;Azimuth","","268","","31","IEEE","16 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such systems aim at helping drivers by either providing a warning to reduce crashes or doing some of the control tasks to relieve a driver from repetitive and boring tasks. Thus, for example, adaptive cruise control (ACC) aims at relieving a driver from manually adjusting his/her speed to maintain a constant speed or a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him/her. Currently, ACC can be improved through vehicle-to-vehicle communication, where the current speed and acceleration of a vehicle can be transmitted to the following vehicles by intervehicle communication. This way, vehicle-to-vehicle communication with ACC can be combined in one single system called cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC). This paper investigates CACC by proposing a novel approach for the design of autonomous vehicle controllers based on modern machine-learning techniques. More specifically, this paper shows how a reinforcement-learning approach can be used to develop controllers for the secure longitudinal following of a front vehicle. This approach uses function approximation techniques along with gradient-descent learning algorithms as a means of directly modifying a control policy to optimize its performance. The experimental results, through simulation, show that this design approach can result in efficient behavior for CACC.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2011.2157145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876320","Autonomous vehicle control;cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC);neural networks;policy-gradient algorithms;reinforcement learning (RL)","Adaptive control;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Cooperative systems;Learning;Function approximation","","267","24","58","IEEE","16 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This performance goal has been mostly achieved by the development of high-density computer systems. As witnessed recently, these systems provide very powerful processing capability and capacity. They often consist of tens or hundreds of thousands of processors and other resource-hungry devices. The energy consumption of these systems has become a major concern. In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling precedence-constrained parallel applications on multiprocessor computer systems and present two energy-conscious scheduling algorithms using dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). A number of recent commodity processors are capable of DVS, which enables processors to operate at different voltage supply levels at the expense of sacrificing clock frequencies. In the context of scheduling, this multiple voltage facility implies that there is a trade-off between the quality of schedules and energy consumption. To effectively balance these two performance goals, we have devised a novel objective function and a variant from that. The main difference between the two algorithms is in their measurement of energy consumption. The extensive comparative evaluations conducted as part of this work show that the performance of our algorithms is very compelling in terms of both application completion time and energy consumption.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677511","Computer systems organization;energy-aware systems;scheduling and task partitioning;simulation of multiprocessor systems;multicomputer systems;performance of systems.","Program processors;Energy consumption;Processor scheduling;Schedules;Scheduling;Optimal scheduling;Voltage control","","266","","29","IEEE","30 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Studies have shown that effective interventions can be taken to contain the epidemics if early detection can be made. Traditional approach employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes collecting influenza-like illness (ILI) activity data from “sentinel” medical practices. Typically there is a 1-2 week delay between the time a patient is diagnosed and the moment that data point becomes available in aggregate ILI reports. In this paper we present the Social Network Enabled Flu Trends (SNEFT) framework, which monitors messages posted on Twitter with a mention of flu indicators to track and predict the emergence and spread of an influenza epidemic in a population. Based on the data collected during 2009 and 2010, we find that the volume of flu related tweets is highly correlated with the number of ILI cases reported by CDC. We further devise auto-regression models to predict the ILI activity level in a population. The models predict data collected and published by CDC, as the percentage of visits to “sentinel” physicians attributable to ILI in successively weeks. We test models with previous CDC data, with and without measures of Twitter data, showing that Twitter data can substantially improve the models prediction accuracy.

Instead of embedding the entire expanded difference into the current pixel, the difference is split between the current pixel and its prediction context. The modification of the context generates an increase of the following prediction errors. Global optimization is obtained by tuning the amount of data embedded into context pixels. Prediction error expansion reversible watermarking schemes based on median edge detector (MED), gradient-adjusted predictor (GAP), and a simplified GAP version, SGAP, are investigated. Improvements are obtained for all the predictors. Notably good results are obtained for SGAP-based schemes.

These are the problem of reaching an agreement on the value of local variables in a network of computational agents and the problem of cooperative solution to a convex optimization problem, where the objective function is the aggregate sum of local convex objective functions. We incorporate the presence of a random communication graph between the agents in our model as a more realistic abstraction of the gossip and broadcast communication protocols of a wireless network. An added ingredient is the presence of local constraint sets to which the local variables of each agent is constrained. Our model allows for the objective functions to be nondifferentiable and accommodates the presence of noisy communication links and subgradient errors. For the consensus problem we provide a diminishing step size algorithm which guarantees asymptotic convergence. The distributed optimization algorithm uses two diminishing step size sequences to account for communication noise and subgradient errors. We establish conditions on these step sizes under which we can achieve the dual task of reaching consensus and convergence to the optimal set with probability one. In both cases we consider the constant step size behavior of the algorithm and establish asymptotic error bounds.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2118740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719290","Asynchronous model;distributed optimization;multiagent system;noisy communications;stochastic optimization","Optimization;Noise;Protocols;Convergence;Symmetric matrices;Noise measurement;Signal processing algorithms","","264","","45","IEEE","22 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a large number of radars, the achievable localization minimum estimation mean-square error (MSE), with full resource allocation, may extend beyond the predetermined system performance goals. In this paper, performance driven resource allocation schemes for multiple radar systems are proposed. All available antennas are used in the localization process. For a predefined estimation MSE threshold, the total transmitted energy is minimized such that the performance objective is met, while keeping the transmitted power at each station within an acceptable range. For a given total power budget, the attainable localization MSE is minimized by optimizing power allocation among the transmit radars. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is used as an optimization metric for the estimation MSE. The resulting nonconvex optimization problems are solved through relaxation and domain decomposition methods, supporting both central processing at the fusion center and distributed processing. It is shown that uniform or equal power allocation is not necessarily optimal and that the proposed power allocation algorithms result in local optima that provide either better localization MSE for the same power budget, or require less power to establish the same performance in terms of estimation MSE. A physical interpretation of these conclusions is offered.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2144976","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5753953","Cramer-Rao bound (CRB);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar;multistatic radar;nonconvex optimization;resource allocation;target localization","Resource management;Radar cross section;Radar antennas;Estimation;Optimization;Accuracy","","264","","28","IEEE","21 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The latter is, indeed, the scope of this paper, which is taken from the Whitehead Memorial Lecture given at the 2010 IEEE Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena (CEIDP). On one hand we will revisit the concepts of space charge accumulation in insulating (polymeric) materials, considering also the latest achievements which deal with ultra-fast charge pulses (solitons), on the other hand we will discuss how space charge can contribute to ageing rate under dc, ac or impulsive voltage, directly through electric field alteration, or indirectly modifying a fundamental ageing factor such as partial discharges.The goal is, at the very end, to show how much such basic investigations can have a fundamental impact on insulation design and electrical apparatus long-term performance/ reliability.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2011.5739438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5739438","Space charge;degradation;charge packets;aging models;partial discharges;insulation breakdown","Space charge;Scattering;Electric breakdown;Electric fields;Equations;Insulation;Polyethylene","","263","","142","IEEE","28 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is proved that for the m th-order consensus, there are at most ⌊(m+1)/2⌋ disconnected stable and unstable consensus regions.

The links in such networks are highly directional: Because of the small carrier wavelength (an order of magnitude smaller than those for existing cellular and wireless local area networks), narrow beams are essential for overcoming higher path loss and can be implemented using compact electronically steerable antenna arrays. Directionality drastically reduces interference, but it also leads to “deafness,” making implicit coordination using carrier sense infeasible. In this paper, we make a quantitative case for rethinking medium access control (MAC) design in such settings. Unlike existing MAC protocols for omnidirectional networks, where the focus is on interference management, we contend that MAC design for 60-GHz mesh networks can essentially ignore interference and must focus instead on the challenge of scheduling half-duplex transmissions with deaf neighbors. Our main contribution is an analytical framework for estimating the collision probability in such networks as a function of the antenna patterns and the density of simultaneously transmitting nodes. The numerical results from our interference analysis show that highly directional links can indeed be modeled as pseudowired, in that the collision probability is small even with a significant density of transmitters. Furthermore, simulation of a rudimentary directional slotted Aloha protocol shows that packet losses due to failed coordination are an order of magnitude higher than those due to collisions, confirming our analytical results and highlighting the need for more sophisticated coordination mechanisms.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2122343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5733382","60-GHz networks;interference analysis;medium access control (MAC);millimeter (mm) wave networks;wireless mesh networks","Interference;Receivers;Antenna arrays;Media Access Protocol;Mesh networks","","261","1","37","IEEE","17 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unsharp masking is a classical tool for sharpness enhancement. We propose a generalized unsharp masking algorithm using the exploratory data model as a unified framework. The proposed algorithm is designed to address three issues: 1) simultaneously enhancing contrast and sharpness by means of individual treatment of the model component and the residual, 2) reducing the halo effect by means of an edge-preserving filter, and 3) solving the out-of-range problem by means of log-ratio and tangent operations. We also present a study of the properties of the log-ratio operations and reveal a new connection between the Bregman divergence and the generalized linear systems. This connection not only provides a novel insight into the geometrical property of such systems, but also opens a new pathway for system development. We present a new system called the tangent system which is based upon a specific Bregman divergence. Experimental results, which are comparable to recently published results, show that the proposed algorithm is able to significantly improve the contrast and sharpness of an image. In the proposed algorithm, the user can adjust the two parameters controlling the contrast and sharpness to produce the desired results.

First, the noise variance is stabilized by applying the Anscombe root transformation to the data, producing a signal in which the noise can be treated as additive Gaussian with unitary variance. Second, the noise is removed using a conventional denoising algorithm for additive white Gaussian noise. Third, an inverse transformation is applied to the denoised signal, obtaining the estimate of the signal of interest. The choice of the proper inverse transformation is crucial in order to minimize the bias error which arises when the nonlinear forward transformation is applied. We introduce optimal inverses for the Anscombe transformation, in particular the exact unbiased inverse, a maximum likelihood (ML) inverse, and a more sophisticated minimum mean square error (MMSE) inverse. We then present an experimental analysis using a few state-of-the-art denoising algorithms and show that the estimation can be consistently improved by applying the exact unbiased inverse, particularly at the low-count regime. This results in a very efficient filtering solution that is competitive with some of the best existing methods for Poisson image denoising.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2056693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5504216","Denoising;photon-limited imaging;Poisson noise;variance stabilization","Image denoising;Gaussian noise;Additive white noise;Additive noise;Noise reduction;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Signal to noise ratio;Maximum likelihood estimation;Algorithm design and analysis","","259","1","22","IEEE","8 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is done by generalizing to multiclass problem techniques defined for binary classifiers. The investigated techniques exploit different query functions, which are based on the evaluation of two criteria: uncertainty and diversity. The uncertainty criterion is associated to the confidence of the supervised algorithm in correctly classifying the considered sample, while the diversity criterion aims at selecting a set of unlabeled samples that are as more diverse (distant one another) as possible, thus reducing the redundancy among the selected samples. The combination of the two criteria results in the selection of the potentially most informative set of samples at each iteration of the AL process. Moreover, we propose a novel query function that is based on a kernel-clustering technique for assessing the diversity of samples and a new strategy for selecting the most informative representative sample from each cluster. The investigated and proposed techniques are theoretically and experimentally compared with state-of-the-art methods adopted for RS applications.

However, the Quality of Service (QoS) delivered by these systems remains an important concern, and needs to be managed in an equally adaptive and predictable way. To address this need, we introduce a novel, tool-supported framework for the development of adaptive service-based systems called QoSMOS (QoS Management and Optimization of Service-based systems). QoSMOS can be used to develop service-based systems that achieve their QoS requirements through dynamically adapting to changes in the system state, environment, and workload. QoSMOS service-based systems translate high-level QoS requirements specified by their administrators into probabilistic temporal logic formulae, which are then formally and automatically analyzed to identify and enforce optimal system configurations. The QoSMOS self-adaptation mechanism can handle reliability and performance-related QoS requirements, and can be integrated into newly developed solutions or legacy systems. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach are validated using simulations and a set of experiments based on an implementation of an adaptive service-based system for remote medical assistance.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611553","Service-oriented software engineering;QoS management;QoS optimization;adaptive systems.","Quality of service;Markov processes;Probabilistic logic;Unified modeling language;Analytical models;Optimization;Scattering","","259","1","102","IEEE","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some stitch to our minds, and other are forgotten. In this paper we focus on the problem of predicting how memorable an image will be. We show that memorability is a stable property of an image that is shared across different viewers. We introduce a database for which we have measured the probability that each picture will be remembered after a single view. We analyze image features and labels that contribute to making an image memorable, and we train a predictor based on global image descriptors. We find that predicting image memorability is a task that can be addressed with current computer vision techniques. Whereas making memorable images is a challenging task in visualization and photography, this work is a first attempt to quantify this useful quality of images.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995721","","Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Games;Humans;Correlation;Semantics;Visualization","","258","3","24","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For an input image, our system first retrieves its nearest neighbors from a large database containing fully annotated images. Then, the system establishes dense correspondences between the input image and each of the nearest neighbors using the dense SIFT flow algorithm [28], which aligns two images based on local image structures. Finally, based on the dense scene correspondences obtained from SIFT flow, our system warps the existing annotations and integrates multiple cues in a Markov random field framework to segment and recognize the query image. Promising experimental results have been achieved by our nonparametric scene parsing system on challenging databases. Compared to existing object recognition approaches that require training classifiers or appearance models for each object category, our system is easy to implement, has few parameters, and embeds contextual information naturally in the retrieval/alignment procedure.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5936073","Object recognition;scene parsing;label transfer;SIFT flow;Markov random fields.","Databases;Labeling;Object recognition;Markov processes;Visualization;Histograms","","258","3","53","IEEE","30 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper investigates such a two-tier infrastructure and possible field-level networks with particular attention to metering and supervisory control and data acquisition applications. For the problem of network integration, a combination of gateway and tunneling solutions is proposed which allows a semitransparent end-to-end connection between application servers and field nodes. The feasibility of the approach and implementation details are discussed at the example of powerline communication and IP-based networks investigated in the European research project on real-time energy management via powerlines and internet.

Consequently, the design of personalized user interfaces and music recommender systems might benefit from understanding the relationship between personality and use of social media. Since there has not been a study between personality and use of Twitter at large, we set out to analyze the relationship between personality and different types of Twitter users, including popular users and influentials. For 335 users, we gather personality data, analyze it, and find that both popular users and influentials are extroverts and emotionally stable (low in the trait of Neuroticism). Interestingly, we also find that popular users are `imaginative' (high in Openness), while influentials tend to be `organized' (high in Conscientiousness). We then show a way of accurately predicting a user's personality simply based on three counts publicly available on profiles: following, followers, and listed counts. Knowing these three quantities about an active user, one can predict the user's five personality traits with a root-mean-squared error below 0.88 on a [1,5] scale. Based on these promising results, we argue that being able to predict user personality goes well beyond our initial goal of informing the design of new personalized applications as it, for example, expands current studies on privacy in social media.","","978-1-4577-1931-8","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113111","Web 2.0;Personality;Social Networks;Twitter","Conferences;Privacy;Social network services;Security","","257","1","41","IEEE","2 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article we describe several methods for predicting the political alignment of Twitter users based on the content and structure of their political communication in the run-up to the 2010 U.S. midterm elections. Using a data set of 1,000 manually-annotated individuals, we find that a support vector machine (SVM) trained on hash tag metadata outperforms an SVM trained on the full text of users' tweets, yielding predictions of political affiliations with 91% accuracy. Applying latent semantic analysis to the content of users' tweets we identify hidden structure in the data strongly associated with political affiliation, but do not find that topic detection improves prediction performance. All of these content-based methods are outperformed by a classifier based on the segregated community structure of political information diffusion networks (95% accuracy).

In this paper, we analyze the performance limits of collaborative spectrum sensing under Byzantine Attacks where malicious users send false sensing data to the fusion center leading to increased probability of incorrect sensing results. We show that above a certain fraction of Byzantine attackers in the CR network, data fusion scheme becomes completely incapable and no reputation based fusion scheme can achieve any performance gain. We present optimal attacking strategies for given attacking resources and also analyze the possible counter measures at the fusion center (FC). Based on these analyses, we also propose a novel and easy to implement technique to counter Byzantine attacks in CRNs.

To overcome these problems, a new process representation language is presented in combination with an accompanying process mining algorithm. The most significant property of the new representation language is in the way the semantics of splits and joins are represented; by using so-called split/join frequency tables. This results in easy to understand process models even in the case of non-trivial constructs, low structured domains and the presence of noise. This paper explains the new process representation language and how the mining algorithm works. The algorithm is implemented as a plug-in in the ProM framework.

Weights in adaline are tuned to minimize the total harmonic distortion of the source current.

In this paper, we investigate the security mechanism when secondary users are facing the jamming attack, and propose a stochastic game framework for anti-jamming defense. At each stage of the game, secondary users observe the spectrum availability, the channel quality, and the attackers' strategy from the status of jammed channels. According to this observation, they will decide how many channels they should reserve for transmitting control and data messages and how to switch between the different channels. Using the minimax-Q learning, secondary users can gradually learn the optimal policy, which maximizes the expected sum of discounted payoffs defined as the spectrum-efficient throughput. The proposed stationary policy in the anti-jamming game is shown to achieve much better performance than the policy obtained from myopic learning, which only maximizes each stage's payoff, and a random defense strategy, since it successfully accommodates the environment dynamics and the strategic behavior of the cognitive attackers.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738229","Security mechanism;spectrum management;cognitive radio networks;game theory;reinforcement learning","Jamming;Games;Stochastic processes;Cognitive radio;Switches;Throughput","","256","","39","IEEE","24 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new statistical model for aggregate interference of a cognitive network, which accounts for the sensing procedure, secondary spatial reuse protocol, and environment-dependent conditions such as path loss, shadowing, and channel fading. We first derive the characteristic function and cumulants of the cognitive network interference at a primary user. Using the theory of truncated-stable distributions, we then develop the statistical model for the cognitive network interference. We further extend this model to include the effect of power control and demonstrate the use of our model in evaluating the system performance of cognitive networks.

Scale integration is achieved by an inverse wavelet transform over the set of scale-weighted center-surround responses. The scale-weighting function (termed ECSF) has been optimized to better replicate psychophysical data on color appearance, and the appropriate sizes of the center-surround inhibition windows have been determined by training a Gaussian Mixture Model on eye-fixation data, thus avoiding ad-hoc parameter selection.

The current anomaly detection methods are susceptible to anomalies in the processing window range or the image scope. In addition, for the local anomaly detection methods themselves, it is difficult to determine the window size suitable for processing background statistics. This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on the random selection of background pixels, the random-selection-based anomaly detector (RSAD). Pixels are randomly selected from the image scene to represent the background statistics; the random selections are performed a sufficient number of times; blocked adaptive computationally efficient outlier nominators are used to detect anomalies each time after a proper subset of background pixels is selected; finally, a fusion procedure is employed to avoid contamination of the background statistics by anomaly pixels. In addition, the real-time implementation of the RSAD is also developed by random selection from updating data and QR decomposition. Several hyperspectral data sets are used in the experiments, and the RSAD shows a better performance than the current hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithms. The real-time version also outperforms its real-time counterparts.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2081677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5628269","Anomaly detection;hyperspectral images;multivariate outlier detection","Pixel;Detectors;Hyperspectral imaging;Covariance matrix;Real time systems;Correlation","","255","","36","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main objective of the proposed controller is to inject a clean sinusoidal current to the grid, even in the presence of nonlinear/unbalanced loads and/or grid-voltage distortions. The repetitive control technique is adopted because it can deal with a very large number of harmonics simultaneously. The proposed current controller consists of an internal model and a stabilizing compensator, which is designed by using the H∞ control theory. It turns out that the stabilizing compensator may be simply an inductor. This leads to a very low total harmonic distortion (THD) and improved tracking performance. In order to demonstrate the improvement of performance, the proposed controller is compared with the traditional proportional-resonant, proportional-integral, and predictive deadbeat controllers. The control strategies are evaluated in the grid-connected mode with experiments under different scenarios: steady-state and transient responses without local loads, and steady-state responses with unbalanced resistive and nonlinear local loads. The proposed controller significantly outperforms the other control schemes in terms of the THD level, with the price of slightly slower dynamic responses.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2010.2089471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607315","Current-controlled;grid-connected inverters;microgrids;repetitive control;total harmonic distortion (THD);voltage-source inverters (VSIs)","Inverters;Voltage control;Inductors;Power quality;Bridge circuits;Frequency control;Pulse width modulation","","255","","30","IEEE","21 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem has received significant attention from the Internet research community in the recent times, driven by many potential applications such as viral marketing and sales promotions. In this paper, we focus on the target set selection problem, which involves discovering a small subset of influential players in a given social network, to perform a certain task of information diffusion. The target set selection problem manifests in two forms: 1) top-k nodes problem and 2) λ -coverage problem. In the top-k nodes problem, we are required to find a set of k key nodes that would maximize the number of nodes being influenced in the network. The λ-coverage problem is concerned with finding a set of key nodes having minimal size that can influence a given percentage λ of the nodes in the entire network. We propose a new way of solving these problems using the concept of Shapley value which is a well known solution concept in cooperative game theory. Our approach leads to algorithms which we call the ShaPley value-based Influential Nodes (SPINs) algorithms for solving the top-k nodes problem and the λ -coverage problem. We compare the performance of the proposed SPIN algorithms with well known algorithms in the literature. Through extensive experimentation on four synthetically generated random graphs and six real-world data sets (Celegans, Jazz, NIPS coauthorship data set, Netscience data set, High-Energy Physics data set, and Political Books data set), we show that the proposed SPIN approach is more powerful and computationally efficient.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2010.2052042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5499450","Diffusion of information;influential nodes;Shapley value;social networks;target set selection;top-$k$ nodes;$\lambda$ -coverage","Social network services;Games;Diffusion processes;Algorithm design and analysis;Greedy algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Context","","254","","52","IEEE","1 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Road detection is of high relevance for autonomous driving, road departure warning, and supporting driver-assistance systems such as vehicle and pedestrian detection. The key for vision-based road detection is the ability to classify image pixels as belonging or not to the road surface. Identifying road pixels is a major challenge due to the intraclass variability caused by lighting conditions. A particularly difficult scenario appears when the road surface has both shadowed and nonshadowed areas. Accordingly, we propose a novel approach to vision-based road detection that is robust to shadows. The novelty of our approach relies on using a shadow-invariant feature space combined with a model-based classifier. The model is built online to improve the adaptability of the algorithm to the current lighting and the presence of other vehicles in the scene. The proposed algorithm works in still images and does not depend on either road shape or temporal restrictions. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on real-world road sequences with heavy traffic and shadows show that the method is robust to shadows and lighting variations. Moreover, the proposed method provides the highest performance when compared with hue-saturation-intensity (HSI)-based algorithms.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2010.2076349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5594640","Driving-assistance system;illuminant invariance;road detection;shadows","Roads;Image color analysis;Pixel;Lighting;Cameras;Entropy;Calibration","","253","3","27","IEEE","4 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To better perform like humans, humanoid robots need the variety of different sensory modalities in order to interact with their environment. This calls for certain robustness and fault tolerance as well as an intelligent solution to connect the different sensory modalities to the robot. Each HEX-O-SKIN is a small hexagonal printed circuit board equipped with multiple discrete sensors for temperature, acceleration, and proximity. With these sensors, we emulate the human sense of temperature, vibration, and light touch. Off-the-shelf sensors were utilized to speed up our development cycle; however, in general, we can easily extend our design with new discrete sensors, thereby making it flexible for further exploration. A local controller on each HEX-O-SKIN preprocesses the sensor signals and actively routes data through a network of modules toward the closest PC connection. Local processing decreases the necessary network and high-level processing bandwidth, while a local analog-to-digital conversion and digital-data transfers are less sensitive to electromagnetic interference. With an active data-routing scheme, it is also possible to reroute the data around broken connections—yielding robustness throughout the global structure while minimizing wirings. To support our approach, multiple HEX-O-SKIN are embedded into a rapid-prototyped elastomer skin material and redundantly connected to neighboring modules by just four ports. The wiring complexity is shifted to each HEX-O-SKIN such that a power and data connection between two modules is reduced to four noncrossing wires. Thus, only a very simple robot-specific base frame is needed to support and wire the HEX-O-SKIN to a robot. The potential of our multimodal sensor modules is demonstrated experimentally on a robot platform.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2011.2106330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5711674","Artificial sensor skin;humanoid skin;multimodal skin;sensor network;tactile-sensor module;touch controller","Skin;Robot sensing systems;Temperature sensors;Materials;Vibrations","","253","2","50","IEEE","10 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scheme evaluation analyzes the prediction performance of competing learning schemes for given historical data sets. The defect predictor builds models according to the evaluated learning scheme and predicts software defects with new data according to the constructed model. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework, we use both simulation and publicly available software defect data sets. RESULTS - The results show that we should choose different learning schemes for different data sets (i.e., no scheme dominates), that small details in conducting how evaluations are conducted can completely reverse findings, and last, that our proposed framework is more effective and less prone to bias than previous approaches. CONCLUSIONS - Failure to properly or fully evaluate a learning scheme can be misleading; however, these problems may be overcome by our proposed framework.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611551","Software defect prediction;software defect-proneness prediction;machine learning;scheme evaluation.","Software;Training data;Predictive models;Buildings;Data models;Prediction algorithms;Training","","253","1","44","IEEE","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Optimal design of LC filter, controller parameters, and damping resistance is carried out in case of grid-connected mode. On the other hand, controller parameters and power sharing coefficients are optimized in case of autonomous mode. The control problem has been formulated as an optimization problem where particle swarm optimization is employed to search for optimal settings of the optimized parameters in each mode. In addition, nonlinear time-domain-based as well as eigenvalue-based objective functions are proposed to minimize the error in the measured power and to enhance the damping characteristics, respectively. Finally, the nonlinear time-domain simulation has been carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed controllers under different disturbances and loading conditions.

Conventional PLL schemes used in DG controller have to compromise between steady-state accuracy and transient dynamics when grid voltage is polluted by unbalance and harmonics. To simultaneously realize good steady-state and transient performances, this paper proposes a general delayed signal cancellation (DSC) operator, which can be tailored to eliminate any specified harmonic. The proposed DSC operator can be further cascaded to stepwise reject all undesired harmonics. Then the conditioned voltage signal can be used in PLL loop to achieve fast transient response at high control bandwidth without suffering from the steady-state error caused by harmonics. Based on differently configured DSC operators, two PLL designs are then developed, namely CDSC-PLL1 and CDSC-PLL2. Specifically, CDSC-PLL1 is aimed for grid voltage with unbalance and odd/even harmonics, while CDSC-PLL2 further addresses asymmetrical harmonics, i.e., harmonics arising from asymmetrically distorted three-phase voltages. By introducing a frequency feedback loop, the proposed PLL can operate properly during considerable frequency variations, even when a phase jump or severe harmonics are also present. All proposed PLL designs have very simple structure and can be easily implemented. The superior performance is confirmed by experimental results.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2010.2099669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5668509","Distributed generation (DG);delayed signal cancellation (DSC);grid synchronization;phase detection;phase-locked loop (PLL)","Harmonic analysis;Phase locked loops;Power system harmonics;Steady-state;Frequency control;Delay;Transient analysis","","252","2","37","IEEE","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, there are no extra current control loops involved, which simplifies the system design and enhances the transient performance. Constant converter switching frequency is achieved by using space vector modulation, which eases the design of the ac harmonic filter. Simulation and experimental results are provided and compared with those of the classic voltage-oriented vector control (VC) and conventional lookup table (LUT) DPC strategies. The proposed SMC-DPC is capable of providing enhanced transient performance similar to that of the LUT-DPC, and keeps the steady-state harmonic spectra at the same level as those of the VC scheme.

Such statistics is usually obtained from large collections of natural images. We claim that the substantial internal data redundancy within a single natural image (e.g., recurrence of small image patches), gives rise to powerful internal statistics, obtained directly from the image itself. While internal patch recurrence has been used in various applications, we provide a parametric quantification of this property. We show that the likelihood of an image patch to recur at another image location can be expressed parametricly as a function of the spatial distance from the patch, and its gradient content. This “internal parametric prior” is used to improve existing algorithms that rely on patch recurrence. Moreover, we show that internal image-specific statistics is often more powerful than general external statistics, giving rise to more powerful image-specific priors. In particular: (i) Patches tend to recur much more frequently (densely) inside the same image, than in any random external collection of natural images. (ii) To find an equally good external representative patch for all the patches of an image, requires an external database of hundreds of natural images. (iii) Internal statistics often has stronger predictive power than external statistics, indicating that it may potentially give rise to more powerful image-specific priors.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995401","","Databases;Noise reduction;Image resolution;Noise;Noise measurement;Redundancy;Estimation","","251","5","16","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The implementations based on two integrators are widely employed to achieve frequency adaptation without substantial computational burden. However, the discretization of these schemes causes a significant error both in the resonant frequency and in the phase lead provided by the delay compensation. Therefore, perfect tracking is not assured, and stability may be compromised. This paper proposes solutions for both problems without adding a significant resource consumption by correction of the roots placement. A simple expression to calculate the target leading angle, in delay compensation schemes, is also proposed to improve stability margins by means of a better accuracy than previous approaches. Experimental results obtained with a laboratory prototype corroborate the theoretical analysis and the improvement achieved by the proposed discrete-time implementations.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2010.2066290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546988","Current control;digital control;power conditioning;pulse width-modulated power converters","Resonance;Digital control;Voltage control;Resonant frequency;Stability;Control systems;Delay systems;Regulators;Steady-state;Active filters","","248","1","35","IEEE","12 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among the existing solutions, \epsilon-differential privacy provides the strongest privacy guarantee. Existing data publishing methods that achieve \epsilon-differential privacy, however, offer little data utility. In particular, if the output data set is used to answer count queries, the noise in the query answers can be proportional to the number of tuples in the data, which renders the results useless. In this paper, we develop a data publishing technique that ensures \epsilon-differential privacy while providing accurate answers for range-count queries, i.e., count queries where the predicate on each attribute is a range. The core of our solution is a framework that applies wavelet transforms on the data before adding noise to it. We present instantiations of the proposed framework for both ordinal and nominal data, and we provide a theoretical analysis on their privacy and utility guarantees.

The antenna system is based on three main parts: feeding part (integrated horns), quasi-optical system and radiating part. The radiating and input parts are placed in two different stacked substrates connected by an optimized quasi-optical system. In contrast to conventional pillbox antennas, the quasi-optical system is made by a pin-made integrated parabola and several coupling slots whose sizes and positions are used to efficiently transfer the energy coming from the input part to the radiating part. The latter consists of a printed leaky-wave antenna, namely an array of slots etched on the uppermost metal layer. Seven pin-made integrated horns are placed in the focal plane of the integrated parabola to radiate seven beams in the far field. Each part of the antenna structure can be optimized independently, thus facilitating and speeding up the complete antenna design. The antenna concept has been validated by measurements (around 24 GHz) showing a scanning capability over  $\pm 30^{\circ}$ in azimuth and more than 20$^{\circ}$ in elevation thanks to the frequency scanning behavior of the leaky-wave radiating part.

In this paper, we introduce a simple new technique for reconstructing a very high-resolution hyperspectral image from two readily obtained measurements: A lower-resolution hyper-spectral image and a high-resolution RGB image. Our approach is divided into two stages: We first apply an unmixing algorithm to the hyperspectral input, to estimate a basis representing reflectance spectra. We then use this representation in conjunction with the RGB input to produce the desired result. Our approach to unmixing is motivated by the spatial sparsity of the hyperspectral input, and casts the unmixing problem as the search for a factorization of the input into a basis and a set of maximally sparse coefficients. Experiments show that this simple approach performs reasonably well on both simulations and real data examples.","1063-6919","978-1-4577-0395-9","10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995457","","Hyperspectral imaging;Cameras;Materials;Spatial resolution;Image reconstruction","","246","6","35","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of performance evaluation is to measure the distance between two sets of tracks: the ground truth tracks and the set of estimated tracks. This paper proposes a mathematically rigorous metric for this purpose. The basis of the proposed distance measure is the recently formulated consistent metric for performance evaluation of multi-target filters, referred to as the OSPA metric. Multi-target filters sequentially estimate the number of targets and their position in the state space. The OSPA metric is therefore defined on the space of finite sets of vectors. The distinction between filtering and tracking is that tracking algorithms output tracks and a track represents a labeled temporal sequence of state estimates, associated with the same target. The metric proposed in this paper is therefore defined on the space of finite sets of tracks and incorporates the labeling error. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed metric behaves in a manner consistent with our expectations.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2140111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5744132","Estimation;performance evaluation;tracking","Target tracking;Performance evaluation;Algorithm design and analysis;Australia;Signal processing algorithms;Electronic mail","","245","","14","Crown","7 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper aims to compare the average spectrum efficiency and the cell edge spectrum efficiency between the two cellular systems in the downlink transmission. In order to achieve high spectrum efficiency, frequency reuse and/or spatial diversity are exploited in these two systems. The performances between the two cellular systems are theoretically compared in a network topology with seven macrocells, each of which has seven hexagonal sectors (or microcells). Moreover, the approach of antenna unit selection in the DAS for spatial diversity is presented. Numerical results show that the average spectrum efficiency per sector and the cell edge spectrum efficiency in the microcellular system are better than those in the DAS without frequency reuse.

This paper examines how cognitive radios initially find one another among the expanse of ever-changing open spectrum, termed the rendezvous problem. Specifically, it addresses the problem of rendezvous under varying levels of system capabilities, spectrum policies, and environmental conditions. The focus is on rendezvous when there are are no control channels or centralized controllers, which we term the blind rendezvous problem. Under these conditions, a sequence-based and modular clock blind rendezvous algorithms are proposed, and it is shown that the performance of these algorithms compares favorably to that of a random blind rendezvous algorithm. Specifically, the sequence-based algorithm provides a bounded Time To Rendezvous (TTR) and the ability to prioritize channels where rendezvous is more likely to occur; the modular clock algorithm reduces the expected TTR, requires little precoordination among radios attempting to rendezvous, and is robust to radios sensing different sets of available channels.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2010.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439004","Dynamic spectrum access;cognitive radio;cognitive network;spectrum sensing;rendezvous.","Cognitive radio;Frequency;Centralized control;Taxonomy;Clocks;Military computing;Telecommunication computing;Robustness;Radiofrequency identification;Government","","245","1","18","IEEE","25 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient method to design optimal control places, and an iteration approach that only computes the reachability graph of a plant Petri net model once in order to obtain a maximally permissive liveness-enforcing supervisor for an FMS. By using a vector covering approach, a minimal covering set of legal markings and a minimal covered set of first-met bad markings (FBM) are computed. At each iteration, an FBM from the minimal covered set is selected. By solving an integer linear programming problem, a place invariant is designed to prevent the FBM from being reached and no marking in the minimal covering set of legal markings is forbidden. This process is carried out until no FBM can be reached. In order to make the considered problem computationally tractable, binary decision diagrams (BDD) are used to compute the sets of legal markings and FBM, and solve the vector covering problem to get a minimal covering set of legal markings and a minimal covered set of FBM.

An MMF is in the strong-coupling regime when the total length of the MMF is much greater than the correlation length over which local principal modes can be considered constant. In this regime, the GDs can be described as the eigenvalues of zero-trace Gaussian unitary ensemble, and the probability density function (pdf) of the GDs is the eigenvalue distribution of the ensemble. For fibers with two to seven modes, the marginal pdf of the GDs is derived analytically. For fibers with a large number of modes, this pdf is shown to approach a semicircle distribution. In the strong-coupling regime, the delay spread is proportional to the square root of the number of independent sections, or the square root of the overall fiber length.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2011.2165316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5986664","Modal dispersion;mode-division multiplexing;multimode fiber;semicircle distribution","Delay;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Couplings;Dispersion;Joints;Correlation;Random variables","","243","3","55","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed control only requires asynchronous information intermittently from neighboring PV generators, making a communication network among the PV units both simple and necessary. The minimum requirement on communication topologies is also prescribed for the proposed control. It is shown that the proposed analysis and design methodology has the advantages that the corresponding communication networks are local, their topology can be time varying, and their bandwidth may be limited.

This paper presents an approach to select objectively parameters for a region growing segmentation technique to outline landslides as individual segments and also addresses the scale dependence of landslides and false positives occurring in a natural landscape. Multiple scale parameters were determined using a plateau objective function derived from the spatial autocorrelation and intrasegment variance analysis, allowing for differently sized features to be identified.

Here, optimal segments were used in a knowledge-based classification approach with the thresholds of diagnostic parameters derived from If-means cluster analysis, to detect landslides of five different types, with an overall recognition accuracy of 76.9%. The approach, when tested in a geomorphologically dissimilar area, recognized landslides with an overall accuracy of 77.7%, without modification to the methodology.

Hence, it provides planners with an essential tool to evaluate downtime costs and decide technology deployments based on quantitative risk assessments by allowing to compare the effect that converter topologies and microgrid architecture choices have on availability. Conventional architectures with single-input converters and alternative configurations with multiple-input converters (MICs) are considered. Calculations yield that all microgrid configurations except those utilizing center converters achieve similar availability of 6-nines. Three converter topologies are used as representatives of many other circuits. These three benchmark circuits are the boost, the isolated SEPIC (ISEPIC), and the current-source half-bridge. Marginal availability differences are observed for different circuit topology choices, although architectures with MICs are more sensitive to this choice. MICs and, in particular, the ISEPIC, are identified as good compromise options for dc microgrids source interfaces. The analysis also models availability influence of local energy storage, both in batteries and generators' fuel. These models provide a quantitative way of comparing dc microgrids with conventional backup energy systems.

The recent finite rate of innovation framework, has paved the way to low rate sampling of such pulses by noticing that only a small number of parameters per unit time are needed to fully describe these signals. Unfortunately, for high rates of innovation, existing sampling schemes are numerically unstable. In this paper we propose a general sampling approach which leads to stable recovery even in the presence of many pulses. We begin by deriving a condition on the sampling kernel which allows perfect reconstruction of periodic streams from the minimal number of samples. We then design a compactly supported class of filters, satisfying this condition. The periodic solution is extended to finite and infinite streams and is shown to be numerically stable even for a large number of pulses. High noise robustness is also demonstrated when the delays are sufficiently separated. Finally, we process ultrasound imaging data using our techniques and show that substantial rate reduction with respect to traditional ultrasound sampling schemes can be achieved.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2105480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5686950","Analog-to-digital conversion;annihilating filters;compressed sensing;finite rate of innovation;perfect reconstruction;sub-Nyquist sampling;ultrasound imaging","Image reconstruction;Streaming media;Kernel;Ultrasonic imaging;Imaging;Technological innovation;Fourier series","","240","7","24","IEEE","13 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most DG units are connected to the microgrid via a power-electronic inverter with dc link. Therefore, new control methods for these inverters need to be developed in order to exploit the DG units as effectively as possible in case of an islanded microgrid. In the literature, most control strategies are based on the conventional transmission grid control or depend on a communication infrastructure. In this paper, on the other hand, an alternative control strategy is proposed based on the specific characteristics of islanded low-voltage microgrids. The microgrid power is balanced by using a control strategy that modifies the set value of the rms microgrid voltage at the inverter ac side as a function of the dc-link voltage. In case a certain voltage, which is determined by a constant-power band, is surpassed, this control strategy is combined with P/V -droop control. This droop controller changes the output power of the DG unit and its possible storage devices as a function of the grid voltage. In this way, voltage-limit violation is avoided. The constant-power band depends on the characteristics of the generator to avoid frequent changes of the power of certain DG units. In this paper, it is concluded that the new control method shows good results in power sharing, transient issues, and stability. This is achieved without interunit communication, which is beneficial concerning reliability issues, and an optimized integration of the renewable energy sources in the microgrid is obtained.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2095044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5685286","DC-link voltage control;distributed generation;microgrid;power sharing;$P/V$ -droop;voltage-source inverter","Voltage control;Inverters;Generators;Frequency control;Renewable energy resources;Power generation;Transient analysis","","240","","30","IEEE","10 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm combines the near-state PWM (NSPWM) method that has superior overall performance characteristics at high modulation index, and MAZSPWM, a modified form of the active zero-state PWM method (AZSPWM1), which is suitable for low modulation index range of operation. Since AZSPWM1 has line-to-line voltage pulse reversals with small zero-voltage time intervals, in its naive form, it causes overvoltages, in particular in long-cable motor drive applications. Obtained by reorganizing the duty cycles of the utilized voltage vectors of AZSPWM1, MAZSPWM has sufficiently long zero-voltage time intervals between pulse reversals such that during pulse reversals, overvoltages are avoided. The combined algorithm performs satisfactorily throughout the inverter operating range and the transition from NSPWM to MAZSPWM and vice versa is seamless. The performance of the proposed algorithm is proven by theory, computer simulations, and detailed laboratory experiments. The paper also shows that the proposed reduced CMV PWM algorithm is effective in reducing the motor leakage current, and it is most beneficial when a small common-mode inductor is included in the drive.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2010.2100100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669355","Active zero-state PWM (AZSPWM);algorithm;common-mode current (CMC);common-mode voltage (CMV);discontinuous PWM (DPWM);inverter;modulation;long cable;near-state PWM (NSPWM);overvoltage;space vector;space vector PWM (SVPWM);pulsewidth modulation (PWM)","Inverters;Surges;Linearity;Space vector pulse width modulation;Switches","","240","12","31","IEEE","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More concisely, the joint posterior distribution of the set-valued map and vehicle trajectory is propagated forward in time as measurements arrive, thereby incorporating both data association and feature management into a single recursion. Furthermore, the Bayes optimality of the proposed approach is established. A first-order solution, which is coined as the probability hypothesis density (PHD) SLAM filter, is derived, which jointly propagates the posterior PHD of the map and the posterior distribution of the vehicle trajectory. A Rao-Blackwellized (RB) implementation of the PHD-SLAM filter is proposed based on the Gaussian-mixture PHD filter (for the map) and a particle filter (for the vehicle trajectory).

Unfortunately, almost all ZigBee channels overlap with wireless local area network (WLAN) channels, resulting in severe performance degradation due to interference. In this paper, we aim to develop practical ZigBee deployment guideline under the interference of WLAN. We identify the “Safe Distance” and “Safe Offset Frequency” using a comprehensive approach including theoretical analysis, software simulation, and empirical measurement. In addition, we propose a frequency agility-based interference avoidance algorithm. The proposed algorithm can detect interference and adaptively switch nodes to “safe” channel to dynamically avoid WLAN interference with small latency and small energy consumption. Our proposed scheme is implemented with a Meshnetics ZigBit Development Kit and its performance is empirically evaluated in terms of the packet error rate (PER) using a ZigBee and Wi-Fi coexistence test bed.

The root cause of harmonic interaction/resonance problems is the impedance-network quasi-resonance between the effective output impedance of the inverter and the equivalent grid impedance at the connection point. Starting with the output impedance modeling of an inverter, a Norton model of the inverter is derived. Comparing with the switching model and the average model of the inverter, simulation results show the effectiveness of the model. This paper proposes that impedance limits should be specified and used as an extra design constraint for DG inverters in order to minimize the harmonic distortion impact on the grid. Assuming the impedance models of individual inverters and local loads within a distribution grid are known, especially in the case of new grids under construction, harmonic interactions between the grid and a certain number of DG inverters can be preliminarily estimated.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2010.2091286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5624644","Distributed generation (DG);distortion;harmonic interactions;inverters;modeling","Inverters;Harmonic analysis;Impedance;Integrated circuit modeling;Harmonic distortion;Analytical models;Power system harmonics","","239","","27","IEEE","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the requirements of efficient integration and simple fabrication, the co-design approach for the integration of filter and antenna is introduced.

The equivalent circuit model for the inverted-L antenna, which is mainly a series RLC circuit, is first established. The values of the corresponding circuit components are then extracted by comparing with the full-wave simulation results. The inverted-L antenna here performs not only a radiator but also the last resonator of the bandpass filter. A design procedure is given, which clearly indicates the steps from the filter specifications to the implementation. As an example, a 2.45 GHz third-order Chebyshev bandpass filter with 0.1 dB equal-ripple response is tackled. Without suffering more circuit area, the proposed structure provides good design accuracy and filter skirt selectivity as compared to the filter simple cascade with antenna and a bandpass filter of the same order.

Stereoscopic displays require eyewear and can be categorized based on the multiplexing scheme as: 1) color multiplexed (old technology but there are some recent developments; low-quality due to color reproduction and crosstalk issues; simple and does not require additional electronics hardware); 2) polarization multiplexed (requires polarized light output and polarization-based passive eyewear; high-resolution and high-quality displays available); and 3) time multiplexed (requires faster display hardware and active glasses synchronized with the display; high-resolution commercial products available). Binocular head-mounted displays can readily provide 3-D, virtual images, immersive experience, and more possibilities for interactive displays. However, the bulk of the optics, matching of the left and right ocular images and obtaining a large field of view make the designs quite challenging. Some of the recent developments using unconventional optical relays allow for thin form factors and open up new possibilities. Autostereoscopic displays are very attractive as they do not require any eyewear. There are many possibilities in this category including: two-view (the simplest implementations are with a parallax barrier or a lenticular screen), multiview, head tracked (requires active optics to redirect the rays to a moving viewer), and super multiview (potentially can solve the accommodation–convergence mismatch problem). Earlier 3-D booms did not last long mainly due to the unavailability of enabling technologies and the content. Current developments in the hardware technologies provide a renewed interest in 3-D displays both from the consumers and the display manufacturers, which is evidenced by the recent commercial products and new research results in this field.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2098351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5701756","Autostereoscopic;head-mounted displays;head tracked;multiview;parallax barrier;stereoscopic;volumetric;3-D displays","Three dimensional displays;Stereo image processing;Image color analysis;Image resolution;Multiplexing","","238","14","130","IEEE","28 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Revision of the training techniques is therefore necessary to improve the accuracy in long-term prognosis. This paper presents a competitive learning-based approach to long-term prognosis of machine health status. Specifically, vibration signals from a defect-seeded rolling bearing are preprocessed using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Statistical parameters computed from both the raw data and the preprocessed data are then utilized as candidate inputs to an RNN. Based on the principle of competitive learning, input data were clustered for effective representation of similar stages of defect propagation of the bearing being monitored. Analysis has shown that the developed technique is more accurate in predicting bearing defect progression than the incremental training technique.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2010.2078296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710193","Competitive learning;continuous wavelet transform (CWT);long-term prediction","Training;Neurons;Recurrent neural networks;Predictive models;Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Continuous wavelet transforms","","238","","32","IEEE","7 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our contributions are summarized as follows. For linear arrays with constrained form factor, an asymptotic analysis based on the properties of prolate spheroidal wave functions shows that a sparse array producing a spatially uncorrelated channel matrix effectively provides the maximum number of spatial degrees of freedom in a LOS environment, although substantial beamforming gains can be obtained by using denser arrays. This motivates our proposed mm-wave MIMO architecture, which utilizes arrays of subarrays to provide both directivity and spatial multiplexing gains. System performance is evaluated in a simulated indoor environment using a ray-tracing model that incorporates multipath effects and potential LOS blockage. Eigenmode transmission with waterfilling power allocation serves as a performance benchmark, and is compared to the simpler scheme of beamsteering transmission with MMSE reception and a fixed signal constellation. Our numerical results provide insight into the spatial variations of attainable capacity within a room, and the combinations of beamsteering and spatial multiplexing used in different scenarios.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2011.092911.101843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042312","Millimeter wave communication;MIMO;channel capacity;antenna arrays","MIMO;Antenna arrays;Multiplexing;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Receivers","","237","2","28","IEEE","13 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed distribution system operation objective is based on the minimization of the energy drawn from the substation while seeking to minimize the number of switching operations of load tap changers and capacitors. A novel method for solving the three-phase DOPF model by transforming the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to a nonlinear programming problem is proposed which reduces the computational burden and facilitates its practical implementation and application.

"Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in Group Decision Making and its Optimization With an Allocation of Information Granularity","W. Pedrycz; M. Song","University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,"31 May 2011","2011","19","3","527","539","In group decision making, one strives to reconcile differences of opinions (judgments) expressed by individual members of the group. Fuzzy-decision-making mechanisms bring a great deal of flexibility. By admitting membership degrees, we are offered flexibility to exploit different aggregation mechanisms and navigate a process of interaction among decision makers to achieve an increasing level of consistency within the group. While the studies reported so far exploit more or less sophisticated ways of adjusting/transforming initial judgments (preferences) of individuals, in this paper, we bring forward a concept of information granularity. Here, information granularity is viewed as an essential asset, which offers a decision maker a tangible level of flexibility using some initial preferences conveyed by each individual that can be adjusted with the intent to reach a higher level of consensus. Our study is concerned with an extension of the well-known analytic hierarchy process to the group decision-making scenario. More specifically, the admitted level of granularity gives rise to a granular matrix of pairwise comparisons. The granular entries represented, e.g., by intervals or fuzzy sets, supply a required flexibility using the fact that we select the most suitable numeric representative of the reciprocal matrix. The proposed concept of granular reciprocal matrices is used to optimize a performance index, which comes as an additive combination of two components. The first one expresses a level of consistency of the individual pairwise comparison matrices; by exploiting the admitted level of granularity, we aim at the minimization of the corresponding inconsistency index. The second part of the performance index quantifies a level of disagreement in terms of the individual preferences. The flexibility offered by the level of granularity is used to increase the level of consensus within the group. Given an implicit nature of relationships between the realizations of the granular pairwise matrices and the values of the performance index, we consider using particle swarm optimization as an optimization vehicle. Two scenarios of allocation of granularity among decision makers are considered, namely, a uniform allocation of granularity and nonuniform distribution of granularity, where the levels of allocated granularity are also subject to optimization. A number of numeric studies are provided to illustrate an essence of the method.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2116029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714744","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP);consensus formation;consistency;granularity of information;group decision making;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Optimization;Decision making;Resource management;Fuzzy sets;Symmetric matrices;Indexes;Performance analysis","","236","","33","IEEE","17 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we simulate and experimentally investigate the source-pocket tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET), which is based on the principle of band-to-band tunneling, p-i-n and source-pocket TFETs are fabricated with different pocket conditions to observe the effect of the source-side pocket on device performance. Different annealing schemes (spike and conventional rapid thermal annealing) are used to study the effect of annealing conditions on TFET performance. The source-pocket TFET shows a higher ION (~10 times) and steeper subthreshold swing as compared to a p-i-n TFET. The ambipolar conduction is also reduced by using a low-doped drain extension. Low-temperature measurements of the source-pocket TFET were performed, and the subthreshold swing of the source-pocket TFET shows very little temperature dependence, which confirms the dominant source injection mechanism to be band-to-band tunneling.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2010.2089525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640662","Band-to-band tunneling;low power;steep subthreshold swing (SS);tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET)","Tunneling;Junctions;Annealing;Performance evaluation;Doping;PIN photodiodes;Logic gates","","236","4","30","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the positive-sequence component, the phase angles for the positive- and negative-sequence components of the grid voltage are derived. A control algorithm for the DVR that is dual voltage controllers only is implemented for the two sequence components in the dq synchronous reference frame.

Nodes in such areas quickly deplete energy resources, leading to disruption in network services. This problem is common for data collection scenarios in which Cluster Heads (CH) have a heavy burden of gathering and relaying information. The relay load on CHs especially intensifies as the distance to the sink decreases. To balance the traffic load and the energy consumption in the network, the CH role should be rotated among all nodes and the cluster sizes should be carefully determined at different parts of the network. This paper proposes a distributed clustering algorithm, Energy-efficient Clustering (EC), that determines suitable cluster sizes depending on the hop distance to the data sink, while achieving approximate equalization of node lifetimes and reduced energy consumption levels. We additionally propose a simple energy-efficient multihop data collection protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of EC and calculate the end-to-end energy consumption of this protocol; yet EC is suitable for any data collection protocol that focuses on energy conservation. Performance results demonstrate that EC extends network lifetime and achieves energy equalization more effectively than two well-known clustering algorithms, HEED and UCR.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2011.092011.110717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030119","Energy-efficient;clustering;wireless sensor network;multihop;hot spot issue","Protocols;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Energy states;Mathematical model;Clustering algorithms","","234","","22","IEEE","29 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sparse signal recovery algorithms, including many $l_{1}$-norm based approaches, can offer improved estimation in that case. In this paper, we present a regularized minimization approach to sparse signal recovery. Sparse learning via iterative minimization (SLIM) follows an $l_{q}$-norm constraint (for  $0<q\leq 1$), and can thus be used to provide more accurate estimates compared to the $l_{1}$-norm based approaches. We herein compare SLIM, through imaging examples and examination of computational complexity, to several well-known sparse methods, including the widely used CoSaMP approach. We show that SLIM provides superior performance for sparse MIMO radar imaging applications at a low computational cost.

The subspace decomposition-based techniques such as MUSIC can then be used for direction finding for multiple targets. Moreover, the transmit beamformers can be designed so that matched-filtering the received data to the waveforms yields multiple (two or more) data sets with rotational invariance property that allows applying search-free direction finding techniques such as ESPRIT or parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Unlike previously reported MIMO radar ESPRIT/PARAFAC-based direction finding techniques, our method achieves the rotational invariance property in a different manner combined also with the transmit energy focusing. As a result, it achieves better estimation performance at lower computational cost. The corresponding Cramer-Rao bound is derived and its dependence on the number of waveforms used is discussed.

However, high computational cost and long reconstruction times remain as a barrier to the use of MBIR in practical applications. Among the various iterative methods that have been studied for MBIR, iterative coordinate descent (ICD) has been found to have relatively low overall computational requirements due to its fast convergence. This paper presents a fast model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm using spatially nonhomogeneous ICD (NH-ICD) optimization. The NH-ICD algorithm speeds up convergence by focusing computation where it is most needed. The NH-ICD algorithm has a mechanism that adaptively selects voxels for update. First, a voxel selection criterion VSC determines the voxels in greatest need of update. Then a voxel selection algorithm VSA selects the order of successive voxel updates based upon the need for repeated updates of some locations, while retaining characteristics for global convergence. In order to speed up each voxel update, we also propose a fast 1-D optimization algorithm that uses a quadratic substitute function to upper bound the local 1-D objective function, so that a closed form solution can be obtained rather than using a computationally expensive line search algorithm. We examine the performance of the proposed algorithm using several clinical data sets of various anatomy.

We then propose to model speech corrupted by additive noise as a linear combination of noise and speech exemplars, and we derive an algorithm for recovering this sparse linear combination of exemplars from the observed noisy speech. We describe how the framework can be used for doing hybrid exemplar-based/HMM recognition by using the exemplar-activations together with the phonetic information associated with the exemplars. As an alternative to hybrid recognition, the framework also allows us to take a source separation approach which enables exemplar-based feature enhancement as well as missing data mask estimation. We evaluate the performance of these exemplar-based methods in connected digit recognition on the AURORA-2 database. Our results show that the hybrid system performed substantially better than source separation or missing data mask estimation at lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), achieving up to 57.1% accuracy at SNR = -5 dB.

We simulated the temperature dependence of the I -V characteristics both at positive and negative gate voltages by applying the multiphonon trap-assisted tunneling model describing the charge transport through the dielectric. In the depletion/weak inversion regime, the current is limited by the supply of carriers available for tunneling. In strong inversion, the temperature dependence is governed by the charge transport mechanisms through the stacks; in particular, in SiO2/HfO2 dielectric stacks, the coupling of the injected carriers with the dielectric phonons at the trap sites is the dominant mechanism. Matching the simulation results to the measurement data allows extracting important trap parameters, e.g., the trap relaxation and ionization energies, which identify the atomic structure of the electrically active defects in the gate dielectric.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2011.2158825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5948373","Dielectric defects;high-$k$;leakage current;modeling;oxide reliability;temperature;trap assisted tunneling","Logic gates;Temperature measurement;Current measurement;Dielectrics;Phonons;Electron traps","","232","4","41","IEEE","11 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A two-layer sparse coding (TSC) model is designed to discover the “true” neighbors of the images and bypass the intensive learning phase of the satellite image classification. The underlying philosophy of the TSC is that an image can be more sparsely reconstructed via the images (sparse I) belonging to the same category (sparse II). The images are classified according to a newly defined “image-to-category” similarity based on the coding coefficients. Requiring no training phase, our method achieves very promising results.

In this paper, we focus on the energy efficiency of a cognitive radio network, in which a secondary user senses the channels licensed to some primary users sequentially before it decides to transmit. Energy is consumed in both the channel sensing and transmission processes. The energy-efficient design calls for a careful design in the sensing-access strategies and the sensing order, with the sensing strategy specifying when to stop sensing and start transmission, the access strategy specifying the power level to be used upon transmission, and the sensing order specifying the sequence of channel sensing. Hence, the objective of this paper is to identify the sensing-access strategies and the sensing order that achieve the maximum energy efficiency. We first investigate the design when the channel sensing order is given and formulate the above design problem as a stochastic sequential decision-making problem. To solve it, we study another parametric formulation of the original problem, which rewards transmission throughput and penalizes energy consumption. Dynamic programming can be applied to identify the optimal strategy for the parametric problem. Then, by exploring the relationship between the two formulations and making use of the monotonicity property of the parametric formulation, we develop an algorithm to find the optimal sensing-access strategies for the original problem. Furthermore, we study the joint design of the channel sensing order and the sensing-access strategies. Lastly, the performance of the proposed designs is evaluated through numerical results.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992834","Cognitive radio;sequential channel sensing;energy efficiency;adaptive power allocation;sensing order","Sensors;Channel estimation;Energy consumption;Throughput;Decision making;Resource management;Cost function","","232","","23","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These images are estimated in practice from a Hermitian product on local windows. These windows lead to biases and resolution losses due to the local heterogeneity caused by edges and textures. This paper proposes a nonlocal approach for the joint estimation of the reflectivity, the interferometric phase, and the coherence images from an interferometric pair of coregistered single-look complex (SLC) SAR images. Nonlocal techniques are known to efficiently reduce noise while preserving structures by performing the weighted averaging of similar pixels. Two pixels are considered similar if the surrounding image patches are “resembling.” Patch similarity is usually defined as the Euclidean distance between the vectors of graylevels. In this paper, a statistically grounded patch-similarity criterion suitable to SLC images is derived. A weighted maximum likelihood estimation of the SAR interferogram is then computed with weights derived in a data-driven way. Weights are defined from the intensity and interferometric phase and are iteratively refined based both on the similarity between noisy patches and on the similarity of patches from the previous estimate. The efficiency of this new interferogram construction technique is illustrated both qualitatively and quantitatively on synthetic and true data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2076376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5617267","Estimation;interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);nonlocal means","Pixel;Coherence;Noise measurement;Noise reduction;Covariance matrix;Maximum likelihood estimation","","231","","42","IEEE","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The non-equiprobable symbols of the augmented alphabet motivate a sparsity-exploiting maximum a posteriori probability (S-MAP) criterion, which is shown to yield a cost comprising the ℓ2 least-squares error penalized by the p-th norm of the wanted symbol vector (p = 0, 1, 2).

It is verified that the PMSM model for multiparameter estimation under id = 0 control is rank deficient for simultaneously estimating winding resistance, rotor flux linkage, and winding inductance and cannot ensure them to converge to the correct parameter values. A new method is proposed based on injecting a short pulse of negative id current and simultaneously solving two sets of simplified PMSM state equations corresponding to id = 0 and id ≠ 0 by using an Adaline neural network. The convergence of solutions is ensured, while the minimum |id| is determined from the error analysis for nonsalient-pole PMSMs. The proposed method does not need the nominal value of any parameter and only needs to sample the winding terminal currents and voltages, and the rotor speed for simultaneously estimating the dq-axis inductances, the winding resistance, and the rotor flux linkage in nonsalient-pole PMSMs. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method can eliminate the estimation error caused by the variation of rotor flux linkage and inductance as a result of state change due to the injected d-axis current in the surface-mounted PMSM.

However, locating text from a complex background with multiple colors is a challenging task. In this paper, we explore a new framework to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations in complex natural scene images. Our proposed framework of text string detection consists of two steps: 1) image partition to find text character candidates based on local gradient features and color uniformity of character components and 2) character candidate grouping to detect text strings based on joint structural features of text characters in each text string such as character size differences, distances between neighboring characters, and character alignment. By assuming that a text string has at least three characters, we propose two algorithms of text string detection: 1) adjacent character grouping method and 2) text line grouping method. The adjacent character grouping method calculates the sibling groups of each character candidate as string segments and then merges the intersecting sibling groups into text string. The text line grouping method performs Hough transform to fit text line among the centroids of text candidates. Each fitted text line describes the orientation of a potential text string. The detected text string is presented by a rectangle region covering all characters whose centroids are cascaded in its text line. To improve efficiency and accuracy, our algorithms are carried out in multi-scales. The proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art results on the public Robust Reading Dataset, which contains text only in horizontal orientation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our methods to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations is evaluated on the Oriented Scene Text Dataset collected by ourselves containing text strings in nonhorizontal orientations.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2126586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5729827","Adjacent character grouping;character property;image partition;text line grouping;text string detection;text string structure","Image color analysis;Pixel;Joining processes;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Image edge detection;Algorithm design and analysis","","230","5","39","IEEE","14 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We compare our results to those previously reported and find that, while they confirm some of the earlier work, there are also differences that motivate the need for further studies.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2010.2094632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645701","Channel models;propagation constant;propagation losses;radio propagation;vehicles","Antenna measurements;Road transportation;Frequency measurement;Wireless communication;Data models;Directive antennas;Buildings","","230","","19","IEEE","29 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Global and local information are extracted from the periocular region using texture and point operators resulting in a feature set for representing and matching this region. A number of aspects are studied in this work, including the 1) effectiveness of incorporating the eyebrows, 2) use of side information (left or right) in matching, 3) manual versus automatic segmentation schemes, 4) local versus global feature extraction schemes, 5) fusion of face and periocular biometrics, 6) use of the periocular biometric in partially occluded face images, 7) effect of disguising the eyebrows, 8) effect of pose variation and occlusion, 9) effect of masking the iris and eye region, and 10) effect of template aging on matching performance.

These moves allow the search to escape weak minima and explore a much larger portion of the variable-dimensional search space, while still always reducing the energy. To demonstrate the validity of this approach we present an extensive quantitative evaluation both on synthetic data and on six different real video sequences.

The first prototype is able to achieve an excellent sidelobe level of -27.7 dB by properly meandering a long slot etched on the broadside of a straight SIW section from the centerline toward the sidewall then back. But it is known that an asymmetrically curved slot would worsen the cross-polar level. To overcome this drawback, a modified leaky-wave antenna is proposed, which has a straight long slot etched on the broadside of a meandering SIW section. It yields an outstanding sidelobe level of -29.3 dB and also improves the cross-polar level by more than 11 dB at 35 GHz. Experimental results agree well with simulations, thus validating our design. Then, a two-dimensional (2-D) multibeam antenna is developed by combining such 14 leaky-wave antennas with an SIW beamforming network (BFN). It has features of scanning both in elevation orientation by varying frequency and in cross-plane direction by using the BFN. Excited at ports 1-10 of such a 2-D multibeam antenna at 35 GHz, angular region of 86.6° in azimuth can effectively be covered by 3 dB beam-width of ten pencil beams. Varying frequency from 33 GHz to 37 GHz, the angular region of 37.5° and 38.9° in elevation can be covered by 3 dB beam-width of those continuous scanning beams excited at ports 6 and 8 respectively.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2010.2090471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5617222","Frequency scanning antenna;leaky-wave antenna;long slot;low sidelobe level;substrate integrated waveguide (SIW);two-dimensional (2-D) multibeam","Leaky wave antennas;Antenna measurements;Fabrication;Antenna radiation patterns;Substrates;Shape","","229","1","19","IEEE","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Variances in electrochemical characteristics among Li-Ion batteries caused by aging differences result in erroneous SOC estimation and SOH prediction when using the existing EKF algorithm. To apply the battery model parameters varied by the aging effect, based on the p.u. system, the absolute values of the parameters in the equivalent circuit model in addition to the discharging/charging voltage and current are converted into dimensionless values relative to a set of base value. The converted values are applied to dynamic and measurement models in the EKF algorithm. In particular, based on two methods such as direct current internal resistance measurement and the statistical analysis of voltage pattern, each diffusion resistance $(R_{\rm Diff})$ can be measured and used for offline and online SOC estimations, respectively. All SOC estimates are within  $\pm$5% of the values estimated by ampere-hour counting. Moreover, it is shown that $R_{\rm Diff}$ is more sensitive than other model parameters under identical experimental conditions and, hence, implementable for SOH prediction.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2011.2168987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6024483","Extended Kalman filter (EKF);per-unit (p.u.) system;state of charge (SOC);state of health (SOH)","Batteries;System-on-a-chip;Voltage measurement;Battery charge measurement;Current measurement;Integrated circuit modeling;Kalman filters","","228","4","40","IEEE","23 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Grid voltage sag causes overcurrents and overvoltages in rotor windings, which can damage the rotor-side converter (RSC). In order to protect the RSC, a classical solution based on installation of the so-called crowbar is adopted; however, as the DFIG absorbs reactive power from the grid, this type of solution deteriorates grid voltage sags and cannot meet the requirements of a new grid code. An improved control strategy which uses virtual resistance to limit rotor side overcurrents is proposed in this paper, which can make a crowbar inactive and supply reactive power to fulfill the latest grid code requirement during voltage sags. In order to validate the proposed strategy, simulations and experiments have been carried out, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2011.2161776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5953525","Demagnetizing;doubly fed generation;grid fault;ride-through control;virtual resistance","Rotors;Stator windings;Voltage fluctuations;Circuit faults;Wind turbines;Windings","","228","","35","IEEE","14 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These loss factors will result in power deviation from the maximum power points. In this paper, both single-stage and two-stage grid-connected PV systems are considered.

Higher DG penetration levels may be interesting from many different points of view, but raise important issues about distribution system operation. Therefore, new techniques are needed to determine the maximum amount of DG that may be installed without requiring major changes in the existing electric power system. According to the literature, voltage rises at load bus bars are a serious limiting factor when installing DG. This paper presents and discusses studies proving that conductor ampacity and voltage rises are limiting factors that manifest themselves under different conditions. The present study highlights situations in which line overloads are more restrictive than voltage rises. Variation in substation voltage, load, and its power factor were simulated in a simplified radial distribution system model, and the amount of distributed generation that may be installed was obtained.

It is a disease in which fluid pressure in the eye increases continuously, damaging the optic nerve and causing vision loss. Computational decision support systems for the early detection of glaucoma can help prevent this complication. The retinal optic nerve fiber layer can be assessed using optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry, and Heidelberg retina tomography scanning methods. In this paper, we present a novel method for glaucoma detection using a combination of texture and higher order spectra (HOS) features from digital fundus images. Support vector machine, sequential minimal optimization, naive Bayesian, and random-forest classifiers are used to perform supervised classification. Our results demonstrate that the texture and HOS features after z-score normalization and feature selection, and when combined with a random-forest classifier, performs better than the other classifiers and correctly identifies the glaucoma images with an accuracy of more than 91%. The impact of feature ranking and normalization is also studied to improve results. Our proposed novel features are clinically significant and can be used to detect glaucoma accurately.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2011.2119322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720314","Classifier;glaucoma;higher order spectra (HOS);texture","Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Classification algorithms;Optical fibers;Artificial neural networks;Entropy","Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological;Fundus Oculi;Glaucoma;Glaucoma;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Middle Aged;ROC Curve","228","1","27","IEEE","24 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, a 15-level hybrid converter can be attained with a minimum number of power components. A comparative study has been carried out to present high performance of the proposed configuration to approach a very low total harmonic distortion of voltage and current, which leads to the possible elimination of the output filter. Regarding the proposed configuration, a new cascade inverter is verified by cascading an asymmetrical diode-clamped inverter, in which 19 levels can be synthesized in output voltage with the same number of components. To balance the dc link capacitor voltages for the maximum output voltage resolution as well as synthesize asymmetrical dc link combination, a new multi-output boost converter is utilized at the dc link voltage of a seven-level H-bridge diode-clamped inverter.

Proximity to the front and diversity of solutions within the approximation set are important requirements. Most established multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have mechanisms that address these requirements. However, in many-objective optimization, where the number of objectives is greater than 2 or 3, it has been found that these two requirements can conflict with one another, introducing problems such as dominance resistance and speciation. In this paper, two diversity management mechanisms are introduced to investigate their impact on overall solution convergence. They are introduced separately, and in combination, and tested on a set of test functions with an increasing number of objectives (6-20). It is found that the inclusion of one of the mechanisms improves the performance of a well-established MOEA in many-objective optimization problems, in terms of both convergence and diversity.

Subsequently, we employ the multiplication matrix to determine all the roots of the system analytically, and hence all minima of the LS, without requiring iterations or an initial guess of the parameters. A key advantage of our method is scalability, since the order of the polynomial system that we solve is independent of the number of points.

By applying the delay partitioning approach, a delay-dependent sufficient condition is proposed for the asymptotic stability with an H∞ error performance for the error system. Then, the H∞ model approximation problem is solved by using the projection approach, which casts the model approximation into a sequential minimization problem subject to linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints by employing the cone complementary linearization algorithm. Moreover, by further extending the results, H∞ model approximation with special structures is obtained, i.e., delay-free model and zero-order model.

In this paper, a simple fuzzy-based frequency-control method is proposed for the PV generator in a PV-diesel hybrid system without the smoothing of PV output power fluctuations. By means of the proposed method, output power control of a PV generator considering the conditions of power utilities and the maximizing of energy capture are achieved. Here, fuzzy control is used to generate the PV output power command. This fuzzy control has average insolation, change of insolation, and frequency deviation as inputs.

Introducing a new parameter p that fixes a power for the edge weights allows us to also include the optimal spanning forest algorithm for watershed in this same framework. We then propose a new family of segmentation algorithms that fixes p to produce an optimal spanning forest but varies the power q beyond the usual watershed algorithm, which we term the power watershed. In particular, when q=2, the power watershed leads to a multilabel, scale and contrast invariant, unique global optimum obtained in practice in quasi-linear time.

The approach splits the control architecture into two separate layers. The hierarchical top layer is used to implement a strategy that addresses the desired transparency, and the lower layer ensures that no “virtual” energy is generated. This means that any bilateral controller can be implemented in a passive manner. Separate communication channels connect the layers at the slave and master sides so that information related to exchanged energy is completely separated from information about the desired behavior.

The availability statistics of the channels are initially unknown to the secondary users and are estimated using sensing decisions. There is no explicit information exchange or prior agreement among the secondary users and sensing and access decisions are undertaken by them in a completely distributed manner. We propose policies for distributed learning and access which achieve order-optimal cognitive system throughput (number of successful secondary transmissions) under self play, i.e., when implemented at all the secondary users. Equivalently, our policies minimize the sum regret in distributed learning and access, which is the loss in secondary throughput due to learning and distributed access. For the scenario when the number of secondary users is known to the policy, we prove that the total regret is logarithmic in the number of transmission slots. This policy achieves order-optimal regret based on a logarithmic lower bound for regret under any uniformly-good learning and access policy. We then consider the case when the number of secondary users is fixed but unknown, and is estimated at each user through feedback. We propose a policy whose sum regret grows only slightly faster than logarithmic in the number of transmission slots.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738217","Cognitive medium access control;multi-armed bandits;distributed algorithms;logarithmic regret","Availability;Sensors;Throughput;Indexes;Channel estimation;Algorithm design and analysis;Distributed algorithms","","226","3","25","IEEE","24 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing techniques use a single homography per image to perform alignment followed by seam cutting or image blending to hide inevitable alignments artifacts. In this paper, we demonstrate how to use two homographies per image to produce a more seamless image. Specifically, our approach blends the homographies in the alignment procedure to perform a nonlinear warping. Once the images are geometrically stitched, they are further processed to blend seams and reduce curvilinear visual artifacts due to the nonlinear warping.

Although many real applications are in this setting, there is no estimator designed for imputing mixed-attribute data sets. This paper first proposes two consistent estimators for discrete and continuous missing target values, respectively.

Our objective is to minimize the energy consumed in distributed sensing subject to constraints on the detection performance, by optimally choosing the sleeping and censoring design parameters. The constraint on the detection performance is given by a minimum target probability of detection and a maximum permissible probability of false alarm. Depending on the availability of prior knowledge about the probability of primary user presence, two cases are considered.

One traditional approach to conserve energy in virtualized data centers is to perform workload (i.e., VM) consolidation. Thereby, workload is packed on the least number of physical machines and over-provisioned resources are transitioned into a lower power state. However, most of the workload consolidation approaches applied until now are limited to a single resource (e.g., CPU) and rely on simple greedy algorithms such as First-Fit Decreasing (FFD), which perform resource-dissipative workload placement. Moreover, they are highly centralized and known to be hard to distribute. In this work, we model the workload consolidation problem as an instance of the multi-dimensional bin-packing (MDBP) problem and design a novel, nature-inspired workload consolidation algorithm based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We evaluate the ACO-based approach by comparing it with one frequently applied greedy algorithm (i.e., FFD). Our simulation results demonstrate that ACO outperforms the evaluated greedy algorithm as it achieves superior energy gains through better server utilization and requires less machines. Moreover, it computes solutions which are nearly optimal. Finally, the autonomous nature of the approach allows it to be implemented in a fully distributed environment.","2152-1093","978-0-7695-4572-1","10.1109/Grid.2011.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076495","Ant Colony Optimization;Combinatorial Optimization;Green Cloud Computing;Multidimensional Bin Packing;Swarm Intelligence;Virtualization","Vectors;Resource management;Algorithm design and analysis;Estimation;Heuristic algorithms;Greedy algorithms;Computational modeling","","225","1","26","IEEE","14 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The success of these SC methods is largely based on the manifold assumption, namely, that two nearby data points in the high-density region of a low-dimensional data manifold have the same cluster label. However, such an assumption might not always hold on high-dimensional data. When the data do not exhibit a clear low-dimensional manifold structure (e.g., high-dimensional and sparse data), the clustering performance of SC will be degraded and become even worse than K -means clustering. In this paper, motivated by the observation that the true cluster assignment matrix for high-dimensional data can be always embedded in a linear space spanned by the data, we propose the spectral embedded clustering (SEC) framework, in which a linearity regularization is explicitly added into the objective function of SC methods. More importantly, the proposed SEC framework can naturally deal with out-of-sample data. We also present a new Laplacian matrix constructed from a local regression of each pattern and incorporate it into our SEC framework to capture both local and global discriminative information for clustering. Comprehensive experiments on eight real-world high-dimensional datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our SEC framework over existing SC methods and K-means-based clustering methods. Our SEC framework significantly outperforms SC using the Nyström algorithm on unseen data.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2011.2162000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030950","Linearity regularization;out-of-sample clustering;spectral clustering;spectral embedded clustering","Laplace equations;Manifolds;Clustering methods;Clustering algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Matrix decomposition;Optimization","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Linear Models;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Regression Analysis","225","","58","USGov","29 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, 3-D integration with through-silicon vias (TSVs) has emerged as an effective solution to meet the future interconnect requirement. Among others, thermomechanical reliability is a key concern for the development of TSV structures used in die stacking as 3-D interconnects. This paper examines the effects of thermally induced stresses on the interfacial reliability of TSV structures. First, 3-D distribution of the thermal stress near the TSV and the wafer surface is analyzed. Using a linear superposition method, a semianalytic solution is developed for a simplified structure consisting of a single TSV embedded in a silicon (Si) wafer. The solution is verified for relatively thick wafers by comparing to numerical results from finite element analysis (FEA). The stress analysis suggests interfacial delamination as a potential failure mechanism for the TSV structure. An analytical solution is then obtained for the steady-state energy release rate as the upper bound for the interfacial fracture driving force, while the effect of crack length is evaluated numerically by FEA. With these results, the effects of the TSV dimensions (e.g., via diameter and wafer thickness) on the interfacial reliability are elucidated. Furthermore, the effects of via material properties and dielectric buffer layers are discussed.","1558-2574","","10.1109/TDMR.2010.2068572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5555956","Interfacial delamination;thermal stress;through-silicon via (TSV);3-D interconnects","Stress;Through-silicon vias;Silicon;Thermal stresses;Delamination;Cooling","","225","1","28","IEEE","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our BCI was asynchronous, meaning that subjects could move the orthosis whenever they wanted, instead of pacing themselves to external cues. Seven subjects each performed two tasks with a BCI that relied on steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Although none of the subjects had any training, six subjects showed good control with a positive predictive value (PPV) higher than 60%. The overall PPV for all subjects reached 78% ±10%. However, the false positive rate was high, and some subjects dislike the flickering lights required in SSVEP BCIs. In follow-up work, we hope to reduce both the false positive rate and the annoyance produced by flickering lights by hybridizing this BCI with a “brain switch,” which could allow people to turn the SSVEP system on or off using a second type of brain activity when they do not wish to control the orthosis.

One important obstacle is the difficulty of maintaining system usability with socket misalignment. Misalignment inevitably occurs during prosthesis donning and doffing, producing a shift in electrode contact locations. We investigated how the size of the electrode detection surface and the placement of electrode poles (electrode orientation) affected system robustness with electrode shift. Electrodes oriented parallel to muscle fibers outperformed electrodes oriented perpendicular to muscle fibers in both shift and no-shift conditions (p <; 0.01). Another finding was the significant difference (p <; 0.01) in performance for the direction of electrode shift. Shifts perpendicular to the muscle fibers reduced classification accuracy and real-time controllability much more than shifts parallel to the muscle fibers. Increasing the size of the electrode detection surface was found to help reduce classification accuracy sensitivity to electrode shifts in a direction perpendicular to the muscle fibers but did not improve the real-time controllability of the pattern recognition system. One clinically important result was that a combination of longitudinal and transverse electrodes yielded high controllability with and without electrode shift using only four physical electrode pole locations.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2011.2159216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5872014","Electrode shift;electromyography (EMG);pattern recognition;virtual reality prosthesis control","Electrodes;Muscles;Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Controllability;Materials;Accuracy","Adult;Artificial Limbs;Electrodes;Electromyography;Electromyography;Female;Humans;Male;Models, Biological;Muscle Fibers, Skeletal;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","224","2","37","IEEE","9 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using this model, the prior knowledge of the gradient profiles are learned from a large collection of natural images, which are called gradient profile prior. Based on this prior, we propose a gradient field transformation to constrain the gradient fields of the high resolution image and the enhanced image when performing single image super-resolution and sharpness enhancement.

This paper investigates the effects of orientation compensation on the coherency matrix and the scattering-model-based decompositions by Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi et al. The Cloude and Pottier decomposition is excluded, because entropy, anisotropy, and alpha angle are roll invariant. We will show that, after orientation compensation, the volume scattering power is consistently decreased, while the double-bounce power has increased. The surface scattering power is relatively unchanged, and the helicity power is roll invariant. All of these characteristics can be explained by the compensation effect on the nine elements of the coherency matrix. In particular, after compensation, the real part of the (HH - VV) · HV* correlation reduces to zero, the intensity of cross-pol |HV| always reduces, and |HH - VV| always increases. This analysis also reveals that the common perception that OA compensation would make a reflection asymmetrical medium completely reflection symmetric is incorrect and that, contrary to the general perception, the four-component decomposition does not use the complete information of the coherency matrix. Only six quantities are included - one more than the Freeman-Durden decomposition, which explicitly assumes reflection symmetry.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2048333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491157","Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR);radar polarimetry;target decomposition","Matrix decomposition;Radar scattering;Polarization;Reflection;Azimuth;Radar polarimetry;Frequency;Entropy;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Information analysis","","224","","23","USGov","21 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, photovoltaic (PV) energy can be easily delivered through a dc/dc converter to the FREEDM system's dc bus. The module-integrated converter (MIC) topology is a good candidate for a PV converter designed to work with the FREEDM system. This paper compares the parallel connected dc MIC structure with its counterpart, the series connected MIC architecture. From the presented analysis, the parallel connected architecture was shown to have more advantages. In this paper, a high-efficiency dual mode resonant converter topology is proposed for parallel connected dc MICs. This new resonant converter topology can change resonant modes adaptively depending on the panel operation conditions. The converter achieves zero-voltage switching for primary-side switches and zero-current switching for secondary-side diodes for both resonant modes. The circulation energy is minimized particularly for 5-50% of the rated power level. Thus, the converter can maintain a high efficiency for a wide input range at different output power levels. This study explains the operation principle of the proposed converter and presents a dc gain analysis based on the fundamental harmonic analysis method. A 240-W prototype with an embedded maximum power point tracking controller was built to evaluate the performance of the proposed converter. The prototype's maximum efficiency reaches 96.5% and an efficiency increase of more than 10% under light load conditions is shown when compared with a conventional LLC resonant converter.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2011.2107581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5699400","DC-DC power converters;photovoltaic systems;smart grid;solar power generation","Microwave integrated circuits;Converters;Topology;Renewable energy resources;Inverters;Capacitors;Electronic mail","","223","2","51","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these challenges, we propose to leverage information on the global structure of the scene and to resolve all detections jointly. In particular, we explore constraints imposed by the crowd density and formulate person detection as the optimization of a joint energy function combining crowd density estimation and the localization of individual people. We demonstrate how the optimization of such an energy function significantly improves person detection and tracking in crowds.

The core supports two distinct error-detection designs, allowing a direct comparison of the relative trade-offs. The first design embeds error-detection sequential (EDS) circuits in critical paths to detect late timing transitions. In addition to reducing the Fclk guardbands for dynamic variations, the embedded EDS design can exploit path-activation rates to operate the microprocessor faster than infrequently-activated critical paths. The second error-detection design offers a less-intrusive approach for dynamic timing-error detection by placing a tunable replica circuit (TRC) per pipeline stage to monitor worst-case delays. Although the TRCs require a delay guardband to ensure the TRC delay is always slower than critical-path delays, the TRC design captures most of the benefits from the embedded EDS design with less implementation overhead. Furthermore, while core min-delay constraints limit the potential benefits of the embedded EDS design, a salient advantage of the TRC design is the ability to detect a wider range of dynamic delay variation, as demonstrated through low supply voltage (VCC) measurements. Both error-detection designs interface with error-recovery techniques, enabling the detection and correction of timing errors from fast-changing variations such as high-frequency VCC droops. The microprocessor core also supports two separate error-recovery techniques to guarantee correct execution even if dynamic variations persist. The first technique requires clock control to replay errant instructions at 1/2FCLK. In comparison, the second technique is a new multiple-issue instruction replay design that corrects errant instructions with a lower performance penalty and without requiring clock control. Silicon measurements demonstrate that resilient circuits enable a 41% throughput gain at equal energy or a 22% energy reduction at equal throughput, as compared to a conventional design when executing a benchmark program with a 10% VCC droop. In addition, the microprocessor includes a new adaptive clock control circuit that interfaces with the resilient circuits and a phase-locked loop (PLL) to track recovery cycles and adapt to persistent errors by dynamically changing Fclk f°Γ maximum efficiency.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2010.2089657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654663","Resilient microprocessor;resilient design;resilient circuit;dynamic variation;timing error;error detection;error-detection sequential circuit;tunable replica circuit;error correction;error recovery;multiple-issue instruction replay;variation tolerance;adaptive circuit;adaptive clocking","Clocks;Microprocessors;Delay;Pipelines;Latches;Phase locked loops","","223","9","21","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The usefulness of this methodology is demonstrated on the Messina landslide event in southern Italy that occurred on October 1, 2009.

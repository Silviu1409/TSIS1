"A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II","K. Deb; A. Pratap; S. Agarwal; T.

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.","1941-0026","","10.1109/4235.996017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996017","","Genetic algorithms;Sorting;Computational complexity;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Testing;Decision making;Associate members;Diversity reception;Constraint optimization","","33496","14","26","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed ""uniform,"" are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the ""uniform"" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1017623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017623","","Gray-scale;Spatial resolution;Prototypes;Pattern recognition;Image recognition;Image texture;Histograms;Quantization;Multiresolution analysis;Robustness","","11812","103","39","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or ""particle"") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods.

How to effectively extend it for multiclass classification is still an ongoing research issue. Several methods have been proposed where typically we construct a multiclass classifier by combining several binary classifiers. Some authors also proposed methods that consider all classes at once. As it is computationally more expensive to solve multiclass problems, comparisons of these methods using large-scale problems have not been seriously conducted. Especially for methods solving multiclass SVM in one step, a much larger optimization problem is required so up to now experiments are limited to small data sets. In this paper we give decomposition implementations for two such ""all-together"" methods. We then compare their performance with three methods based on binary classifications: ""one-against-all,"" ""one-against-one,"" and directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM). Our experiments indicate that the ""one-against-one"" and DAG methods are more suitable for practical use than the other methods. Results also show that for large problems methods by considering all data at once in general need fewer support vectors.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.991427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991427","","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Optimization methods;Large-scale systems;Computer science;Training data","","4699","10","28","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by: (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes; (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. The dissimilarity between the two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as the problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar to that in the image.

A system on chip (SoC) can provide an integrated solution to challenging design problems in the telecommunications, multimedia, and consumer electronics domains. Much of the progress in these fields hinges on the designers' ability to conceive complex electronic engines under strong time-to-market pressure. Success will require using appropriate design and process technologies, as well as interconnecting existing components reliably in a plug-and-play fashion. Focusing on using probabilistic metrics such as average values or variance to quantify design objectives such as performance and power will lead to a major change in SoC design methodologies. Overall, these designs will be based on both deterministic and stochastic models. Creating complex SoCs requires a modular, component-based approach to both hardware and software design.

The application scheduling problem has been shown to be NP-complete in general cases as well as in several restricted cases. Because of its key importance, this problem has been extensively studied and various algorithms have been proposed in the literature which are mainly for systems with homogeneous processors. Although there are a few algorithms in the literature for heterogeneous processors, they usually require significantly high scheduling costs and they may not deliver good quality schedules with lower costs. In this paper, we present two novel scheduling algorithms for a bounded number of heterogeneous processors with an objective to simultaneously meet high performance and fast scheduling time, which are called the Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT) algorithm and the Critical-Path-on-a-Processor (CPOP) algorithm. The HEFT algorithm selects the task with the highest upward rank value at each step and assigns the selected task to the processor, which minimizes its earliest finish time with an insertion-based approach. On the other hand, the CPOP algorithm uses the summation of upward and downward rank values for prioritizing tasks. Another difference is in the processor selection phase, which schedules the critical tasks onto the processor that minimizes the total execution time of the critical tasks. In order to provide a robust and unbiased comparison with the related work, a parametric graph generator was designed to generate weighted directed acyclic graphs with various characteristics. The comparison study, based on both randomly generated graphs and the graphs of some real applications, shows that our scheduling algorithms significantly surpass previous approaches in terms of both quality and cost of schedules, which are mainly presented with schedule length ratio, speedup, frequency of best results, and average scheduling time metrics.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.993206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993206","","Processor scheduling","","2449","7","31","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To build fully automated systems that analyze the information contained in face images, robust and efficient face detection algorithms are required. Given a single image, the goal of face detection is to identify all image regions which contain a face, regardless of its 3D position, orientation and lighting conditions. Such a problem is challenging because faces are non-rigid and have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color and texture. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect faces in a single image, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms.

In such environments, we propose the use of multiple transmit antennas to induce large and fast channel fluctuations so that multiuser diversity can still be exploited. The scheme can be interpreted as opportunistic beamforming and we show that true beamforming gains can be achieved when there are sufficient users, even though very limited channel feedback is needed.

This article surveys frequency domain equalization (FDE) applied to single-carrier (SC) modulation solutions. SC radio modems with frequency domain equalization have similar performance, efficiency, and low signal processing complexity advantages as OFDM, and in addition are less sensitive than OFDM to RF impairments such as power amplifier nonlinearities.

It establishes the idea that only those cells that recognize the antigens (Ag's) are selected to proliferate. The selected cells are subject to an affinity maturation process, which improves their affinity to the selective Ag's. This paper proposes a computational implementation of the clonal selection principle that explicitly takes into account the affinity maturation of the immune response. The general algorithm, named CLONALG, is derived primarily to perform machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, and then it is adapted to solve optimization problems, emphasizing multimodal and combinatorial optimization. Two versions of the algorithm are derived, their computational cost per iteration is presented, and a sensitivity analysis in relation to the user-defined parameters is given. CLONALG is also contrasted with evolutionary algorithms. Several benchmark problems are considered to evaluate the performance of CLONALG and it is also compared to a niching method for multimodal function optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2002.1011539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1011539","","Immune system;Evolutionary computation;Sensitivity analysis;Artificial immune systems;Adaptive systems;Computational efficiency;Optimization methods;Pattern recognition;Biology computing;Biological system modeling","","1699","","44","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner is critical to operate the sensor network for a long period of time. In W. Heinzelman et al. (Proc. Hawaii Conf. on System Sci., 2000), a data collection problem is defined where, in a round of communication, each sensor node has a packet to be sent to the distant base station. If each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station then it will deplete its power quickly. The LEACH protocol presented by W. Heinzelman et al. is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. By randomizing the cluster heads chosen to transmit to the base station, LEACH achieves a factor of 8 improvement compared to direct transmissions, as measured in terms of when nodes die. In this paper, we propose PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), a near optimal chain-based protocol that is an improvement over LEACH. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH by about 100 to 300% when 1%, 20%, 50%, and 100% of nodes die for different network sizes and topologies.","","0-7803-7231-X","10.1109/AERO.2002.1035242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035242","","Sensor systems;Information systems;Base stations;Batteries;Wireless communication;Protocols;Costs;Network topology;Collaboration;Sensor fusion","","1681","11","14","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method also avoids another drawback of EM for mixture fitting: the possibility of convergence toward a singular estimate at the boundary of the parameter space. The novelty of our approach is that we do not use a model selection criterion to choose one among a set of preestimated candidate models; instead, we seamlessly integrate estimation and model selection in a single algorithm. Our technique can be applied to any type of parametric mixture model for which it is possible to write an EM algorithm; in this paper, we illustrate it with experiments involving Gaussian mixtures. These experiments testify for the good performance of our approach.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.990138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990138","","Unsupervised learning","","1654","6","64","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation is performed manually. Automatic musical genre classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. In addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals. In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into an hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic content and pitch content are proposed. The performance and relative importance of the proposed features is investigated by training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real-world audio collections. Both whole file and real-time frame-based classification schemes are described. Using the proposed feature sets, classification of 61% for ten musical genres is achieved. This result is comparable to results reported for human musical genre classification.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2002.800560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021072","","Humans;Music information retrieval;Instruments;Computer science;Multiple signal classification;Signal analysis;Pattern recognition;Feature extraction;Wavelet analysis;Cultural differences","","1633","48","33","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our implementations offer exact reconstruction, stability against perturbations, ease of implementation, and low computational complexity. A central tool is Fourier-domain computation of an approximate digital Radon transform. We introduce a very simple interpolation in the Fourier space which takes Cartesian samples and yields samples on a rectopolar grid, which is a pseudo-polar sampling set based on a concentric squares geometry. Despite the crudeness of our interpolation, the visual performance is surprisingly good. Our ridgelet transform applies to the Radon transform a special overcomplete wavelet pyramid whose wavelets have compact support in the frequency domain. Our curvelet transform uses our ridgelet transform as a component step, and implements curvelet subbands using a filter bank of a/spl grave/ trous wavelet filters. Our philosophy throughout is that transforms should be overcomplete, rather than critically sampled. We apply these digital transforms to the denoising of some standard images embedded in white noise. In the tests reported here, simple thresholding of the curvelet coefficients is very competitive with ""state of the art"" techniques based on wavelets, including thresholding of decimated or undecimated wavelet transforms and also including tree-based Bayesian posterior mean methods. Moreover, the curvelet reconstructions exhibit higher perceptual quality than wavelet-based reconstructions, offering visually sharper images and, in particular, higher quality recovery of edges and of faint linear and curvilinear features. Existing theory for curvelet and ridgelet transforms suggests that these new approaches can outperform wavelet methods in certain image reconstruction problems. The empirical results reported here are in encouraging agreement.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.1014998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1014998","","Image denoising;Wavelet transforms;Image reconstruction;Interpolation;Wavelet domain;Filter bank;Stability;Computational complexity;Fourier transforms;Sampling methods","","1617","16","32","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with individual nodes remaining largely inactive for long periods of time, but then becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in almost every way: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses three novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. To reduce energy consumption in listening to an idle channel, nodes periodically sleep. Neighboring nodes form virtual clusters to auto-synchronize on sleep schedules. Inspired by PAMAS, S-MAC also sets the radio to sleep during transmissions of other nodes. Unlike PAMAS, it only uses in-channel signaling. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for sensor-network applications that require store-and-forward processing as data move through the network. We evaluate our implementation of S-MAC over a sample sensor node, the Mote, developed at University of California, Berkeley. The experiment results show that, on a source node, an 802.11-like MAC consumes 2-6 times more energy than S-MAC for traffic load with messages sent every 1-10 s.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019408","","Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks;Sleep;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Delay;Energy consumption;Computer networks;Collaboration","","1556","32","19","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The result is a slowly varying shading artifact over the image that can produce errors with conventional intensity-based classification. Our algorithm is formulated by modifying the objective function of the standard fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm to compensate for such inhomogeneities and to allow the labeling of a pixel (voxel) to be influenced by the labels in its immediate neighborhood. The neighborhood effect acts as a regularizer and biases the solution toward piecewise-homogeneous labelings. Such a regularization is useful in segmenting scans corrupted by salt and pepper noise.

The GFC method, which is robust to changes in illumination and facial expression, applies the enhanced Fisher linear discriminant model (EFM) to an augmented Gabor feature vector derived from the Gabor wavelet representation of face images. The novelty of this paper comes from (1) the derivation of an augmented Gabor feature vector, whose dimensionality is further reduced using the EFM by considering both data compression and recognition (generalization) performance; (2) the development of a Gabor-Fisher classifier for multi-class problems; and (3) extensive performance evaluation studies. In particular, we performed comparative studies of different similarity measures applied to various classifiers. We also performed comparative experimental studies of various face recognition schemes, including our novel GFC method, the Gabor wavelet method, the eigenfaces method, the Fisherfaces method, the EFM method, the combination of Gabor and the eigenfaces method, and the combination of Gabor and the Fisherfaces method. The feasibility of the new GFC method has been successfully tested on face recognition using 600 FERET frontal face images corresponding to 200 subjects, which were acquired under variable illumination and facial expressions. The novel GFC method achieves 100% accuracy on face recognition using only 62 features.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.999679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=999679","","Face recognition;Lighting;Vectors;Robustness;Testing;Kernel;Computer science;Data compression;Performance evaluation;Particle measurements","","1419","17","38","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically these methods find a set of basis images and represent faces as a linear combination of those images. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular example of such methods. The basis images found by PCA depend only on pairwise relationships between pixels in the image database. In a task such as face recognition, in which important information may be contained in the high-order relationships among pixels, it seems reasonable to expect that better basis images may be found by methods sensitive to these high-order statistics. Independent component analysis (ICA), a generalization of PCA, is one such method. We used a version of ICA derived from the principle of optimal information transfer through sigmoidal neurons. ICA was performed on face images in the FERET database under two different architectures, one which treated the images as random variables and the pixels as outcomes, and a second which treated the pixels as random variables and the images as outcomes. The first architecture found spatially local basis images for the faces. The second architecture produced a factorial face code. Both ICA representations were superior to representations based on PCA for recognizing faces across days and changes in expression. A classifier that combined the two ICA representations gave the best performance.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.804287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058079","","Face recognition;Independent component analysis;Principal component analysis;Pixel;Image databases;Random variables;Statistical analysis;Statistics;Neurons;Spatial databases","","1394","3","61","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SRAD is the edge-sensitive diffusion for speckled images, in the same way that conventional anisotropic diffusion is the edge-sensitive diffusion for images corrupted with additive noise. We first show that the Lee and Frost filters can be cast as partial differential equations, and then we derive SRAD by allowing edge-sensitive anisotropic diffusion within this context. Just as the Lee (1980, 1981, 1986) and Frost (1982) filters utilize the coefficient of variation in adaptive filtering, SRAD exploits the instantaneous coefficient of variation, which is shown to be a function of the local gradient magnitude and Laplacian operators. We validate the new algorithm using both synthetic and real linear scan ultrasonic imagery of the carotid artery. We also demonstrate the algorithm performance with real SAR data. The performance measures obtained by means of computer simulation of carotid artery images are compared with three existing speckle reduction schemes. In the presence of speckle noise, speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion excels over the traditional speckle removal filters and over the conventional anisotropic diffusion method in terms of mean preservation, variance reduction, and edge localization.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.804276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097762","","Speckle;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Adaptive filters;Carotid arteries;Radar imaging;Additive noise;Partial differential equations;Laplace equations;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Computer simulation","","1286","15","23","IEEE","16 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It consists of a class of motion models and a general nonlinear measurement equation in position. A general algorithm is presented, which is parsimonious with the particle dimension. It is based on marginalization, enabling a Kalman filter to estimate all position derivatives, and the particle filter becomes low dimensional. This is of utmost importance for high-performance real-time applications. Automotive and airborne applications illustrate numerically the advantage over classical Kalman filter-based algorithms. Here, the use of nonlinear models and non-Gaussian noise is the main explanation for the improvement in accuracy. More specifically, we describe how the technique of map matching is used to match an aircraft's elevation profile to a digital elevation map and a car's horizontal driven path to a street map. In both cases, real-time implementations are available, and tests have shown that the accuracy in both cases is comparable with satellite navigation (as GPS) but with higher integrity. Based on simulations, we also argue how the particle filter can be used for positioning based on cellular phone measurements, for integrated navigation in aircraft, and for target tracking in aircraft and cars. Finally, the particle filter enables a promising solution to the combined task of navigation and tracking, with possible application to airborne hunting and collision avoidance systems in cars.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.978396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=978396","","Particle filters;Particle tracking;Aircraft navigation;Position measurement;Satellite navigation systems;Target tracking;Motion measurement;Nonlinear equations;Automotive engineering;Kalman filters","","1255","25","44","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the conventional low-pass topology, the quantities L and C represent a positive equivalent permeability and permittivity, respectively. However, in the dual configuration, in which the positions of L and C are simply interchanged, these equivalent material parameters assume simultaneously negative values. Two-dimensional periodic versions of these dual networks are used to demonstrate negative refraction and focusing; phenomena that are manifestations of the fact that such media support a propagating fundamental backward harmonic.

This contrasts with the mass element which, by definition, always has one terminal connected to ground. The inerter allows electrical circuits to be translated over to mechanical ones in a completely analogous way. The inerter need not have large mass. This allows any arbitrary positive-real impedance to be synthesized mechanically using physical components which may be assumed to have small mass compared to other structures to which they may be attached.

Our approach is to first design the controller using established techniques and considering the network transparency, and then analyze the effect of the network on closed-loop system performance. When implemented, an NCS consists of multiple independent sensors and actuators competing for an access to the network, with no universal clock available to synchronize their actions. Since the nodes act asynchronously, we allow access to the network at anytime, but assume each access occurs before a prescribed deadline, known as the maximum allowable transfer interval. Only one node may access the network at a time. This communication constraint imposed by the network is the main focus of the paper. The performance of the new TOD protocol and the statically scheduled protocols are examined in simulations of an automotive gas turbine and an unstable batch reactor.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.998034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998034","","Stability analysis;Networked control systems;Access protocols;Control systems;MIMO;Performance analysis;System performance;Actuators;Clocks;Synchronization","","1192","5","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time-domain interpolation is obtained by passing to the time domain by means of IDFT (inverse discrete Fourier transform), zero padding and going back to the frequency domain by DFT (discrete Fourier transform). In addition, channel estimation based on a block type pilot arrangement is performed by sending pilots in every sub-channel and using this estimation for a specific number of following symbols.

Higher level understanding of events requires that certain lower level computer vision tasks be performed. These may include detection of unusual motion, tracking targets, labeling body parts, and understanding the interactions between people. To achieve many of these tasks, it is necessary to build representations of the appearance of objects in the scene. This paper focuses on two issues related to this problem. First, we construct a statistical representation of the scene background that supports sensitive detection of moving objects in the scene, but is robust to clutter arising out of natural scene variations. Second, we build statistical representations of the foreground regions (moving objects) that support their tracking and support occlusion reasoning. The probability density functions (pdfs) associated with the background and foreground are likely to vary from image to image and will not in general have a known parametric form. We accordingly utilize general nonparametric kernel density estimation techniques for building these statistical representations of the background and the foreground. These techniques estimate the pdf directly from the data without any assumptions about the underlying distributions.

We assume that the receiver has no knowledge of the instantaneous fading state. When the receiver knows only the marginal statistics of the fading, a symbol-by-symbol ML detector can be used to improve detection performance. If the receiver has knowledge of the joint temporal statistics of the fading, maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) can be employed, yielding a further performance improvement, but at the cost of very high complexity. Spatial diversity reception with multiple receivers can also be used to overcome turbulence-induced fading.

It is a consequence of collecting data in greater and greater quantities and the desire to extract more detailed information about the material composition of surfaces. Linear mixing is the key assumption that has permitted well-known algorithms to be adapted to the unmixing problem. In fact, the resemblance of the linear mixing model to system models in other areas has permitted a significant legacy of algorithms from a wide range of applications to be adapted to unmixing. However, it is still unclear whether the assumption of linearity is sufficient to model the mixing process in every application of interest. It is clear, however, that the applicability of models and techniques is highly dependent on the variety of circumstances and factors that give rise to mixed pixels. The outputs of spectral unmixing, endmember, and abundance estimates are important for identifying the material composition of mixtures.","1558-0792","","10.1109/79.974727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974727","","Hyperspectral sensors;Layout;Reflectivity;Remote sensing;Spectroscopy;Hyperspectral imaging;Spatial resolution;Data mining;Atmospheric modeling;Analytical models","","1073","39","40","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

For its implementation with several useful optimization techniques, we have developed a tool, named CCFinder (Code Clone Finder), which extracts code clones in C, C++, Java, COBOL and other source files. In addition, metrics for the code clones have been developed. In order to evaluate the usefulness of CCFinder and metrics, we conducted several case studies where we applied the new tool to the source code of JDK, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, and many other systems. As a result, CCFinder has effectively found clones and the metrics have been able to effectively identify the characteristics of the systems.

One important component of radio resource management is power control, which has been studied extensively in the context of voice communications. With the increasing demand for wireless data services, it is necessary to establish power control algorithms for information sources other than voice. We present a power control solution for wireless data in the analytical setting of a game theoretic framework. In this context, the quality of service (QoS) a wireless terminal receives is referred to as the utility and distributed power control is a noncooperative power control game where users maximize their utility. The outcome of the game results in a Nash (1951) equilibrium that is inefficient. We introduce pricing of transmit powers in order to obtain Pareto improvement of the noncooperative power control game, i.e., to obtain improvements in user utilities relative to the case with no pricing. Specifically, we consider a pricing function that is a linear function of the transmit power. The simplicity of the pricing function allows a distributed implementation where the price can be broadcast by the base station to all the terminals. We see that pricing is especially helpful in a heavily loaded system.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.983324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=983324","","Power control;Pricing;Context;Quality of service;Wireless communication;Resource management;Data analysis;Game theory;Context-aware services;Broadcasting","","1073","2","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given an arbitrary point x /spl isin/ /spl Ropf//sup m/ and a generator matrix for a lattice /spl Lambda/, the algorithm computes the point of /spl Lambda/ that is closest to x. The algorithm is shown to be substantially faster than other known methods, by means of a theoretical comparison with the Kannan (1983, 1987) algorithm and an experimental comparison with the Pohst (1981) algorithm and its variants, such as the Viterbo-Boutros (see ibid. vol.45, p.1639-42, 1999) decoder.

This way of combining individual “expert” models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called “contrastive divergence” whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976602760128018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6789337","","","","1038","12","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

The model is simplified to the narrowband channels. The validation of the model is based upon data collected in both picocell and microcell environments. The stochastic model has also been used to investigate the capacity of MIMO radio channels, considering two different power allocation strategies, water filling and uniform and two different antenna topologies, 4/spl times/4 and 2/spl times/4. Space diversity used at both ends of the MIMO radio link is shown to be an efficient technique in picocell environments, achieving capacities within 14 b/s/Hz and 16 b/s/Hz in 80% of the cases for a 4/spl times/4 antenna configuration implementing water filling at a SNR of 20 dB.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.801223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021913","","Stochastic processes;MIMO;Antenna measurements;Decorrelation;Base stations;Narrowband;Filling;Receiving antennas;Electronic mail;Scattering","","1035","29","28","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Without proper security mechanisms, networks will be confined to limited, controlled environments, negating much of the promise they hold. The limited ability of individual sensor nodes to thwart failure or attack makes ensuring network availability more difficult. To identify denial-of-service vulnerabilities, the authors analyzed two effective sensor network protocols that did not initially consider security.

We derive a sequence of analytical results which show that the reconstruction constraints provide less and less useful information as the magnification factor increases. We also validate these results empirically and show that, for large enough magnification factors, any smoothness prior leads to overly smooth results with very little high-frequency content. Next, we propose a super-resolution algorithm that uses a different kind of constraint in addition to the reconstruction constraints. The algorithm attempts to recognize local features in the low-resolution images and then enhances their resolution in an appropriate manner. We call such a super-resolution algorithm a hallucination or reconstruction algorithm. We tried our hallucination algorithm on two different data sets, frontal images of faces and printed Roman text. We obtained significantly better results than existing reconstruction-based algorithms, both qualitatively and in terms of RMS pixel error.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1033210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033210","","Image resolution;Image reconstruction;Image generation;Image analysis;Image sequence analysis;Information analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Image recognition;Reconstruction algorithms","","1026","183","53","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An analytical expression for the optimal power flow from a rectified piezoelectric device is derived, and an ""energy harvesting"" circuit is proposed which can achieve this optimal power flow. The harvesting circuit consists of an AC-DC rectifier with an output capacitor, an electrochemical battery, and a switch-mode DC-DC converter that controls the energy flow into the battery. An adaptive control technique for the DC-DC converter is used to continuously implement the optimal power transfer theory and maximize the power stored by the battery. Experimental results reveal that use of the adaptive DC-DC converter increases power transfer by over 400% as compared to when the DC-DC converter is not used.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.802194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035141","","Power supplies;DC-DC power converters;Batteries;Piezoelectric devices;Load flow;Impedance;Vibrations;Rectifiers;Switched capacitor circuits;Switching circuits","","980","32","12","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

DENFIS evolve through incremental, hybrid (supervised/unsupervised), learning, and accommodate new input data, including new features, new classes, etc., through local element tuning. New fuzzy rules are created and updated during the operation of the system. At each time moment, the output of DENFIS is calculated through a fuzzy inference system based on m-most activated fuzzy rules which are dynamically chosen from a fuzzy rule set. Two approaches are proposed: (1) dynamic creation of a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy rule set for a DENFIS online model; and (2) creation of a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy rule set, or an expanded high-order one, for a DENFIS offline model. A set of fuzzy rules can be inserted into DENFIS before or during its learning process. Fuzzy rules can also be extracted during or after the learning process. An evolving clustering method (ECM), which is employed in both online and offline DENFIS models, is also introduced.

At rates of tens of bits per second per hertz, Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST), where every antenna transmits its own independent substream of data, has been shown to have good performance and simple encoding and decoding. Yet V-BLAST suffers from its inability to work with fewer receive antennas than transmit antennas-this deficiency is especially important for modern cellular systems, where a base station typically has more antennas than the mobile handsets. Furthermore, because V-BLAST transmits independent data streams on its antennas there is no built-in spatial coding to guard against deep fades from any given transmit antenna. On the other hand, there are many previously proposed space-time codes that have good fading resistance and simple decoding, but these codes generally have poor performance at high data rates or with many antennas. We propose a high-rate coding scheme that can handle any configuration of transmit and receive antennas and that subsumes both V-BLAST and many proposed space-time block codes as special cases. The scheme transmits substreams of data in linear combinations over space and time. The codes are designed to optimize the mutual information between the transmitted and received signals. Because of their linear structure, the codes retain the decoding simplicity of V-BLAST, and because of their information-theoretic optimality, they possess many coding advantages.

The model captures the effects of two important masking phenomena, electrical masking and latching-window masking, which inhibit soft errors in combinational logic. We quantify the SER due to high-energy neutrons in SRAM cells, latches, and logic circuits for feature sizes from 600 nm to 50 nm and clock periods from 16 to 6 fan-out-of-4 inverter delays. Our model predicts that the SER per chip of logic circuits will increase nine orders of magnitude from 1992 to 2011 and at that point will be comparable to the SER per chip of unprotected memory elements. Our result emphasizes that computer system designers must address the risks of soft errors in logic circuits for future designs.","","0-7695-1597-5","10.1109/DSN.2002.1028924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028924","","Error analysis;Logic circuits;Semiconductor device modeling;CMOS logic circuits;CMOS technology;Microarchitecture;CMOS memory circuits;Neutrons;Random access memory;Latches","","952","11","32","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a new image representation that provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions that are coherent in color and texture. This ""Blobworld"" representation is created by clustering pixels in a joint color-texture-position feature space. The segmentation algorithm is fully automatic and has been run on a collection of 10,000 natural images. We describe a system that uses the Blobworld representation to retrieve images from this collection. An important aspect of the system is that the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, query results from these systems can be inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metrics. By finding image regions that roughly correspond to objects, we allow querying at the level of objects rather than global image properties. We present results indicating that querying for images using Blobworld produces higher precision than does querying using color and texture histograms of the entire image in cases where the image contains distinctive objects.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1023800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1023800","","Image segmentation;Image retrieval;Image representation;Pixel;Information retrieval;Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Image databases;Web sites;Image recognition","","947","63","47","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In that sense, QRS detection provides the fundamentals for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. Software QRS detection has been a research topic for more than 30 years. The evolution of these algorithms clearly reflects the great advances in computer technology.

The statistical scheme leads to a new wavelet-based texture retrieval method that is based on the accurate modeling of the marginal distribution of wavelet coefficients using generalized Gaussian density (GGD) and on the existence a closed form for the KLD between GGDs. The proposed method provides greater accuracy and flexibility in capturing texture information, while its simplified form has a close resemblance with the existing methods which uses energy distribution in the frequency domain to identify textures.

Current approaches represent two extremes: idealized statistical models representing a rich scattering environment and parameterized physical models that describe realistic scattering environments via the angles and gains associated with different propagation paths. However, simple rules that capture the effects of scattering characteristics on channel capacity and diversity are difficult to infer from existing models. We propose an intermediate virtual channel representation that captures the essence of physical modeling and provides a simple geometric interpretation of the scattering environment. The virtual representation corresponds to a fixed coordinate transformation via spatial basis functions defined by fixed virtual angles. We show that in an uncorrelated scattering environment, the elements of the channel matrix form a segment of a stationary process and that the virtual channel coefficients are approximately uncorrelated samples of the underlying spectral representation. For any scattering environment, the virtual channel matrix clearly reveals the two key factors affecting capacity: the number of parallel channels and the level of diversity. The concepts of spatial zooming and aliasing are introduced to provide a transparent interpretation of the effect of antenna spacing on channel statistics and capacity. Numerical results are presented to illustrate various aspects of the virtual framework.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.803324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033686","","Fading;Channel capacity;Statistics;MIMO;Antennas and propagation;Antenna arrays;Wireless communication;Scattering parameters;Solid modeling;Receiving antennas","","864","8","22","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples of signals with a finite rate of innovation include streams of Diracs (e.g., the Poisson process), nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials. Even though these signals are not bandlimited, we show that they can be sampled uniformly at (or above) the rate of innovation using an appropriate kernel and then be perfectly reconstructed. Thus, we prove sampling theorems for classes of signals and kernels that generalize the classic ""bandlimited and sinc kernel"" case. In particular, we show how to sample and reconstruct periodic and finite-length streams of Diracs, nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials using sinc and Gaussian kernels. For infinite-length signals with finite local rate of innovation, we show local sampling and reconstruction based on spline kernels. The key in all constructions is to identify the innovative part of a signal (e.g., time instants and weights of Diracs) using an annihilating or locator filter: a device well known in spectral analysis and error-correction coding. This leads to standard computational procedures for solving the sampling problem, which we show through experimental results.

Experimental results demonstrate very high accuracy in superposition of images from different subjects. There are two major novelties in the proposed algorithm. First, it uses an attribute vector, i.e., a set of geometric moment invariants (GMIs) that are defined on each voxel in an image and are calculated from the tissue maps, to reflect the underlying anatomy at different scales. The attribute vector, if rich enough, can distinguish between different parts of an image, which helps establish anatomical correspondences in the deformation procedure; it also helps reduce local minima, by reducing ambiguity in potential matches. This is a fundamental deviation of our method, referred to as the hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration (HAMMER), from other volumetric deformation methods, which are typically based on maximizing image similarity. Second, in order to avoid being trapped by local minima, i.e., suboptimal poor matches, HAMMER uses a successive approximation of the energy function being optimized by lower dimensional smooth energy functions, which are constructed to have significantly fewer local minima. This is achieved by hierarchically selecting the driving features that have distinct attribute vectors, thus, drastically reducing ambiguity in finding correspondence. A number of experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm results in accurate superposition of image data from individuals with significant anatomical differences.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.803111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175091","","Biomedical imaging;Radiology;Anatomy;Image analysis;Biomedical computing;Magnetic resonance;Brain;Biomedical measurements;Neuroimaging;Aging","Aged;Algorithms;Atrophy;Brain;Brain;Elasticity;Humans;Image Enhancement;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes;Subtraction Technique","836","3","52","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, this paper has three main contributions. First, it proposes a new clustering method called CLARANS, whose aim is to identify spatial structures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that, when compared with existing clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and effective. Second, the paper investigates how CLARANS can handle not only point objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of CLARANS, the paper develops two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discover relationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover knowledge that is difficult to find with existing spatial data mining algorithms.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1033770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033770","","Data mining;Clustering algorithms;Spatial databases;Clustering methods;Image databases;Computer Society;Computational geometry;Satellites;Biomedical equipment;Cameras","","828","5","33","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The LEACH protocol presented by Heinzelman et al. (2000) is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. In this paper, we present an improved scheme, called PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), which is a near-optimal chain-based protocol that minimizes energy. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH. For many applications, in addition to minimizing energy, it is also important to consider the delay incurred in gathering sensed data. We capture this with the energy /spl times/ delay metric and present schemes that attempt to balance the energy and delay cost for data gathering from sensor networks. We present two new schemes to minimize energy /spl times/ delay using CDMA and non-CDMA sensor nodes. We compared the performance of direct, LEACH, and our schemes with respect to energy /spl times/ delay using extensive simulations for different network sizes. Results show that our schemes perform 80 or more times better than the direct scheme and also outperform the LEACH protocol.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2002.1036066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036066","","Protocols;Base stations;Delay;Clustering algorithms;Energy efficiency;Fuses;Sensor systems;Information systems;Energy capture;Costs","","816","14","31","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the exact and general BER expression of QAM with an arbitrary constellation size has not been derived yet. We provide an exact and general closed-form expression of the BER for one-dimensional and two-dimensional amplitude modulations, i.e., PAM and QAM, under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel when Gray code bit mapping is employed.

A number of reduced-complexity methods for turbo equalization have been introduced in which MAP equalization is replaced with suboptimal, low-complexity approaches. We explore a number of low-complexity soft-input/soft-output (SISO) equalization algorithms based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. This includes the extension of existing approaches to general signal constellations and the derivation of a novel approach requiring less complexity than the MMSE-optimal solution.

It appears unlikely that wide bandgap semiconductor devices will find much use in low-power transistor applications until the ambient temperature exceeds approximately 300/spl deg/C, as commercially available silicon and silicon-on-insulator technologies are already satisfying requirements for digital and analog VLSI in this temperature range. However practical operation of silicon power devices at ambient temperatures above 200/spl deg/C appears problematic, as self-heating at higher power levels results in high internal junction temperatures and leakages. Thus, most electronic subsystems that simultaneously require high-temperature and high-power operation will necessarily be realized using wide bandgap devices, once they become widely available.

The emphasis is on parametric amplifiers in general and single pumped parametric amplifiers in particular. While a theoretical framework based on highly efficient four-photon mixing is provided, the focus is on the intriguing applications enabled by the parametric gain, such as all-optical signal sampling, time-demultiplexing, pulse generation, and wavelength conversion. As these amplifiers offer high gain and low noise at arbitrary wavelengths with proper fiber design and pump wavelength allocation, they are also candidate enablers to increase overall wavelength-division-multiplexing system capacities similar to the more well-known Raman amplifiers. Similarities and distinctions between Raman and parametric amplifiers are also addressed. Since the first fiber-based parametric amplifier experiments providing net continuous-wave gain in the for the optical fiber communication applications interesting 1.5-/spl mu/m region were only conducted about two years ago, there is reason to believe that substantial progress may be made in the future, perhaps involving ""holey fibers"" to further enhance the nonlinearity and thus the gain.

To prevent these failures and to maintain transformers in good operating condition is a very important issue for utilities. Traditionally, routine preventative maintenance programs combined with regular testing were used. The change to condition-based maintenance has resulted in the reduction, or even elimination, of routine time-based maintenance. Instead of doing maintenance at a regular interval, maintenance is only carried out if the condition of the equipment requires it. Hence, there is an increasing need for better nonintrusive diagnostic and monitoring tools to assess the internal condition of the transformers.

Stretching of sequences in time is allowed, as well as global translation of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that compute these similarity measures are also provided. We compare these new methods to the widely used Euclidean and time warping distance functions (for real and synthetic data) and show the superiority of our approach, especially in the strong presence of noise. We prove a weaker version of the triangle inequality and employ it in an indexing structure to answer nearest neighbor queries.

Confocal microwave imaging involves illuminating the breast with an ultra-wideband pulse from a number of antenna locations, then synthetically focusing reflections from the breast. The detection of malignant tumors is achieved by the coherent addition of returns from these strongly scattering objects. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting and localizing small (<1 cm) tumors in three dimensions with numerical models of two system configurations involving synthetic cylindrical and planar antenna arrays. Image formation algorithms are developed to enhance tumor responses and reduce early- and late-time clutter. The early-time clutter consists of the incident pulse and reflections from the skin, while the late-time clutter is primarily due to the heterogeneity of breast tissue. Successful detection of 6-mm-diameter spherical tumors is achieved with both planar and cylindrical systems, and similar performance measures are obtained. The influences of the synthetic array size and position relative to the tumor are also explored.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2002.800759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019445","","Microwave imaging;Breast cancer;Cancer detection;Breast neoplasms;Breast tissue;Reflection;Breast tumors;Dielectrics;Ultra wideband technology;Microwave antennas","Algorithms;Breast Neoplasms;Calibration;Computer Simulation;Electromagnetics;Equipment Design;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Microscopy, Confocal;Microwaves;Models, Anatomic;Phantoms, Imaging;Sensitivity and Specificity","730","22","31","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analysis leads to the formulation of a stochastic tapped-delay-line (STDL) model of the UWB indoor channel. The averaged power delay profile can be well-modeled by a single exponential decay with a statistically distributed decay constant. The small-scale statistics of path energy gains follow Gamma distributions whose parameters m are truncated Gaussian variables with mean values and standard deviations decreasing with delay. The total received energy experiences a lognormal shadowing around the mean energy given by the path-loss power law. We also find that the correlation between multipath components is negligible.

In this paper we model data-centric routing and compare its performance with traditional end-to-end routing schemes.

We show that data-centric routing offers significant performance gains across a wide range of operational scenarios.

We use a set of attributes which are relevant, irrelevant or redundant and from the viewpoint of managing a dataset which can be huge, reducing the number of attributes by selecting only the relevant ones is desirable. In doing so, higher performances with lower computational effort is expected. In this paper, we propose two feature selection algorithms. The limitation of mutual information feature selector (MIFS) is analyzed and a method to overcome this limitation is studied. One of the proposed algorithms makes more considered use of mutual information between input attributes and output classes than the MIFS. What is demonstrated is that the proposed method can provide the performance of the ideal greedy selection algorithm when information is distributed uniformly. The computational load for this algorithm is nearly the same as that of MIFS. In addition, another feature selection algorithm using the Taguchi method is proposed. This is advanced as a solution to the question as to how to identify good features with as few experiments as possible. The proposed algorithms are applied to several classification problems and compared with MIFS. These two algorithms can be combined to complement each other's limitations. The combined algorithm performed well in several experiments and should prove to be a useful method in selecting features for classification problems.","1941-0093","","10.1109/72.977291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=977291","","Mutual information;Neural networks;Biological neural networks;Principal component analysis;Decision trees;High performance computing;Information analysis;Data mining;Educational technology;Educational programs","","709","8","28","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model does not assume any channel side information at the receiver or at the transmitter, but assumes that the coefficients remain constant for a coherence interval of length T symbol periods. We compute the asymptotic capacity of this channel at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terms of the coherence time T, the number of transmit antennas M, and the number of receive antennas N. While the capacity gain of the coherent multiple antenna channel is min{M, N} bits per second per Hertz for every 3-dB increase in SNR, the corresponding gain for the noncoherent channel turns out to be M* (1 - M*/T) bits per second per Hertz, where M*=min{M, N, [T/2]}.

The approach has been applied to engineering design selection, organizational self-assessment, safety and risk assessment, and supplier assessment. In this paper, the fundamental features of the ER approach are investigated. New schemes for weight normalization and basic probability assignments are proposed. The original ER approach is further developed to enhance the process of aggregating attributes with uncertainty. Utility intervals are proposed to describe the impact of ignorance on decision analysis. Several properties of the new ER approach are explored, which lay the theoretical foundation of the ER approach.

These problems are solved via the notions of generalized quadratic stability and generalized quadratic stabilization, respectively. Necessary and sufficient conditions for generalized quadratic stability and generalized quadratic stabilization are derived. A strict linear matrix inequality (LMI) design approach is developed.

The simple imperative programming language is extended with commands (not expressions) for accessing and modifying shared structures, and for explicit allocation and deallocation of storage. Assertions are extended by introducing a ""separating conjunction"" that asserts that its subformulas hold for disjoint parts of the heap, and a closely related ""separating implication"". Coupled with the inductive definition of predicates on abstract data structures, this extension permits the concise and flexible description of structures with controlled sharing. In this paper, we survey the current development of this program logic, including extensions that permit unrestricted address arithmetic, dynamically allocated arrays, and recursive procedures.

The proposed model is more general and realistic than the usual independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) model, and allows us to investigate the behavior of channel capacity as a function of the scattering radii at transmitter and receiver, distance between the transmit and receive arrays, and antenna beamwidths and spacing. We show how the MIMO capacity is governed by spatial fading correlation and the condition number of the channel matrix through specific sets of propagation parameters. The proposed model explains the existence of ""pinhole"" channels which exhibit low spatial fading correlation at both ends of the link but still have poor rank properties, and hence, low ergodic capacity. In fact, the model suggests the existence of a more general family of channels spanning continuously from full rank i.i.d. to low-rank pinhole cases. We suggest guidelines for predicting high rank (and hence, high ergodic capacity) in MIMO channels, and show that even at long ranges, high channel rank can easily be sustained under mild scattering conditions. Finally, we validate our results by simulations using ray tracing techniques.

The latter relies on the generalized Laplacian pyramid, which is another oversampled structure obtained by recursively subtracting from an image an expanded decimated lowpass version. Both the methods selectively perform spatial-frequencies spectrum substitution from an image to another. In both schemes, context dependency is exploited by thresholding the local correlation coefficient between the images to be merged, to avoid injection of spatial details that are not likely to occur in the target image. Unlike other multiscale fusion schemes, both the present decompositions are not critically subsampled, thus avoiding possible impairments in the fused images, due to missing cancellation of aliasing terms.

To optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40% over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing.

We find that, in the MIMO case, unlike the single-input single-output (SISO) case, delay spread channels may provide advantages over flat fading channels not only in terms of outage capacity but also in terms of ergodic capacity.

The novelty of the complex fuzzy set lies in the range of values its membership function may attain. In contrast to a traditional fuzzy membership function, this range is not limited to [0, 1], but extended to the unit circle in the complex plane. Thus, the complex fuzzy set provides a mathematical framework for describing membership in a set in terms of a complex number. The inherent difficulty in acquiring intuition for the concept of complex-valued membership presents a significant obstacle to the realization of its full potential. Consequently, a major part of this work is dedicated to a discussion of the intuitive interpretation of complex-valued grades of membership. Examples of possible applications, which demonstrate the new concept, include a complex fuzzy representation of solar activity (via measurements of the sunspot number), and a signal processing application. A comprehensive study of the mathematical properties of the complex fuzzy set is presented.

We derive and compare expressions for the asymptotic growth rate of capacity with n antennas for both independent and correlated fading cases; the latter is derived under some assumptions about the scaling of the fading correlation structure. In both cases, the theoretic capacity growth is linear in n but the growth rate is 10-20% smaller in the presence of correlated fading.

This concept allows the NOC to accommodate large resources such as large memory banks, FPGA areas, or special purpose computation resources such as high performance multi-processors. The NOC design methodology consists of two phases. In the first phase a concrete architecture is derived from the general NOC template. The concrete architecture defines the number of switches and shape of the network, the kind and shape of regions and the number and kind of resources. The second phase maps the application onto the concrete architecture to form a concrete product.","","0-7695-1486-3","10.1109/ISVLSI.2002.1016885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016885","","Network-on-a-chip;Design methodology;Switches;Concrete;Communication switching;Field programmable gate arrays;Computer architecture;Shape;Packet switching;Hardware","","653","64","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on an in-depth examination of the influence of the search pattern on speed performance, we propose a novel algorithm using a hexagon-based search pattern to achieve further improvement. The hexagon-based search pattern is investigated in comparison with diamond search pattern and demonstrates significant speedup gain over the diamond-based search. Analysis shows that a speed improvement rate of the hexagon-based search (HEXBS) algorithm over the diamond search (DS) algorithm can be over 80% for locating some motion vectors in certain scenarios. In short, the proposed HEXBS algorithm can find the same motion vector with fewer search points than the DS algorithm. Generally speaking, the larger the motion vector, the more search points the.

When compared with other sources of variation in face images, appearance variation due to aging displays some unique characteristics.

We describe how the effects of aging on facial appearance can be explained using learned age transformations and present experimental results to show that reasonably accurate estimates of age can be made for unseen images. We also show that we can improve our results by taking into account the fact that different individuals age in different ways and by considering the effect of lifestyle. Our proposed framework can be used for simulating aging effects on new face images in order to predict how an individual might look like in the future or how he/she used to look in the past. The methodology presented has also been used for designing a face recognition system, robust to aging variation. In this context, the perceived age of the subjects in the training and test images is normalized before the training and classification procedure so that aging variation is eliminated. Experimental results demonstrate that, when age normalization is used, the performance of our face recognition system can be improved.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.993553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993553","","Aging","","641","37","28","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inevitably, the role of quantitative image analysis in the evaluation of drug therapy will increase, driven in part by requirements imposed by regulatory agencies. However, the prohibitive length of time involved and the significant intra- and inter-rater variability of the measurements obtained from manual analysis of large MRI databases represent major obstacles to the wider application of quantitative MRI analysis. We have developed a fully automatic ""pipeline"" image analysis framework and have successfully applied it to a number of large-scale, multi-center studies (more than 1000 MRI scans). This pipeline system is based on robust image processing algorithms, executed in a parallel, distributed fashion. This paper describes the application of this system to the automatic quantification of multiple sclerosis lesion load in MRI, in the context of a phase III clinical trial. The pipeline results were evaluated through an extensive validation study, revealing that the obtained lesion measurements are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by trained human observers. Given that intra- and inter-rater measurement variability is eliminated by automatic analysis, this system enhances the ability to detect small treatment effects not readily detectable through conventional analysis techniques. While useful for clinical trial analysis in multiple sclerosis, this system holds widespread potential for applications in other neurological disorders, as well as for the study of neurobiology in general.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.806283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174106","","Pipelines;Magnetic resonance imaging;Clinical trials;Multiple sclerosis;Image analysis;Magnetic analysis;Humans;Lesions;Pathology;Drugs","Algorithms;Brain;Clinical Trials as Topic;Computing Methodologies;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Multiple Sclerosis;Multiple Sclerosis;Observer Variation;Systems Integration","633","4","58","IEEE","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this contribution, we describe a probabilistic approach that is able to compensate for imprecisely localized, partially occluded, and expression-variant faces even when only one single training sample per class is available to the system. To solve the localization problem, we find the subspace (within the feature space, e.g., eigenspace) that represents this error for each of the training images. To resolve the occlusion problem, each face is divided into k local regions which are analyzed in isolation. In contrast with other approaches where a simple voting space is used, we present a probabilistic method that analyzes how ""good"" a local match is. To make the recognition system less sensitive to the differences between the facial expression displayed on the training and the testing images, we weight the results obtained on each local area on the basis of how much of this local area is affected by the expression displayed on the current test image.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1008382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1008382","","Face recognition;Principal component analysis;Image recognition;System testing;Pattern recognition;Lighting;Voting;Learning systems;Displays","","633","9","74","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Analysis of the inactivation kinetics for various bacteria seeded in (or on) various media and exposed to the plasma generated by these devices, showed that three types of survivor curves exist, depending on the type of micro-organism, the type of medium, and the type of exposure (direct versus remote). Insights into the roles of UV radiation, active species, and charged particles has led to the conclusion that chemically reactive species, such as free radicals, play the most important role in the inactivation process.

We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976602760407955","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6789852","","","","627","33","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Previous work reported results of studies that showed that prioritization techniques can significantly improve rate of fault detection. Those studies, however, raised several additional questions: 1) Can prioritization techniques be effective when targeted at specific modified versions; 2) what trade-offs exist between fine granularity and coarse granularity prioritization techniques; 3) can the incorporation of measures of fault proneness into prioritization techniques improve their effectiveness? To address these questions, we have performed several new studies in which we empirically compared prioritization techniques using both controlled experiments and case studies.","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.988497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988497","","Computer aided software engineering;Fault detection;Software testing;System testing;Costs;Software measurement;Radio access networks;Feedback;Debugging;Instruments","","621","5","35","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These measures are calculated by comparing the positions of the alternatives between the individual solutions and collective solution. In such a way, the consensus situation is evaluated in each moment in a more realistic way. With these measures, we design a consensus support system that is able to substitute the actions of the moderator. In this system, the consensus measure is used to guide the consensus process until the final solution is achieved while the proximity measure is used to guide the discussion phases of the consensus process. The consensus support system has a feedback mechanism to guide the discussion phases based on the proximity measure. This feedback mechanism is based on simple and easy rules to help experts change their opinions in order to obtain a degree of consensus as high as possible. The main improvement of this consensus model is that it supports consensus process automatically, without moderator, and, in such a way, the possible subjectivity that the moderator can introduce in the consensus process is avoided.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2002.802821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046070","","Decision making;Phase measurement;Feedback;Position measurement;Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Coordinate measuring machines","","618","","27","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among the most appealing aspects of this field are the ability to refer it to a well-established theory, and the fact that the proposed algorithms in this field are efficient and practical. Adaptive methods based on anisotropic diffusion (AD), weighted least squares (WLS), and robust estimation (RE) were proposed as iterative locally adaptive machines for noise removal. Tomasi and Manduchi (see Proc. 6th Int. Conf. Computer Vision, New Delhi, India, p.839-46, 1998) proposed an alternative noniterative bilateral filter for removing noise from images. This filter was shown to give similar and possibly better results to the ones obtained by iterative approaches. However, the bilateral filter was proposed as an intuitive tool without theoretical connection to the classical approaches. We propose such a bridge, and show that the bilateral filter also emerges from the Bayesian approach, as a single iteration of some well-known iterative algorithm. Based on this observation, we also show how the bilateral filter can be improved and extended to treat more general reconstruction problems.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.801126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1042377","","Filters;Signal processing algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Additive noise;Signal processing;Adaptive signal processing;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Least squares approximation;Noise robustness","","597","25","23","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We study adapting the user's transmission rate and power based on the channel state information as well as the buffer occupancy; the objectives are to regulate both the long-term average transmission power and the average buffer delay incurred by the traffic. Two models for this situation are discussed; one corresponding to fixed-length/variable-rate codewords and one corresponding to variable-length codewords. The tradeoff between the average delay and the average transmission power required for reliable communication is analyzed. A dynamic programming formulation is given to find all Pareto optimal power/delay operating points. We then quantify the behavior of this tradeoff in the regime of asymptotically large delay. In this regime, we characterize simple buffer control policies which exhibit optimal characteristics.

However, lack of structured coding schemes limited the practical application of these concepts so far. One of the basic elements of a network code is the binning scheme. Wyner (1974, 1978) and other researchers proposed various forms of coset codes for efficient binning, yet these schemes were applicable only for lossless source (or noiseless channel) network coding. To extend the algebraic binning approach to lossy source (or noisy channel) network coding, previous work proposed the idea of nested codes, or more specifically, nested parity-check codes for the binary case and nested lattices in the continuous case. These ideas connect network information theory with the rich areas of linear codes and lattice codes, and have strong potential for practical applications.

A single estimator, in the form of a Kalman filter, processes the available positioning information from all the members of the team and produces a pose estimate for every one of them. The equations for this centralized estimator can be written in a decentralized form, therefore allowing this single Kalman filter to be decomposed into a number of smaller communicating filters. Each of these filters processes the sensor data collected by its host robot. Exchange of information between the individual filters is necessary only when two robots detect each other and measure their relative pose. The resulting decentralized estimation schema, which we call collective localization, constitutes a unique means for fusing measurements collected from a variety of sensors with minimal communication and processing requirements. The distributed localization algorithm is applied to a group of three robots and the improvement in localization accuracy is presented.

Exudates are found using their high grey level variation, and their contours are determined by means of morphological reconstruction techniques. The detection of the optic disc is indispensable for this approach. We detect the optic disc by means of morphological filtering techniques and the watershed transformation. The algorithm has been tested on a small image data base and compared with the performance of a human grader. As a result, we obtain a mean sensitivity of 92.8% and a mean predictive value of 92.4%.

QoS takes into account not only the average response time, but also the percentile of the response time; and throughput is the rate at which a service can process requests. QoS measures can include the maximum throughput or a function that describes how throughput varies with load intensity. The QoS measure is observed by Web services users. These users are not human beings but programs that send requests for services to Web service providers.

To replace the sensor the information on the rotor speed is extracted from measured stator voltages and currents at the motor terminals. Vector-controlled drives require estimating the magnitude and spatial orientation of the fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor. Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in the low-speed range can be achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine.

Recently, they attracted considerable interest in the systems and control community. The complexity arises due to the exponential type transcendental terms in their characteristic equation. The transcendentality brings infinitely many characteristic roots, which are cumbersome to elaborate as evident from the literature. A number of methodologies have been suggested with limited ability to assess the stability in the parametric domain of time delay. This study offers an exact, structured and robust methodology to bring a closure to the question at hand. Ultimately we present a unique explicit analytical expression in terms of the system parameters which not only reveals the stability regions (pockets) in the domain of time delay, but it also declares the number of unstable characteristic roots at any given pocket. The method starts with the determination of all possible purely imaginary (resonant) characteristic roots for any positive time delay. To achieve this a simplifying substitution is used for the transcendental terms in the characteristic equation. It is proven that the number of such resonant roots for a given dynamics is finite. Each one of these roots is created by infinitely many time delays, which are periodically distributed. An interesting property is also claimed next, that the root crossing directions at these locations are invariant with respect to the delay and dependent only on the crossing frequency. These two unique findings facilitate a simple and practical stability method, which is the highlight of the work.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2002.1000275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000275","","Stability analysis;Delay effects;Equations;Resonance;Time invariant systems;Control systems;Robustness;Frequency;Delay lines;Polynomials","","565","1","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Results demonstrate that within-die fluctuations primarily impact the FMAX mean and die-to-die fluctuations determine the majority of the FMAX variance. Employing rigorously derived device and circuit models, the impact of die-to-die and within-die parameter fluctuations on future FMAX distributions is forecast for the 180, 130, 100, 70, and 50-nm technology generations. Model predictions reveal that systematic within-die fluctuations impose the largest performance degradation resulting from parameter fluctuations. Assuming a 3/spl sigma/ channel length deviation of 20%, projections for the 50-nm technology generation indicate that essentially a generation of performance gain can be lost due to systematic within-die fluctuations.

As such, if one desires to learn a control law in real-time, a fusion of soft computing techniques to learn the appropriate control law with hard computing techniques to maintain the stability constraint and guarantee convergence is required. The objective of the paper is to describe an adaptive dynamic programming algorithm (ADPA) which fuses soft computing techniques to learn the optimal cost (or return) functional for a stabilizable nonlinear system with unknown dynamics and hard computing techniques to verify the stability and convergence of the algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm is initialized with a (stabilizing) cost functional and the system is run with the corresponding control law (defined by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation), with the resultant state trajectories used to update the cost functional in a soft computing mode. Hard computing techniques are then used to show that this process is globally convergent with stepwise stability to the optimal cost functional/control law pair for an (unknown) input affine system with an input quadratic performance measure (modulo the appropriate technical conditions). Three specific implementations of the ADPA are developed for 1) the linear case, 2) for the nonlinear case using a locally quadratic approximation to the cost functional, and 3) the nonlinear case using a radial basis function approximation of the cost functional; illustrated by applications to flight control.","1558-2442","","10.1109/TSMCC.2002.801727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039198","","Dynamic programming;Cost function;Function approximation;Control systems;Stability;Convergence;Computer applications;Heuristic algorithms;Fuses;Nonlinear systems","","557","1","32","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This geometry, which has been used to model complex objects found in nature such as clouds and coastlines, has space-filling properties that can be utilized to miniaturize antennas. These contours are able to add more electrical length in less volume. In this article, we look at miniaturizing wire and patch antennas using fractals. Fractals are profoundly intricate shapes that are easy to define. It is seen that even though the mathematical foundations call for an infinitely complex structure, the complexity that is not discernible for the particular application can be truncated. For antennas, this means that we can reap the rewards of miniaturizing an antenna using fractals without paying the price of having to manufacture an infinitely complex radiator. In fact, it is shown that the required number of generating iterations, each of which adds a layer of intricacy, is only a few. A primer on the mathematical bases of fractal geometry is also given, focusing especially on the mathematical properties that apply to the analysis of antennas. Also presented is an application of these miniaturized antennas to phased arrays. It is shown how these fractal antennas can be used in tightly packed linear arrays, resulting in phased arrays that can scan to wider angles while avoiding grating lobes.","1558-4143","","10.1109/74.997888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=997888","","Fractal antennas;Phased arrays;Linear antenna arrays;Geometry;Solid modeling;Clouds;Wire;Patch antennas;Shape;Manufacturing","","557","13","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The local normal model treats the neighborhood of a pixel as having a normal probability distribution. The normal mixture model considers the observation from each pixel as arising from one of several possible classes such that each class has a normal probability distribution. The linear mixture model considers each observation to be a linear combination of fixed spectra, known as endmembers, that are, or may be, associated with materials in the scene, and the coefficients, interpreted as fractional abundance, are constrained to be nonnegative and sum to one. We show how the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) may be used to derive anomaly detectors for the local normal and global normal mixture models. The anomaly detector applied with the linear mixture approach proceeds by identifying target like endmembers based on properties of the histogram of the abundance estimates and employing a matched filter in the space of abundance estimates. To overcome the limitations of the individual models, we develop a joint decision logic, based on a maximum entropy probability model and the GLRT, that utilizes multiple decision statistics, and we apply this approach using the detection statistics derived from the three clutter models. Examples demonstrate that the joint decision logic can improve detection performance in comparison with the individual anomaly detectors. We also describe the application of linear prediction filters to repeated images of the same area to detect changes that occur within the scene over time.","1558-0792","","10.1109/79.974730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974730","","Spectral analysis","","552","21","40","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We adapt the Butler-Reeds-Dawson (1981) algorithm to solve this optimization problem in three steps. In the first step, the data are compressed using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the kernels. The tensor-product structure of the kernel is exploited so that the compressed data is typically a thousand fold smaller than the original data. This size reduction is crucial for fast optimization. In the second step, the constrained optimization problem is transformed to an unconstrained optimization problem in the compressed data space. In the third step, a suboptimal value of the smoothing parameter is chosen by the BRD method. Steps 2 and 3 are iterated until convergence of the algorithm.

In the three-phase machines, the concentrated winding is too often restricted to a winding with a short pitch of 120 electrical degrees, i.e., to a winding with performances reduced compared to the traditional structures. But there is a significant number of three-phase structures which can support a concentrated winding if the number of poles is increased.

While challenging even in the best of circumstances, this problem poses unique difficulties when the dimensions of the interferometric input data exceed the limits of one's computational capabilities. In order to deal with such cases, we propose a technique for applying the statistical-cost, network-flow phase-unwrapping algorithm (SNAPHU) of Chen and Zebker (2001) to large datasets. Specifically, we introduce a methodology whereby a large interferogram is partitioned into a set of several smaller tiles that are unwrapped individually and then divided further into independent, irregularly shaped reliable regions. These regions are subsequently assembled into a full unwrapped solution, with the phase offsets between regions computed in a secondary optimization problem whose objective is to maximize the a posteriori probability of the final solution. As this secondary problem assumes the same statistical models as employed in the initial tile-unwrapping stage, the technique results in a solution that approximates the solution that would have been obtained had the full-size interferogram been unwrapped as a single piece. The secondary problem is framed in terms of network-flow ideas, allowing the use of an existing nonlinear solver. Applying the algorithm to a large topographic interferogram acquired over central Alaska, we find that the technique is less prone to unwrapping artifacts than more simple tiling approaches.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.802453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036000","","Synthetic aperture radar interferometry;Probability;Phase estimation;Geophysics computing;Partitioning algorithms;Two dimensional displays;Data analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","","549","","21","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

System stability is analyzed in terms of the time-domain definition of passivity. We define a ""passivity observer"" (PO) which measures energy flow in and out of one or more subsystems in real-time software. Active behavior is indicated by a negative value of the PO at any time. We also define the ""passivity controller"" (PC), an adaptive dissipative element which, at each time sample, absorbs exactly the net energy output (if any) measured by the PO. The method is tested with simulation and implementation in the Excalibur haptic interface system. Totally stable operation was achieved under conditions such as stiffness >100 N/mm or time delays of 15 ms. The PO/PC method requires very little additional computation and does not require a dynamical model to be identified.","2374-958X","","10.1109/70.988969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988969","","Time domain analysis;Haptic interfaces;Energy measurement;Control systems;Stability analysis;Fluid flow measurement;Software measurement;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Time measurement","","548","2","20","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Dominating sets and neighbor elimination-based broadcasting algorithms in wireless networks","I. Stojmenovic; M. Seddigh; J.

In a broadcasting task, a source node sends the same message to all the nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose to significantly reduce or eliminate the communication overhead of a broadcasting task by applying the concept of localized dominating sets. Their maintenance does not require any communication overhead in addition to maintaining positions of neighboring nodes. Retransmissions by only internal nodes in a dominating set is sufficient for reliable broadcasting. Existing dominating sets are improved by using node degrees instead of their ids as primary keys. We also propose to eliminate neighbors that already received the message and rebroadcast only if the list of neighbors that might need the message is nonempty. A retransmission after negative acknowledgements scheme is also described. The important features of the proposed algorithms are their reliability (reaching all nodes in the absence of message collisions), significant rebroadcast savings, and their localized and parameterless behavior. The reduction in communication overhead for the broadcasting task is measured experimentally. Dominating set based broadcasting, enhanced by a neighbor elimination scheme and highest degree key, provides reliable broadcast with /spl les/53 percent of node retransmissions (on random unit graphs with 100 nodes) for all average degrees d. Critical d is around 4, with <48 percent for /spl les/3, /spl les/40 percent for d/spl ges/10, and /spl les/20 percent for d/spl ges/25. The proposed methods are better than existing ones in all considered aspects: reliability, rebroadcast savings, and maintenance communication overhead. In particular, the cluster structure is inefficient for broadcasting because of considerable communication overhead for maintaining the structure and is also inferior in terms of rebroadcast savings.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.980024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=980024","","Broadcasting;Intelligent networks;Wireless networks","","541","3","36","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then discuss the channel capacity of the oversampled and clipped OFDM signals over the additive white Gaussian noise and ideally interleaved Rayleigh fading channels. The capacity is calculated based on the assumption that the distortion terms caused by the clipping are Gaussian. It is shown that the SNR penalty due to the clipping can be considerably alleviated by using optimal coding and reducing the information data rate.

However, more than a decade after its initial proposal, IP multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment, and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow, and congestion control. We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP multicast. We study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives. We believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.803066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038577","","Computer aided software engineering;Multicast protocols;Error correction;Unicast;Proposals;Scalability;Delay;Switches;Web and internet services;Internetworking","","527","16","23","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Detailed multipath structure was retrieved from PDPs and PAPs and was related to site-specific environments. Results show an excellent correlation between the propagation environments and the multipath channel structures. The measurement results confirm that the majority of the multipath components can be determined from image based ray tracing techniques for line-of-sight (LOS) applications.

In particular, statistical properties and ergodic theorems for relative entropy densities of HMPs were developed. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimator were proved under some mild conditions. Similar results were established for switching autoregressive processes. These processes generalize HMPs. New algorithms were developed for estimating the state, parameter, and order of an HMP, for universal coding and classification of HMPs, and for universal decoding of hidden Markov channels.

We assume that the object consists of a given number of nonoverlapping materials, such as soft tissue and bone. The attenuation coefficient of each voxel is the product of its unknown density and a known energy-dependent mass attenuation coefficient. We formulate a penalized-likelihood function for this polyenergetic model and develop an ordered-subsets iterative algorithm for estimating the unknown densities in each voxel. The algorithm monotonically decreases the cost function at each iteration when one subset is used. Applying this method to simulated X-ray CT measurements of objects containing both bone and soft tissue yields images with significantly reduced beam hardening artifacts.","1558-254X","","10.1109/42.993128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993128","","X-ray imaging;Image reconstruction;Computed tomography;Biological tissues;Bones;Iterative algorithms;Attenuation measurement;Energy measurement;Biological materials;Cost function","Algorithms;Bone and Bones;Bone and Bones;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Monte Carlo Method;Phantoms, Imaging;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Water","504","20","44","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on use of a short-current pulse of the PV to determine an optimum operating current where the maximum output power can be obtained and completely differs from conventional hill-climbing-based methods. In the proposed system, the optimum operating current is instantaneously determined simply by taking a product of the short-current pulse amplitude and a parameter k because the optimum operating current is exactly proportional to the short current under various conditions of illuminance and temperature. Also, the system offers an identification capability of k by means of fast power-versus-current curve scanning, which makes the short-current pulse-based MPPT method adaptive to disturbances such as shades partially covering the PV panels and surface contamination. The above adaptive MPPT algorithm has been introduced into a current-controlled boost chopper and a multiple power converter system composed of PV-and-chopper modules. Various operating characteristics have experimentally been examined on this multiple PV-and-chopper module system from a practical viewpoint and excellent MPPT performance has been confirmed through the tests.","1557-9948","","10.1109/41.982265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982265","","Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Power generation;Temperature;Surface contamination;Choppers;System testing;Pollution measurement;Databases;Power measurement","","504","10","8","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EPONs are designed to carry Ethernet frames at standard Ethernet rates. An EPON uses a single trunk fiber that extends from a central office to a passive optical splitter, which then fans out to multiple optical drop fibers connected to subscriber nodes. Other than the end terminating equipment, no component in the network requires electrical power, hence the term passive. Local carriers have long been interested in passive optical networks for the benefits they offer: minimal fiber infrastructure and no powering requirement in the outside plant. With Ethernet now emerging as the protocol of choice for carrying IP traffic in metro and access networks, EPON has emerged as a potential optimized architecture for fiber to the building and fiber to the home.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.983910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=983910","","EPON;Next generation networking;Optical fiber devices;Ethernet networks;Passive optical networks;Buildings;Optical fiber networks;Central office;Fans;Access protocols","","503","22","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, in the application of Kalman filters there is often known model or signal information that is either ignored or dealt with heuristically. For instance, constraints on state values (which may be based on physical considerations) are often neglected because they do not fit easily into the structure of the Kalman filter. A rigorous analytic method of incorporating state equality constraints in the Kalman filter is developed. The constraints may be time varying. At each time step the unconstrained Kalman filter solution is projected onto the state constraint surface. This significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the filter. The use of this algorithm is demonstrated on a simple nonlinear vehicle tracking problem.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.993234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993234","","Kalman filters;Filtering;State estimation;Noise measurement;Covariance matrix;Vehicle dynamics;Electronic mail;Equations;Gain measurement;Surface fitting","","500","1","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, Z/sub o/ is the output impedance of the source module/subsystem, and Z/sub i/ is the input impedance of the load module/subsystem. As a result, an effective way to prevent system instability is defining impedance specifications for modules/subsystems. This paper briefly summarizes existing works and introduces the authors' contribution in defining impedance specifications. A new forbidden region for impedance ratio Z/sub o//Z/sub i/ on the S-plane is proposed as the system stability margin requirement. Based on this proposed forbidden region, the impedance specifications of individual loads are established.

The bandwidth of the signal used in this experiment is in excess of 1 GHz, which results in a differential path delay resolution of less than a nanosecond, without special processing. Based on the experimental results, a characterization of the propagation channel from a communications theoretic view point is described, and its implications for the design of a UWB radio receiver are presented. Robustness of the UWB signal to multipath fading is quantified through histograms and cumulative distributions. The all RAKE (ARAKE) receiver and maximum-energy-capture selective RAKE (SRAKE) receiver are introduced. The ARAKE receiver serves as the best case (bench mark) for RAKE receiver design and lower bounds the performance degradation caused by multipath. Multipath components of measured waveforms are detected using a maximum-likelihood detector. Energy capture as a function of the number of single-path signal correlators used in UWB SRAKE receiver provides a complexity versus performance tradeoff. Bit-error-probability performance of a UWB SRAKE receiver, based on measured channels, is given as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of correlators implemented in the receiver.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.805031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097827","","Bandwidth;RAKE receivers;Fading;Correlators;Laboratories;Signal processing;Delay;Signal resolution;Robustness;Histograms","","494","3","74","IEEE","16 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our method explicitly takes into account the statistical variation of both the received signal and interference power and optimally allocates power subject to constraints on the probability of fading induced outage for each transmitter/receiver pair. We establish several results for this type of problem. We establish tight bounds that relate the outage probability caused by channel fading to the signal-to-interference margin calculated when the statistical variation of the signal and interference powers is ignored. This allows us to show that well-known methods for allocating power, based on Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue theory, can be used to determine power allocations that are provably close to achieving optimal (i.e., minimal) outage probability. We show that the problems of minimizing the transmitter power subject to constraints on outage probability and minimizing outage probability subject to power constraints can be posed as a geometric program (GP). A GP is a special type of optimization problem that can be transformed to a nonlinear convex optimization problem by a change of variables and therefore solved globally and efficiently by interior-point methods. We also give a fast iterative method for finding the optimal power allocation to minimize the outage probability.","1558-2248","","10.1109/7693.975444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975444","","Power control;Fading;Rayleigh channels;Probability;Interference constraints;Transmitters;Optimization methods;Wireless networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Iterative methods","","492","5","33","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The accuracy and application range of the two methods are examined in the case of the surge of Monacobreen in Northern Svalbard between 1992 and 1996. Offset-tracking procedures of SAR images are an alternative to differential SAR interferometry for the estimation of glacier motion when differential SAR interferometry is limited by loss of coherence, i.e. in the case of rapid and incoherent flow and of large acquisition time intervals between the two SAR images. In addition, an offset-tracking procedure in the azimuth direction may be combined with differential SAR interferometry in the slant-range direction in order to retrieve a two-dimensional displacement map when SAR data of only one orbit configuration are available.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.805079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166597","","Motion estimation;Interferometry;Surface topography;Surges;Ice;Radar tracking;Geography;Synthetic aperture radar;Azimuth;Remote sensing","","483","","22","IEEE","22 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this case, the convergence properties of the evolutionary algorithm are unclear due to the approximation error of the model. In this paper, extensive empirical studies are carried out to investigate the convergence properties of an evolution strategy using an approximate fitness function on two benchmark problems. It is found that incorrect convergence will occur if the approximate model has false optima. To address this problem, individual- and generation-based evolution control are introduced and the resulting effects on the convergence properties are presented. A framework for managing approximate models in generation-based evolution control is proposed. This framework is well suited for parallel evolutionary optimization, which is able to guarantee the correct convergence of the evolutionary algorithm, as well as to reduce the computation cost as much as possible. Control of the evolution and updating of the approximate models are based on the estimated fidelity of the approximate model.

In this study, we investigate the traffic-grooming problem in a WDM-based optical mesh topology network. Our objective is to improve the network throughput.

If demosaicing is not performed appropriately, images suffer from highly visible color artifacts. In this paper we present a new demosaicing technique that uses inter-channel correlation effectively in an alternating-projections scheme.

We propose the second mechanism, called global network positioning (GNP), which is based on absolute coordinates computed from modeling the Internet as a geometric space. Since end hosts maintain their own coordinates, these approaches allow end hosts to compute their inter-host distances as soon as they discover each other. Moreover, coordinates are very efficient in summarizing inter-host distances, making these approaches very scalable. By performing experiments using measured Internet distance data, we show that both coordinates-based schemes are more accurate than the existing state of the art system IDMaps, and the GNP approach achieves the highest accuracy and robustness among them.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019258","","IP networks;Peer to peer computing;Economic indicators;Propagation delay;Computer networks;Solid modeling;Performance evaluation;Coordinate measuring machines;Internet;Robustness","","472","29","12","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But overresponding to change has been cited as the source of many software disasters, such as the $3 billion overrun of the US Federal Aviation Administration's Advanced Automation System for national air traffic control. The author believes that both agile and plan-driven approaches have a responsible center and overinterpreting radical fringes. Agile and plan-driven methods both form part of the planning spectrum.

High chip rates in wideband CDMA systems facilitate accurate TDOA measurements, and a smart antenna used at the home base station (BS) can provide accurate AOA measurement in a macrocell environment. A two-step least square location estimator is developed based on a linear form of the AOA equation in the small error region. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid TDOA/AOA location scheme gives a much higher location accuracy than TDOA only location, when the number of base stations is small and/or when the TDOA measurements have a relatively poor accuracy.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2002.800542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017519","","Wideband;Multiaccess communication;Antenna measurements;Semiconductor device measurement;Time measurement;Broadband antennas;Base stations;Wireless communication;Costs;Time difference of arrival","","470","19","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aura aims to minimize distractions on a user's attention, creating an environment that adapts to the user's context and needs. Aura is specifically intended for pervasive computing environments involving wireless communication, wearable or handheld computers, and smart spaces. Human attention is an especially scarce resource in such environments, because the user is often preoccupied with walking, driving, or other real-world interactions. In addition, mobile computing poses difficult challenges such as intermittent and variable-bandwidth connectivity, concern for battery life, and the client resource constraints that weight and size considerations impose. To accomplish its ambitious goals, research in Aura spans every system level: from the hardware, through the operating system, to applications and end users. Underlying this diversity of concerns, Aura applies two broad concepts. First, it uses proactivity, which is a system layer's ability to anticipate requests from a higher layer. In today's systems, each layer merely reacts to the layer above it. Second, Aura is self-tuning: layers adapt by observing the demands made on them and adjusting their performance and resource usage characteristics accordingly. Currently, system-layer behavior is relatively static. Both of these techniques will help lower demand for human attention.","1558-2590","","10.1109/MPRV.2002.1012334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1012334","","Pervasive computing;Humans;Computer networks;Context;Wireless communication;Handheld computers;Legged locomotion;Mobile computing;Batteries;Hardware","","469","56","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We calculate entanglement-assisted capacities for two interesting quantum channels, the qubit amplitude damping channel and the bosonic channel with amplification/attenuation and Gaussian noise. We discuss how many independent parameters are required to completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of a general quantum channel, alone or in the presence of ancillary resources such as prior entanglement. In the classical analog of entanglement-assisted communication - communication over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) between parties who share prior random information - we show that one parameter is sufficient, i.e., that in the presence of prior shared random information, all DMCs of equal capacity can simulate one another with unit asymptotic efficiency.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.802612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035117","","Information rates;Entropy;Gaussian noise;Protocols;Memoryless systems","","461","","34","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present two techniques to improve the performance and reduce the complexity of channel parameter estimation: optimum training-sequence design and simplified channel estimation. The optimal training sequences not only simplify the initial channel estimation, but also attain the best estimation performance. The simplified channel estimation significantly reduces the complexity of the channel estimation at the expense of a negligible performance degradation. The effectiveness of the new techniques is demonstrated through the simulation of an OFDM system with two-transmit and two-receive antennas. The space-time coding with 240 information bits per codeword is used for transmit diversity. From the simulation, the required signal-to-noise ratio is only about 9 dB for a 10% word error rate for a channel with the typical urban- or hilly-terrain delay profile and a 40-Hz Doppler frequency.","1558-2248","","10.1109/7693.975446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975446","","Channel estimation;OFDM;Transmitting antennas;Parameter estimation;Diversity reception;Frequency estimation;Mobile antennas;Degradation;Wireless communication;Interference","","461","122","15","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, in order to evaluate propagation characteristics of not only bound modes but leaky modes in HFs, an anisotropic perfectly matched layer is also employed as a boundary condition at computational window edges. It is confirmed from numerical results that the propagation loss increases rapidly with increasing wavelength, especially for HFs with one ring of smaller air holes, and that the propagation loss is drastically reduced by adding one more ring of air holes to the cladding region.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2002.1017609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017609","","Finite element methods;Propagation losses;Photonic crystal fibers;Optical waveguides;Optical propagation;Holey fibers;Image analysis;Finite difference methods;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Perfectly matched layers","","459","11","26","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A detection and approximation estimator is used for online health monitoring. Once a fault is detected, a bank of isolation estimators is activated for the purpose of fault isolation. A key design issue of the proposed fault isolation scheme is the adaptive residual threshold associated with each isolation estimator. A fault that has occurred can be isolated if the residual associated with the matched isolation estimator remains below its corresponding adaptive threshold, whereas at least one of the components of the residuals associated with all the other estimators exceeds its threshold at some finite time. Based on the class of nonlinear uncertain systems under consideration, an isolation decision scheme is devised and fault isolability conditions are given, characterizing the class of nonlinear faults that are isolable by the robust fault isolation scheme. The nonconservativeness of the fault isolability conditions is illustrated by deriving a subclass of nonlinear systems and of faults for which these conditions are also necessary for fault isolability. Moreover, the analysis of the proposed fault isolation scheme provides rigorous analytical results concerning the fault isolation time. Two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the fault diagnosis methodology.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.995036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995036","","Robustness;Fault detection;Nonlinear systems;Fault diagnosis;Equations;Algorithm design and analysis;Monitoring;Uncertain systems;Uncertainty;State estimation","","458","10","57","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It also paves the way toward the development of systematic approaches for effective therapeutic intervention in disease. The central theme in this paper is the Boolean formalism as a building block for modeling complex, large-scale, and dynamical networks of genetic interactions. We discuss the goals of modeling genetic networks as well as the data requirements. The Boolean formalism is justified from several points of view. We then introduce Boolean networks and discuss their relationships to nonlinear digital filters. The role of Boolean networks in understanding cell differentiation and cellular functional states is discussed. The inference of Boolean networks from real gene expression data is considered from the viewpoints of computational learning theory and nonlinear signal processing, touching on computational complexity of learning and robustness. Then, a discussion of the need to handle uncertainty in a probabilistic framework is presented, leading to an introduction of probabilistic Boolean networks and their relationships to Markov chains. Methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other genes are presented. The general question of the potential effect of individual genes on the global dynamical network behavior is considered using stochastic perturbation analysis. This discussion then leads into the problem of target identification for therapeutic intervention via the development of several computational tools based on first-passage times in Markov chains. Examples from biology are presented throughout the paper.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.804686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046956","","Genetics;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Biological systems;Systematics;Diseases;Large-scale systems;Digital filters;Cellular networks;Gene expression","","455","1","102","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Variable-length chromosomes (strings) and their genes (parameters) have been used for encoding the problem. The crossover operation exchanges partial chromosomes (partial routes) at positionally independent crossing sites and the mutation operation maintains the genetic diversity of the population. The proposed algorithm can cure all the infeasible chromosomes with a simple repair function. Crossover and mutation together provide a search capability that results in improved quality of solution and enhanced rate of convergence. This paper also develops a population-sizing equation that facilitates a solution with desired quality. It is based on the gambler ruin model; the equation has been further enhanced and generalized. The equation relates the size of the population, quality of solution, cardinality of the alphabet, and other parameters of the proposed algorithm. Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithm exhibits a much better quality of solution (route optimality) and a much higher rate of convergence than other algorithms. The results are relatively independent of problem types for almost all source-destination pairs. Furthermore, simulation studies emphasize the usefulness of the population-sizing equation. The equation scales to larger networks.

To reduce the energy consumption significantly, a node should turn off its radio most of the time, except when it has to participate in data forwarding. We propose a new technique, called sparse topology and energy management (STEM), which efficiently wakes up nodes from a deep sleep state without the need for an ultra low-power radio. The designer can trade the energy efficiency of this sleep state for the latency associated with waking up the node.

We show that our hybrid wakeup scheme results in energy savings of over two orders of magnitude compared to sensor networks without topology management. Furthermore, the network designer is offered full flexibility in exploiting the energy-latency-density design space by selecting the appropriate parameter settings of our protocol.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2002.1011060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1011060","","Design optimization;Intelligent networks;Network topology;Delay;Energy efficiency;Energy management;Fires;Energy consumption;Sleep;Ad hoc networks","","443","1","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Graphical rendering technology is combined with constrained active contour tracking to create a robust wire-frame tracking system. It operates in real time at video frame rate (25 Hz) on standard hardware. It is based on an internal CAD model of the object to be tracked which is rendered using a binary space partition tree to perform hidden line removal. A Lie group formalism is used to cast the motion computation problem into simple geometric terms so that tracking becomes a simple optimization problem solved by means of iterative reweighted least squares. A visual servoing system constructed using this framework is presented together with results showing the accuracy of the tracker. The paper then describes how this tracking system has been extended to provide a general framework for tracking in complex configurations. The adjoint representation of the group is used to transform measurements into common coordinate frames. The constraints are then imposed by means of Lagrange multipliers. Results from a number of experiments performed using this framework are presented and discussed.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1017620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017620","","Rendering (computer graphics);Space technology;Active contours;Robustness;Hardware;Tracking;Least squares methods;Visual servoing;Coordinate measuring machines;Lagrangian functions","","442","114","36","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, the performance of large overlay networks could be improved if the application-level connectivity between the nodes in these networks is congruent with the underlying IP-level topology. Similarly, in the case of replicated Web content, client nodes could use topological information in selecting one of multiple available servers. For such applications, one need not find the optimal solution in order to achieve significant practical benefits. Thus, these applications, and presumably others like them, do not require exact topological information and can instead use sufficiently informative hints about the relative positions of Internet hosts. In this paper, we present a binning scheme whereby nodes partition themselves into bins such that nodes that fall within a given bin are relatively close to one another in terms of network latency. Our binning strategy is simple (requiring minimal support from any measurement infrastructure), scalable (requiring no form of global knowledge, each node only needs knowledge of a small number of well-known landmark nodes) and completely distributed (requiring no communication or cooperation between the nodes being binned). We apply this binning strategy to the two applications mentioned above: overlay network construction and server selection. We test our binning strategy and its application using simulation and Internet measurement traces. Our results indicate that the performance of these applications can be significantly improved by even the rather coarse-grained knowledge of topology offered by our binning scheme.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019369","","Peer to peer computing;Web server;Routing;Internet;Network servers;Network topology;Europe;Delay;Large-scale systems;Computer architecture","","439","24","34","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pointwise correspondences are chosen as the closest point with respect to a weighted linear combination of positional and feature distances. It is shown that, under ideal noise-free conditions, correspondences formed using this distance function are correct more often than correspondences formed using the positional distance alone. In addition, monotonic convergence to at least a local minimum is shown to hold for this method. When noise is present, a method that automatically sets the optimal relative contribution of features and positions is described. This method trades off the error in feature values due to noise against the error in positions due to misalignment. Experimental results suggest that using invariant features decreases the probability of being trapped in a local minimum and may be an effective solution for difficult range image registration problems where the scene is very small compared to the model.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.982886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982886","","Layout;Iterative closest point algorithm;Iterative algorithms;Image registration;Least squares approximation;Robustness;Convergence;Computer vision;Computer graphics;Application software","","436","4","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The document collection's time-line, selected thematic content and thematic strength are indicated by the river's directed flow, composition and changing width, respectively. The directed flow from left to right is interpreted as movement through time and the horizontal distance between two points on the river defines a time interval. At any point in time, the vertical distance, or width, of the river indicates the collective strength of the selected themes.

In this paper, we provide some insights on why image quality assessment is so difficult by pointing out the weaknesses of the error sensitivity based framework, which has been used by most image quality assessment approaches in the literature. Furthermore, we propose a new philosophy in designing image quality metrics: The main function of the human eyes is to extract structural information from the viewing field, and the human visual system is highly adapted for this purpose. Therefore, a measurement of structural distortion should be a good approximation of perceived image distortion.

However, it imposes technical challenges in that a write should be preceded by an erase operation, and that this erase operation can be performed only in a unit much larger than the write unit. To address these technical hurdles, an intermediate software layer called a flash translation layer (FTL) is generally employed to redirect logical addresses from the host system to physical addresses in flash memory. Previous approaches have performed this address translation at the granularity of either a write unit (page) or an erase unit (block). We propose a novel FTL design that combines the two different granularities in address translation. This is motivated by the idea that coarse grain address translation lowers the resources required to maintain translation information, which is crucial in mobile consumer products for cost and power consumption reasons, while fine grain address translation is efficient in handling small size writes. Performance evaluation based on trace-driven simulation shows that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms previously proposed approaches.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2002.1010143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1010143","","Flash memory;Electric shock;Energy consumption;Hard disks;Nonvolatile memory;Mobile computing;Personal digital assistants;Power engineering computing;Consumer products;Costs","","432","106","17","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to other error-detection techniques that use hardware redundancy, EDDI does not require any hardware modifications to add error detection capability to the original system. EDDI duplicates instructions during compilation and uses different registers and variables for the new instructions. Especially for the fault in the code segment of memory, formulas are derived to estimate the error-detection coverage of EDDI using probabilistic methods. These formulas use statistics of the program, which are collected during compilation. EDDI was applied to eight benchmark programs and the error-detection coverage was estimated. Then, the estimates were verified by simulation, in which a fault injector forced a bit-flip in the code segment of executable machine codes. The simulation results validated the estimated fault coverage and show that approximately 1.5% of injected faults produced incorrect results in eight benchmark programs with EDDI, while on average, 20% of injected faults produced undetected incorrect results in the programs without EDDI. Based on the theoretical estimates and actual fault-injection experiments, EDDI can provide over 98% fault-coverage without any extra hardware for error detection. This pure software technique is especially useful when designers cannot change the hardware, but they need dependability in the computer system. To reduce the performance overhead, EDDI schedules the instructions that are added for detecting errors such that ""instruction-level parallelism"" (ILP) is maximized. Performance overhead can be reduced by increasing ILP within a single super-scalar processor. The execution time overhead in a 4-way super-scalar processor is less than the execution time overhead in the processors that can issue two instructions in one cycle.","1558-1721","","10.1109/24.994913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994913","","Hardware;Fault detection;Computer errors;Single event upset;Event detection;Parallel processing;Error correction;Computer architecture;Redundancy;Registers","","425","8","33","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficient space-time codes have been developed that utilize a large portion of the available capacity. These codes are designed under the assumption that the transmitter has no knowledge about the channel. In this work, on the other hand, we consider the case when the transmitter has partial, but not perfect, knowledge about the channel and how to improve a predetermined code so that this fact is taken into account. A performance criterion is derived for a frequency-nonselective fading channel and then utilized to optimize a linear transformation of the predetermined code. The resulting optimization problem turns out to be convex and can thus be efficiently solved using standard methods. In addition, a particularly efficient solution method is developed for the special case of independently fading channel coefficients. The proposed transmission scheme combines the benefits of conventional beamforming with those given by orthogonal space-time block coding. Simulation results for a narrow-band system with multiple transmit antennas and one or more receive antennas demonstrate significant gains over conventional methods in a scenario with nonperfect channel knowledge.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.985950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985950","","Array signal processing","","424","9","34","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two types of anomaly detection are of interest and considered in this paper. One was previously developed by Reed and Yu to detect targets whose signatures are distinct from their surroundings. Another was designed to detect targets with low probabilities in an unknown image scene. Interestingly, they both operate the same form as does a matched filter. Moreover, they can be implemented in real-time processing, provided that the sample covariance matrix is replaced by the sample correlation matrix. One disadvantage of an anomaly detector is the lack of ability to discriminate the detected targets from another. In order to resolve this problem, the concept of target discrimination measures is introduced to cluster different types of anomalies into separate target classes. By using these class means as target information, the detected anomalies can be further classified. With inclusion of target discrimination in anomaly detection, anomaly classification can be implemented in a three-stage process, first by anomaly detection to find potential targets, followed by target discrimination to cluster the detected anomalies into separate target classes, and concluded by a classifier to achieve target classification. Experiments show that anomaly classification performs very differently from anomaly detection.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.800280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1020263","","Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Detectors;Covariance matrix;Signal processing;Image analysis;Matched filters;Object detection;Image sensors;Layout","","417","2","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new space-time cross-correlation function includes all the relevant parameters of the MIMO fading channel in a clean compact form, suitable for both mathematical analysis and numerical calculations/simulations. It also covers many known correlation models as special cases. We demonstrate the utility of the new space-time correlation model by clarifying the limitations of a widely accepted correlation model for MIMO fading channels.

Recently, with the introduction of the new high-speed 802.11a physical layer (PHY), it is even more important to have a well-designed link adaptation scheme work with the 802.11a PHY such that its multiple transmission rates can be exploited. In this paper, we first present a generic method to analyze the goodput performance of an 802.11a system under the distributed coordination function (DCF) and express the expected effective goodput as a closed-form function of the data payload length, the frame retry count, the wireless channel condition, and the selected data transmission rate. Then, based on the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel MPDU (MAC protocol data unit)-based link adaptation scheme for the 802.11a systems. It is a simple table-driven approach and the basic idea is to preestablish a best PHY mode table by applying the dynamic programming technique. The best PHY mode table is indexed by the system status triplet that consists of the data payload length, the wireless channel condition, and the frame retry count. At runtime, a wireless station determines the most appropriate PHY mode for the next transmission attempt by a simple table lookup, using the most up-to-date system status as the index. Our in-depth simulation shows that the proposed MPDU-based link adaptation scheme outperforms the single-mode schemes and the autorate fallback (ARF) scheme-which is used in Lucent Technologies' WaveLAN-II networking devices-significantly in terms of the average goodput, the frame drop rate, and the average number of transmission attempts per data frame delivery.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2002.1175541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175541","","Wireless LAN;Physical layer;Data communication;Payloads;Local area networks;Performance analysis;Media Access Protocol;Dynamic programming;Runtime;Table lookup","","415","21","22","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first consider the case when the antenna subsets are selected based on exact channel knowledge (ECK). Our results assume the transmission of orthogonal space-time block codes (with emphasis on the Alamouti (see IEEE J. Select. Areas Commun., vol.16, p.1451-68, Oct. 1998) code). Next, we treat the case of antenna subset selection when statistical channel knowledge (SCK) is employed by the selection algorithm. This analysis is applicable to general space-time coding schemes. When ECK is available, we show that the selection algorithm chooses the antenna set that maximizes the channel Frobenius norm leading to both coding and diversity gain. When SCK is available, the selection algorithm chooses the antenna set that maximizes the determinant of the covariance of the vectorized channel leading mostly to a coding gain. In case of ECK-based selection, we provide analytical expressions for average SNR and outage probability improvement. For the case when SCK-based selection is used, we derive expressions for coding gain.

A double resonator equivalent circuit model is presented and used to estimate the impedance bandwidth and the respective distributions of radiation losses with typical parameter values at 900 and 1800 MHz. It is noticed that at 900 MHz, the radiation losses of the antenna element wavemode represent typically less than 10% of the total power. Thus, the antenna element works mainly as a matching element, which couples to the low-Q resonant wavemode of the chassis. At 1800 MHz, the contribution of the antenna element wavemode is larger. By enhancing the coupling and by tuning the chassis resonance, it is possible to obtain an impedance bandwidth of over 50% (6 dB return loss) at both at 900 and 1800 MHz. The results given by the equivalent circuit study are fully supported by those of three-dimensional phone-model simulations, including calculation of the SAR and efficiency values. In prototyping, the 6 dB bandwidth of 5.5% was obtained at 980 MHz with a nonradiating coupling element with a volume of 1.6 cm/sup 3/ on a 120 mm long chassis.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2002.802085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1137540","","Mobile handsets;Mobile antennas;Resonance;Bandwidth;Equivalent circuits;Impedance;Coupling circuits;Telephone sets;Performance analysis;Circuit optimization","","412","28","24","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed 3-D SVM is a superset of the traditional two-dimensional (2-D) SVM, and thus it inherits all the merits of the traditional 2-D SVM. A 100 kW 5 kHz four-leg inverter and a 20 kHz four-leg rectifier prototypes are built and controlled by the proposed 3-D SVM. Experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the 3-D SVM.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.1004239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1004239","","Voltage;Pulse width modulation inverters;Space vector pulse width modulation;Support vector machines;Pulse width modulation converters;Rectifiers;Active filters;Capacitors;Power generation;Leg","","409","2","31","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An algorithm assigns a unique signature to each node in the program graph and adds instructions for error detection. Signatures are embedded in the program during compilation time using the constant field of the instructions and compared with run-time signatures when the program is executed. Another algorithm reduces the code size and execution time overhead caused by checking instructions in CFCSS. A ""branching fault injection experiment"" was performed with benchmark programs. Without CFCSS, an average of 33.7 % of the injected branching faults produced undetected incorrect outputs; however, with CFCSS, only 3.1 % of branching faults produced undetected incorrect outputs. Thus it is possible to increase error detection coverage for control flow errors by an order of magnitude using CFCSS. The distinctive advantage of CFCSS over previous signature monitoring techniques is that CFCSS is a pure software method, i.e., it needs no dedicated hardware such as a watchdog processor for control flow checking. A watchdog task in multitasking environment also needs no extra hardware, but the advantage of CFCSS over a watchdog task is that CFCSS can be used even when the operating system does not support multitasking.","1558-1721","","10.1109/24.994926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994926","","Monitoring;Runtime;Error correction;Hardware;Multitasking;Central Processing Unit;Process control;Operating systems;Fault detection;Satellites","","406","35","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Raw microdata (i.e., individual records or data vectors) are grouped into small aggregates prior to publication. Each aggregate should contain at least k data vectors to prevent disclosure of individual information, where k is a constant value preset by the data protector. No exact polynomial algorithms are known to date to microaggregate optimally, i.e., with minimal variability loss. Methods in the literature rank data and partition them into groups of fixed-size; in the multivariate case, ranking is performed by projecting data vectors onto a single axis. In this paper, candidate optimal solutions to the multivariate and univariate microaggregation problems are characterized. In the univariate case, two heuristics based on hierarchical clustering and genetic algorithms are introduced which are data-oriented in that they try to preserve natural data aggregates. In the multivariate case, fixed-size and hierarchical clustering microaggregation algorithms are presented which do not require data to be projected onto a single dimension; such methods clearly reduce variability loss as compared to conventional multivariate microaggregation on projected data.","1558-2191","","10.1109/69.979982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=979982","","Aggregates;Databases;Protection;Polynomials;Partitioning algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Clustering algorithms","","404","1","24","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have emerged as an alternative technology offering advantages such as wide bandwidth, ease of fabricating large arrays, and potential for integration with electronics. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the viability of CMUTs for ultrasound imaging. We present the first pulse-echo phased array B-scan sector images using a 128-element, one-dimensional (1-D) linear CMUT array. We fabricated 64- and 128-element 1-D CMUT arrays with 100% yield and uniform element response across the arrays. These arrays have been operated in immersion with no failure or degradation in performance over the time. For imaging experiments, we built a resolution test phantom roughly mimicking the attenuation properties of soft tissue. We used a PC-based experimental system, including custom-designed electronic circuits to acquire the complete set of 128/spl times/128 RF A-scans from all transmit-receive element combinations. We obtained the pulse-echo frequency response by analyzing the echo signals from wire targets. These echo signals presented an 80% fractional bandwidth around 3 MHz, including the effect of attenuation in the propagating medium. We reconstructed the B-scan images with a sector angle of 90 degrees and an image depth of 210 mm through offline processing by using RF beamforming and synthetic phased array approaches. The measured 6-dB lateral and axial resolutions at 135 mm depth were 0.0144 radians and 0.3 mm, respectively. The electronic noise floor of the image was more than 50 dB below the maximum mainlobe magnitude. We also performed preliminary investigations on the effects of crosstalk among array elements on the image quality. In the near field, some artifacts were observable extending out from the array to a depth of 2 cm. A tail also was observed in the point spread function (PSF) in the axial direction, indicating the existence of crosstalk. The relative amplitude of this tail with respect to the mainlobe was less than -20 dB.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2002.1049742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049742","","Ultrasonic transducer arrays;Ultrasonic transducers;Acoustic arrays;Acoustic imaging;Phased arrays;Crosstalk;Bandwidth;Ultrasonic imaging;Attenuation;Radio frequency","Adipose Tissue;Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Simulation;Electric Capacitance;Electrodes;Equipment Design;Image Enhancement;Liver;Miniaturization;Phantoms, Imaging;Quality Control;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stochastic Processes;Transducers;Ultrasonography","404","43","57","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A number of such algorithms were developed previously. This tutorial will concentrate on schemes that are loop-free, localized, and follow a single-path strategy, which are desirable characteristics for scalable routing protocols. Routing protocols have two modes: greedy mode (when the forwarding node is able to advance the message toward the destination) and recovery mode (applied until return to greedy mode is possible). We discuss them separately. Methods also differ in metrics used (hop count, power, cost, congestion, etc.), and in past traffic memorization at nodes (memoryless or memorizing past traffic).

The problem is motivated by the following observation. With many channel coding schemes, the energy required to transmit a packet can be significantly reduced by lowering transmission power and code rate and therefore transmitting the packet over a longer period of time. However, information is often time-critical or delay-sensitive and transmission times cannot be made arbitrarily long. We therefore consider packet transmission schedules that minimize energy subject to a deadline or a delay constraint. Specifically, we obtain an optimal offline schedule for a node operating under a deadline constraint. An inspection of the form of this schedule naturally leads us to an online schedule which is shown, through simulations, to perform closely to the optimal offline schedule. Taking the deadline to infinity, we provide an exact probabilistic analysis of our offline scheduling algorithm. The results of this analysis enable us to devise a lazy online algorithm that varies transmission times according to backlog. We show that this lazy schedule is significantly more energy-efficient compared to a deterministic (fixed transmission time) schedule that guarantees queue stability for the same range of arrival rates.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2002.801419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026006","","Energy efficiency;Optimal scheduling;Wireless sensor networks;Power control;Delay;Algorithm design and analysis;Wireless LAN;Batteries;Signal processing;Interference","","397","9","21","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, NR quality assessment is feasible only when prior knowledge about the types of image distortion is available. This research aims to develop NR quality measurement algorithms for JPEG compressed images. First, we established a JPEG image database and subjective experiments were conducted on the database. We show that Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which requires the reference images, is a poor indicator of subjective quality. Therefore, tuning an NR measurement model towards PSNR is not an appropriate approach in designing NR quality metrics. Furthermore, we propose a computational and memory efficient NR quality assessment model for JPEG images.

For each macroblock (MB), the initial search is performed only once at the beginning in order to find a good starting point for the follow-up refined local search. By doing so, unnecessary intermediate search and the risk of being trapped into local minimum matching error points could be greatly reduced in long search case. For the initial search stage, an adaptive rood pattern (ARP) is proposed, and the ARP's size is dynamically determined for each MB, based on the available motion vectors (MVs) of the neighboring MBs. In the refined local search stage, a unit-size rood pattern (URP) is exploited repeatedly, and unrestrictedly, until the final MV is found. To further speed up the search, zero-motion prejudgment (ZMP) is incorporated in our method, which is particularly beneficial to those video sequences containing small motion contents. Extensive experiments conducted based on the MPEG-4 Verification Model (VM) encoding platform show that the search speed of our proposed ARPS-ZMP is about two to three times faster than that of the diamond search (DS), and our method even achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) particularly for those video sequences containing large and/or complex motion contents.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.806251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176932","","Motion estimation;Video sequences;MPEG 4 Standard;Virtual manufacturing;PSNR;Video coding;Transform coding;Computer errors;Encoding;Video compression","","394","10","23","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is particularly true for the wide bandgap devices. In this paper we review the various trapping phenomena observed in SiC- and GaN-based FETs that contribute to compromised power performance. For both of these material systems, trapping effects associated with both the surface and with the layers underlying the active channel have been identified. The measurement techniques utilized to identify these traps and some of the steps taken to minimize their effects, such as modified buffer layer designs and surface passivation, are described. Since similar defect-related phenomena were addressed during the development of the GaAs technology, relevant GaAs work is briefly summarized.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.1021569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021569","","Gallium nitride;Silicon carbide;FETs;Microwave devices;Gallium arsenide;Power generation;Photonic band gap;Measurement techniques;Buffer layers;Passivation","","393","4","73","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ML estimator is optimized in a single step, as opposed to other estimators that are optimized separately in relative time-delay and source location estimations. For the multisource case, we propose and demonstrate an efficient alternating projection procedure based on sequential iterative search on single-source parameters. The proposed algorithm is shown to yield superior performance over other suboptimal techniques, including the wideband MUSIC and the two-step least-squares methods, and is efficient with respect to the derived Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). From the CRB analysis, we find that better source location estimates can be obtained for high-frequency signals than low-frequency signals. In addition, large range estimation error results when the source signal is unknown, but such unknown parameter does not have much impact on angle estimation. In some applications, the locations of some sensors may be unknown and must be estimated. The proposed method is extended to estimate the range from a source to an unknown sensor location. After a number of source-location frames, the location of the uncalibrated sensor can be determined based on a least-squares unknown sensor location estimator.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.800420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1018778","","Maximum likelihood estimation;Wideband;Sensor arrays;Multiple signal classification;Narrowband;Signal processing algorithms;Acoustic sensors;Position measurement;Acoustic arrays;Radar tracking","","391","33","30","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, despite numerous studies on trust and reputation systems, few have taken studies across disciplines to provide an integrated account of these concepts and their relationships.

The comparison is done on, the basis of: (1) major hardware components required; (2) operating region; and (3) energy output due to a defined wind function using the characteristics of a practical wind turbine. Although a fixed speed system is more simple and reliable, it severely limits the energy output of a wind turbine. In case of variable speed systems, comparison shows that using a wound rotor induction machine of similar rating can significantly enhance energy capture. This comes about due to the ability to operate with rated torque even at supersynchronous speeds; power is then generated out of the rotor as well as the stator. Moreover, with rotor side control, the voltage rating of the power devices and DC bus capacitor bank is reduced. The size of the line side inductor also decreased. Results are presented to show the substantial advantages of the doubly fed system.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2002.801993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033974","","Wind power generation;Wounds;Rotors;Induction machines;Wind turbines;Wind energy;Control systems;Hardware;Power system reliability;Energy capture","","387","1","15","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It aims to identify a set of reference signatures (also known as endmembers) that can be used to model the reflectance spectrum at each pixel of the original image. Thus, the modeling is carried out as a linear combination of a finite number of ground components. Although spectral mixture models have proved to be appropriate for the purpose of large hyperspectral dataset subpixel analysis, few methods are available in the literature for the extraction of appropriate endmembers in spectral unmixing. Most approaches have been designed from a spectroscopic viewpoint and, thus, tend to neglect the existing spatial correlation between pixels. This paper presents a new automated method that performs unsupervised pixel purity determination and endmember extraction from multidimensional datasets; this is achieved by using both spatial and spectral information in a combined manner. The method is based on mathematical morphology, a classic image processing technique that can be applied to the spectral domain while being able to keep its spatial characteristics. The proposed methodology is evaluated through a specifically designed framework that uses both simulated and real hyperspectral data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.802494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046852","","Multidimensional systems;Morphological operations;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Image analysis;Spectral analysis;Reflectivity;Pixel;Data analysis;Spectroscopy","","387","27","54","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce the concept of routing indices (RIs), which allow nodes to forward queries to neighbors that are more likely to have answers. If a node cannot answer a query, it forwards the query to a subset of its neighbors, based on its local RI, rather than by selecting neighbors at random or by flooding the network by forwarding the query to all neighbors. We present three RI schemes: the compound, the hop-count, and the exponential routing indices. We evaluate their performance via simulations, and find that RIs can improve performance by one or two orders of magnitude vs. a flooding-based system, and by up to 100% vs. a random forwarding system. We also discuss the tradeoffs between the different RI schemes and highlight the effects of key design variables on system performance.","1063-6927","0-7695-1585-1","10.1109/ICDCS.2002.1022239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022239","","Routing;Peer to peer computing;System performance;Distributed computing;Robustness;Costs;Web search;Search engines;Computer hacking","","386","7","26","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these problems, the ready-to-send and clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) dialogue has been proposed in the literature. However, MAC schemes using only the RTS/CTS dialogue cannot completely solve the hidden and the exposed terminal problems, as pure ""packet sensing"" MAC schemes are not safe even in fully connected networks. We propose a new MAC protocol, termed the dual busy tone multiple access (DBTMA) scheme. The operation of the DBTMA protocol is based on the RTS packet and two narrow-bandwidth, out-of-band busy tones. With the use of the RTS packet and the receive busy tone, which is set up by the receiver, our scheme completely solves the hidden- and the exposed-terminal problems. The busy tone, which is set up by the transmitter, provides protection for the RTS packets, increasing the probability of successful RTS reception and, consequently, increasing the throughput. This paper outlines the operation rules of the DBTMA scheme and analyzes its performance. Simulation results are also provided to support the analytical results. It is concluded that the DBTMA protocol is superior to other schemes that rely on the RTS/CTS dialogue on a single channel or to those that rely on a single busy tone. As a point of reference, the DBTMA scheme out-performs FAMA-NCS by 20-40% in our simulations using the network topologies borrowed from the FAMA-NCS paper. In an ad hoc network with a large coverage area, DBTMA achieves performance gain of 140% over FAMA-NCS and performance gain of 20% over RI-BTMA.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2002.1010617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1010617","","Access control;Ad hoc networks;Access protocols;Performance gain;Media Access Protocol;Transmitters;Protection;Throughput;Performance analysis;Analytical models","","385","11","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes performance control of a Web server using classical feedback control theory. We use feedback control theory to achieve overload protection, performance guarantees, and service differentiation in the presence of load unpredictability. We show that feedback control theory offers a promising analytic foundation for providing service differentiation and performance guarantees. We demonstrate how a general Web server may be modeled for purposes of performance control, present the equivalents of sensors and actuators, formulate a simple feedback loop, describe how it can leverage on real-time scheduling and feedback-control theories to achieve per-class response-time and throughput guarantees, and evaluate the efficacy of the scheme on an experimental testbed using the most popular Web server, Apache. Experimental results indicate that control-theoretic techniques offer a sound way of achieving desired performance in performance-critical Internet applications.

Whether the promise of BWA will materialize depends on its appeal to telecom operators from the perspective of deployment economics, where the critical factor is the ease of installation of broadband wireless subscriber units.

The proposed decision model enables optimal inspection and replacement decision in order to balance the cost engaged by failure and unavailability on an infinite horizon. Two maintenance decision variables are considered: the preventive replacement threshold and the inspection schedule based on the system state. In order to assess the performance of the proposed maintenance structure, a mathematical model for the maintained system cost is developed using regenerative and semi-regenerative processes theory. Numerical experiments show that the s-expected maintenance cost rate on an infinite horizon can be minimized by a joint optimization of the replacement threshold and the a periodic inspection times. The proposed maintenance structure performs better than classical preventive maintenance policies which can be treated as particular cases. Using the proposed maintenance structure, a well-adapted strategy can automatically be selected for the maintenance decision-maker depending on the characteristics of the wear process and on the different unit costs. Even limit cases can be reached: for example, in the case of expensive inspection and costly preventive replacement, the optimal policy becomes close to a systematic periodic replacement policy. Most of the classical maintenance strategies (periodic inspection/replacement policy, systematic periodic replacement, corrective policy) can be emulated by adopting some specific inspection scheduling rules and replacement thresholds. In a more general way, the proposed maintenance structure shows its adaptability to different possible characteristics of the maintained single-unit system.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2002.1011518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1011518","","Inspection;Cost function;Mathematical model;Chromium;Infinite horizon;Preventive maintenance;Predictive maintenance;Time measurement;Random variables;Shape","","369","1","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, identifying good transfer functions is difficult enough in 1D, let alone 2D or 3D.

We present a set of direct manipulation widgets that make specifying such transfer functions intuitive and convenient.

These models show considerable promise as a basis for segmenting and interpreting images. One of the drawbacks of the approach is, however, the need to establish a set of dense correspondences between all members of a set of training shapes. Often this is achieved by locating a set of ""landmarks"" manually on each training image, which is time consuming and subjective in two dimensions and almost impossible in three dimensions. We describe how shape models can be built automatically by posing the correspondence problem as one of finding the parameterization for each shape in the training set. We select the set of parameterizations that build the ""best"" model. We define ""best"" as that which minimizes the description length of the training set, arguing that this leads to models with good compactness, specificity and generalization ability. We show how a set of shape parameterizations can be represented and manipulated in order to build a minimum description length model. Results are given for several different training sets of two-dimensional boundaries, showing that the proposed method constructs better models than other approaches including manual landmarking-the current gold standard.

Computer simulation shows that for four-input and four-output systems transmitting data at 4 Mb/s over a 1.25 MHz channel, the required signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for 10% and 1% word error rates (WER) are 10.5 dB and 13.8 dB, respectively, when each codeword contains 500 information bits and the channel's Doppler frequency is 40 Hz (corresponding normalized frequency: 0.9%). Increasing the number of the receive antennas improves the system performance. When the number or receive antennas is increased from four to eight, the required SNRs for 10% and 1% WER are reduced to 4 dB and 6 dB, respectively. Therefore, MIMO-OFDM is a promising technique for highly spectrally efficient wideband transmission.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033009","","Wireless communication;Signal detection;Channel estimation;Receiving antennas;MIMO;OFDM;Wideband;Space time codes;Decoding;Intersymbol interference","","364","9","21","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although Bloom filters allow false positives, for many applications the space savings outweigh this drawback when the probability of an error is sufficiently low. We introduce compressed Bloom filters, which improve performance when the Bloom filter is passed as a message, and its transmission size is a limiting factor. For example, Bloom filters have been suggested as a means for sharing Web cache information. In this setting, proxies do not share the exact contents of their caches, but instead periodically broadcast Bloom filters representing their caches. By using compressed Bloom filters, proxies can reduce the number of bits broadcast, the false positive probability, and/or the amount of computation per lookup. The cost is the processing time for compression and decompression, which can use simple arithmetic coding, and more memory use at the proxies, which utilize the larger uncompressed form of the Bloom filter.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2002.803864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041067","","Data structures;Information filtering;Information filters;Broadcasting;Protocols;Digital filters;Costs;Arithmetic;Computer networks;Information theory","","360","48","18","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A TSK-type recurrent fuzzy network for dynamic systems processing by neural network and genetic algorithms","Chia-Feng Juang","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan",IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,"7 Aug 2002","2002","10","2","155","170","In this paper, a TSK-type recurrent fuzzy network (TRFN) structure is proposed. The proposal calls for the design of TRFN by either neural network or genetic algorithms depending on the learning environment. A recurrent fuzzy network is described which develops from a series of recurrent fuzzy if-then rules with TSK-type consequent parts. The recurrent property comes from feeding the internal variables, derived from fuzzy firing strengths, back to both the network input and output layers. In this configuration, each internal variable is responsible for memorizing the temporal history of its corresponding fuzzy rule. The internal variable is also combined with external input variables in each rule's consequence, which shows an increase in network learning ability. TRFN design under different learning environments is next advanced. For problems where supervised training data is directly available, TRFN with supervised learning (TRFN-S) is proposed, and a neural network (NN) learning approach is adopted for TRFN-S design. An online learning algorithm with concurrent structure and parameter learning is proposed. With flexibility of partition in the precondition part, and outcome of TSK-type, the TRFN-S displays both small network size and high learning accuracy. For problems where gradient information for NN learning is costly to obtain or unavailable, like reinforcement learning, TRFN with Genetic learning (TRFN-G) is put forward. The precondition parts of TRFN-G are also partitioned in a flexible way, and all free parameters are designed concurrently by genetic algorithm. Owing to the well-designed network structure of TRFN, TRFN-G, like TRFN-S, is characterized by high learning accuracy. To demonstrate the superior properties of TRFN, TRFN-S is applied to dynamic system identification and TRFN-G to dynamic system control. By comparing the results to other types of recurrent networks and design configurations, the efficiency of TRFN is verified.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.995118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995118","","Fuzzy systems;Neural networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Genetic algorithms;Proposals;History;Input variables;Training data;Supervised learning;Partitioning algorithms","","360","","55","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is a tendency towards operation-based merging because of its increased expressiveness. Another tendency is to try to define merge techniques that are as general, accurate, scalable, and customizable as possible, so that they can be used in any phase in the software life-cycle and detect as many conflicts as possible.

Networking, vol.1, p.397-413, 1993). While active queue management can potentially reduce packet loss rates in the Internet, we show that current techniques are ineffective in preventing high loss rates. The inherent problem with these algorithms is that they use queue lengths as the indicator of the severity of congestion. In light of this observation, a fundamentally different active queue management algorithm, called BLUE, is proposed, implemented and evaluated. BLUE uses packet loss and link idle events to manage congestion. Using both simulation and controlled experiments, BLUE is shown to perform significantly better than RED, both in terms of packet loss rates and buffer size requirements in the network. As an extension to BLUE, a novel technique based on Bloom filters (see Bloom, B., Commun. ACM, vol.13, no.7, p.422-6, 1970) is described for enforcing fairness among a large number of flows. In particular, we propose and evaluate stochastic fair BLUE (SFB), a queue management algorithm which can identify and rate-limit nonresponsive flows using a very small amount of state information.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2002.801399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026008","","Internet;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Bandwidth;Size control;Filters;Stochastic processes;Loss measurement;IP networks;Computer science","","358","2","34","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper reviews some of the technical reasons behind the wide-spread acceptance of Raman technology. Distributed Raman amplifiers improve the noise figure and reduce the nonlinear penalty of fiber systems, allowing for longer amplifier spans, higher bit rates, closer channel spacing, and operation near the zero-dispersion wavelength. Lumped or discrete Raman amplifiers are primarily used to increase the capacity of fiber-optic networks, opening up new wavelength windows for wavelength-division multiplexing such as the 1300 nm, 1400 nm, or short-wavelength S-band. As an example, using a cascade of S-band lumped amplifiers, a 20-channel, OC-192 system is shown that propagates over 867 km of standard, single-mode fiber. Raman amplifiers provide a simple single platform for long-haul and ultralong-haul amplifier needs and, therefore, should see a wide range of deployment in the next few years.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2002.1016358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016358","","Stimulated emission;Optical fiber amplifiers;Optical amplifiers;Optical fiber devices;Distributed amplifiers;Operational amplifiers;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Commercialization;Nonlinear optical devices;Noise figure","","358","14","38","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The channel parameters are the attenuations and delays incurred by the signal echoes along the propagation paths. Time-hopping modulation with binary symbols is assumed. The estimation method is based on the maximum-likelihood criterion and is applied to two different scenarios: either with known symbols (DA estimation) or with unknown symbols (NDA estimation). The effects of the estimation errors on the performance of a RAKE receiver are assessed by simulation by comparing the receiver bit-error rate with either perfect channel estimates or imperfect estimates as obtained from the proposed algorithms. The results show that the degradations are tolerable as long as the number of users is limited. They also show that the DA method has an edge over the NDA in that it can handle a larger number of users for a fixed degradation. The number of users that can be accommodated in practice is found for some values of the system parameters.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.805053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097829","","Channel estimation;Ultra wideband technology;Degradation;Interference;Attenuation;Propagation delay;Maximum likelihood estimation;Estimation error;Fading;Multipath channels","","354","17","14","IEEE","16 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among the factors complicating this task is the need to make the decision within the framework of an enterprise's strategic objectives and organizational structure while considering and integrating financial and strategic benefits of each project. The paper discusses the use of the ANP, a general form of Saaty's analytic hierarchy process, as a model to evaluate the value of competing R&D project proposals. A generic ANP model developed by the authors, which includes in its decision levels the actors involved in the decision, the stages of research, categories of metrics, and individual metrics, is presented.

Many evolving low-power sensor network scenarios need to have high spatial density to enable reliable operation in the face of component node failures as well as to facilitate high spatial localization of events of interest. This induces a high level of network data redundancy, where spatially proximal sensor readings are highly correlated. We propose a new way of removing this redundancy in a completely distributed manner, i.e., without the sensors needing to talk, to one another. Our constructive framework for this problem is dubbed DISCUS (distributed source coding using syndromes) and is inspired by fundamental concepts from information theory. We review the main ideas, provide illustrations, and give the intuition behind the theory that enables this framework.We present a new domain of collaborative information communication and processing through the framework on distributed source coding.

To analyze structural and functional changes in human cells and solid tumors following exposure to nsPEF, we utilized flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. We provide further support for the hypothesis that as the pulse duration is decreased, there is a lower incidence of electric field interactions at the plasma membrane and a higher incidence of interactions with intracellular structures. The nsPEF effects are pulse duration/electric field intensity-dependent and energy density- or temperature-independent.

These channels model the effects of inter-symbol interference (ISI), co-channel interference (CCI), and noise. A low-order autoregressive model approximates the MIMO channel variation and facilitates tracking via a Kalman filter. Hard decisions to aid Kalman tracking come from a MIMO finite-length minimum-mean-squared-error decision-feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE), which performs the equalization task. Since the optimum DFE for a wide range of channels produces decisions with a delay /spl Delta/ > 0, the Kalman filter tracks the channel with a delay. A channel prediction module bridges the time gap between the channel estimates produced by the Kalman filter and those needed for the DFE adaptation. The proposed algorithm offers good tracking behavior for multiuser fading ISI channels at the expense of higher complexity than conventional adaptive algorithms. Applications include synchronous multiuser detection of independent transmitters, as well as coordinated transmission through many transmitter/receiver antennas, for increased data rate.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.995063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995063","","Fading;Decision feedback equalizers;MIMO;Intersymbol interference;Delay;Transmitters;Frequency;Interchannel interference;Radiofrequency interference;Kalman filters","","349","4","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With our novel growing hierarchical SOM (GHSOM) we address both limitations. The GHSOM is an artificial neural-network model with hierarchical architecture composed of independent growing SOMs. The motivation was to provide a model that adapts its architecture during its unsupervised training process according to the particular requirements of the input data. Furthermore, by providing a global orientation of the independently growing maps in the individual layers of the hierarchy, navigation across branches is facilitated. The benefits of this novel neural network are a problem-dependent architecture and the intuitive representation of hierarchical relations in the data. This is especially appealing in explorative data mining applications, allowing the inherent structure of the data to unfold in a highly intuitive fashion.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.804221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1058070","","Data analysis;Data mining;Space technology;Pattern recognition;Unsupervised learning;Navigation;Neural networks;Functional analysis;Pattern analysis;Multidimensional systems","","347","","30","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A new class of single state models is defined in which presliding is elastoplastic: under loading, frictional displacement is first purely elastic and then transitions to plastic. The new model class is demonstrated to substantially reduce drift while preserving the favorable properties of existing models (e.g., dissipativity) and to provide a comparable match to experimental data.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2002.1000274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000274","","Friction;Hysteresis;Plastics;Predictive models;Stability analysis;Sliding mode control;Displacement control;Velocity control;Mechanical systems;Servomechanisms","","347","2","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography. But, beyond this application, it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging. To date, only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low-frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography. The proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve Young's modulus image reconstruction. The process is a combination of several ideas well-known in ultrasonic imaging: ultra-fast imaging, multisynthetic aperture beamforming, 1-D speckle tracking, and compound imaging. Classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128. The beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures. Comparison of successive frames by a classical 1-D speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams. The variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification, thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2002.1041078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041078","","Motion estimation;Ultrasonic imaging;Array signal processing;Speckle;Two dimensional displays;Reflectivity;Humans;Displacement measurement;Vibration measurement;Ultrasonic variables measurement","Algorithms;Elasticity;Equipment Design;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Enhancement;Models, Statistical;Motion;Phantoms, Imaging;Quality Control;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stress, Mechanical;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography;Video Recording;Video Recording","346","22","31","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The weaknesses of classical watermarking methods to geometrical distortions are outlined first. Geometrical distortions can be decomposed into two classes: global transformations such as rotations and translations and local transformations such as the StirMark attack. An overview of existing self-synchronizing schemes is then presented. Theses schemes can use periodical properties of the mark, invariant properties of transforms, template insertion, or information provided by the original image to counter geometrical distortions. Thereafter, a new class of watermarking schemes using the image content is presented. We propose an embedding and detection scheme where the mark is bound with a content descriptor defined by salient points. Three different types of feature points are studied and their robustness to geometrical transformations is evaluated to develop an enhanced detector. The embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a Delaunay tessellation on the set of points. The mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation. The detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles. The performance of the presented scheme is evaluated after JPEG compression, geometrical attack and transformations. Results show that the fact that the scheme is robust to these different manipulations.

Weather forecasts are a key input when the ANN is used for forecasting. This paper investigates the use of weather ensemble predictions in the application of ANNs to load forecasting for lead times from one to ten days ahead. A weather ensemble prediction consists of multiple scenarios for a weather variable. We use these scenarios to produce multiple scenarios for load. The results show that the average of the load scenarios is a more accurate load forecast than that produced using traditional weather forecasts. We use the load scenarios to estimate the uncertainty in the ANN load forecast. This compares favorably with estimates based solely on historical load forecast errors.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2002.800906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033703","","Neural networks;Load forecasting;Weather forecasting;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Random variables;Uncertainty;Economic forecasting;Load modeling;Linear regression","","344","","29","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way. The DDMCMC paradigm adopts seven parametric and nonparametric image models for intensity and color at various regions. We test the DDMCMC paradigm extensively on both color and gray-level images and some results are reported in this paper.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.1000239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000239","","Image segmentation;Monte Carlo methods","","342","18","31","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reasons are offset and drift components in the acquired feedback signals, voltage distortions caused by the nonlinear behavior of the switching converter, and the increased sensitivity against model parameter mismatch. New modeling and identification techniques are proposed to overcome these problems. A pure integrator is employed for stator flux estimation which permits high-estimation bandwidth. Compensation of the drift components is done by offset identification. The nonlinear voltage distortions are corrected by a self-adjusting inverter model. A further improvement is a novel method for online adaptation of the stator resistance. Experiments demonstrate smooth steady-state operation and high dynamic performance at extremely low speed.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2002.800779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019966","","Machine vector control;Induction motors;Inverters;Parameter estimation;Voltage;Nonlinear distortion;Stators;Induction motor drives;Feedback;Switching converters","","342","1","13","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These MOSFETs are believed to be the smallest double-gate transistors ever fabricated. Excellent short-channel performance is observed in devices with a wide range of gate lengths (10/spl sim/105 nm). The observed short-channel behavior outperforms any reported single-gate silicon MOSFETs. Due to the [110] channel crystal orientation, hole mobility in the fabricated p-channel FinFET exceeds greatly that in a traditional planar MOSFET. At 105 nm gate length, the p-channel FinFET shows a record-high transconductance of 633 /spl mu/S//spl mu/m at a V/sub dd/ of 1.2 V.

Despite various optimizations, many routing messages are propagated unnecessarily. We propose a gossiping-based approach, where each node forwards a message with some probability, to reduce the overhead of the routing protocols. Gossiping exhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions, the gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node gets the message; in the remaining executions, a substantial fraction of the nodes gets the message. The fraction of executions in which most nodes get the message depends on the gossiping probability and the topology of the network. In the networks we have considered, using gossiping probability between 0.6 and 0.8 suffices to ensure that almost every node gets the message in almost every execution. For large networks, this simple gossiping protocol uses up to 35% fewer messages than flooding, with improved performance. Gossiping can also be combined with various optimizations of flooding to yield further benefits. Simulations show that adding gossiping to AODV results in significant performance improvement, even in networks as small as 150 nodes. We expect that the improvement should be even more significant in larger networks.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019424","","Routing protocols;Floods;Ad hoc networks;Global Positioning System;Computer science;Network topology;Spread spectrum communication;Power supplies;Wireless sensor networks;Bandwidth","","339","1","22","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The CSF approach is a more realistic and flexible framework for modeling imperfect competition than other models for three reasons. First, the models include as a special case the Cournot conjecture that rivals will not change production if prices change; thus, the CSF framework is more general. Second, Cournot models cannot be used when price elasticity of demand is zero, but the proposed models can. Third, unlike supply function equilibrium models, CSF equilibria can be calculated for large transmission networks. Existence and uniqueness properties for prices and profits are reported.

The new algorithm is based on the consistent use of the least trimmed squares (LTS) approach in all phases of the operation. Convergence is proved and an efficient implementation is discussed. TrICP is fast, applicable to overlaps under 50%, robust to erroneous measurements and shape defects, and has easy-to-set parameters. ICP is a special case of TrICP when the overlap parameter is 100%.

A constructive design method is developed based on an effective coupling of a new parameter separation technique and the tool of adding a power integrator, leading to C/sup 0/ adaptive regulators with minimal parameterization. Indeed, the dimension of the proposed dynamic compensator can always be one, irrespective of the number of unknown parameters.

This method exploits the colocation of the downstream transmitters and of the upstream receivers, in order to achieve far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellation and perform multiuser transmission optimization. The performance improvements are particularly pronounced in environments with strong FEXT such as in very high-speed DSL. Discrete multitone is employed for each user with additional constraints on the cyclic prefix length and with the assumption of block-synchronized transmission and reception for downstream and upstream transmission correspondingly. Within each tone, upstream crosstalk is removed by multiple-input-multiple-output decision feedback at the receiving side, while downstream crosstalk is eliminated by analogous preprocessing at the transmitting side. Additionally, the issue of transmission energy allocation in frequency and among users is addressed. Assuming frequency-division duplexing, the corresponding optimization problem is formulated and solved via convex programming both for a fixed upstream-downstream band plan and for a dynamically programmable band plan. The case of power backoff as a means to reduce the impact of crosstalk on alien systems is also treated. Interestingly, the performance of the proposed methods is shown to be very close to known information theory bounds.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.1007389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1007389","","DSL;Crosstalk;Central office;Optical network units;Optical transmitters;Optical receivers;Optimization methods;MIMO;Feedback;Radio spectrum management","","331","77","51","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on computed tomography (CT) scans, the following steps are performed. 1) The volume data is preprocessed and the vessels are segmented. 2) The skeleton of the vessels is determined and transformed into a graph enabling a geometrical and structural shape analysis. Using this information the different intrahepatic vessel systems are identified automatically. 3) Based on the structural analysis of the branches of the portal vein, their vascular territories are approximated with different methods. These methods are compared and validated anatomically by means of corrosion casts of human livers. 4) Vessels are visualized with graphics primitives fitted to the skeleton to provide smooth visualizations without aliasing artifacts.

A video shot is defined as a series of interrelated consecutive frames taken contiguously by a single camera and representing a continuous action in time and space. As such, shots are considered to be the primitives for higher level content analysis, indexing, and classification. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we analyze the shot-boundary detection problem in detail and identify major issues that need to be considered in order to solve this problem successfully. Then, we present a conceptual solution to the shot-boundary detection problem in which all issues identified in the previous step are considered. This solution is provided in the form of a statistical detector that is based on minimization of the average detection-error probability. We model the required statistical functions using a robust metric for visual content discontinuities (based on motion compensation) and take into account all (a priori) knowledge that we found relevant to shot-boundary detection. This knowledge includes the shot-length distribution, visual discontinuity patterns at shot boundaries, and characteristic temporal changes of visual features around a boundary. Major advantages of the proposed detector are its robust and sequence-independent performance, while there is also the possibility to detect different types of shot boundaries simultaneously. We demonstrate the performance of our detector regarding two most widely used types of shot boundaries: hard cuts and dissolves.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.988656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988656","","Detectors;Gunshot detection systems;Robustness;Video sequences;Content based retrieval;Cameras;Indexing;Probability;Motion compensation;Motion detection","","326","11","31","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An analytical modeling technique is developed to characterize an uncooperative two-level hierarchical caching system where the least recently used (LRU) algorithm is locally run at each cache. With this modeling technique, we are able to identify a characteristic time for each cache, which plays a fundamental role in understanding the caching processes. In particular, a cache can be viewed roughly as a low-pass filter with its cutoff frequency equal to the inverse of the characteristic time. Documents with access frequencies lower than this cutoff frequency have good chances to pass through the cache without cache hits. This viewpoint enables us to take any branch of the cache tree as a tandem of low-pass filters at different cutoff frequencies, which further results in the finding of two fundamental design principles. Finally, to demonstrate how to use the principles to guide the caching algorithm design, we propose a cooperative hierarchical Web caching architecture based on these principles. Both model-based and real trace simulation studies show that the proposed cooperative architecture results in more than 50% memory saving and substantial central processing unit (CPU) power saving for the management and update of cache entries compared with the traditional uncooperative hierarchical caching architecture.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.801752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031903","","Algorithm design and analysis;Cutoff frequency;Network servers;Low pass filters;Central Processing Unit;Delay;Internet;Analytical models;Service oriented architecture;Memory management","","326","3","17","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A common measure of the attained diagonalization of the set is the weighted least-squares (WLS) criterion. However, most well-known algorithms are restricted to finding an orthogonal diagonalizing matrix, relying on a whitening phase for the nonorthogonal factor. Often, such an approach implies unbalanced weighting, which can result in degraded performance. We propose an iterative alternating-directions algorithm for minimizing the WLS criterion with respect to a general (not necessarily orthogonal) diagonalizing matrix. Under some mild assumptions, we prove weak convergence in the sense that the norm of parameters update is guaranteed to fall below any arbitrarily small threshold within a finite number of iterations. We distinguish between Hermitian and symmetrical problems. Using BSS simulations results, we demonstrate the improvement in estimating the mixing matrix, resulting from the relaxation of the orthogonality restriction.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.1011195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1011195","","Source separation;Independent component analysis;Blind source separation;Symmetric matrices;Matrix decomposition;Least squares approximation;Iterative algorithms;Degradation;Convergence;Instruments","","326","5","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, human faces are very similar in structure with minor differences from person to person. They are actually within one class of ""human face"". Furthermore, lighting conditions change, while facial expressions and pose variations further complicate the face recognition task as one of the difficult problems in pattern analysis. This paper proposes a novel concept: namely, that faces can be recognized using a line edge map (LEM). The LEM, a compact face feature, is generated for face coding and recognition. A thorough investigation of the proposed concept is conducted which covers all aspects of human face recognition, i.e. face recognition under (1) controlled/ideal conditions and size variations, (2) varying lighting conditions, (3) varying facial expressions, and (4) varying pose. The system performance is also compared with the eigenface method, one of the best face recognition techniques, and with reported experimental results of other methods. A face pre-filtering technique is proposed to speed up the search process. It is a very encouraging to find that the proposed face recognition technique has performed better than the eigenface method in most of the comparison experiments. This research demonstrates that the LEM, together with the proposed generic line-segment Hausdorff distance measure, provides a new method for face coding and recognition.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1008383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1008383","","Face recognition;Humans;Image sequences;Pattern recognition;Lighting control;Access control;Biometrics;Biomedical monitoring;Law enforcement;Pattern analysis","","323","9","49","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The flat interface nerve electrode (FINE) reshapes the nerve into a flat geometry to increase the surface area and move central axon populations close to the surface. The electrode was implanted acutely on the sciatic nerve of eight cats. The FINE can significantly reshape the nerve and fascicles (p<0.0001) while maintaining the same total nerve cross-sectional area. The stimulation thresholds were 2.89 nC for pulse amplitude modulation and 10.2 nC for pulsewidth modulation. Monopolar, square-pulse stimulation with single contacts on the FINE selectively recruited each of the four main branches of the sciatic nerve. Simultaneous stimulation with two contacts produced moments about the ankle joint that were a combination of the moments produced by the individual contacts when stimulated separately.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2002.806840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178100","","Electrodes;Nerve fibers;Contacts;Shape;Recruitment;Pulse modulation;Amplitude modulation;Spirals;Engine cylinders;Safety","Anatomy, Cross-Sectional;Animals;Ankle Joint;Ankle Joint;Cats;Electric Stimulation;Electric Stimulation;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Electrodes, Implanted;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscle, Skeletal;Peripheral Nerves;Recruitment, Neurophysiological;Reproducibility of Results;Sciatic Nerve;Sciatic Nerve;Sensitivity and Specificity","323","10","42","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The border gateway protocol (BGP) is currently the only interdomain routing protocol deployed in the Internet. BGP does not solve a shortest paths problem since any interdomain protocol is required to allow policy-based metrics to override distance-based metrics and enable autonomous systems to independently define their routing policies with little or no global coordination. It is then natural to ask if BGP can be viewed as a distributed algorithm for solving some fundamental problem. We introduce the stable paths problem and show that BGP can be viewed as a distributed algorithm for solving this problem. Unlike a shortest path tree, such a solution does not represent a global optimum, but rather an equilibrium point in which each node is assigned its local optimum. We study the stable paths problem using a derived structure called a dispute wheel, representing conflicting routing policies at various nodes. We show that if no dispute wheel can be constructed, then there exists a unique solution for the stable paths problem. We define the simple path vector protocol (SPVP), a distributed algorithm for solving the stable paths problem. SPVP is intended to capture the dynamic behavior of BGP at an abstract level. If SPVP converges, then the resulting state corresponds to a stable paths solution. If there is no solution, then SPVP always diverges. In fact, SPVP can even diverge when a solution exists. We show that SPVP will converge to the unique solution of an instance of the stable paths problem if no dispute wheel exists.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.993304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993304","","Routing protocols;Distributed algorithms;Shortest path problem;Internet;Wheels;Safety;Electronic mail;Robustness","","323","2","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, speckle reduction is a prerequisite for many SAR image processing tasks. In this paper, we develop a speckle reduction algorithm by fusing the wavelet Bayesian denoising technique with Markov-random-field-based image regularization. Wavelet coefficients are modeled independently and identically by a two-state Gaussian mixture model, while their spatial dependence is characterized by a Markov random field imposed on the hidden state of Gaussian mixtures. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate hyperparameters and specify the mixture model, and the iterated-conditional-modes method is implemented to optimize the state configuration. The noise-free wavelet coefficients are finally estimated by a shrinkage function based on local weighted averaging of the Bayesian estimator. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms standard wavelet denoising techniques in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio and the equivalent-number-of-looks measures in most cases. It also achieves better performance than the refined Lee filter.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.802473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1105905","","Speckle;Noise reduction;Markov random fields;Synthetic aperture radar;Bayesian methods;Wavelet coefficients;Image processing;Expectation-maximization algorithms;State estimation;Optimization methods","","319","2","51","IEEE","16 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because channel state information is impossible to be known perfectly at the transmitter in practical wireless systems, we design, in this paper, an optimal multiantenna transmitter based on the knowledge of mean values of the underlying channels. Our optimal transmitter design turns out to be an eigen-beamformer with multiple beams pointing to orthogonal directions along the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix of the estimated channel at the transmitter and with proper power loading across beams. The optimality pertains to minimizing an upper bound on the symbol error rate, which leads to better performance than maximizing the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. Coupled with orthogonal space-time block codes, two-directional eigen-beamforming emerges as a more attractive choice than conventional one-directional beamforming with uniformly improved performance, without rate reduction, and without essential increase in complexity. With multiple receive antennas and reasonably good feedback quality, the two-directional eigen-beamformer is also capable of achieving the best possible performance in a large range of transmit-power-to-noise ratios, without a rate penalty.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.803355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033689","","Transmitters;Block codes;Feedback;Channel state information;Upper bound;Error analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Optical coupling;Array signal processing;Receiving antennas","","316","30","20","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our performance study shows that gSpan substantially outperforms previous algorithms, sometimes by an order of magnitude.","","0-7695-1754-4","10.1109/ICDM.2002.1184038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184038","","Tree graphs;Testing;Computer science;Graphics;Data mining;Data structures;Kernel;Chemical compounds;Itemsets;Costs","","315","8","8","IEEE","10 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Platinum is the most commonly used material for neural stimulation. Two other materials have been considered: iridium oxide and titanium nitride. This study directly compared the electrical characteristics of iridium oxide and titanium nitride by fabricating silicon substrate probes that differed only in the material used to form the electrode. Electrochemical measurements indicated that iridium oxide had lower impedance and a higher charge storage capacity than titanium nitride, suggesting better performance as a stimulating electrode. Direct measurement of the electrode potential in response to a biphasic current pulse confirmed that iridium oxide uses less voltage to transfer the same amount of charge, therefore using less power. The charge injection limit for titanium nitride was 0.87 mC/cm/sup 2/, contradicting other reports estimating that titanium nitride was capable of injecting 22 mC/cm/sup 2/. Iridium oxide charge storage was 4 mC/cm/sup 2/, which is comparable to other published values for iridium oxide. Electrode efficiency will lead to an overall more efficient and effective device.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2002.805487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159151","","In vitro;Titanium;Electrodes;Biological materials;Current measurement;Charge measurement;Pulse measurements;Platinum;Electric variables;Silicon","Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Electric Capacitance;Electric Impedance;Electric Stimulation;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Iridium;Materials Testing;Microelectrodes;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Titanium","314","1","22","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach implicitly captures biometric shape cues such as body height, width, and body-part proportions, as well as gait cues such as stride length and amount of arm swing.

The essential idea is to evolve a curve (in 2D) or a surface (in 3D) under constraints from image forces so that it clings to features of interest in an intensity image. Recent variations on this theme take into account properties of enclosed regions and allow for multiple curves or surfaces to be simultaneously represented. However, it is still unclear how to apply these techniques to images of narrow elongated structures, such as blood vessels, where intensity contrast may be low and reliable region statistics cannot be computed. To address this problem, we derive the gradient flows which maximize the rate of increase of flux of an appropriate vector field through a curve (in 2D) or a surface (in 3D). The key idea is to exploit the direction of the vector field along with its magnitude. The calculations lead to a simple and elegant interpretation which is essentially parameter free and has the same form in both dimensions. We illustrate its advantages with several level-set-based segmentations of 2D and 3D angiography images of blood vessels.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1114849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1114849","","Image segmentation;Active contours;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging;Computer vision;Statistics;Shape;Image analysis;Angiography;Image motion analysis","","312","5","41","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A separation and classification method, based on a fuzzy classifier, is developed for the analysis of the acquired PD-pulse shape signals. The result of the fuzzy classification is a cluster of signals homogeneous in terms of stochastic features of PD pulses. The classification efficiency is evaluated resorting to the PD-pulse height and phase distributions analysis. The instrumentation, and the associated classification methodology, are applied to measure and analyze PD data recorded for mica-insulated stator bars and coils, where typical defects, occurring during normal operations, were simulated. It is shown that the proposed procedure enables PD-source identification to solve the identification problems which arise, in particular, when different sources of PD are simultaneously active.

In particular we are interested in optimal paths, i.e., we want to minimize the total flight time. We propose two different formulations of the multiaircraft conflict avoidance problem as a mixed-integer linear program: in the first case only velocity changes are admissible maneuvers, in the second one only heading angle changes are allowed.

In this context, an adaptive semiparametric technique for the unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms associated with the gray levels of changed and unchanged pixels in a difference image is presented. Such a technique exploits the effectivenesses of two theoretically well-founded estimation procedures: the reduced Parzen estimate (RPE) procedure and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, thanks to the resulting estimates and to a Markov random field (MRF) approach used to model the spatial-contextual information contained in the multitemporal images considered, a change detection map is generated. The adaptive semiparametric nature of the proposed technique allows its application to different kinds of remote-sensing images.

On the defense side, current technologies are still unable to withstand large-scale attacks. The main purpose of this article is therefore twofold.

Process improvement is facilitated by the development and use of models that account for and illuminate important characteristics of the process. Iteration is a fundamental but often unaddressed feature of product development (PD) processes. Its impact is mediated by the architecture of a process, i.e., its constituent activities and their interactions. This paper integrates several important characteristics of PD processes into a single model, highlighting the effects of varying process architecture. The PD process is modeled as a network of activities that exchange deliverables. Each activity has an uncertain duration and cost, an improvement curve, and risks of rework based on changes in its inputs. A work policy governs the timing of activity execution and deliverable exchange (and thus the amount of activity concurrency). The model is analyzed via simulation, which outputs sample cost and schedule outcome distributions. Varying the process architecture input varies the output distributions. Each distribution is used with a target and an impact function to determine a risk factor. Alternative process architectures are compared, revealing opportunities to trade cost and schedule risk. Example results and applications are shown for an industrial process, the preliminary design of an uninhabited combat aerial vehicle. The model yields and reinforces several managerial insights, including: how rework cascades through a PD process, trading off cost and schedule risk, interface criticality, and occasions for iterative overlapping.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2002.806709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176870","","Product development;Research and development management;Risk analysis;Economics","","307","1","27","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, none of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has a proof of convergence to the true Pareto-optimal solutions with a wide diversity among the solutions. In this paper, we discuss why a number of earlier MOEAs do not have such properties. Based on the concept of ε-dominance, new archiving strategies are proposed that overcome this fundamental problem and provably lead to MOEAs that have both the desired convergence and distribution properties.

This GSVD-based multimicrophone algorithm can be considered to be an extension of the single-microphone signal subspace algorithms for enhancing noisy speech signals and amounts to a specific optimal filtering problem when the desired response signal cannot be observed. The optimal filter can be written as a function of the generalized singular vectors and singular values of a speech and noise data matrix. A number of symmetry properties are derived for the single-microphone and multimicrophone optimal filter, which are valid for the white noise case as well as for the colored noise case. In addition, the averaging step of some single-microphone signal subspace algorithms is examined, leading to the conclusion that this averaging operation is unnecessary and even suboptimal. For simple situations, where we consider localized sources and no multipath propagation, the GSVD-based optimal filtering technique exhibits the spatial directivity pattern of a beamformer. When comparing the noise reduction performance for realistic situations, simulations show that the GSVD-based optimal filtering technique has a better performance than standard fixed and adaptive beamforming techniques for all reverberation times and that it is more robust to deviations from the nominal situation, as, e.g., encountered in uncalibrated microphone arrays.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.801937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025586","","Speech enhancement;Colored noise;Filtering algorithms;Filters;Microphone arrays;Singular value decomposition;Degradation;Additive noise;White noise;Noise reduction","","304","2","42","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Classical approaches are based on the regulation to zero of an error function computed from the current measurement and a constant desired one. By using such an approach, it is not obvious how to introduce any constraint in the realized trajectories or to ensure the convergence for all the initial configurations. In this paper, we propose a new approach to resolve these difficulties by coupling path planning in image space and image-based control. Constraints such that the object remains in the camera field of view or the robot avoids its joint limits can be taken into account at the task planning level. Furthermore, by using this approach, current measurements always remain close to their desired value, and a control by image-based servoing ensures robustness with respect to modeling errors. The proposed method is based on the potential field approach and is applied whether the object shape and dimensions are known or not, and when the calibration parameters of the camera are well or badly estimated. Finally, real-time experimental results using an eye-in-hand robotic system are presented and confirm the validity of our approach.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2002.802218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1044366","","Path planning;Robust control;Robot vision systems;Current measurement;Cameras;Feedback control;Image resolution;Orbital robotics;Error correction;Shape","","303","","24","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first develop a model for such a transmission scheme and focus particularly on multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Using this method, we analyze the impact of time variation within a transmission block (time variation could arise both from Doppler spread of the channel and from synchronization errors). To mitigate the effects of such time variations, we propose a time-domain approach. We design ICI-mitigating block linear filters, and we examine how they are modified in the context of space-time block-coded transmissions. Our approach reduces to the familiar single-tap frequency-domain equalizer when the channel is block time invariant. Channel estimation in rapidly time-varying scenarios becomes critical, and we propose a scheme for estimating channel parameters varying within a transmission block. Along with the channel estimation scheme, we also examine the issue of pilot tone placement and show that in time-varying channels, it may be better to group pilot tones together into clumps that are equispaced onto the FFT grid; this placement technique is in contrast to the common wisdom for time-invariant channels. Finally, we provide numerical results illustrating the performance of these schemes, both for uncoded and space-time block-coded systems.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.803347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033676","","Interference;MIMO;OFDM;Time-varying channels;Channel estimation;Frequency synchronization;Time domain analysis;Nonlinear filters;Equalizers;Parameter estimation","","303","16","27","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These models implicitly incorporate certain assumptions about speckle, scene, and observed signals. In this study, the multiplicative and the product speckle models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed. This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters: the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering. It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters. Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed for optimum application of these filters in the context of nonstationary scene signals.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.803727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166598","","Speckle;Filtering theory;Estimation theory;Filters;Layout;Signal processing;Additive noise;Spatial resolution;Signal resolution;Gaussian noise","","301","","55","IEEE","22 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the case of constant time delays, the stability criteria are delay-independent; for the case of time-varying delays, the stability criteria are delay-dependent. The results obtained in this paper are less conservative than the ones reported so far in the literature and provides one more set of criteria for determining the stability of delayed neural networks.","1558-1268","","10.1109/TCSI.2002.800842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016840","","Stability analysis;Neural networks;Delay effects;Hopfield neural networks;Stability criteria;Asymptotic stability;Cellular neural networks;Artificial neural networks;Sufficient conditions;Linear matrix inequalities","","298","","27","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Measurement of over 500 desktop file systems shows that nearly half of all consumed space is occupied by duplicate files. We present a mechanism to reclaim space from this incidental duplication to make it available for controlled file replication. Our mechanism includes: (1) convergent encryption, which enables duplicate files to be coalesced into the space of a single file, even if the files are encrypted with different users' keys; and (2) SALAD, a Self-Arranging Lossy Associative Database for aggregating file content and location information in a decentralized, scalable, fault-tolerant manner.

The algorithms chosen for close study include two gray world methods, a limiting case of a version of the Retinex method, a number of variants of Forsyth's (1990) gamut-mapping method, Cardei et al.'s (2000) neural net method, and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method (Finlayson et al. 1997, 2001; Hubel and Finlayson 2000) .

If these text occurrences could be detected, segmented, and recognized automatically, they would be a valuable source of high-level semantics for indexing and retrieval. We propose a novel method for localizing and segmenting text in complex images and videos. Text lines are identified by using a complex-valued multilayer feed-forward network trained to detect text at a fixed scale and position. The network's output at all scales and positions is integrated into a single text-saliency map, serving as a starting point for candidate text lines. In the case of video, these candidate text lines are refined by exploiting the temporal redundancy of text in video. Localized text lines are then scaled to a fixed height of 100 pixels and segmented into a binary image with black characters on white background. For videos, temporal redundancy is exploited to improve segmentation performance. Input images and videos can be of any size due to a true multiresolution approach. Moreover, the system is not only able to locate and segment text occurrences into large binary images, but is also able to track each text line with sub-pixel accuracy over the entire occurrence in a video, so that one text bitmap is created for all instances of that text line. Therefore, our text segmentation results can also be used for object-based video encoding such as that enabled by MPEG-4.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.999203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=999203","","Image segmentation;Videos;Web pages;Text recognition;Indexing;Nonhomogeneous media;Feedforward systems;Pixel;Image resolution;Encoding","","295","57","30","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The behaviors of the Geman-McClure (GM) estimator, of the correlation ratio, and of the mutual information (MI) relative to activated areas are studied using simulated time series and actual data stemming from a 3 T magnet. It is shown that these methods are more robust than the usual difference of squares measure.

In the past few years, the structure of LA, has been modified in several directions to suit different applications. Concepts such as parameterized learning automata (PLA), generalized learning,automata (GLA), and continuous action-set learning automata (CALA) have been proposed, analyzed, and applied to solve many significant learning problems. Furthermore, groups of LA forming teams and feedforward networks have been shown to converge to desired solutions under appropriate learning algorithms.

This is achieved by exploiting the fact that the materials comprising the various objects in a scene reflect, absorb, and emit electromagnetic radiation in ways characteristic of their molecular composition and shape. If the radiation arriving at the sensor is measured at each wavelength over a sufficiently broad spectral band, the resulting spectral signature, or simply spectrum, can be used (in principle) to uniquely characterize and identify any given material. An important function of hyperspectral signal processing is to eliminate the redundancy in the spectral and spatial sample data while preserving the high-quality features needed for detection, discrimination, and classification. This dimensionality reduction is implemented in a scene-dependent (adaptive) manner and may be implemented as a distinct step in the processing or as an integral part of the overall algorithm. The most widely used algorithm for dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA) or, equivalently, Karhunen-Loeve transformation.","1558-0792","","10.1109/79.974715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974715","","Signal processing;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Layout;Signal processing algorithms;Principal component analysis;Remote sensing;Composite materials;Electromagnetic radiation;Shape","","290","6","","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Comprehensive design of a three-dimensional (3-D) active appearance model (AAM) is reported for the first time as an involved extension of the AAM framework introduced by Cootes et al. The model's behavior is learned from manually traced segmentation examples during an automated training stage. Information about shape and image appearance of the cardiac structures is contained in a single model. This ensures a spatially and/or temporally consistent segmentation of three-dimensional cardiac images. The clinical potential of the 3-D AAM is demonstrated in short-axis cardiac MR images and four-chamber echocardiographic sequences. The method's performance was assessed by comparison with manually identified independent standards in 56 clinical MR and 64 clinical echo image sequences. The AAM method showed good agreement with the independent standard using quantitative indexes of border positioning errors, endo- and epicardial volumes, and left ventricular mass. In MR, the endocardial volumes, epicardial volumes, and left ventricular wall mass correlation coefficients between manual and AAM were R/sup 2/=0.94,0.97,0.82, respectively.

This leads to a large coding gain, comparable to that of turbo TCM, over both Gaussian and Rayleigh fading channels with much less system complexity. We address critical design issues to enhance the decoding performance and provide the analytical bounds on the performance with an ideal feedback assumption.

Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976602317318938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790128","","","","286","58","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Theoretical models for the processes involved are assessed in terms of the experimental data and an outline for the sequence of events in tree initiation developed. The inter-relationship between tree discharges, tree propagation, and tree shape is discussed. Theoretical models for these processes are evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce experimental data, especially tree shapes and discharge sequences in time and space. The chaotic nature of the tree propagation mechanism is discussed both through experimental data and the results of a completely deterministic theoretical model.

After a discussion of codec selection and the delay budget, there is a discussion of various techniques to achieve network quality of service. Since call setup is very important, the paper next gives an overview of several VoIP call signaling protocols, including H.323, SIP, MGCP, and Megaco/H.248.

The consistent landmark and intensity registration algorithm produces good correspondences between images near landmark locations by matching corresponding landmarks and away from landmark locations by matching the image intensities. In contrast to similar unidirectional algorithms, these new consistent algorithms jointly estimate the forward and reverse transformation between two images while minimizing the inverse consistency error-the error between the forward (reverse) transformation and the inverse of the the reverse (forward) transformation. This reduces the ambiguous correspondence between the forward and reverse transformations associated with large inverse consistency errors. In both algorithms a thin-plate spline (TPS) model is used to regularize the estimated transformations. Two-dimensional (2-D) examples are presented that show the inverse consistency error produced by the traditional unidirectional landmark TPS algorithm can be relatively large and that this error is minimized using the consistent landmark algorithm.

We then present a theoretical analysis of the picture distortion caused by channel errors and the subsequent inter-frame propagation. Based on this analysis, we develop a statistical model to estimate such channel errors induced distortion for different channel conditions and encoder settings. The proposed analytic model mathematically describes the complex behavior of channel errors in a video coding and transmission system. Unlike other experimental approaches for distortion estimation reported in the literature, this analytic model has very low computational complexity and implementation cost, which are highly desirable in wireless video applications. Simulation results show that this model is able to accurately estimate the channel errors induced distortion with a minimum delay in processing. Based on the proposed source coding R-D model and the analytic channel-distortion estimation, we derive an analytic solution for adaptive intra mode selection and joint source-channel rate control under time-varying wireless channel conditions.

Both the standby power and the active power of a processor chip will increase precipitously below the 0.1-µm or 100-nm technology generation. To extend CMOS scaling to the shortest channel length possible while still gaining significant performance benefit, an optimized, vertically and laterally nonuniform doping design (superhalo) is presented. It is projected that room-temperature CMOS will be scaled to 20-nm channel length with the superhalo profile.

Ideally, the RTS/CTS handshake can eliminate most interference. However, the effectiveness of RTS/CTS handshake is based on the assumption that hidden nodes are within transmission range of receivers. In this paper, we prove using analytic models that in ad hoc networks, such an assumption cannot hold due to the fact that power needed for interrupting a packet reception is much lower than that of delivering a packet successfully. Thus, the ""virtual carrier sensing"" implemented by RTS/CTS handshake cannot prevent all interference. Physical carrier sensing can complement this in some degree. However, since interference happens at receivers, while physical carrier sensing is detecting transmitters (the same problem causing the hidden terminal situation), physical carrier sensing cannot help much, unless a very large carrier sensing range is adopted, which is limited by the antenna sensitivity. We investigate how effective is the RTS/CTS handshake in terms of reducing interference. We show that in some situations, the interference range is much larger than transmission range, where RTS/CTS cannot function well. Then, a simple MAC layer scheme is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results verify that our scheme can help IEEE 802.11 resolve most interference caused by large interference range.","","0-7803-7632-3","10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1188044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188044","","Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Media Access Protocol;Transmitters;Operating systems;Computer science;USA Councils;Interference elimination;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas","","276","3","11","IEEE","26 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This value of the displacement energy compares with that of silicon carbide but is smaller than that of diamond and larger than that of gallium arsenide (GaAs). No threshold energy for the nitrogen atom was observed. It is concluded that the nitrogen sublattice repairs itself through annealing. The measured displacement energy is used to determine the Rutherford cross section, which permits a theoretical comparison of electron and proton irradiation damage in GaN. The effects of 2.5 MeV electrons on gallium nitride films have been studied by photoluminescence (PL), and according to the literature, they introduce transitions in the near infrared part of the spectrum. Experiments on gallium nitride films using 2 MeV protons are reported in this work. The same transitions in the near infrared part of the spectrum are observed by PL. It is deduced that 2 MeV protons are about 1000 times more damaging than 2.5 MeV electrons. The Rutherford cross section predicts a value of 214. The difference is attributed to the defect recombination rate which depends on the particle type. The nature of the transitions in the near infrared part of the spectrum is reviewed. The GaN films were annealed at 400/spl deg/C for 30 min. As a result of annealing, another transition appears in the green part of the spectrum.

We assume here that power constraints are modeled by a maximal distance above which two nodes are not (directly) connected. We find that the introduction of a sparse network of base stations does significantly help in increasing the connectivity, but only when the node density is much larger in one dimension than in the other. We explain the results by percolation theory. We obtain analytical expressions of the probability of connectivity in the 1D case.

Although large caches can significantly improve performance, they have the potential to increase power consumption. As feature sizes shrink the dominant component of this power loss will be leakage. However, during a fixed period of time the activity in a cache is only centered on a small subset of the lines. This behavior can be exploited to cut the leakage power of large caches by putting the cold cache lines into a state preserving, low-power drowsy mode. Moving lines into and out of drowsy state incurs a slight performance loss. In this paper we investigate policies and circuit techniques for implementing drowsy caches. We show that with simple architectural techniques, about 80%-90% of the cache lines can be maintained in a drowsy state without affecting performance by more than 1%. According to our projections, in a 0.07 um CMOS process, drowsy caches will be able to reduce the total energy (static and dynamic) consumed in the caches by 50%-75%. We also argue that the use of drowsy caches can simplify the design and control of low-leakage caches, and avoid the need to completely turn off selected cache lines and lose their state.","1063-6897","0-7695-1605-X","10.1109/ISCA.2002.1003572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003572","","Dynamic voltage scaling;Voltage control;Energy consumption;Computer architecture;Circuit simulation;Threshold voltage;Leakage current;Inverters;Semiconductor device modeling;Predictive models","","275","30","12","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While this is usually considered an improvement of everyday life, it also makes unauthorized copying and distributing of multimedia data much easier, therefore presenting a challenge in the field of copyright protection. Digital watermarking, which is inserting copyright information into the data, has been proposed to solve the problem. In this paper, we first discuss the features that a practical digital watermarking system for ownership verification requires. Besides perceptual invisibility and robustness, we claim that the private control of the watermark is also very important. Second, we present a novel wavelet-based watermarking algorithm. Experimental results and analysis are then given to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and can be used in a practical system.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.982816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982816","","Watermarking;Digital images;Signal processing algorithms;Internet;Copyright protection;Algorithm design and analysis;Filter bank;Counterfeiting;Robust control;Power system protection","","274","","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

BANKS enables users to extract information in a simple manner without any knowledge of the schema or any need for writing complex queries. A user can get information by typing a few keywords, following hyperlinks, and interacting with controls on the displayed results. BANKS models tuples as nodes in a graph, connected by links induced by foreign key and other relationships. Answers to a query are modeled as rooted trees connecting tuples that match individual keywords in the query. Answers are ranked using a notion of proximity coupled with a notion of prestige of nodes based on inlinks, similar to techniques developed for Web search.

The nonlinear diffusion coefficient is locally adjusted according to image features such as edges, textures, and moments. As such, it can switch the diffusion process from a forward to a backward (inverse) mode according to a given set of criteria. This results in a forward-and-backward (FAB) adaptive diffusion process that enhances features while locally denoising smoother segments of the signal or image. The proposed method, using the FAB process, is applied in a super-resolution scheme. The FAB method is further generalized for color processing via the Beltrami flow, by adaptively modifying the structure tensor that controls the nonlinear diffusion process. The proposed structure tensor is neither positive definite nor negative, and switches between these states according to image features. This results in a forward-and-backward diffusion flow where different regions of the image are either forward or backward diffused according to the local geometry within a neighborhood.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.800883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021076","","Diffusion processes;Image enhancement;Noise reduction;Switches;Signal processing;Tensile stress;Image segmentation;Signal resolution;Color;Geometry","","274","1","40","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach presents some advantages over previously published methods: it can treat multiple-part structures and requires less restrictive assumptions on the structure's topology. In this paper, we address the problem of building a 3-D statistical shape model of the left and right ventricle of the heart from 3-D magnetic resonance images.

One such application is prevention of biofouling, an effect that is based on reversible electroporation of cell membranes. Pulsed electric fields of several kilovolts per centimeter amplitude and submicrosecond duration have been found to prevent the growth of aquatic nuisance species on surfaces. Reversible electroporation is also used for medical applications, e.g., for delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs into tumor cells, for gene therapy and for transdermal drug delivery. Higher electric fields cause irreversible membrane damage. Pulses in the microsecond range with electric field intensities in the tens of kilovolts per centimeter are used for bacterial decontamination of water and liquid food. A new type of field-cell interaction utilizing nanosecond pulses with electric fields exceeding 50 kV/cm has been recently added to known bioelectric effects. Based on capacitive coupling to cell substructures, it has the potential to affect transport processes across subcellular membranes and may be used for gene transfer into cell nuclei. Other studies indicate that it triggers intracellular processes such as programmed cell death that can be used for cancer treatment. In order to generate the required electric fields for these processes, high-voltage high-current sources are required. The pulse duration needs to be short to prevent thermal effects.

The initial cross-search pattern is designed to fit the cross-center-biased motion vector distribution characteristics of the real-world sequences by evaluating the nine relatively higher probable candidates located horizontally and vertically at the center of the search grid. The proposed cross-diamond search (CDS) algorithm employs the halfway-stop technique and finds small motion vectors with fewer search points than the DS algorithm while maintaining similar or even better search quality. The improvement of CDS over DS can be up to a 40% gain on speedup. Experimental results show that the CDS is much more robust, and provides faster searching speed and smaller distortions than other popular fast block-matching algorithms.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2002.806815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175453","","Motion estimation;Shape;Robustness;Video coding;Image sequences;Image analysis;Image sequence analysis;Pattern analysis;Distortion measurement;Rotation measurement","","272","3","12","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the beginning, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) were limited to niche applications such as small-size displays for digital watches, pocket calculators, and small handheld devices. That all changed with the development of the notebook computer industry. In 1988, Washizuka et al. of Sharp Corporation demonstrated an active-matrix full-color full-motion 14-in display using a thin-film-transistor array. The electronics industries now recognized that Heilmeier's 25-year dream of a wall-hanging television had become reality. LCDs could be used to replace existing cathode ray tubes.

They are, for example, competitive with chemical batteries in applications like transportation or improving power quality, which involve many charge-discharge cycles and little in the way of long-term storage. Progress in power electronics, particularly in high-power insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and field-effect transistors (FETs), underlies higher-power flywheel operation. While the stored energy is determined by the speed, mass, and geometry of the wheel, the limits on input and output power are in general set by the power electronics. With these higher power devices, fewer individual components are needed, so the power electronics package can be comparable in size to the flywheel plus motor-generator combination. This paper describes the main features of flywheel energy storage systems and space, hybrid electric vehicle, and combat vehicle applications.","1939-9340","","10.1109/6.993788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993788","","Flywheels;Batteries;Power electronics;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;FETs;Chemical technology;Road transportation;Power quality;Insulation;Geometry","","267","5","","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper attempts to explore an emerging discipline know as cognitive informatics. Cognitive Informatics is a profound interdisciplinary research area that tackles the common root problems of modern informatics, computation, software engineering, artificial intelligence (AI), neural psychology, and cognitive science. Cognitive informatics studies the internal information processing mechanisms and natural intelligence of the brain. This paper describes historical development of informatics from the classical information theory, contemporary informatics, to cognitive informatics. The domain of cognitive informatics and its interdisciplinary nature are explored. Foundations of cognitive informatics, particularly the brain vs. the mind, the acquired life functions vs. the inherited ones, and generic relationships between information, matter and energy are investigated. The potential engineering applications of cognitive informatics and perspectives on future research are discussed. It is expected that the investigation into cognitive informatics will result in fundamental findings towards the development of next generation IT and software technologies, such as neural computers, bioinformatics, quantum information processing, new software development approaches, and new architectures of information systems.","","0-7695-1724-2","10.1109/COGINF.2002.1039280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039280","","Cognitive informatics;Artificial intelligence;Information processing;Quantum computing;Software engineering;Psychology;Cognitive science;Information theory;Power engineering and energy;Application software","","267","","14","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Update with out-of-sequence measurements in tracking: exact solution","Y. Bar-Shalom","University of Connecticut, USA",IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,"10 Dec 2002","2002","38","3","769","777","In target tracking systems measurements are typically collected in ""scans"" or ""frames"" and then they are transmitted to a processing center. In multisensor tracking systems that operate in a centralized manner, there are usually different time delays in transmitting the scans or frames from the various sensors to the center. This can lead to situations where measurements from the same target arrive out of sequence. Such ""out-of-sequence"" measurement (OOSM) arrivals can occur even in the absence of scan/frame communication time delays. The resulting ""negative-time measurement update"" problem, which is quite common in real multisensor systems, was solved previously only approximately in the literature. The exact state update equation for such a problem is presented. The optimal and two suboptimal algorithms are compared on a number of realistic examples, including a GMTI (ground moving target indicator) radar case.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2002.1039398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039398","","Time measurement;Target tracking;Radar tracking;Delay effects;Sensor systems;Equations;Current measurement;Measurement standards;Multisensor systems;Electric variables measurement","","267","5","9","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we propose dividing the image into blocks in a multilevel hierarchy and calculating block signatures in this hierarchy. While signatures of small blocks on the lowest level of the hierarchy ensure superior accuracy of tamper localization, higher level block signatures provide increasing resistance to VQ attacks. At the top level, a signature calculated using the whole image completely thwarts the counterfeiting attack. Moreover, ""sliding window"" searches through the hierarchy enable the verification of untampered regions after an image has been cropped.

This paper applies the proportional model in the differentiation of queueing delays, and investigates appropriate packet scheduling mechanisms. Starting from the proportional delay differentiation (PDD) model, we derive the average queueing delay in each class, show the dynamics of the class delays under the PDD constraints, and state the conditions in which the PDD model is feasible. The feasibility model of the model can be determined from the average delays that result with the strict priorities scheduler. We then focus on scheduling mechanisms that can implement the PDD model, when it is feasible to do so. The proportional average delay (PAD) scheduler meets the PDD constraints, when they are feasible, but it exhibits a pathological behavior in short timescales. The waiting time priority (WTP) scheduler, on the other hand, approximates the PDD model closely, even in the short timescales of a few packet departures, but only in heavy load conditions. PAD and WTP serve as motivation for the third scheduler, called hybrid proportional delay (HPD). HPD approximates the PDD model closely, when the model is feasible, independent of the class load distribution. Also, HPD provides predictable delay differentiation even in short timescales.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.986503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=986503","","Delay;Scheduling algorithm;Quality of service;Diffserv networks;Atherosclerosis;Resource management;Admission control;Pathology;Intserv networks;Proposals","","266","1","34","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The moving object region is then separated from the background region by comparing the current frame with the constructed background image. Finally, a post-processing step is applied on the obtained object mask to remove noise regions and to smooth the object boundary. In situations where object shadows appear in the background region, a pre-processing gradient filter is applied on the input image to reduce the shadow effect. In order to meet the real-time requirement, no computationally intensive operation is included in this method. Moreover, the implementation is optimized using parallel processing and a processing speed of 25 QCIF fps can be achieved on a personal computer with a 450-MHz Pentium III processor.

The primitive tree structured relationships are parent-child and ancestor-descendant, and finding all occurrences of these relationships in an XML database is a core operation for XML query processing. We develop two families of structural join algorithms for this task: tree-merge and stack-tree. The tree-merge algorithms are a natural extension of traditional merge joins and the multi-predicate merge joins, while the stack-tree algorithms have no counterpart in traditional relational join processing. We present experimental results on a range of data and queries using the TIMBER native XML query engine built on top of SHORE. We show that while, in some cases, tree-merge algorithms can have performance comparable to stack-tree algorithms, in many cases they are considerably worse. This behavior is explained by analytical results that demonstrate that, on sorted inputs, the stack-tree algorithms have worst-case I/O and CPU complexities linear in the sum of the sizes of inputs and output, while the tree-merge algorithms do not have the same guarantee.","1063-6382","0-7695-1531-2","10.1109/ICDE.2002.994704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994704","","XML;Pattern matching;Relational databases;Engines;Books;Query processing;Algorithm design and analysis;Database languages;Database systems;Data engineering","","265","27","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Registration of cardiac images is a more complex problem than brain image registration because the heart is a nonrigid moving organ inside a moving body. Moreover, as compared to the registration of brain images, the heart exhibits much fewer accurate anatomical landmarks. In a clinical context, physicians often mentally integrate image information from different modalities.

Based on this infrastructure, a completely passive ceramic pressure sensor that uses a wireless telemetry scheme has been developed. The passive nature of the telemetry removes the need for electronics, power supplies, or contacts to withstand the high-temperature environment. The sensor contains a passive LC resonator comprised of a movable diaphragm capacitor and a fixed inductor, thereby causing the sensor resonant frequency to be pressure-dependent. Data is retrieved with an external loop antenna. The sensor has been fabricated and characterized and was compared with an electromechanical model. It was operated up to 400/spl deg/C in a pressure range from 0 to 7 Bar.

Adjusting the rotor speed makes the machine either release the kinetic energy to the power system or absorb it from the utility grid. Thus, the machine has the capability of achieving not only reactive-power control, but also active-power control based on the flywheel effect of the rotating parts. This paper proposes a new control strategy for a doubly-fed induction machine intended as a flywheel energy storage system, which is characterized by the combination of vector control and decoupling control. The control strategy enables the induction machine to perform active-power control independent of reactive-power control even in transient states. The validity of the theory developed in this paper, along with the effectiveness and viability of the control strategy, is confirmed by computer simulation. In addition, this paper discusses a transient behavior of a magnetizing current in the induction machine.","1941-0107","","10.1109/63.988676","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988676","","Induction machines;Pulse width modulation;Flywheels;Energy storage;Pulse power systems;Control systems;Power system transients;Voltage;Space vector pulse width modulation;Kinetic energy","","263","","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

HAWAII uses specialized path setup schemes which install host-based forwarding entries in specific routers to support intra-domain micromobility. These path setup schemes deliver excellent performance by reducing mobility related disruption to user applications. Also, mobile hosts retain their network address while moving within the domain, simplifying quality-of-service (QoS) support. Furthermore, reliability is achieved through maintaining soft-state forwarding entries for the mobile hosts and leveraging fault detection mechanisms built in existing intra-domain routing protocols.

We propose a new frequency-domain decision feedback equalizer (FD-DFE) for single carrier modulation, which makes use of a data block transmission format similar to that of the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing with cyclic prefix (OFDM). The scheme is a nonadaptive DFE where the feedforward part is implemented in the frequency domain, while feedback signal is generated by time-domain filtering. Through simulations in a HIPERLAN-2 scenario, we show that FD-DFE yields a capacity very close to that of OFDM. This result is also confirmed by analytical derivations for a particular case. Furthermore, when no channel loading is considered, FD-DFE performs closely to OFDM for the same averaged frame error rate in a coded transmission. Design methods of the FD-DFE are investigated and a reduced complexity technique is developed, with the result that FD-DFE and OFDM have a similar computational complexity in signal processing.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2002.1010614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1010614","","OFDM modulation;Decision feedback equalizers;Chirp modulation;Frequency modulation;Frequency division multiplexing;Frequency domain analysis;Signal generators;Time domain analysis;Filtering;Error analysis","","262","32","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We thus investigate a dedicated minimization-based motion estimator. The cost function to be minimized includes a novel data term relying on an integrated version of the continuity equation of fluid mechanics, which is compatible with large displacements. This term is associated with an original second-order div-curl regularization which prevents the washing out of the salient vorticity and divergence structures. The performance of the resulting fluid flow estimator is demonstrated on meteorological satellite images. In addition, we show how the sequences of dense motion fields we estimate can be reliably used to reconstruct trajectories and to extract the regions of high vorticity and divergence.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.990137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990137","","Fluid flow;Motion estimation;Image analysis;Image motion analysis;Image sequence analysis;Motion analysis;Image sequences;Computer vision;Cost function;Equations","","262","3","48","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately,ML detection (MLD) is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem, for which there is no known algorithm that can find the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity (in the number of users). In this paper, a polynomial-time approximation method called semi-definite (SD) relaxation is applied to the MLD problem with antipodal data transmission. SD relaxation is an accurate approximation method for certain NP-hard problems. The SD relaxation ML (SDR-ML) detector is efficient in that its complexity is of the order of K3.5, where K is the number of users. We illustrate the potential of the SDR-ML detector by showing that some existing detectors, such as the decorrelator and the linear-minimum-mean-square-error detector, can be interpreted as degenerate forms of the SDR-ML detector. Simulation results indicate that the BER performance of the SDR-ML detector is better than that of these existing detectors and is close to that of the true ML detector, even when the cross-correlations between users are strong or the near-far effect is significant.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.992139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=992139","Maximum likelihood detection;multiuser detection;relaxation methods;semi-definite programming","Multiuser detection;Detectors;NP-hard problem;Maximum likelihood detection;Bit error rate;Approximation methods;Multiaccess communication;Interference;Code division multiplexing","","261","2","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finding a good observer for an uncertain nonlinear system is not an obvious task. We argue that it is sufficient to build an observer for the output tracking error. Ultimate boundedness of the error signals is shown through Lyapunov's direct method.

However, since the relationship between load power and factors influencing load power is nonlinear, it is difficult to identify its nonlinearity by using conventional methods. Most of papers deal with 24-hour-ahead load forecasting or next day peak load forecasting. These methods forecast the demand power by using forecasted temperature as forecast information. But, when the temperature curves changes rapidly on the forecast day, load power changes greatly and forecast error would going to increase. In conventional methods neural networks uses all similar day's data to learn the trend of similarity. However, learning of all similar day's data is very complex, and it does not suit learning of neural network. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the neural network structure and learning time. To overcome these problems, we propose a one-hour-ahead load forecasting method using the correction of similar day data.

The evolution of a horizontal wind speed has been synthesized taking into account two components. The medium- and long-term component is described by a power spectrum associated to a specific site. The turbulence component is assumed to be dependent on the medium- and long-term wind speed evolution. It is considered as a nonstationary process. Two simulation methods for this component, using rational and nonrational filters are proposed. In both procedures, the turbulence model is defined by two parameters, which are either obtained experimentally, or adopted a priori, according to information from the considered site.

GaN:RE ELDs emit light due to impact excitation of the rare earth (RE) ions by hot carriers followed by radiative RE relaxation. By appropriately choosing the RE dopant, narrow linewidth emission can be obtained at selected wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The deposition of GaN:RE layers is carried out by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy, and a plasma N/sub 2/ source. Growth mechanisms and optimization of the GaN layers for RE emission are discussed based on RE concentration, growth temperature, and V/III ratio. The fabrication processes and electrical models for both dc- and ac-biased devices are discussed, along with techniques for multicolor integration. Visible emission at red, green, and blue wavelengths from GaN doped with Eu, Er, and Tm has led to the development of flat-panel display (FPD) devices. The brightness characteristics of thick dielectric EL (TDEL) display devices are reviewed as a function of bias, frequency, and time. High contrast TDEL devices using a black dielectric are presented. The fabrication and operation of FPD prototypes are described.

We consider essentially the same physical model of a wireless network under a different traffic pattern, namely the relay traffic pattern, but we allow for arbitrarily complex network coding. In our model, there is only one active source/destination pair, while all other nodes assist this transmission. We show code constructions leading to achievable rates and derive upper bounds from the max-flow min-cut theorem. It is shown that lower and upper bounds meet asymptotically as the number of nodes in the network goes to infinity, thus proving that the capacity of the wireless network with n nodes under the relay traffic pattern behaves like log n bits per second. This demonstrates also that network coding is essential: under the point-to-point coding assumption considered by Gupta et al., the achievable rate is constant, independent of the number of nodes.

For the cantilevers with thickness H<500 nm and length L>10 /spl mu/m, thermoelastic loss is negligible. But it becomes significant when the beam thickness H>500 nm and the length L<10 /spl mu/m. The cantilevers are very liable to air damping, hardly operated at pressure higher than 10/sup -3/ mbar. In a high vacuum (<10/sup -3/ mbar), air damping is negligible, the support and surface loss play an important role. The shorter the cantilevers, the larger the support energy loss. For the cantilevers with L/H<100, the quality factors (Q factors) are limited by the support loss. When the length L>30 /spl mu/m, the Q factors of the cantilevers are proportional to their thickness, i.e., surface loss dominates the mechanical behavior. Annealing the cantilevers of 170 nm thickness at 1000/spl deg/C for 30 s under an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condition results in an over one order-of-magnitude increase of the Q factor, up to about 2.5/spl times/10/sup 5/ for cantilevers of 30-90 /spl mu/m in length.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.805208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097798","","Energy dissipation;Silicon;Force sensors;Mechanical energy;Thermoelasticity;Damping;Energy resolution;Q factor;Laser beams;Structural beams","","255","1","33","IEEE","16 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The balance of the capacitor voltages is not possible in all operating conditions when the MPC converter possesses a passive front end. On the other hand, in AC/DC/AC power conversion, the back-to-back connection of a multilevel rectifier with a multilevel inverter allows the balance of the DC-link capacitor voltages and, at the same time, it offers the power-factor-correction capability at the mains AC input. An effective balancing strategy suitable for MPC conversion systems with any number of DC-link capacitors is presented here. The strategy has been carefully studied to optimize the converter efficiency. The simulation results related to a high-power conversion system (up to 10 MW) characterized by four intermediate DC-link capacitors are shown.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2002.801237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021299","","Diodes;Capacitors;Rectifiers;Pulse width modulation converters;Pulse width modulation inverters;Pulse width modulation;Topology;Power conversion;Medium voltage;Pulse modulation","","255","1","17","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our retrieval system, an image is represented by a set of segmented regions, each of which is characterized by a fuzzy feature (fuzzy set) reflecting color, texture, and shape properties. As a result, an image is associated with a family of fuzzy features corresponding to regions. Fuzzy features naturally characterize the gradual transition between regions (blurry boundaries) within an image and incorporate the segmentation-related uncertainties into the retrieval algorithm. The resemblance of two images is then defined as the overall similarity between two families of fuzzy features and quantified by a similarity measure, UFM measure, which integrates properties of all the regions in the images. Compared with similarity measures based on individual regions and on all regions with crisp-valued feature representations, the UFM measure greatly reduces the influence of inaccurate segmentation and provides a very intuitive quantification. The UFM has been implemented as a part of our experimental SIMPLIcity image retrieval system. The performance of the system is illustrated using examples from an image database of about 60,000 general-purpose images.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1033216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033216","","Image retrieval;Content based retrieval","","251","5","35","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, this detection is performed without any explicit extraction of coherent structures. This paper explains the construction of the ""v-disparity"" image, its main properties, and the obstacle detection method. The longitudinal profile of the road is estimated and the objects located above the road surface are then extracted as potential obstacles; subsequently, the accurate detection of road obstacles, in particular the position of tyre-road contact points is computed in a precise manner.

Short-channel effects (SCE) of the FinFET can be reasonably controlled by reducing either silicon fin height or fin thickness. Analytical solution of 3-D Laplace's equation is employed to establish the design equations for the subthreshold behavior in the fully depleted silicon fins. Based on the 3-D analytical electrostatic potential in the subthreshold region, the threshold voltage (V/sub th/) roll-off and the subthreshold swing (S) are estimated by considering the source barrier changes in the most leaky channel path. V/sub th/ roll-off is an exponential function of the ratio of effective channel length to drain potential decay length, which can then be expressed as a function of the fin thickness, the fin height and the gate oxide thickness. The drain-potential decay lengths of single-gate fully depleted SOI MOSFET (FDFET), double-gate MOSFET (DGFET), rectangular surrounding-gate MOSFET (SGFET), and FinFET are compared.

However, besides being suitable only for systems with monotonic step response, the compensated systems whose controllers are tuned in accordance with the Ziegler-Nichols method have generally a step response with a high-percent overshoot. In this paper, tuning methods for proportional-integral (PI) and PID controllers are proposed that, like the Ziegler-Nichols method, need only parameters obtained from the plant step response. The methodology also encompasses the design of PID controllers for plants with underdamped step response and provides the means for a systematic adjustment of the controller gain in order to meet transient performance specifications.

The approach is based on repeated analyses of a circuit with the desired topology; no similarity transformation is needed. Restrictions imposed by the implementation on the coupling coefficients such as signs and orders of magnitudes are straightforwardly handled within this technique. The technique is then used to synthesize and design filters with full or almost full coupling matrices by selecting, among the infinite number of solutions, the matrix that corresponds to the actual implementation. In such cases, analytical techniques and those based on similarity transformations cannot be used since they provide no mechanism to constrain individual coupling coefficients in order to discriminate between two full coupling matrices, which are both solutions to the synthesis problem. Using the technique described in this paper, a filter designer can extract the coupling matrix of a filter of arbitrary order and topology while enforcing relevant constraints. There is no need to master all the different existing similarity-transformation-based techniques and the topologies to which they are applicable. For the first time, detailed investigations of parasitic coupling effects, for either compensation or utilization, are made possible. The method is applied to the synthesis of a variety of filters, some of which are then designed and built and their response measured.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2002.801348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022042","","Resonator filters;Coupling circuits;Microwave filters;Filtering theory;Circuit synthesis;Attenuation;Circuit analysis;Circuit topology;Wireless communication","","248","1","33","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed design bridges the gap between multiplexing and diversity and yields codes that typically perform well both in terms of ergodic capacity as well as error probability. This is important because, as we show, designs performing well from an ergodic capacity point of view do not necessarily perform well from an error probability point of view.

The asymptotic performance of these algorithms in the limit of large code block length can be rigorously analyzed by using density evolution. We show that, for random spreading in the large-system limit, density evolution is considerably simplified.

However, recent advances in the theory of mathematical morphology still remain largely unexplored. We show in this paper that they can enhance methodologies for the processing and analysis of Earth observation data for tasks as diverse as filtering, simplification, directional segmentation and crest line extraction.

We test a number of the leading computational color constancy algorithms using a comprehensive set of images.

The algorithms studied include two gray world methods, a version of the Retinex method, several variants of Forsyth's (1990) gamut-mapping method, Cardei et al.'s (2000) neural net method, and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method (Finlayson et al. 1997, 2001; Hubel and Finlayson 2000).

Experiments with synthesized data (part one of this paper) suggested that the methods which emphasize the use of the input data statistics, specifically color by correlation and the neural net algorithm, are potentially the most effective at estimating the chromaticity of the scene illuminant. Unfortunately, we were unable to realize comparable performance on real images.

Therefore, the total number of transmissions (forward nodes) is generally used as the cost criterion for broadcasting. The problem of finding the minimum number of forward nodes is NP-complete. Among various approximation approaches, dominant pruning (Lim and Kim 2001) utilizes 2-hop neighborhood information to reduce redundant transmissions. In this paper, we analyze some deficiencies of the dominant pruning algorithm and propose two better approximation algorithms: total dominant pruning and partial dominant pruning. Both algorithms utilize 2-hop neighborhood information more effectively to reduce redundant transmissions. Simulation results of applying these two algorithms show performance improvements compared with the original dominant pruning. In addition, two termination criteria are discussed and compared through simulation under both the static and dynamic environments.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2002.1038347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038347","","Broadcasting;Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Floods;Approximation algorithms;Costs;Algorithm design and analysis;Mobile communication;Personnel;Personal digital assistants","","245","1","18","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficient evaluation of these queries in response to the movement of the objects is critical for supporting acceptable response times. In such environments, the traditional approach of building an index on the objects (data) suffers from the need for frequent updates and thereby results in poor performance. In fact, a brute force, no-index strategy yields better performance in many cases. Neither the traditional approach nor the brute force strategy achieve reasonable query processing times. This paper develops novel techniques for the efficient and scalable evaluation of multiple continuous queries on moving objects. Our solution leverages two complimentary techniques: Query Indexing and Velocity Constrained Indexing (VCI). Query Indexing relies on 1) incremental evaluation, 2) reversing the role of queries and data, and 3) exploiting the relative locations of objects and queries. VCI takes advantage of the maximum possible speed of objects in order to delay the expensive operation of updating an index to reflect the movement of objects. In contrast to an earlier technique that requires exact knowledge about the movement of the objects, VCI does not rely on such information. While Query Indexing outperforms VCI, it does not efficiently handle the arrival of new queries. Velocity constrained indexing, on the other hand, is unaffected by changes in queries. We demonstrate that a combination of Query Indexing and Velocity Constrained Indexing enables the scalable execution of insertion and deletion of queries in addition to processing ongoing queries. We also develop several optimizations and present a detailed experimental evaluation of our techniques. The experimental results show that the proposed schemes outperform the traditional approaches by almost two orders of magnitude.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2002.1039840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039840","","Indexing;Delay;Navigation;Query processing;Telephony;Business;Humans;Portable computers;Positron emission tomography","","245","7","40","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This allows enforcement of the system power conservation through all terminals, and allows simultaneous solutions for both the electrical potentials and the system temperature. The thermal port built accordingly can be used for natural thermal coupling. The static and dynamic behaviors of the solar array model based on the approach are obtained and validated through comparison of simulation results to theoretical predictions and other reported data.

We design and evaluate the Secure Efficient Ad hoc Distance vector routing protocol (SEAD), a secure ad hoc network routing protocol based on the design of the Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector routing protocol (DSDV). In order to support use with nodes of limited CPU processing capability, and to guard against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in which an attacker attempts to cause other nodes to consume excess network bandwidth or processing time, we use efficient one-way hash functions and do not use asymmetric cryptographic operations in the protocol. SEAD performs well over the range of scenarios we tested, and is robust against multiple uncoordinated attackers creating incorrect routing state in any other node, even in spite of any active attackers or compromised nodes in the network.","","0-7695-1647-5","10.1109/MCSA.2002.1017480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017480","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Wireless communication;Computer networks;Spread spectrum communication;Femtocell networks;Central Processing Unit;Computer crime","","243","3","44","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By viewing an attack as a violation of a safety property, we can use off-the-shelf model checking technology to produce attack graphs automatically: a successful path from the intruder's viewpoint is a counterexample produced by the model checker In this paper we present an algorithm for generating attack graphs using model checking as a subroutine. Security analysts use attack graphs for detection, defense and forensics.

The worst-case performance is compared for two cases: (1) with the use of feedback alone and (2) with the addition of the feedforward input. It is shown that inversion-based feedforward controllers can lead to performance improvements at frequencies w where the uncertainty /spl Delta/ (jw) in the nominal plant is smaller than the size of the nominal plant G/sub 0/(jw) divided by its condition number K/sub G0/ (jw), i.e., /spl par//spl Delta/(jw)/spl par//sub 2/ < /spl par/G/sub 0/(jw) /spl par//sub 2//k/sub G0/ (jw).

The tuning curve becomes strongly dependent on the oscillator bias current. As a result, the practical tuning range is reduced and the upconverted flicker noise of the bias current dominates the 1/f/sup 3/ close-in phase noise, even if the waveform symmetry has been assured. A first-order estimation of the tuning curve for MOS-varactor-tuned VCOs is provided. Based on this result, a simplified phase-noise model for double cross-coupled VCOs is derived.

The control design is motivated by a theoretical analysis of the dynamic equations of motion of a rigid body and exploits passivity-like properties of these dynamics to derive a Lyapunov control algorithm using robust backstepping techniques. The proposed control is novel in considering the full dynamic system incorporating all degrees of freedom (albeit for a restricted class of dynamics) and in not requiring measurement of the relative depths of the observed image points.

With the utilization of iterative Lyapunov design and neural networks, the proposed design procedure expands the class of nonlinear systems for which robust adaptive control approaches have been studied. The design method does not require a priori knowledge of the signs of the unknown virtual control coefficients. Leakage terms are incorporated into the adaptive laws to prevent parameter drifts due to the inherent neural-network approximation errors. It is proved that the proposed robust adaptive scheme can guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system signals.. The control performance can be guaranteed by an appropriate choice of the design parameters.

A typical construction of such drives includes an induction machine with a dual three-phase connection, where two three-phase groups are spatially shifted 30 electrical degrees, a six-leg inverter, and a control circuit. By controlling the machine's phase currents, harmonic elimination and torque-ripple reduction techniques could be implemented.

All the above quantities are analytically calculated from the speckled image, the variance and autocorrelation of the fading variable, and the wavelet filters only, without resorting to any model to describe the underlying backscatter. On the test image Lena corrupted by synthetic speckle, the proposed method outperforms Kuan's local linear MMSE filtering by almost 3-dB signal-to-noise ratio. When true synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are concerned, empirical criteria based on distributions of multiscale local coefficient of variation, calculated in the undecimated wavelet domain, are introduced to mitigate the rescaling of coefficients in highly heterogeneous areas where the speckle does not obey a fully developed model, to avoid blurring strong textures and point targets. Experiments carried out on widespread test SAR images and on a speckled mosaic image, comprising synthetic shapes, textures, and details from optical images, demonstrate that the visual quality of the results is excellent in terms of both background smoothing and preservation of edge sharpness, textures, and point targets. The absence of decimation in the wavelet decomposition avoids typical impairments often introduced by critically subsampled wavelet-based denoising.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.805083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166595","","Speckle;Wavelet domain;Noise reduction;Signal to noise ratio;Filtering;Noise level;Testing;Adaptive filters;Analysis of variance;Image analysis","","239","1","28","IEEE","22 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For such classification, the conventional parametric statistical classifiers, which have been applied successfully in remote sensing for the last two decades, are not appropriate, since a convenient multivariate statistical model does not exist for the data. In this paper, several single and multiple classifiers, that are appropriate for the classification of multisource remote sensing and geographic data are considered. The focus is on multiple classifiers: bagging algorithms, boosting algorithms, and consensus-theoretic classifiers. These multiple classifiers have different characteristics. The performance of the algorithms in terms of accuracies is compared for two multisource remote sensing and geographic datasets. In the experiments, the multiple classifiers outperform the single classifiers in terms of overall accuracies.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.802476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1105916","","Remote sensing;Boosting;Bagging;Pattern recognition;Associate members;Satellites;Radar remote sensing;Councils;Neural networks","","238","","21","IEEE","16 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These kind of networks are very flexible, thus they do not require any existing infrastructure or central administration. Therefore, mobile ad-hoc networks are suitable for temporary communication links. The biggest challenge in this kind of networks is to find a path between the communication end points, what is aggravated through the node mobility. In this paper we present a new on-demand routing algorithm for mobile, multi-hop ad-hoc networks. The protocol is based on swarm intelligence and especially on the ant colony based meta heuristic. These approaches try to map the solution capability of swarms to mathematical and engineering problems. The introduced routing protocol is highly adaptive, efficient and scalable. The main goal in the design of the protocol was to reduce the overhead for routing.

To accurately test the DTM mechanism being proposed, this paper also develops a thermal model based on lumped thermal resistances and thermal capacitances. This model is computationally efficient and tracks temperature at the granularity of individual functional blocks within the processor. Because localized heating occurs much faster than chip-wide heating, some parts of the processor are more likely, to be ""hot spots"" than others. Experiments using Wattch and the SPEC2000 benchmarks show that the thermal trigger threshold can be set within 0.2/spl deg/ of the maximum temperature and yet never enter thermal emergency. This cuts the performance loss of DTM by 65% compared to the previously described fetch toggling technique that uses a response of fixed magnitude.","1530-0897","0-7695-1525-8","10.1109/HPCA.2002.995695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995695","","Thermal management;Testing;Thermal resistance;Vehicle dynamics;Adaptive control;Temperature;Heating;Feedback control;Programmable control;Vehicles","","237","11","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A prototype of a nanophotonic integrated circuit (IC) is presented, in which the optical near field is used as a carrier to transmit a signal from one nanometric dot to another. Each section of this paper reviews theoretical and experimental studies carried out to assess the possibility of designing, fabricating, and operating each nanophotonic IC device. A key device, the nanophotonic switch, is proposed based on optical near-field energy transfer between quantum dots (QDs). The optical near-field interaction is expressed as the sum of the Yukawa function, and the oscillation period of the nutation of cubic CuCl QDs is estimated to be less than 100 ps. To guarantee one-directional (i.e., irreversible) energy transfer between two resonant levels of QDs, intrasublevel transitions due to phonon coupling are examined by considering a simple two-QD plus phonon heat bath system. As a result, the state-filling time is estimated as 22 ps for CuCl QDs. This time is almost independent of the temperature in the Born-Markov approximation. Using cubic CuCl QDs in a NaCl matrix as a test sample, the optical near-field energy transfer was experimentally verified by near-field optical spectroscopy with a spatial resolution smaller than 50 nm in the near-UV region at 15 K. This transfer occurs from the lowest state of excitons in 4.6-nm QDs to the first dipole-forbidden excited state of excitons in 6.3-nm QDs. To fabricate nanophotonic devices and ICs, chemical vapor deposition using an optical near field is proposed; this is sufficiently precise in controlling the size and position of the deposited material. A novel deposition scheme under nonresonant conditions is also demonstrated and its origin is discussed. In order to confirm the possibility of using a nanometric ZnO dot as a light emitter in a nanophotonic IC, spatially and spectrally resolved photoluminescence imaging of individual ZnO nanocrystallites was carried out with a spatial resolution as high as 55 nm, using a UV fiber probe, and the spectral shift due to the quantum size effect was found. To connect the nanophotonic IC to external photonic devices, a nanometer-scale waveguide was developed using a metal-coated silicon wedge structure. Illumination (wavelength: 830 nm) of the metal-coated silicon wedge (width: 150 nm) excites a TM plasmon mode with a beam width of 150 nm and propagation length of 2.5 /spl mu/m. A key device for nanophotonics, an optical near-field probe with an extremely high throughput, was developed by introducing a pyramidal silicon structure with localized surface plasmon resonance at the metallized probe tip. A throughput as high as 2.3% was achieved. Finally, as an application of nanophotonics to, a high-density, high-speed optical memory system, a novel contact slider with a pyramidal silicon probe array was developed. This slider was used for phase-change recording and reading, and a mark length as short as 110 nm was demonstrated.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2002.801738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039477","","Optical devices;Nanophotonics;Optical design;Optical device fabrication;Nanoscale devices;High speed optical techniques;Probes;Silicon;Photonic integrated circuits;Energy exchange","","236","3","83","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These techniques transform multivariate multiset data into new orthogonal variables called canonical variates (CVs) which, when applied in remote sensing, exhibit ever-decreasing similarity (as expressed by correlation measures) over sets consisting of (1) spectral variables at fixed points in time (R-mode analysis), or (2) temporal variables with fixed wavelengths (T-mode analysis). The CVs are invariant to linear and affine transformations of the original variables within sets which means, for example, that the R-mode CVs are insensitive to changes over time in offset and gain in a measuring device. In a case study, CVs are calculated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with six spectral bands over six consecutive years. Both Rand T-mode CVs clearly exhibit the desired characteristic: they show maximum similarity for the low-order canonical variates and minimum similarity for the high-order canonical variates. These characteristics are seen both visually and in objective measures. The results from the multiset CCA R- and T-mode analyses are very different. This difference is ascribed to the noise structure in the data. The CCA methods are related to partial least squares (PLS) methods. This paper very briefly describes multiset CCA-based multiset PLS. Also, the CCA methods can be applied as multivariate extensions to empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) techniques. Multiset CCA is well-suited for inclusion in geographical information systems (GIS).","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.988962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=988962","","Remote sensing;Data analysis;Least squares methods;Wavelength measurement;Satellites;Geophysical measurements;Constraint optimization;Time measurement;Information systems;Geographic Information Systems","","236","","48","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three cases are discussed and, for each case, conditions are derived under which the dynamic characteristics of the system are either of steady-state type, limit cycles or chaotic, thus by properly adjusting some system parameters, the system can exhibit limit cycles (LCs) or chaotic behaviors at will.

The whole system may be regarded as a stochastic bilinear hybrid system that includes both time-evolving and event-driven mechanisms. Our attention is focused on the design of a robust state-feedback controller such that, for all admissible uncertainties as well as nonlinear disturbances, the closed-loop system is stochastically exponentially stable in the mean square, independent of the time delay. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the existence of desired robust controllers, which are given in terms of the solutions to a set of either linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), or coupled quadratic matrix inequalities.

Analytical models of the leakage current, dynamic power, and frequency as functions of supply voltage and body bias are derived and verified with SPICE simulation. We then show how to determine the correct trade-off between supply voltage and body bias for a given clock frequency and duration of operation.

The performance of these signaling strategies is highly dependent on MIMO channel characteristics, which, in turn, depend on antenna height and spacing and richness of scattering. In practice, large antenna spacings are often required to achieve significant multiplexing or diversity gain. The use of dual-polarized antennas (polarization diversity) is a promising cost- and space-effective alternative, where two spatially separated uni-polarized antennas are replaced by a single antenna structure employing orthogonal polarizations. This paper investigates the performance of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity (Alamouti (see IEEE J. Select. Areas Commun., vol.16, p.1451-58, Oct. 1998) scheme) in MIMO wireless systems employing dual-polarized antennas. In particular, we derive estimates for the uncoded average symbol error rate of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity and identify channel conditions where the use of polarization diversity yields performance improvements. We show that while improvements in terms of symbol error rate of up to an order of magnitude are possible in the case of spatial multiplexing, the presence of polarization diversity generally incurs a performance loss for transmit diversity techniques. Finally, we provide simulation results to demonstrate that our estimates closely match the actual symbol error rates.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.803322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033685","","Polarization;MIMO;Diversity methods;Error analysis;Samarium;Transmitting antennas;Scattering;Transmitters;Receiving antennas;Laboratories","","231","7","27","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting approach is suitable for generating both high-speed scans of moving objects when projecting a single stripe pattern and high-resolution scans of static scenes using a short sequence of time-shifted stripe patterns.

The issue of the dual-damascene process and its potential effect on EM reliability is described with special focus on the peculiarities of the dual-damascene interconnect architecture compared to more conventional subtractively etched Al-based interconnects. Experiments performed on dual-damascene interconnects that highlight electromigration reliability issues such as early failure, a tentative explanation for via electromigration failure, and the Blech effect, are summarized. Emphasis is placed on an experimental methodology that uses large interconnect ensembles in a multi-link configuration. Such a large scale study of nearly 10000 interconnects has shown statistical evidence of bimodal failure behavior consistent with the presence of a weak and strong failure mode, which have been identified as voiding, respectively, within the via and the trench at the cathode end of an interconnect. A multi-link approach has also demonstrated a length-dependent distribution of failures that yields a (j/spl middot/L)/sub c/ product value of about 9000 A/cm in dual-damascene Cu/oxide interconnections and is consistent with mass transport that is controlled by the presence of extended defects within Cu such as grain boundaries, interfaces, and/or surfaces.

First, the memory bandwidth in ME is analyzed and the problem is solved by exploring data reuse. Four levels are defined according to the degree of data reuse for previous frame access. With the highest level of data reuse, one-access for frame pixels is achieved. A scheduling strategy is also applied to data reuse of the ME architecture designs and a seven-type classification system is developed that can accommodate most published ME architectures. This classification can simplify the work of designers in designing more cost-effective ME architectures, while simultaneously minimizing memory bandwidth.

This, together with a plethora of existing simulation languages and packages, has created a popular opinion that simulation is mainly an exercise in computer programming. In new computing environments, programming can be minimized, or even fully replaced, by the manipulation of icons (representing prebuilt programming objects containing basic functional blocks of simulated systems) on a computer monitor. One can say that we have witnessed another success of modern science and technology: the emergence of wonderful and powerful tools for exploring and predicting the behavior of such complex stochastic dynamic systems as telecommunication networks. But this enthusiasm is not shared by all researchers in this area. An opinion is spreading that one cannot rely on the majority of the published results on performance evaluation studies of telecommunication networks based on stochastic simulation, since they lack credibility. Indeed, the spread of this phenomenon is so wide that one can speak about a deep crisis of credibility. In this article this claim is supported by the results of a survey of over 2200 publications on telecommunication networks in proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM and such journals as IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, and Performance Evaluation Journal.

Having considered their perils and pitfalls, we formulate guidelines that, if observed, could help to ensure a basic level of credibility of simulation studies of telecommunication networks.","1558-1896","","10.1109/35.978060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=978060","","Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Functional programming;Analytical models;Computer networks;Telecommunication computing;Packaging;Computer displays;Stochastic systems;Stochastic processes","","230","1","15","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Certain topics in telegraph transmission theory","H. Nyquist","American Telephone and Telegraph Company, New York, NY, USA",Proceedings of the IEEE,"7 Aug 2002","2002","90","2","280","305","The most obvious method for determining the distortion of telegraph signals is to calculate the transients of the telegraph system. This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.989875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989875","","Telegraphy;Steady-state;Frequency conversion;Signal processing;Telephony;Phase distortion;Circuit analysis computing;Shape","","230","18","5","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use a chi-squared distance analysis to compute a flexible metric for producing neighborhoods that are highly adaptive to query locations. Neighborhoods are elongated along less relevant feature dimensions and constricted along most influential ones. As a result, the class conditional probabilities are smoother in the modified neighborhoods, whereby better classification performance can be achieved.

As suggested by Fleet and Jepson (1990), we track contours of constant phase over time, since these are more robust to variations in lighting conditions and deviations from pure translation than contours of constant amplitude. Our phase-based approach proceeds in three stages. First, the image sequence is spatially filtered using a bank of quadrature pairs of Gabor filters, and the temporal phase gradient is computed, yielding estimates of the velocity component in directions orthogonal to the filter pairs' orientations. Second, a component velocity is rejected if the corresponding filter pair's phase information is not linear over a given time span. Third, the remaining component velocities at a single spatial location are combined and a recurrent neural network is used to derive the full velocity. We test our approach on several image sequences, both synthetic and realistic.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.1031944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031944","","Optical filters;Phase estimation;Image motion analysis;Gabor filters;Image sequences;Robustness;Filter bank;Yield estimation;Information filtering;Information filters","","226","43","24","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These control schemes can be extensively applied to the operation of a five-phase induction motor using a fully digital implementation. Vector control of the five-phase induction motor not only achieves high drive performance, but also generates the desired nearly rectangular current waveforms and flux profile in the air-gap resulting in an improvement in air gap flux density and an increase of 10% in output torque. The DTC method has additional advantages when applied to multiphase, in this case a five-phase, induction motor. The five-phase inverter provides 32 space voltage vectors in comparison to 8 space voltage vectors provided by the three-phase inverter. Therefore, a more elaborate flux and torque control algorithm for the five-phase induction motor can be employed. Direct torque control of the five-phase induction motor reduces the amplitude of the ripples of both the stator flux and the torque, resulting in a more precise flux and torque control. A 32-b floating-point TMS320C32 digital signal processor (DSP) enables these two sophisticated control techniques to be conveniently implemented with high control precision. Experimental results show that an ideal control capability is obtained for both control methods when applied to the five-phase induction motor and further validates theoretical analysis.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.800983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016801","","Induction motor drives;Control systems;Induction motors;Torque control;Machine vector control;Inverters;Voltage;Induction generators;Air gaps;Signal processing algorithms","","226","","18","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since impact-ionization is an abrupt function of the electric field (or the carrier energy), simulations show that the device has a subthreshold slope much lower than kT/q. Simulations also show that it is indeed possible to make complementary circuits with switching speeds comparable to or exceeding CMOS. Experimental results on a silicon based prototype verify the basic concept and show very steep subthreshold slopes with high speed turn-on and turn-off.

The study addresses device count, DC filter ratings, restrictions on voltage control, active power transfer through the DC link, and balancing of DC-link voltages. Emphasis is placed on capacitor sizing because of its impact on the cost and size of the FACTS controller. A method for the dimensioning the DC capacitor filter is presented.

Current humanoid robots, however, lack in adaptability, agility, or high-mobility enough to meet the expectations. In order to enhance high-mobility, the humanoid motion should be generated in real-time in accordance with the dynamics, which commonly requires a large amount of computation and has not been implemented so far. We have developed a real-time motion generation method that controls the center of gravity (COG) by indirect manipulation of the zero moment point (ZMP). The real-time response of the method provides humanoid robots with high-mobility. In the paper, the algorithm is presented. It consists of four parts, namely, the referential ZMP planning, the ZMP manipulation, the COG velocity decomposition to joint angles, and local control of joint angles. An advantage of the algorithm lies in its applicability to humanoids with a lot of degrees of freedom.

Procedures of how to tune the equipment for optimal results with respect to etch rate and profile control are described. Profile control is a delicate balance between the respective etching and deposition rates of a SiO/sub x/F/sub y/ passivation layer on the sidewalls and bottom of an etched structure in relation to the silicon removal rate from unpassivated areas. Any parameter that affects the relative rates of these processes has an effect on profile control. The deposition of the SiO/sub x/F/sub y/ layer is mainly determined by the oxygen content in the SF/sub 6/ gas flow and the electrode temperature. Removal of the SiO/sub x/F/sub y/ layer is mainly determined by the kinetic energy (self-bias) of ions in the SF/sub 6//O/sub 2/ plasma. Diagrams for profile control are given as a function of parameter settings, employing the previously published ""black silicon method"". Parameter settings for high rate silicon bulk etching, and the etching of micro needles and micro moulds are discussed, which demonstrate the usefulness of the diagrams for optimal design of etched features. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that in order to use the oxygen flow as a control parameter for cryogenic DRIE, it is necessary to avoid or at least restrict the presence of fused silica as a dome material, because this material may release oxygen due to corrosion during operation of the plasma source. When inert dome materials like alumina are used, etching recipes can be defined for a broad variety of microstructures in the cryogenic temperature regime. Recipes with relatively low oxygen content (1-10% of the total gas volume) and ions with low kinetic energy can now be applied to observe a low lateral etch rate beneath the mask, and a high selectivity (more than 500) of silicon etching with respect to polymers and oxide mask materials is obtained. Crystallographic preference etching of silicon is observed at low wafer temperature (-120/spl deg/C). This effect is enhanced by increasing the process pressure above 10 mtorr or for low ion energies (below 20 eV).","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.800928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022850","","Plasma temperature;Guidelines;Etching;Silicon;Micromechanical devices;Plasma applications;Cryogenics;Kinetic energy;Optimal control;Passivation","","222","15","35","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

FMT modulation mitigates interference due to echo and near-end crosstalk signals, and increases the system throughput and reach. Signal equalization in an FMT receiver is accomplished in the form of per-subchannel symbol-spaced or fractionally spaced linear or decision-feedback equalization. The problem of channel coding for this type of modulation is also addressed, and an approach that allows combined removal of intersymbol-interference via precoding and trellis coding is described. Furthermore, practical design aspects regarding filter-bank realization, initial transceiver training, adaptive equalization, and timing recovery are discussed.

A nonlinear system of this class is composed of multiple affine local linear models that are smoothly interpolated by weighting functions resulting from a fuzzy partitioning of the state space of a given nonlinear system subject to observation. The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system is then an accurate approximation of the original nonlinear system. Our approach to the analysis and design of observers for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems is based on extending sliding mode observer schemes to the case of interpolated multiple local affine linear models. Thus, our main contribution is nonlinear observer analysis and design methods that can effectively deal with model/plant mismatches.

Each of these techniques offer specific strengths that make them efficient for particular problem structures. However, neither structural techniques based on SAT, nor functional methods using BDDs offer an overall robust reasoning mechanism that works reliably for a broad set of applications. The authors present a combination of techniques for Boolean reasoning based on BDDs, structural transformations, an SAT procedure, and random simulation natively working on a shared graph representation of the problem. The described intertwined integration of the four techniques results in a powerful summation of their orthogonal strengths.

A physical modeling of this plant is made based on the general laws of physics. For this type of control problem, it is extremely important to prevent the occurrence of web break or fold by decoupling the web tension and the web velocity. Due to the wide-range variation of the radius and inertia of the rollers the system dynamics change considerably during the winding/unwinding process. Different strategies for web tension control and linear transport velocity control are presented. First, an H/sub /spl infin// robust control strategy which reduces the coupling between tension and velocity, is compared to the decentralized control strategy with proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers commonly used in the industry. Second, an H/sub /spl infin// robust control strategy with varying gains is shown to render the control more robust to the radius variations. Then, a linear parameter varying (LPV) control strategy with smooth scheduling of controllers is synthesized for different operating points and compared to the previous methods. Finally, this LPV control and the H/sub /spl infin// robust control strategy with varying gains are combined to give the best results on an experimental setup, for the rejection of the disturbances introduced by velocity variations and for the robustness to radius and inertia changes.","1558-0865","","10.1109/87.987065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=987065","","Robust control;Velocity control;Control systems;Physics;Distributed control;Three-term control;PD control;Pi control;Proportional control;Industrial control","","220","3","27","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several of these studies have shown that such models can be accurate in predicting faulty classes within one particular software product. In practice, however, prediction models are built on certain products to be used on subsequent software development projects. How accurate can these models be, considering the inevitable differences that may exist across projects and systems? Organizations typically learn and change. From a more general standpoint, can we obtain any evidence that such models are economically viable tools to focus validation and verification effort? This paper attempts to answer these questions by devising a general but tailorable cost-benefit model and by using fault and design data collected on two mid-size Java systems developed in the same environment. Another contribution of the paper is the use of a novel exploratory analysis technique - MARS (multivariate adaptive regression splines) to build such fault-proneness models, whose functional form is a-priori unknown. The results indicate that a model built on one system can be accurately used to rank classes within another system according to their fault proneness. The downside, however, is that, because of system differences, the predicted fault probabilities are not representative of the system predicted. However, our cost-benefit model demonstrates that the MARS fault-proneness model is potentially viable, from an economical standpoint. The linear model is not nearly as good, thus suggesting a more complex model is required.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2002.1019484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019484","","Object oriented modeling;Predictive models;Mars;Economic forecasting;Environmental economics;Java;Accuracy;Logistics;Computer Society;Fault detection","","220","1","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the number of transmit antennas n=1, 2, or n is a multiple of four, we spread a rotated version of the information symbol vector by the Hadamard transform and send it over n transmit antennas and n time periods; for other values of n, we construct the codes by sending the components of a rotated version of the information symbol vector over the diagonal of an n /spl times/ n ST code matrix.

Beamforming on the other hand exploits geometric information which is often readily available but not utilized in blind algorithms. We propose to join these benefits by combining cross-power minimization of second-order source separation with geometric linear constraints used in adaptive beamforming. We find that the geometric constraints resolve some of the ambiguities inherent in the independence criterion such as frequency permutations and degrees of freedom provided by additional sensors.

In this work, we build a path planning system based on RRTs that interleaves planning and execution, first evaluating it in simulation and then applying it to physical robots. Our planning algorithm, ERRT (execution extended RRT), introduces two novel extensions of previous RRT work, the waypoint cache and adaptive cost penalty search, which improve replanning efficiency and the quality of generated paths. ERRT is successfully applied to a real-time multi-robot system. Results demonstrate that ERRT is significantly more efficient for replanning than a basic RRT planner, performing competitively with or better than existing heuristic and reactive real-time path planning approaches. ERRT is a significant step forward with the potential for making path planning common on real robots, even in challenging continuous, highly dynamic domains.","","0-7803-7398-7","10.1109/IRDS.2002.1041624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1041624","","Path planning;Navigation;Mobile robots;Computer science;Costs;Real time systems;Multirobot systems;Time factors;State-space methods;Explosions","","218","3","9","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The given nonlinear transformation Is applied to the set, and the unscented estimate is obtained by computing the statistics of the transformed set of sigma points. For example, the mean and covariance of the transformed set approximates the nonlinear transformation of the original mean and covariance estimate. The computational efficiency of the UT therefore depends on the number of sigma points required to capture the known statistics of the original estimate.

They are used in agent systems, knowledge management systems, and e-commerce platforms. They can also generate natural language, integrate intelligent information, provide semantic-based access to the Internet, and extract information from texts in addition to being used in many other applications to explicitly declare the knowledge embedded in them. However, not only are ontologies useful for applications in which knowledge plays a key role, but they can also trigger a major change in current Web contents. This change is leading to the third generation of the Web-known as the Semantic Web-which has been defined as the conceptual structuring of the Web in an explicit machine-readable way.

It is proved that, under mild assumptions, global practical output tracking is achievable by smooth state feedback, although asymptotic output tracking is usually not possible (even locally) because the linearized system has uncontrollable modes whose eigenvalues are on the right half plane. Smooth feedback controllers which solve the problem of global practical output tracking are explicitly constructed, based on a modified 'adding a power integrator' approach. This feedback design method also leads to solutions to challenging benchmark control problems, including practical output tracking of an underactuated unstable two degrees of freedom mechanical system.","1558-2523","","10.1109/9.981720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=981720","","Nonlinear systems;Regulators;Output feedback;Nonlinear equations;Linear systems;Servomechanisms;Partial differential equations;Robustness;State feedback;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","218","","33","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 249 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 bits/mm/sup 2/ over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence.

This analysis is extended to the study of transient operation where the generation of the reference voltage of the DVR is discussed.

The information theoretic criteria developed here evolved from a Renyi entropy estimator (A. Renyi, 1960) that was proposed recently and has been successfully applied to other machine learning applications (J.C. Principe et al., 2000). An improved version of the k-change algorithm is used in optimization because of the stepwise nature of the cost function and existence of local minima. Even when applied to nonlinearly separable data, the new algorithm performs well, and was able to find nonlinear boundaries between clusters.

To preserve the partitioning of the antecedent space, linearly transformed input variables can be used in the model. This may, however, complicate the interpretation of the rules. To form an easily interpretable model that does not use the transformed input variables, a new clustering algorithm is proposed, based on the expectation-maximization (EM) identification of Gaussian mixture models. This new technique is applied to two well-known benchmark problems: the MPG (miles per gallon) prediction and a simulated second-order nonlinear process.

Therefore, it is sensitive to noisy interference such as illumination changes and quantization errors. Furthermore, CCHs large dimension or histogram bins requires large computation on histogram comparison. To address these concerns, this paper presents a new color histogram representation, called fuzzy color histogram (FCH), by considering the color similarity of each pixel's color associated to all the histogram bins through fuzzy-set membership function. A novel and fast approach for computing the membership values based on fuzzy c-means algorithm is introduced. The proposed FCH is further exploited in the application of image indexing and retrieval. Experimental results clearly show that FCH yields better retrieval results than CCH. Such computing methodology is fairly desirable for image retrieval over large image databases.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.801585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025168","","Histograms;Color;Image retrieval;Indexing;Interference;Lighting;Quantization;Image databases;Information retrieval;Software libraries","","215","1","26","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This requirement has to be supported at all system levels, including the field level in process industry, as well as the cell and machine control levels in manufacturing industry, where fieldbus-based communication systems are commonly found. Furthermore, typical applications at these levels require both time- and event-triggered communication services, in most cases under stringent timing constraints, to convey state data in the former case and alarms and management data in the latter. However, neither the requirement for flexible operation under guaranteed timeliness nor for joint support of time and event-triggered traffic are efficiently fulfilled by most of existing fieldbus systems. This paper presents a new protocol, flexible time-triggered communication on controller area network, which fulfills both requirements: it supports time-triggered communication in a flexible way as well as being an efficient combination of both time- and event-triggered traffic with temporal isolation. These types of traffic are handled by two complementary subsystems, the synchronous and the asynchronous messaging systems, respectively. The paper includes a justification for the new protocol as well as its description and worst case temporal analysis for both subsystems. This analysis shows the capability of the protocol to convey real-time traffic of either type.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2002.804967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097741","","Protocols;Field buses;Manufacturing industries;Communication system traffic control;Electrical equipment industry;Communication system control;Timing;Real time systems;Industrial control;Machine control","","214","5","7","IEEE","16 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mismatching flows are rate-limited in proportion to their aggressiveness. D-WARD offers good service to legitimate traffic even during an attack, while effectively reducing DDoS traffic to a negligible level. A prototype of the system has been built in a Linux router.

The premise and defuzzification parts are static while the consequent parts of the fuzzy rules are recurrent neural networks with internal feedback and time delay synapses. The network is trained by means of a novel learning algorithm, named Dynamic-Fuzzy Neural Constrained Optimization Method (D-FUNCOM), based on the concept of constrained optimization. The proposed algorithm is general since it can be applied to locally as well as fully recurrent networks, regardless of their structures. An adaptation mechanism of the maximum parameter change is presented as well. The proposed dynamic model, equipped with the learning algorithm, is applied to several temporal problems, including modeling of a NARMA process and the noise cancellation problem. Performance comparisons are conducted with a series of static and dynamic systems and some existing recurrent fuzzy models. Simulation results show that DFNN compares favorably with its competing rivals and thus it can be considered for efficient system identification.","1941-0492","","10.1109/3477.990874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990874","","System identification;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Recurrent neural networks;Neurofeedback;Delay effects;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization methods;Constraint optimization;Noise cancellation","","211","1","49","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Without a priori knowledge of the distribution of the training data set, a novel mapping-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm is devised to reveal the true cluster configuration in a single pass for an initial SANFIS construction, estimating the location and variance of each cluster. Subsequently, a fast recursive linear/nonlinear least-squares algorithm is performed to further accelerate the learning convergence and improve the system performance. Good generalization capability, fast learning convergence and compact comprehensible knowledge representation summarize the strength of SANFIS.

Boundaries between domains are chosen to exploit existing queues, thereby minimizing inter-domain synchronization costs. We propose four clock domains, corresponding to the front end , integer units, floating point units, and load-store units. We evaluate this design using a simulation infrastructure based on SimpleScalar and Wattch.

This paper studies an alternative network architecture combining OBS with dynamic wavelength allocation under fast circuit switching to provide a scalable optical architecture with a guaranteed QoS in the presence of dynamic and bursty traffic loads. In the proposed architecture, all processing and buffering are concentrated at the network edge and bursts are routed over an optical transport core using dynamic wavelength assignment. It is assumed that there are no buffers or wavelength conversion in core nodes and that fast tuneable laser sources are used in the edge routers. This eliminates the forwarding bottleneck of electronic routers in DWDM networks for terabit-per-second throughput and guarantees forwarding with predefined delay at the edge and latency due only to propagation time in the core. The edge burst aggregation mechanisms are evaluated for a range of traffic statistics to identify their impact on the allowable burst lengths, required buffer size and achievable edge delays. Bandwidth utilization and wavelength reuse are introduced as new parameters characterizing the network performance in the case of dynamic wavelength allocation. Based on an analytical model, upper bounds for these parameters are derived to quantify the advantages of wavelength channel reuse, including the influence of the signaling round-trip time required for lightpath reservation. The results allow to quantify the operational gain achievable with fast wavelength switching compared to quasistatic wavelength-routed optical networks and can be applied to the design of future optical network architectures.","1558-2213","","10.1109/50.996576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996576","","Optical buffering;Optical wavelength conversion;Optical fiber networks;Bandwidth;Wavelength division multiplexing;Telecommunication traffic;Delay;Optical burst switching;All-optical networks;Circuits","","209","2","21","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that, by performing an LM step on a single neighborhood at each training iteration, not only significant savings in memory occupation and computing effort are obtained, but also, the overall performance of the LM method can be increased.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.1031951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1031951","","Neural networks;Neurons;Testing;Backpropagation algorithms;Multilayer perceptrons;Optimization methods;Software performance;Software tools;Computer languages","","209","","12","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The AMR-WB codec was also selected by the International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Sector (ITU-T) in July 2001 in the standardization activity for wideband speech coding around 16 kb/s and was approved in January 2002 as Recommendation G.722.2. The adoption of AMR-WB by ITU-T is of significant importance since for the first time the same codec is adopted for wireless as well as wireline services. AMR-WB uses an extended audio bandwidth from 50 Hz to 7 kHz and gives superior speech quality and voice naturalness compared to existing second- and third-generation mobile communication systems. The wideband speech service provided by the AMR-WB codec will give mobile communication speech quality that also substantially exceeds (narrowband) wireline quality.

In addition, the notation should be easy to comprehend and allow for formal reasoning about the correctness of the specification refinement and also about the correctness of an implementation in terms of whether it adheres to the specification. Targeting all these requirements together, the paper proposes employing behavior protocols which are based on a notation similar to regular expressions. As proof of the concept, the behavior protocols are used in the SOFA architecture description language at three levels: interface, frame, and architecture. Key achievements of this paper include the definitions of bounded component behavior and protocol conformance relation. Using these concepts, the designer can verify the adherence of a component's implementation to its specification at runtime, while the correctness of refining the specification can be verified at design time.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2002.1049404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049404","","Access protocols;Architecture description languages;Runtime;Software reusability;Computer Society;Software architecture;Programming profession;Object oriented programming;Object oriented modeling;Automata","","208","","33","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The electromagnetic properties of such metamaterial plates, which can indeed be regarded as frequency-selective surfaces, are influenced by the shape and geometry of these inclusions. When a metamaterial surface is closely placed above a perfectly conducting plate, at a certain frequency band, this structure may possess a high surface impedance at its top surface, thus providing a high-impedance ground plane (HIGP). The center frequency and bandwidth over which such a high-impedance electromagnetic surface is achieved depend on inclusion shapes and compositions, among other parameters. By placing a resistive sheet on top of this surface, we can achieve a thin structure that can be an efficient absorber for incident electromagnetic energy.","","0-7803-7330-8","10.1109/APS.2002.1016106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016106","","Metamaterials;Surface waves;Surface impedance;Magnetic materials;Frequency;Dielectrics;Shape;Reflectivity;Dipole antennas;Transmission line matrix methods","","207","3","11","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many simulations, it seems that we fully benefit from PNLMS only when the impulse response is close to a delta function.

Central to the algorithm is a 12-parameter interimage transformation derived by modeling the retina as a rigid quadratic surface with unknown parameters. The parameters are estimated by matching vascular landmarks by recursively tracing the blood vessel structure. The parameter estimation technique, which could be generalized to other applications, is a hierarchy of models and methods, making the algorithm robust to unmatchable image features and mismatches between features caused by large interframe motions. Experiments involving 3,000 image pairs from 16 different healthy eyes were performed. Final registration errors less than a pixel are routinely achieved. The speed, accuracy, and ability to handle small overlaps compare favorably with retinal image registration techniques published in the literature.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.990136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990136","","Robustness;Change detection algorithms;Retina;Parameter estimation;Humans;Microscopy;Instruments;Recursive estimation;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging","","207","20","57","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Techniques for controlling DG plants that use feedback of only locally measurable variables are presented. This solution allows correct system operation and switching between parallel and isolated modes without needing online communication of control signals between the generators.

By using an observer-based output feedback control law and adaptive law, the free parameters of the adaptive FNN controller can be tuned on-line based on the Lyapunov synthesis approach. A supervisory controller is appended into the FNN controller to force the state to be within the constraint set. Therefore, if the FNN controller cannot maintain the stability, the supervisory controller starts working to guarantee stability. On the other hand, if the FNN controller works well, the supervisory controller will be de-activated. The overall adaptive scheme guarantees the global stability of the resulting closed-loop system in the sense that all signals involved are uniformly bounded. Simulation results also show that our initial control effort is much less than those in previous works, while preserving the tracking performance.","1941-0034","","10.1109/91.983277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=983277","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Fuzzy control;Force control;Stability;Adaptive systems;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Output feedback","","206","","22","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Under the assumptions that neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel, and that the receiver forms a minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimate based on training symbols only, training is optimized by maximizing a tight lower bound on the ergodic training-based independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) capacity. For OFDM systems, it is shown that the lower bound is maximized by placing the known symbols periodically in frequency. For single-carrier systems, under the assumption that the training symbols are placed in clusters of length /spl alpha/ /spl ges/ (2L + 1), it is shown that the lower bound is maximized by a family of placement schemes called QPP-/spl alpha/, where QPP stands for quasi-periodic placement.

We prove that fixed-size window control can achieve fair bandwidth sharing according to any of these criteria, provided scheduling at each link is performed in an appropriate manner. We then consider a distributed random scheme where each traffic source varies its sending rate randomly, based on binary feedback information from the network.

Without sufficient clutter rejection, low velocity blood flow cannot be measured, and estimates of higher velocities will have a large bias. The small number of samples available (8 to 16) makes clutter filtering in color flow imaging a challenging problem. In this paper, we review and analyze three classes of filters: finite impulse response (FIR), infinite impulse response (IIR), and regression filters. The quality of the filters was assessed based on the frequency response, as well as on the bias and variance of a mean blood velocity estimator using an autocorrelation technique. For FIR filters, the frequency response was improved by allowing a non-linear phase response. By estimating the mean blood flow velocity from two vectors filtered in the forward and backward direction, respectively, the standard deviation was significantly lower with a minimum phase filter than with a linear phase filter. For IIR filters applied to short signals, the transient part of the output signal is important. We analyzed zero, step, and projection initialization, and found that projection initialization gave the best filters.

The best filters from each of the three classes gave comparable bias and variance of the mean blood velocity estimates. However, polynomial regression filters and projection-initialized IIR filters had a slightly better frequency response than could be obtained with FIR filters.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.985705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985705","","Ultrasonic imaging;Finite impulse response filter;IIR filters;Frequency response;Nonlinear filters;Blood flow;Polynomials;Fluid flow measurement;Velocity measurement;Ultrasonic variables measurement","Blood Flow Velocity;Computer Simulation;Equipment Design;Mathematics;Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color","205","5","14","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm consists of three distinct levels, i.e., pixel level, region level and frame level. At the pixel level, statistical models of gradients and color are separately used to classify each pixel as belonging to background or foreground. In the region level, foreground pixels obtained from the color based subtraction are grouped into regions and gradient based subtraction is then used to make inferences about the validity of these regions. Pixel based models are updated based on decisions made at the region level. Finally, frame level analysis is performed to detect global illumination changes. Our method provides the solution to some of the common problems that are not addressed by most background subtraction algorithms, such as fast illumination changes, repositioning of static background objects, and initialization of background model with moving objects present in the scene.","","0-7695-1860-5","10.1109/MOTION.2002.1182209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1182209","","Robustness;Lighting;Layout;Pixel;Object detection;Surveillance;Computer vision;Computer science;Performance analysis;Inference algorithms","","205","11","16","IEEE","28 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These bounds are validated using experimental data from a 118-182-kHz sonar, showing an accuracy of the order of 20 microns on the ping-to-ping cross-track displacements. Next, the accuracy required on the DPCA sway and yaw in order to achieve a given synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) beampattern specification, specified by the expected SAS array gain, is computed as a function of the number P of pings in the SAS. Higher accuracy is required when P increases to counter the accumulation of errors during the integration of the elementary ping-to-ping estimates: the standard deviation must decrease as P/sup -1/2/ for the DPCA sway and P/sup -3/2/ for the yaw. Finally, by combining the above results, the lower bounds on DPCA micronavigation accuracy are established. These bounds set an upper limit to the SAS length achievable in practice. The maximum gain Q in cross-range resolution achievable by a DPCA micronavigated SAS is computed as a function of the key SAS parameters.

The exhalation volume was segmented and used as a template to which the other volumes were registered using an intensity-based rigid registration algorithm followed by nonrigid registration. The patients were imaged at inhale and exhale only. The registration results were validated by visual assessment and consistency measurements indicating subvoxel registration accuracy. For all subjects, we assessed the nonrigid motion of the heart at the right coronary artery, right atrium, and left ventricle. We show that the rigid-body motion of the heart is primarily in the craniocaudal direction with smaller displacements in the right-left and anterior-posterior directions; this is in agreement with previous studies. Deformation was greatest for the free wall of the right atrium and the left ventricle; typical deformations were 3-4 mm with deformations of up to 7 mm observed in some subjects. Using the registration results, landmarks on the template surface were mapped to their correct positions through the breathing cycle. Principal component analysis produced a statistical model of the motion and deformation of the heart.

Experiments for simple motion and walking motion were performed to verify the proposed approach, with impedance parameters found by RLS (recursive least square) method. The evaluation of assisted motion was done by a calculation based on EMG in nearly proportion to the operator's muscle force. The results showed the amplitudes of EMG were reduced significantly, the operator was able to swing the leg lighter by reducing the inertia around knee, and the strain of knee in foot-grounding could be alleviated by adding the stiffness to joint.","","0-7803-7398-7","10.1109/IRDS.2002.1043967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1043967","","Legged locomotion;Electromyography;Impedance;Knee;Motion control;Torque control;Resonance light scattering;Least squares methods;Muscles;Leg","","204","16","7","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the existing secure communication techniques using chaos do not have enough security. For example, secure communication protocols based on chaos synchronization require robustness which gives useful information to attackers. The cryptosystems based on direct applications of chaotic maps have been weak against linear and differential cryptoanalysis. In this paper, a new kind of chaotic cryptosystem which overcomes these difficulties to some extent is proposed. The cryptosystem is based on a discretization of the skew tent map. We also show some of the desirable properties of the proposed cryptosystem using dynamical characteristics.

The statistical properties concerning coefficient magnitudes and their evolution across scales are expressed in a joint conditional model. The three main novelties with respect to related approaches are (1) the interscale-ratios of wavelet coefficients are statistically characterized and different local criteria for distinguishing useful coefficients from noise are evaluated, (2) a joint conditional model is introduced, and (3) a novel anisotropic Markov random field prior model is proposed.

In the haptic guidance paradigm, the subject is physically guided through the ideal motion by the haptic interface, thus giving the subject a kinesthetic understanding of what is required. Subjects learned a complex 3D motion under three training conditions (haptic, visual, haptic and visual) and were required to manually reproduce the movement under two recall conditions (with vision, without vision). Performance was measured in terms of position, shape, timing, and drift. Findings from this study indicate that haptic guidance is effective in training. While visual training was better for teaching the trajectory shape, temporal aspects of the task were more effectively learned from haptic guidance.

These rovers will have the ability to navigate safely through unknown and potentially hazardous terrain, using autonomous passive stereo vision to detect potential terrain hazards before driving into them. Unfortunately, the computational power of currently available radiation hardened processors limits the amount of distance (and therefore science) that can be safely achieved by any rover in a given time frame. We present overviews of our current rover vision and navigation systems, to provide context for the types of computation that are required to navigate safely. We also present baseline timing results that represent a lower bound in achievable performance (useful for systems engineering studies of future missions), and describe ways to improve that performance using commercial grade (as opposed to radiation hardened) processors. In particular, we document speedups to our stereo vision system that were achieved using the vectorized operations provided by Pentium MMX technology. Timing data were derived from implementations on several platforms: a prototype Mars rover with flight-like electronics (the Athena Software Development Model (SDM) rover), a RAD6000 computing platform (as will be used in the 2003 MER missions), and research platforms with commercial Pentium III and Sparc processors. Finally, we summarize the radiation effects analysis that suggests that commercial grade processors are likely to be adequate for Mars surface missions, and discuss the level of speedup that may accrue from using these instead of radiation hardened parts.","","0-7803-7231-X","10.1109/AERO.2002.1035370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035370","","Stereo vision;Navigation;Mars;Radiation hardening;Timing;Land surface;Hazards;Machine vision;Computer vision;Power engineering computing","","202","3","14","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A clear and step-by-step theoretical analysis, explaining completely the presence of certain harmonics in the line-current spectrum in the presence of eccentricity, is discussed. More importantly, it is shown for the first time that a link exists between the low- and high-frequency elements of these harmonics. It is also shown that these high-frequency components are not very strong in all types of machine. These results will be useful in generating rules and laws to formulate online tools for machine condition monitoring.

Unlike platoon systems, the semi-autonomous systems are immediately deployable on present day highways, where both manually driven and adaptive cruise controlled vehicles can coexist. Our theoretical results show that the proposed system is able to maintain smaller time gaps safely, is string stable, and is guaranteed to have smaller actuator inputs than a standard autonomous ACC system.

Errors should be avoided especially in embedded systems for critical applications. However, as the trend in VLSI technologies has been toward smaller feature sizes, lower supply voltages and higher frequencies, there is a growing concern about temporary errors as well as permanent errors in embedded systems; thus, it is very essential to detect those errors. Software-implemented hardware fault tolerance (SIHFT) is a low-cost alternative to hardware fault-tolerance techniques for embedded processors: It does not require any hardware modification of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processors. ED/sup 4/I (error detection by data diversity and duplicated instructions) is a SIHFT technique that detects both permanent and temporary errors by executing two ""different"" programs (with the same functionality) and comparing their outputs. ED/sup 4/I maps each number, x, in the original program into a new number x', and then transforms the program so that it operates on the new numbers so that the results can be mapped backwards for comparison with the results of the original program. The mapping in the transformation of ED/sup 4/I is x' = k/spl middot/x for integer numbers, where k/sub f/ determines the fault detection probability and data integrity of the system. For floating-point numbers, we find a value of k/sub f/ for the fraction and k/sub e/ for the exponent separately, and use k = k/sub f//spl times/2/sup k/ for the value of k. We have demonstrated how to choose an optimal value of k for the transformation. This paper shows that, for integer programs, the transformation with k = -2 was the most desirable choice in six out of seven benchmark programs we simulated. It maximizes the fault detection probability under the condition that the data integrity is highest.","1557-9956","","10.1109/12.980007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=980007","","Hardware;Embedded system;Fault tolerance;Fault detection;Degradation;Application software;Very large scale integration;Voltage;Frequency","","200","3","41","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a new approach based on higher-order statistics (HOS) is introduced that overcomes the subjectivity of human intervention and eliminates the noise factor. By using skewness and kurtosis, two algorithms have been formed, namely, Phase Arrival Identification-Skewness/Kurtosis (PAI-S/K), and some advantages have been gained over the usual approaches, resulting in the automatic identification of the transition from Gaussianity to non-Gaussianity that coincides with the onset of the seismic event, despite noise presence. Experimental results on real seismic data, gathered by the Seismological Network of the Department of Geophysics of Aristotle University, demonstrate an excellent performance of the PAI-S/K scheme, regarding both accuracy and noise robustness. The simplicity of the proposed method makes it an attractive candidate for huge seismic data assessment in a real-time context.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.800438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1020271","","Robustness;Seismology;Higher order statistics;Humans;Earth;Earthquakes;Seismic waves;Signal processing algorithms;Gaussian noise;Phase noise","","200","1","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work presents an algorithm which meets these demands: one-pass list-mode expectation maximization (OPL-EM) algorithm. The algorithm operates directly on list-mode data, passes through the data once only, accounts for finite resolution effects in the system model, and can also include regularization. The algorithm performs multiple image updates during its single pass through the list-mode data, corresponding to the number of subsets that the data have been split into.

This model can be used to understand what information on geometric and dielectric properties of a building can be extracted from microwave remote sensing data. The geometrical model consists of a rectangular parallelepiped whose vertical walls form a generic angle with respect to the sensor line of flight. The parallelepiped is placed on a rough surface. The radar return from such a structure can be decomposed into single-scattering contributions from the (rough) ground, the building roof (a plane surface in our model), and vertical walls and multiple scattering contributions from dihedral structures formed by vertical walls and ground. In our model, single-scattering contributions are evaluated by using either physical optics (PO) or geometrical optics (GO), depending on surface roughness. In order to account for multiple scattering between buildings and terrain, we use GO to evaluate the field reflected by the smooth wall toward the ground (first bounce) or the sensor (second or third bounce) and GO or PO (according to ground surface roughness) to evaluate the field scattered by the ground toward the wall (first or second bounce) or the sensor (second bounce). Finally, the above model is used to analyze the field backscattered from a building as a function of the main scene parameters; in particular, the angle between vertical walls and sensor line of night and the dependence on the look angle are analyzed.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.802459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036007","","Backscatter;Buildings;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Radar scattering;Solid modeling;Electromagnetic scattering;Optical scattering;Electromagnetic modeling;Electromagnetic analysis","","198","","11","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This leaves dual-failure situations as the main factor to consider in quantifying how the availability of services benefit from the investment in restorability. We approach the question in part with a theoretical framework and in part with a series of computational routing trials. The computational part of the analysis includes all details of graph topology, capacity distribution, and the details of the restoration process, effects that were generally subject to significant approximations in prior work. The main finding is that a span-restorable mesh network can be extremely robust under dual-failure events against which they are not specifically designed. In a modular-capacity environment, an adaptive restoration process was found to restore as much as 95% of failed capacity on average over all dual-failure scenarios, even though the network was designed with minimal spare capacity to assure only single-failure restorability. The results also imply that for a priority service class, mesh networks could provide even higher availability than dedicated 1+1 APS. This is because there are almost no dual-failure scenarios for which some partial restoration level is not possible, whereas with 1+1 APS (or rings) there are an assured number of dual-failure scenarios for which the path restorability is zero. Results suggest conservatively that 20% or more of the paths in a mesh network could enjoy this ultra-high availability service by assigning fractional recovery capacity preferentially to those paths upon a dual failure scenario.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.1003046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003046","","Availability;Mesh networks;Investments;Signal restoration;Optical fiber networks;Protection;Wavelength measurement;Delay;Routing;Distributed computing","","197","11","35","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It centres around the notion of an event type and supports features commonly known from object-oriented languages like type hierarchies and super-type subscriptions. A scalable routing algorithm using an overlay routing network is presented that avoids global broadcasts by creating rendezvous nodes.

However the motor's doubly salient structure and highly nonuniform torque and magnetization characteristics lead to the inability to excite the motor using conventional AC motor waveforms, or apply established AC motor rotating field theory to the motor. Furthermore, high torque ripple is inherent in the motor unless a torque ripple reduction strategy is employed. Thus, control of the motor is difficult and complex compared to other machines. Previous methods of control have fallen into two main categories: those which use a simplified linear model and those which account for the motor saturation. The simplified linear model schemes have the advantage of simplicity and tractability but are inaccurate in most practical SR drives, whereas the nonlinear schemes have the problem of high complexity and computational expensiveness which makes real-time implementation difficult. To overcome these problems, in this paper, a novel control method for the SR motor is derived from analysis of the nonuniform torque characteristics of the motor. The control method applies the philosophy of direct torque control (DTC). Unlike previous direct torque control schemes for the SR motor drive, the new method does not involve short flux patterns, a change of the motor winding configuration, or the use of a bipolar current drive. Thus, the scheme can be conveniently implemented on any normal type of SR motor drive. In addition, the scheme overcomes the problems associated with torque ripple control in the SR motor by regulating the torque output of the motor within a hysteresis band. Furthermore, the scheme is very simple and can be implemented in real-time with low cost microprocessor hardware.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.800968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1016803","","Torque control;Reluctance motors;AC motors;Hysteresis motors;Strontium;Costs;Motor drives;Magnetization;Microprocessors;Hardware","","196","1","27","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has several salient features; namely, the following. 1) Instead of a single multiplicative bias field that affects all tissue intensities, separate parametric smooth models are used for the intensity of each class. 2) A brain atlas is used in conjunction with a robust registration procedure to find a nonrigid transformation that maps the standard brain to the specimen to be segmented. This transformation is then used to: segment the brain from nonbrain tissue; compute prior probabilities for each class at each voxel location and find an appropriate automatic initialization. 3) Finally, a novel algorithm is presented which is a variant of the expectation-maximization procedure, that incorporates a fast and accurate way to find optimal segmentations, given the intensity models along with the spatial coherence assumption.

Such a representation provides an intermediate description that enables applications such as object tracking, video summarization and visualization, video insertion, and sprite-based video compression. Previous work on motion layer analysis has largely concentrated on two-frame or multi-frame batch formulations. The temporal coherency of motion layers and the domain constraints on shapes have not been exploited. This paper introduces a complete dynamic motion layer representation in which spatial and temporal constraints on shape, motion and layer appearance are modeled and estimated in a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) framework using the generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In order to limit the computational complexity of tracking arbitrarily shaped layer ownership, we propose a shape prior that parameterizes the representation of shape and prevents motion layers from evolving into arbitrary shapes. In this work, a Gaussian shape prior is chosen to specifically develop a near-real-time tracker for vehicle tracking in aerial videos. However, the general idea of using a parametric shape representation as part of the state of a tracker is a powerful one that can be extended to other domains as well. Based on the dynamic layer representation, an iterative algorithm is developed for continuous object tracking over time. The proposed method has been successfully applied in an airborne vehicle tracking system. Its performance is compared with that of a correlation-based tracker and a motion change-based tracker to demonstrate the advantages of the new method. Examples of tracking when the backgrounds are cluttered and the vehicles undergo various rigid motions and complex interactions such as passing, turning, and stop-and-go demonstrate the strength of the complete dynamic layer representation.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.982885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=982885","","Bayesian methods;Shape;Video compression;Vehicle dynamics;Tracking;Vehicles;Visualization;Motion analysis;Motion estimation;Maximum a posteriori estimation","","195","3","17","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, a large phased array will still function properly, albeit with a slightly decreased efficiency and higher sidelobes if 3-4% of the phase shifters fail. Currently, the failure mechanisms of MEMS switches are being investigated and will greatly benefit the reliability of MEMS phase shifters. Also, the hermetic packaging of MEMS phase shifters is not straightforward, due to their relatively large size. It is for these reasons that the authors believe that MEMS phase shifters will be mostly used in satellite and defense applications in the next five years.","1557-9581","","10.1109/MMW.2002.1004054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1004054","","Radiofrequency microelectromechanical systems;Phase shifters;Micromechanical devices;Switches;Microswitches;Phased arrays;Gallium arsenide;Failure analysis;Packaging;Satellites","","195","","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

So-called Data Grids seek to harness geographically distributed resources for such large-scale data-intensive problems. Yet effective scheduling in such environments is challenging, due to a need to address a variety of metrics and constraints while dealing with multiple, potentially independent sources of jobs and a large number of storage, compute, and network resources. We describe a scheduling framework that addresses these problems. Within this framework, data movement operations may be either tightly bound to job scheduling decisions or, alternatively, performed by a decoupled, asynchronous process on the basis of observed data access patterns and load. We develop a family of algorithms and use simulation studies to evaluate various combinations. Our results suggest that while it is necessary to consider the impact of replication, it is not always necessary to couple data movement and computation scheduling. Instead, these two activities can be addressed separately, thus significantly simplifying the design and implementation.","1082-8907","0-7695-1686-6","10.1109/HPDC.2002.1029935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1029935","","Distributed computing;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Application software;Computer science;Large-scale systems;Resource management;Physics computing;Laboratories;Bioinformatics","","193","6","29","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The infrared signal is modeled as the combination of a diffuse component and a line-of-sight (LOS) or direct component. For the diffuse component alone, the properties of the channel are found using Ulbricht's integrating sphere. When a LOS component is also present, the transfer function depends upon the Rician factor K given by the ratio of the electrical power in the LOS and diffuse signals after the detector. For small K, the transfer function shows notches down to low frequencies, but due to the nature of light never for zero frequency. We confirm that a K-factor /spl ges/13 dB is required also in infrared wireless links in order to support distortionless data transmission beyond 100 Mbit/s. Increasing the directivity at the receiver and/or at the transmitter improves the effective value of K. Here, we show that a moderate directivity will be sufficient for high-speed infrared communication in typical indoor scenarios.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.995522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995522","","Wireless communication;Optical fiber communication;Transfer functions;Frequency;Analytical models;Indoor environments;Rician channels;Signal detection;Detectors;Data communication","","192","3","38","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This ensures a simple architecture for the neural network and minimizes the size of the training set required for its proper training. Our studies indicate that features extracted from actual circuits lie closer to each other and exhibit more overlap across fault classes compared to SPICE simulations. This implies that the neural network architecture which can most reliably perform fault diagnosis of actual circuits is one whose outputs estimate the probabilities that input features belong to different fault classes. Our work also shows that SPICE simulations can be used to select appropriate features for training the neural network.

Their numerical solution is, however, computationally demanding, especially in three dimensions, because of the fine temporal and spatial sampling required. This paper methodically examines computational performance when solving the bidomain equations. Several techniques to speed up this computation are examined in this paper. The first step was to recast the equations into a parabolic part and an elliptic part. The parabolic part was solved by either the finite-element method (FEM) or the interconnected cable model (ICCM). The elliptic equation was solved by FEM on a coarser grid than the parabolic problem and at a reduced frequency. The performance of iterative and direct linear equation system solvers was analyzed as well as the scalability and parallelizability of each method. Results indicate that the ICCM was twice as fast as the FEM for solving the parabolic problem, but when the total problem was considered, this resulted in only a 20% decrease in computation time. The elliptic problem could be solved on a coarser grid at one-quarter of the frequency at which the parabolic problem was solved and still maintain reasonable accuracy. Direct methods were faster than iterative methods by at least 50% when a good estimate of the extracellular potential was required. Parallelization over four processors was efficient only when the model comprised at least 500 000 nodes. Thus, it was possible to speed up solution of the bidomain equations by an order of magnitude with a slight decrease in accuracy.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2002.804597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046934","","Equations;Finite element methods;Frequency;Iterative methods;Extracellular;Heart;Biomedical engineering;Computational modeling;Sampling methods;Performance analysis","Algorithms;Anisotropy;Computing Methodologies;Electric Conductivity;Electrophysiology;Finite Element Analysis;Heart;Heart Conduction System;Humans;Membrane Potentials;Models, Cardiovascular;Myocardium;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","192","","26","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The multivariate quality control technique is based on Hotelling's T/sup 2/ test that detects both counterrelationship anomalies and mean-shift anomalies. The performance of the Hotelling's T/sup 2/ test is examined on two sets of computer audit data: a small data set and a large multiday data set. Both data sets contain sessions of normal and intrusive activities. For the small data set, the Hotelling's T/sup 2/ test signals all the intrusion sessions and produces no false alarms for the normal sessions. For the large data set, the Hotelling's T/sup 2/ test signals 92 percent of the intrusion sessions while producing no false alarms for the normal sessions.

This paper reviews the physics and statistics of dielectric wearout and breakdown in ultrathin SiO2-based gate dielectrics. Estimating reliability requires an extrapolation from the measeurment conditions (e.g., higher voltage) to normal operation conditions. To reduce the error in this extrapolation, long-term (>1 year) stress experiments have been used to measure the wearout and breakdown of ultrathin (<2 nm) dielectric films as close as possible to operating conditions. Measured over a sufficiently wide range of stress conditions, the time to breakdown (TBD) does not obey any simple “law” such as exponential dependence on electric field or voltage, as has been commonly assumed in reliability extrapolations. Thus, the interpretation of TBD data remains somewhat controver sial. Present research is aimed at better understanding the nature of the electrical conduction through a breakdown spot, and the effect of the oxide breakdown on device and circuit performance. In some cases an oxide breakdown may not lead to immediate circuit failure, so more research is needed in order to develop a quantitative methodology for predicting the reliability of circuits.","0018-8646","","10.1147/rd.462.0265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5388999","","","","191","9","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

The in-band interference caused by a selection of UWB signals is calculated at GSM900, UMTS/wideband code-division multiple-access (WCDMA), and Global Position System (GPS) frequency bands as a function of the UWB pulsewidth. Several short-pulse waveforms, based on the Gaussian pulse, can be used to generate UWB transmission. The two UWB system concepts studied here are time hopping and direct sequence spread spectrum. Baseband binary pulse amplitude modulation is used as the data modulation scheme. Proper selection of pulse waveform and pulsewidth allows one to avoid some rejected frequency bands up to a certain limit. However, the pulse shape is also intertwined with the data rate demands. If short-pulses are used in UWB communication the high-pass filtered waveforms are preferred according to the results. The use of long pulses, however, favors the generic Gaussian waveform instead. An UWB system suffers most from narrowband systems if the narrowband interference and the nominal center frequency of the UWB signal overlap. This is proved by bit-error rate simulations in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with interference at global system for mobile communication (GSM) and UMTS/WCDMA frequencies.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.805242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097837","","3G mobile communication;Multiaccess communication;Global Positioning System;Interference;Frequency;Narrowband;AWGN;Space vector pulse width modulation;Pulse modulation;Amplitude modulation","","190","8","13","IEEE","16 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The satellite communications industry created demand for low-mass narrow-band low-loss filters with severe specifications on amplitude selectivity and phase linearity. These requirements resulted in the development of dual-mode waveguide and dielectric-resonator filters, and advances in the design of contiguous multiplexers. Cellular communications base-stations demanded low-loss high power-handling selective filters with small physical size, capable of being manufactured in tens of thousands at a reasonable cost. These demands led to advances in coaxial resonator, dielectric resonator, and superconducting filters, and also to methods of cost-reduction, including computer-aided alignment. Cellular radio handsets have required the manufacture of hundreds of millions of extremely small very low-cost filters, still with reasonably low loss and high selectivity.

The aggregate allows personalized recommendations to be computed by members of the community, or by outsiders. The numerical algorithm is fast, robust and accurate. Our method reduces the collaborative filtering task to an iterative calculation of the aggregate requiring only addition of vectors of user data. Then we use homomorphic encryption to allow sums of encrypted vectors to be computed and decrypted without exposing individual data. We give verification schemes for all parties in the computation.

A location-tracking mechanism is introduced that consists of intersystem location updates and intersystem paging. Intersystem update is implemented by using the concept of boundary location area, which is determined by a dynamic location update policy in which the velocity and the quality of service are taken into account on a per-user basis. Also, intersystem paging is based on the concept of a boundary location register, which is used to maintain the records of mobile users crossing the boundary of systems. This mechanism not only reduces location-tracking costs, but also significantly decreases call-loss rates and average-paging delays.

A key feature of the proposed approach is real-time assessment of terrain characteristics and incorporation of this information in the robot navigation strategy. Three terrain characteristics that strongly affect its traversability, namely, roughness, slope, and discontinuity, are extracted from video images obtained by on-board cameras. This traversability data is used to infer, in real time, the terrain Fuzzy Rule-Based Traversability Index, which succinctly quantifies the ease of traversal of the regional terrain by the mobile robot. A new traverse-terrain behavior is introduced that uses the regional traversability index to guide the robot to the safest and the most traversable terrain region. The regional traverse-terrain behavior is complemented by two other behaviors, local avoid-obstacle and global seek-goal. The recommendations of these three behaviors are integrated through adjustable weighting factors to generate the final motion command for the robot. The weighting factors are adjusted automatically, based on the situational context of the robot. The terrain assessment and robot navigation algorithms Are implemented on a Pioneer commercial robot and field-test studies are conducted. These studies demonstrate that the robot possesses intelligent decision-making capabilities that are brought to bear in negotiating hazardous terrain conditions during the robot motion.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2002.1019461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019461","","Navigation;Robotics and automation;Mobile robots;Intelligent robots;Fuzzy logic;Data mining;Robot vision systems;Cameras;Decision making;Robot motion","","190","3","30","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the ability to perform this task in real time (typically for streams sent themselves in real time) is especially interesting. The problem is still unsolved because there are many parameters affecting video quality, and their combined effect is not well identified and understood. Among these parameters, we have the source bit rate, the encoded frame type, the frame rate at the source, the packet loss rate in the network, etc. Only subjective evaluations give good results but, by definition, they are not automatic. We have previously explored the possibility of using artificial neural networks (NNs) to automatically quantify the quality of video flows and we showed that they can give results well correlated with human perception. In this paper, our goal is twofold. First, we report on a significant enhancement of our method by means of a new neural approach, the random NN model, and its learning algorithm, both of which offer better performances for our application. Second, we follow our approach to study and analyze the behavior of video quality for wide range variations of a set of selected parameters. This may help in developing control mechanisms in order to deliver the best possible video quality given the current network situation, and in better understanding of QoS aspects in multimedia engineering.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2002.806808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175444","","Neural networks;Testing;Humans;Streaming media;Bit rate;Encoding;PSNR;Artificial neural networks;Quality assessment;Video compression","","189","6","41","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The motivation behind the design, the fabrication approach, and the experimental characterization are presented for two classes of devices. The first design involves multiple parallel channels with integrated filter structures to incorporate standard catalytic materials. These catalysts are in the form of finely divided porous particles in a packed-bed arrangement. The second device involves the incorporation of porous silicon as a catalyst support, in the form of a thin layer covering microstructured channels. These microstructured channels simulate the structure of a packed bed and enhance mass transfer relative to an open channel. The ability to incorporate features at the tens-of-microns scale can reduce the mass-transfer limitations by promoting mixing and dispersion for the multiple phases. Directly integrating the catalyst support structures into the channels of the microreactor allows the precise definition of the bed properties, including the support's size, shape and arrangement, and the void fraction. Such a design would find broad applicability in enhancing the transport and active surface area for sensing, chemical, and biochemical conversion devices. Reaction rates for the gas-liquid-solid hydrogenation of cyclohexene using the integrated catalyst with porous silicon as a support compare favorably to those rates obtained with the packed-bed approach. In both cases, the mass transfer coefficient is at least 100 times better than conventional laboratory reactors.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.803416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097791","","Fabrication;Microfluidics;Silicon;Inductors;Chemical technology;Filters;Micromechanical devices;Chemical reactors;Chemical analysis;Chemical processes","","189","12","46","IEEE","16 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams, and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites. We find that although most streams (about 45 percent of them) are dragonflies, lasting less than 2 seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days, and can carry a high proportion (50-60 percent) of the total bytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime (dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions. We submit that ISPs need to be aware of the distribution of Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams. In particular, any forwarding cache mechanisms in Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams. In addition ISPs should realize that long-running streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes-something they may not have allowed for when using traditional ""flat rate user bandwidth consumption"" approaches to provisioning and engineering.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2002.1039865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039865","","Internet;Transport protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Fluid flow measurement;Mice;Feedback;Aggregates;IP networks;Size measurement;Bandwidth","","188","2","10","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is shown that the product of the time-selectivity order and the frequency-selectivity order is a key parameter to characterize the outage capacity of the correlated fading channel. It is also observed that STCs with large effective lengths and ideal built-in interleavers are more effective in exploiting the natural diversity in multiple-antenna correlated fading channels. We then propose a low-density parity-check (LDPC)-code-based STC-OFDM system. Compared with the conventional space-time trellis code (STTC), the LDPC-based STC can significantly improve the system performance by exploiting both the spatial diversity and the selective-fading diversity in wireless channels. Compared with the previously proposed turbo-code-based STC scheme, LDPC-based STC exhibits lower receiver complexity and more flexible scalability. We also consider receiver design for LDPC-based STC-OFDM systems in unknown fast fading channels and propose a novel turbo receiver employing a maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization (MAP-EM) demodulator and a soft LDPC decoder, which can significantly reduce the error floor in fast fading channels with a modest computational complexity. With such a turbo receiver, the proposed LDPC-based STC-OFDM system is a promising solution to highly efficient data transmission over selective-fading mobile wireless channels.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.975756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=975756","","OFDM;Fading;Parity check codes;Frequency division multiplexing;Transmitters;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Convolutional codes;System performance;Turbo codes","","188","24","36","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additional modifications, such as dynamic adaptation of the correlation kernels, and adaptive step size estimation, were introduced for achieving robustness to photon noise, varying contrast, and apparent discontinuity and/or hollowness of structures. The end product is a labeling of all somas present, graph-theoretic representations of all dendritic/axonal structures, and image statistics such as soma volume and centroid, soma interconnectivity, the longest branch, and lengths of all graph branches originating from a soma. This method is able to work directly with unprocessed confocal images, without expensive deconvolution or other preprocessing. It is much faster that skeletonization, typically consuming less than a minute to trace a 70 MB image on a 500 MHz computer. These properties make it attractive for large-scale automated tissue studies that require rapid on-line image analysis, such as high-throughput neurobiology/angiogenesis assays, and initiatives such as the Human Brain Project.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2002.1006304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1006304","","Neurons;Kernel;Fluorescence;Microscopy;Topology;Retina;Noise robustness;Labeling;Statistics;Deconvolution","Algorithms;Animals;Feasibility Studies;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Microscopy, Confocal;Microscopy, Fluorescence;Models, Neurological;Neurons;Neurons;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","187","3","54","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Using augmented reality for teaching Earth-Sun relationships to undergraduate geography students","B. E. Shelton; N. R.

We carefully examined over thirty students who participated in an augmented reality exercise containing models designed to teach concepts of rotation/revolution, solstice/equinox, and seasonal variation of light and temperature. We found a significant overall improvement in student understanding after the AR exercise, as well as a reduction in student misunderstandings. Further analysis implies that learning complex spatial phenomena is closely linked to the way students control ""when"" and ""how"" they are able to manipulate virtual 3D objects. We present arguments for why it may be appropriate to use videotaped data gathering methods to accurately describe student understanding in future research.","","0-7803-7680-3","10.1109/ART.2002.1106948","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1106948","","Augmented reality;Education;Geography;Earth;Sun;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Paper technology;Computational Intelligence Society;Laboratories","","186","","5","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The largely graph-based current framework of the crisp DES is unsuitable for the expansion, and we have thus reformulated it using state vectors and event transition matrices which can be extended to fuzzy vectors and matrices by allowing their elements to take values between 0 and 1. To measure information related to fuzzy DES, we generalize the crisp DES observability. The new observability allows one to determine whether or not the system output observed is sufficient for decision making. Finally, we extend the optimal control of DES to fuzzy DES. The new fuzzy DES theory is consistent with the existing theory, both at the conceptual and the computation levels, in that the former contains the latter as a special case when the memberships must be either 0 or 1. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical development.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2002.1018761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1018761","","Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Discrete event systems;Humans;Observability;Computer networks;Optimal control;Automatic control;Protocols;Network synthesis","","186","","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The neurocontroller design uses a novel technique based on the adaptive critic designs (ACDs), specifically on heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) and dual heuristic programming (DHP). Results show that both neurocontrollers are robust, but that DHP outperforms HDP or conventional controllers, especially when the system conditions and configuration change. This paper also shows how to design optimal neurocontrollers for nonlinear systems, such as turbogenerators, without having to do continually online training of the neural networks, thus avoiding risks of instability.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.1000146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000146","","Dynamic programming;Neurocontrollers;Turbogenerators;Voltage;Regulators;Turbines;Power grids;Robust control;Control systems;Nonlinear systems","","186","6","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulated annealing is particularly well suited for a large combinatorial optimization problem since it can avoid local minima by accepting improvements in cost. However, it often requires a meaningful cooling schedule and a special strategy, which makes use of the property of distribution systems in finding the optimal solution. In this paper, we augment the cost function with the operation condition of distribution systems, improve the perturbation mechanism with system topology, and use the polynomial-time cooling schedule, which is based on the statistical calculation during the search. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in the Korea Electric Power Corporation's distribution system.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2002.803823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046886","","Simulated annealing;Intelligent networks;Large-scale systems;Cooling;Switches;Computational modeling;Scheduling;Genetic algorithms;Minimization methods;Cost function","","186","","22","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The prior is a description of the dynamic behavior we expect for the targets which is modeled as constant velocity motion with a Gaussian disturbance acting on the target's heading direction. The likelihood function is arrived at by defining an uninformative prior for both the signals and noise variance and removing these parameters from the problem by marginalization. Advances in sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) techniques, specifically the particle filter algorithm, allow us to model and track the posterior distribution defined by the Bayesian model using a collection of target states that can be viewed as samples from the posterior of interest. We describe two versions of this algorithm and finally present results obtained using synthetic data.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.978377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=978377","","Sensor arrays;Bayesian methods;Target tracking;Particle tracking;Particle filters;Direction of arrival estimation;Monte Carlo methods;Distributed computing;Signal processing algorithms;Sliding mode control","","186","3","13","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This requires new analysis tools for understanding system performance. This paper presents an adaptive distributed power flow solution method based on the compensation-based method. The comprehensive distributed system model includes 3-phase nonlinear loads, lines, capacitors, transformers, and dispersed generation units. The numerical properties of the compensation-based power flow method are compared and analyzed under different situations, such as load unbalance, sudden increase of 1-phase loads, degree of meshed loops, number of generator nodes, and so on. Based on these analyses, an adaptive compensation-based power flow method is proposed that is fast and reliable while maintaining necessary accuracy. It is shown that this adaptive method is especially appropriate for simulation of slow dynamics.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2002.1022810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022810","","Load flow;Distributed power generation;Power generation;Performance analysis;System performance;Power system modeling;Capacitors;Transformers;Load flow analysis;Maintenance","","186","","7","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

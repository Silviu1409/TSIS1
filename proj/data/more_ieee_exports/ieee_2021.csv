There is a growing trend of applying DRL to mobile robot navigation. In this paper, we review DRL methods and DRL-based navigation frameworks. Then we systematically compare and analyze the relationship and differences between four typical application scenarios: local obstacle avoidance, indoor navigation, multi-robot navigation, and social navigation. Next, we describe the development of DRL-based navigation. Last, we discuss the challenges and some possible solutions regarding DRL-based navigation.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409758","mobile robot navigation;obstacle avoidance;deep reinforcement learning","Navigation;Mobile robots;Reinforcement learning;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Robots;Task analysis;Robot sensing systems","","218","","","","20 Apr 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The number and complexity of new attacks continue to rise; therefore, effective and intelligent solutions are necessary. Unsupervised machine learning techniques are particularly appealing to intrusion detection systems since they can detect known and unknown types of attacks as well as zero-day attacks. In the current paper, we present an unsupervised anomaly detection method, which combines Sub-Space Clustering (SSC) and One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to detect attacks without any prior knowledge. The proposed approach is evaluated using the well-known NSL-KDD dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our method performs better than some of the existing techniques.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9147152","unsupervised learning;clustering;intrusion detection;feature selection","Anomaly detection;Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Complexity theory","","125","","","","24 Jul 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Task offloading incurs extra communication latency and energy cost, and extensive efforts have focused on offloading schemes. Many metrics of the system utility are defined to achieve satisfactory quality of experience. However, most existing works overlook the balance between throughput and fairness. This study investigates the problem of finding an optimal offloading scheme in which the objective of optimization aims to maximize the system utility for leveraging between throughput and fairness. Based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition, the expectation of time complexity is analyzed to derive the optimal scheme. A gradient-based approach for utility-aware task offloading is given. Furthermore, we provide an increment-based greedy approximation algorithm with 1 + 1/e-1 ratio. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve effective performance in utility and accuracy.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9147161","utility;approximation algorithm;quality of experience;mobile edge computing","Task analysis;Optimization;Energy consumption;Approximation algorithms;Delays;Servers;Quality of experience","","73","","","","24 Jul 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"
"A multi-objective optimization method of initial virtual machine fault-tolerant placement for star topological data centers of cloud systems","W. Zhang; X. Chen; J. Jiang","School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China",Tsinghua Science and Technology,"19 Jun 2020","2021","26","1","95","111","Virtualization is the most important technology in the unified resource layer of cloud computing systems. Static placement and dynamic management are two types of Virtual Machine (VM) management methods. VM dynamic management is based on the structure of the initial VM placement, and this initial structure will affect the efficiency of VM dynamic management. When a VM fails, cloud applications deployed on the faulty VM will crash if fault tolerance is not considered. In this study, a model of initial VM fault-tolerant placement for star topological data centers of cloud systems is built on the basis of multiple factors, including the service-level agreement violation rate, resource remaining rate, power consumption rate, failure rate, and fault tolerance cost. Then, a heuristic ant colony algorithm is proposed to solve the model. The service-providing VMs are placed by the ant colony algorithms, and the redundant VMs are placed by the conventional heuristic algorithms.

HILS implementation using digital signal processors (DSPs) and field programmable gate array (FPGA) for electric machine drives has been investigated but those methods have drawbacks such as complexity in development and verification. Among various HILS implementation approaches, more efficient development and verification for electric machine drives can be achieved through use of commercial real time machines. As well as implementation of the HILS, accurate modeling of a control target system plays an important role. Therefore, modeling trend in electric machine drives for HILS implementation is needed to be reviewed. This paper provides a background of HILS and commercially available real time machines and characteristics of each real time machine are introduced.

In this paper, a novel voting-based deep learning framework, called VNN, is proposed to take the advantage of any kinds of deep learning structures. Considering several models created by different aspects of data and various deep learning structures, VNN provides the ability to aggregate the best models in order to create more accurate and robust results. Therefore, VNN helps the security specialists to detect more complicated attacks. Experimental results over KDDCUP'99 and CTU-13, as two well known and more widely employed datasets in computer network area, revealed the voting procedure was highly effective to increase the system performance, where the false alarms were reduced up to 75% in comparison with the original deep learning models, including Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312777","deep learning;Voting-based Neural Network (VNN);network security;Pearson correlation coefficient","Deep learning;Data models;Mathematical model;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Recurrent neural networks;Computational modeling","","40","","","","4 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To improve the speed response, a compensating voltage component is supplemented by an amending integrator. The compensating voltage is a coalition of drift and offset voltages, and reduces DC drift and initial value issues. During low-speed operation, inaccurate voltage acquisition distorts the stator voltage critically, and it becomes considerable when the stator voltage of the machine is low. Implementing a three-level neutral point clamped inverter in speed-sensorless decoupled control of an induction motor improves the performance of the drive with superior quality of inverter output voltage. Further, the performance of the induction motor drive is improved by replacing the proportional-integral (PI) controller in the adaption mechanism of RF-MRAS with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) controller. A prototype model of the three-level neutral point clamped inverter (3L-NPC)-fed induction motor drive is fabricated in a laboratory, and its performance for a RF-MRAS, modified RFMRAS, and modified RFMRAS using ANFIS are compared using different benchmark tests.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2021.000017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9479933","Induction motor drive;vector control;neutral point clamped inverter;model reference adaptive system;ANFIS","Rotors;Adaptation models;Inverters;Mathematical model;Adaptive systems;Voltage control;Torque","","25","","","","9 Jul 2021","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

To evaluate the asymmetry and discriminate fault types, the magnitude ratio of the positive sequence to the negative sequence of phase currents is designed as a fault detection index. Thereafter, the DC components of the phase currents in different reference frames are utilized to locate faults. Specifically, the polarities of the DC contents in the natural reference frame are utilized to locate a single OCF and two OCFs in different legs.

The polar emotions of cartoon materials are an important reference for creators as they can help them easily obtain the pictures they need. Some methods for obtaining the emotions of cartoon pictures have been proposed, but most of these focus on expression recognition. Meanwhile, other emotion recognition methods are not ideal for use as cartoon materials. We propose a deep learning-based method to classify the polar emotions of the cartoon pictures of the ""Moe"" drawing style. According to the expression feature of the cartoon characters of this drawing style, we recognize the facial expressions of cartoon characters and extract the scene and facial features of the cartoon images. Then, we correct the emotions of the pictures obtained by the expression recognition according to the scene features. Finally, we can obtain the polar emotions of corresponding picture. We designed a dataset and performed verification tests on it, achieving 81.9% experimental accuracy.

Since the extracted features are unique for each modulation, they can be considered as a fingerprint of each modulation. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the previously published methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and success rate. For example, the success rate of the proposed method for 64-QAM modulation at SNR=11 dB is 99%. Another advantage of the proposed method is its wide SNR range; such that the probability of classification for 16-QAM at SNR=3 dB is almost 1. The proposed method also provides a database for geometrical features of I-Q constellation diagram. By comparing and correlating the data of the provided database with the estimated I-Q diagram of the received signal, the processing gain of 4 dB is obtained.

For the load balancing routing, the traffic bottleneck in the network can be resolved. However, it can decrease QoT because the routes may passthrough multiple hops. On the other hand, the QoT aware routing often improves the QoT of the routes, but it can increase thetraffic bottleneck due to the unbalanced traffic load in the network. Therefore, the investigation of load balancing routing taking into account QoT is very essential, especially in the case of a wideand ultra-high speed WMN. In this paper, we propose a load balancing routing algorithm under the constraints of QoT for WMN. Our method uses the principle of the software defined networking (SDN) to choose the load balancing routes satisfying the constraints of QoT.

The original SAR image is transformed into the additive noise model by logarithmic transform with deviation correction. Then, we use the pixel and its nearest neighbors as a vector to select training samples from the local window by LPG based on the block similar matching. The LPG method ensures that only the similar sample patches are used in the local statistical calculation of PCA transform estimation, so that the local features of the image can be well preserved after coefficients shrinkage in the PCA domain.

Scalability is one of the most attractive features of microservices. Scaling in the microservices architecture requires the scaling of specified services only, rather than the entire application. Scaling services can be achieved by deploying the same service multiple times on different physical machines. However, problems with load balancing may arise. Most existing solutions of microservices load balancing focus on individual tasks and ignore dependencies between these tasks. In the present paper, we propose TCLBM, a task chain-based load balancing algorithm for microservices. When an Application Programming Interface (API) request is received, TCLBM chooses target services for all tasks of this API call and achieves load balancing by evaluating the system resource usage of each service instance. TCLBM reduces the API response time by reducing data transmissions between physical machines. We use three heuristic algorithms, namely, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Genetic Algorithm (GA), to implement TCLBM, and comparison results reveal that GA performs best. Our findings show that TCLBM achieves load balancing among service instances and reduces API response times by up to 10% compared with existing methods.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9220751","load balancing;microservices;task chain","Task analysis;Load management;Data communication;Heuristic algorithms;Time factors;Containers;Genetic algorithms","","15","","","","12 Oct 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, in practice, the resolution and illumination of EFWI are limited by the bandwidth and aperture of seismic data. The often-present wells in developed fields as well as some exploratory regions can provide complementary information of the target area. We, thus, introduce a regularization technique, which combines the surface seismic and well log data, to help improve the resolution of EFWI. We use deep neural networks to learn the statistical relations between some selected features of the inverted model and the facies interpreted from well logs. The selected features are the means and variances of the inverted velocities defined within Gaussian windows. Using multiple fully connected layers, we train our neural networks to identify the relation between the means and variances at the well location and those from the inverted model. The network is used to map the means and variances extracted from the well to the whole model domain. We then perform another EFWI in which we fit the predicted data to the observed ones as well as fit the model over a Gaussian window to the predicted means and variances. The tests on synthetic and real seismic data demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the resolution and illumination of deep-buried reservoirs, which often encounter poor illumination from seismic data.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623962","Image processing;Inverse theory;Waveform inversion;Seismic tomography","","","15","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The model can improve the result of a evolutionary game and facilitate the completion of the task. First, based on the multi-agent theory, to solve the existing problems in the original model, a negative feedback tax penalty mechanism is proposed to guide the strategy selection of individuals in the group. In addition, in order to evaluate the evolutionary game results of the group in the model, a calculation method of the group intelligence level is defined. Secondly, the Q-learning algorithm is used to improve the guiding effect of the negative feedback tax penalty mechanism. In the model, the selection strategy of the Q-learning algorithm is improved and a bounded rationality evolutionary game strategy is proposed based on the rule of evolutionary games and the consideration of the bounded rationality of individuals.

The quasi-linear frequency modulation (quasi-LFM) radar waveforms (LFM, Frank code, P1-P4 code) have similar time-frequency distributions, and it is difficult to identify such signals using traditional time-frequency analysis methods. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an algorithm for automatic recognition of quasi-LFM radar waveforms based on fractional Fourier transform and time-frequency analysis. First of all, fractional Fourier transform and the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) are used to determine the number of main ridgelines and the tilt angle of the target component in WVD. Next, the standard deviation of the target component's width in the signal's WVD is calculated. Finally, an assembled classifier using neural network is built to recognize different waveforms by automatically combining the three features. Simulation results show that the overall recognition rate of the proposed algorithm reaches 94.17% under 0 dB. When the training data set and the test data set are mixed with noise, the recognition rate reaches 89.93%. The best recognition accuracy is achieved when the size of the training set is taken as 400. The algorithm complexity can meet the requirements of real-time recognition.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612136","quasi-linear frequency modulation (quasi-LFM) radar waveform;time-frequency distribution;fractional Fourier transform (FrFT);assembled classifier","Time-frequency analysis;Codes;Radar;Manganese;Frequency modulation;Fourier transforms;Classification algorithms","","13","","","","11 Nov 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

In order to analyze the damage characteristics and the residual strength of the composite structure, the frequency, energy, size, and depth of the damage are studied, and the situation of missing detection during the inspection is considered. The structural residual strength and total maintenance cost are quantified corresponding to different inspection intervals. The proposed optimization method relieves the constraints in previous simulation methods, and is more consistent with the actual situation. Finally, the outer wing of aircraft is taken as an example, and with the historical cases and experimental data, the optimization method is verified.

As a result, a faster convergence rate of state variables is achieved. Furthermore, based on the integral sliding mode (ISM) and above geometric homogeneity, a self-adapting high-order sliding mode (HOSM) control law is proposed for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertainties.

With the proposed metric, the improved SCL scheme based on special nodes (SN) decoders was developed. This decoder will be denoted by GSCLF. The main idea of the proposed decoder is joint using of two approaches: first one is a fast decoding of special nodes in binary tree representation of polar code (e.g., some special nodes in tree representation of polar code that allow efficient list decoding with low complexity) and the second one is an applying of additional decoding attempts (flips) in the case when initial decoding was erroneous. The simultaneous use of these two approaches results in both a significant reduction in spatial complexity and a significant reduction in the number of computations required for decoding whereas keeping excellent performance.

A common fault in a three-phase PWM rectifier is the open-circuit fault of the switch. This paper analyzes the current waveform distortion of the square wave motor when the rectifier switch fault, and proposes different fault-tolerant control strategies for different situations of switch fault, include single, double and triple switches fault. This method is based on several special driving modes under power generation situation of square wave motor. The strategy is easy to implement and does not need to change the circuit topology. It can realize fault-tolerant control of switch faults in the same side half bridge or the same bridge arm of the three-phase PWM rectifier.

However, traditional approaches such as first-touch and memory policy fall short in false page-sharing, fragmentation, or ease of use. In this paper, we propose a partitioned shared-memory approach that allows multithreaded applications to achieve full NUMA-awareness with only minor code changes and develop an accompanying NUMA-aware heap manager which eliminates false page-sharing and minimizes fragmentation.

In this paper, the multi-satellite distributed coordinating and scheduling problem considering emergent tasks is studied. Due to the limitation of onboard computational resources and time, common online onboard rescheduling methods for such problems usually adopt simple greedy methods, sacrificing the solution quality to deliver timely solutions. To better solve the problem, a new multi-satellite onboard scheduling and coordinating framework based on multi-solution integration is proposed. This method uses high computational power on the ground and generates multiple solutions, changing the complex onboard rescheduling problem to a solution selection problem. With this method, it is possible that little time is used to generate a solution that is as good as the solutions on the ground. We further propose several multi-satellite coordination methods based on the multi-agent Markov decision process (MMDP) and mixed-integer programming (MIP). These methods enable the satellite to make independent decisions and produce high-quality solutions. Compared with the traditional centralized scheduling method, the proposed distributed method reduces the cost of satellite communication and increases the response speed for emergent tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed multi-solution integration framework and the distributed coordinating strategies are efficient and effective for onboard scheduling considering emergent tasks.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679710","agile satellite scheduling;emergent task;onboard rescheduling;distributed coordinating;multi-solution integration","Task analysis;Satellites;Processor scheduling;Real-time systems;Heuristic algorithms;Uncertainty;Programming","","7","","","","12 Jan 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

By employing the virtual age method, the impact of external shocks on the system degradation process is characterized by random virtual age increment in the two stages, resulting in the corresponding two-stage virtual age process. When operating in the defective state, the system becomes more susceptible to fatigue and suffers from a greater aging rate.

Additionally, the torque density can be extended to wider scale before saturation. Multi-objective optimization based on differential evolution (DE) coupled with finite element method (FEM) is conducted to further improve the performance of the proposed machine. When compared to traditional flux-controllable machine, the PMAHEM exhibits the merits of: (1) higher torque density per PM volume, (2) lower torque ripple, and (3) wider flux controllable range.

Compared with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) based methods, TCAM uses fewer frequency search points. In this way, the proposed method reduces complex multiplications, and uses real multiplications instead of improving the accuracy of the Doppler frequency and the Doppler rate. Furthermore, the differential process between two adjacent milliseconds is used for avoiding the impact of bit transition and the Doppler frequency on the integration peak. The results demonstrate that due to the reduction of complex multiplications, the computational cost of TCAM is lower than that of the FFT based method under the same signal to noise ratio (SNR).","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9574644","high-dynamic and weak signal environment;compressed acquisition;frequency parameters estimation","Doppler effect;Frequency estimation;Frequency synthesizers;Signal to noise ratio;Global navigation satellite system;Costs;Correlation","","5","","","","14 Oct 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

This equalizer is based on a two-layer hierarchical modular architecture. The top string-to-module (S2M) layer consists of a half-bridge inverter and a voltage multiplier (VM) rectifier, and the bottom cell-to-cell (C2C) layer is implemented by bidirectional buck-boost units. Without state-of-charge (SOC) estimation, the battery charge can be automatically transferred from high-voltage cell-modules/cells to low-voltage ones. Only a pair of symmetrical pulse width modulation (PWM) driving signals with fixed switching frequency and duty cycle are required. This reduces the control complexity remarkably. Meanwhile, the balancing current of each balancing path naturally attenuates with the convergence of cell-module/cell voltages. This ensures a fast balancing of cell-module/cell with large voltage mismatch. The battery-recovery-effect induced balancing error is also effectively mitigated. Moreover, simple control facilitates a simultaneous module and cell voltage balancing in static, charging, and discharging conditions. The operation principles are analyzed in detail. An experimental platform with eight series-connected batteries is built and tested. The measured results well validate the theoretical analysis. Both cell and module voltages automatically converge with clearly mitigated recovery effect.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2021.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9675070","Battery equalizer;battery recovery effect;current-converge;open-loop control","Equalizers;Batteries;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Capacitors;Rectifiers;Switches","","4","","","","7 Jan 2022","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

The philosophy behind this could be described by the Chinese traditional culture symbol of “yin” and “yang”. A wireless network having optimal performance must be a harmonious network where the interfering and useful signals harmoniously coexist in an optimal balance. Interference management plays a critical role in achieving this optimal balance, while sophisticated interference management techniques should be designed to improve the system performance.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2021.0013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9622202","harmonious wireless networks;duality;complementarity principle;yin and yang;interference management","Interference;Wireless networks;Relays;Precoding;Receivers;Array signal processing;Throughput","","3","","","","19 Nov 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Broad applicability of the results was ensured by generating 100 sets of robot parameters at random from a carefully selected design space, comparing the performance of the rigid, revolute and prismatic spine morphology. Using bootstrapping techniques, it was determined with a 78.8% probability that the prismatic spine morphology was the optimal spine for these long-time-horizon trajectories.

In practice, appropriate triggering threshold values can be obtained through simulation given the level of measurement noise and a rough range of potential measurement outliers. A clustering based approach is proposed to further improve the robustness of localization solution against reference sensor related outliers. Simulations are included to examine the solution's performance and compare it with several benchmarks.

To this end, in this paper we propose a resource allocation approach for uplink transmissions within a random access procedure in MTC by exploiting multichannel selection diversity, coined explore-before-talk (EBT). Each user in EBT first sends pilot signals through multiple channels that are initially allocated by a base station (BS) for exploration, and then the BS informs a subset of initially allocated channels that are associated with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for data packet transmission by the user while releasing the rest of the channels for other users. Consequently, EBT exploits a multichannel selection diversity gain during data packet transmission, at the cost of exploration during pilot transmission. We optimize this exploration-exploitation trade-off, by deriving closed-form mean data rate and resource outage probability expressions. Numerical results corroborate that EBT achieves a higher mean data rate while satisfying the same outage constraint, compared to a conventional MTC protocol without exploration.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2020.000029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377691","Machine-type communication;multichannel selection diversity;resource allocation;uplink transmission","Uplink;Signal to noise ratio;Resource management;Channel estimation;Internet of Things;Data models;Diversity methods","","2","","","","12 Mar 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

We propose an automatic spatio-temporal change detection method by identifying the temporary coherent scatterers. Based on amplitude time series, x2-test and iterative single pixel change detection are proposed to identify all step-times: the moments of the surface change. Then the parameters, e.g., deformation velocity and relative height, are estimated and corresponding coherent periods are identified by using interferometric phase time series. With identified temporary coherent scatterers, different types of temporal surface changes can be classified using the location of the coherent periods and spatial significant changes are identified combining point density and F values. The main advantage of our method is automatically detecting spatio-temporal surface changes without prior information. Experimental results by the proposed method show that both appearing and disappearing buildings with their step-times are successfully identified and results by ascending and descending SAR images show a good agreement.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679700","change detection;temporary coherent scatterer;multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);amplitude analysis","Time series analysis;Synthetic aperture radar;Urban areas;Optical interferometry;Lead;Faces;Calibration","","2","","","","12 Jan 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"
"Security enhanced dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm against degradation attacks in next generation passive optical networks","",,Journal of Optical Communications and Networking,"10 Sep 2021","2021","13","12","301","311","The dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm is highly impactful in improving the network performance of gigabit passive optical networks (GPON). However, reports delineating its vulnerability to certain attacks can be found in the literature, thus raising concerns. A degradation attack manipulates the transmission control protocol (TCP) congestion control algorithm, which may impact the received bandwidth of targeted network users. Here, the absence of electronics within the passive splitter renders attack identification in GPONs a significant challenge. Therefore, the current study aimed to propose a secured DBA mechanism known as security enhanced DBA capable of overcoming this particular threat. A detection phase served as a critical component for sensing and subsequently mitigating any abnormal behaviors observed among optical network units (ONUs). Upon identification of the attacker, penalties were imposed to deter the next attack attempt and reestablish the fairness to previously attacked ONUs. The simulation findings revealed throughput improvement of up to 63% due to the security feature offered by the mechanism. Besides, significant improvements for the upstream delay performance recorded at 52%, 60%, and 65% for traffic containers (TCONT) TCONT2, TCONT3, and TCONT4, respectively, were observed in comparison to the non-secure DBA mechanism. Hence, the integration of the security mechanisms in DBA renders it possible to avoid any exploitation of GPON vulnerability in hacking other users’ bandwidth.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.434739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534886","","Optical network units;Bandwidth;Passive optical networks;Degradation;Standards;Protocols;Channel allocation","","2","","","","10 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed efficient algorithm can improve the time utilization ratio (TUR) by 9%, the hit value ratio (HVR) by 3.5%, and reduce the task drop ratio (TDR) by 6% in comparison with existing dwell scheduling algorithms considering pulse interleaving in PAR and the proposed efficient one.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612135","dynamic template;dwell scheduling;pulse interleaving","Task analysis;Radar;Scheduling algorithms;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Adaptive scheduling;Signal to noise ratio","","2","","","","11 Nov 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

However, the steady-state behaviour and performance of this particular generator are not yet to be theoretically investigated. This paper therefore presents the first theoretical investigation based on the steady-state equivalent circuit model for standalone TSCAOI configured generators. Moreover, this paper is the first to adopt the winding function approach to derive a dynamic mathematical model for TSCAOI configured generators. This approach not only eliminates the cumbersome mathematical manipulation required in all previous papers related to TSCAOI configured generators but also provides a visual insight into the resulting winding distribution of the machine. In order to investigate the load and excitation characteristics pertinently, the dynamic model is transformed into two different equivalent circuit models by appropriate selected transformation matrix. Using these two models, this paper identified the impacts of system parameters on the load and excitation characteristics, as well as on the level of voltage unbalance. Experimental results of a prototype generator under various operating conditions are presented, together with simulated results, to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed investigations.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2021.00002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9399332","Equivalent circuit model;induction generator;single-phase electricity generation;TSCAOI configuration","Windings;Generators;Rotors;Load modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Equivalent circuits;Steady-state","","2","","","","8 Apr 2021","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

Each subsystem is an individual agent component, which manages itself autonomously and reacts to the requirements from other agents. To reduce computing burden on a specified computer and improve the suitability and flexibility of the integrated simulation system, a distributed framework is employed in the system by deploying agent components on different computers. The data transmission among agents is based on the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP). A practical example of sun pointing is used to test the operating effect of the integrated system and the working condition of subsystems. The simulation results verify that the integrated system has higher sun pointing accuracy, quicker dynamical response to variations of the lighting, attitude and temperature and fewer computing resources with effective and accurate subsystems.

The paper presents evidence of student learning relating to ethics found in student assignments submitted in partial fulfillment of a capstone course that forms part of the undergraduate program for Electrical Engineering at the University of Cape Town. Evidence of student learning will be linked to three distinct theories of learning that are presented and contrasted as metaphors: a theory of learning that assumes transference and is acquisition-based; a theory of learning that assumes transference by means of participation within a community and a theory of learning that is activity-centered and aims to be transformative. Each of these theories will be linked to particular teaching approaches and assessment strategies. The learning theories provide a frame to examine evidence of student learning relating to ethics in a particular context. This process justifies an expanded conception of learning relating to ethics in engineering.","1991-1696","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580770","ethics in engineering;online learning;teaching and learning ethics;graduate attributes;engineering identity","Ethics;Education;Knowledge engineering;Electrical engineering;Affordances;Visualization;Standards","","2","","","","1 Nov 2021","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

For two-state Markovian source, we consider two different types of estimators at the base station, and characterize the optimal update policy.

We describe a method to determine the ‘local’ seeing degradation due to wavefront perturbations within the final few metres of the optical path from celestial sources to the focal plane of a ground-based telescope, using the primary instrument and along the same path taken by light from celestial sources. The concept involves placing strobed emitters along the light path to produce images on the main focal plane that ‘freeze’ different realizations of index perturbations. This method has the advantage of measuring directly the image motion and scintillation imparted by the dynamic spatial and temporal structure of local perturbations in the index of refraction along the light path, with a clean separation from seeing induced in the atmosphere above the dome. The strobed-source approach allows for rapid image motion and scintillation to be measured directly on the focal plane, even for large-aperture telescopes with wide-field instruments and slow shutters, such as that being constructed for the Rubin Observatory. A conceptual design is presented that uses the ‘guider’ CCDs in the Rubin telescope focal plane to make local-seeing measurements on demand, perhaps even during science exposures.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646722","atmospheric effects;instrumentation: adaptive optics;telescopes","","","1","","","","10 Dec 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Brain signal classification is a challenging issue owing to the high-dimensional data and low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, a novel method is proposed to cope with this problem through sparse representation for the P300 speller paradigm. This work is distinguished using two key contributions. First, we investigate sparse coding and its feasibility for brain signal classification. Training signals are used to learn the dictionaries and test signals are classified according to their sparse representation and reconstruction errors. Second, sample selection and a channel-aware dictionary are proposed to reduce the effect of noise, which can improve performance and enhance the computing efficiency simultaneously. A novel classification method from the sample set perspective is proposed to exploit channel correlations. Specifically, the brain signal of each channel is classified jointly using its spatially neighboring channels and a novel weighted regulation strategy is proposed to overcome outliers in the group. Experimental results have demonstrated that our methods are highly effective. We achieve a state-of-the-art recognition rate of 72.5%, 88.5%, and 98.5% at 5, 10, and 15 epochs, respectively, on BCI Competition III Dataset II.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312773","sparse representation;sample selection;channel-aware dictionary;P300 speller","Dictionaries;Training;Encoding;Electroencephalography;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Task analysis","","1","","","","4 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Two approaches are combined to tackle this problem: the discrete cosine transform (DCT) approach, used in the forward modelling step, and the variational Bayesian (VB) approach, used in the inverse reconstruction step. VB can provide not only point estimates but also closed forms of the full posterior probability distributions. To efficiently compute such estimates of the full joint posterior distributions of large-scale seismic inverse problems, we resort to a DCT order-reduction scheme with a VB approximation of the posteriors, avoiding the need for costly Bayesian sampling methods. More specifically, we first reduce the model parameters through truncation of their DCT coefficients. This helps regularizing our seismic inverse problem and alleviates its computational complexity. Then, we apply a VB inference in the reduced-DCT space to estimate the dominant (retained) DCT coefficients together with the variance of the observational noise. We also present an efficient implementation of the derived VB-based algorithm for further cost reduction. The performances of the proposed scheme are evaluated through extensive numerical experiments for both linear and nonlinear forward models. In the former, the subsurface reflectivity model was reconstructed at a comparable estimation accuracy as the optimal weighted-regularized-least-squares solution. In the latter, the main structural features of the squared slowness model were well reconstructed.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717196","Inverse theory;Probability distribution;Waveform inversion","","","1","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In fact, time has been a recurring aspect in HCI research for the past 30 years. Based on this continuous and growing interest in HCI research, we find it to be a good time to explore if ‘time’ can be used as a way to structure and organize HCI research. In this paper, we make one such attempt based on a literature study in which we have focused on how time and temporality has been addressed in HCI research during the past 30 years. In our overview of the field, we explore how time and temporality has played out in HCI along the two dimensions of what and how it has been studied. Based on these two dimensions, we created a 4 × 4 matrix that allowed us to filter the material and categorize HCI research in relation to time and temporality. As a result of our explorations, we have identified a turn to temporality as a design material in HCI, an interest in methods for temporality studies in HCI and in temporality as a theoretical lens. We end with a discussion of some implications of our findings around the notions of (i) waves of time and temporality studies in HCI research, (ii) the potential use of the 4 × 4 matrix and (iii) the consequences of a more fundamental shift from things to events.","1873-7951","","10.1093/iwc/iwab025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646577","interactivity;interaction;temporality;time;HCI","","","1","","","","10 Dec 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our plug-and-play control approach means that the modular active capacitor can be directly connected to the DC bus without any extra connections, just like a passive capacitor. The proposed modular design improves the overall reliability, providing fault tolerance operation. We investigate the application of our type of active capacitor in DC microgrids, where multiple active capacitors are distributed at different nodes. It is shown that ripple power can be shared in proportion to the storage capacity of the active capacitors without any communication between them. We also offer a mathematical stability analysis of a DC microgrid in which the admittances of all the devices satisfy a certain condition that is less restrictive than being positive-real (and which is satisfied by our proposed design).

The latter provides estimates of the properties of the subsurface, which can be used to aid structural interpretation alongside the original seismic data and a number of other seismic attributes. In this work, we redefine this process as an inverse problem which tries to jointly estimate subsurface properties (i.e. acoustic impedance) and a piece-wise segmented representation of the subsurface based on user-defined macroclasses. By inverting for the quantities simultaneously, the inversion is primed with prior knowledge about the regions of interest, whilst at the same time it constrains this belief with the actual seismic measurements. As the proposed functional is separable in the two quantities, these are optimized in an alternating fashion, where each subproblem is solved using the Primal-Dual algorithm. Subsequently, the final segmented model is used as input to an ad hoc workflow that extracts the perimeter of the detected shapes and produces a structural framework (i.e. seismic horizons) consistent with the estimated subsurface properties. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through numerical examples on synthetic and field data sets.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623734","Image processing;Inverse theory;Numerical solutions;Computational seismology","","","1","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Transcending the limitations of purely correlative neuroimaging measures and experimental sensory stimulation, they allow to experimentally manipulate brain activity and study its consequences for perception, cognition, and eventually, behavior. Although this is true in principle, particular caution is advised when interpreting brain stimulation experiments in a causal manner. Research hypotheses are often oversimplified, disregarding the underlying (implicitly assumed) complex chain of causation, namely, that the stimulation technique has to generate an electric field in the brain tissue, which then evokes or modulates neuronal activity both locally in the target region and in connected remote sites of the network, which in consequence affects the cognitive function of interest and eventually results in a change of the behavioral measure. Importantly, every link in this causal chain of effects can be confounded by several factors that have to be experimentally eliminated or controlled to attribute the observed results to their assumed cause. This is complicated by the fact that many of the mediating and confounding variables are not directly observable and dose–response relationships are often nonlinear. We will walk the reader through the chain of causation for a generic cognitive neuroscience NIBS study, discuss possible confounds, and advise appropriate control conditions. If crucial assumptions are explicitly tested (where possible) and confounds are experimentally well controlled, NIBS can indeed reveal cause–effect relationships in cognitive neuroscience studies.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_01591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314347","","","","1","","","Open Access","5 Jan 2021","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Early definitions recognized two social actors as role equivalent, if they have identical relationships to the same other actors. Although this rather strong equivalence requirement has been relaxed in different ways, it is often challenging to detect interesting, non-trivial role equivalences, especially for social networks derived from empirical data. Multi-layer networks (MLNs) are increasingly gaining popularity for modelling collective adaptive systems, for example, engineered cyber-physical systems or animal collectives. Multiplex networks, a special case of MLNs, transparently and compactly describe such complex interactions (social, biological, transportation), where nodes can be connected by links of different types. In this work, we first propose a novel notion of exact and approximate role equivalence for multiplex MLNs. Then, we implement and experimentally evaluate the algorithm on a suite of real-world case studies. Results demonstrate that our notion of approximate role assignment not only obtains non-trivial partitions over nodes and layers as well, but it provides a fine-grained hierarchy of role equivalences, which is impossible to obtain by (combining) the existing role detection techniques. We demonstrate the latter by interpreting in detail the case study of Florence families, a classical benchmark from literature.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnab027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9619560","multi-layer networks;role assignment;exact and approximate model reduction","","","1","","","","18 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We propose to measure the 3D topology of ionized regions using the Betti numbers. These quantify the topology using the number of components, tunnels, and cavities in any given field. Based on the results for a set of reionization simulations we find that the Betti numbers of the ionization field show a characteristic evolution during reionization, with peaks in the different Betti numbers characterizing different stages of the process. The shapes of their evolutionary curves can be fitted with simple analytical functions. We also observe that the evolution of the Betti numbers shows a clear connection with the percolation of the ionized and neutral regions and differs between different reionization scenarios. Through these properties, the Betti numbers provide a more useful description of the topology than the widely studied Euler characteristic or genus. The morphology of the ionization field will be imprinted on the redshifted 21-cm signal from the EoR. We construct mock image cubes using the properties of the low-frequency element of the future Square Kilometre Array and show that we can extract the Betti numbers from such data sets if an observation time of 1000 h is used. Even for a much shorter observation time of 100 h, some topological information can be extracted for the middle and later stages of reionization. We also find that the topological information extracted from the mock 21-cm observations can put constraints on reionization models.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab1320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9491178","galaxies: high-redshift;intergalactic medium;cosmology: theory;dark ages;reionization;first stars;early Universe","","","1","","","","20 Jul 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

An innovative dependency matrix (called combinatorial dependency matrix) composed of three submatrices is presented.

In this work, we investigate this possibility by analysing the range of SIDM scattering cross-section per unit mass, σ/mχ, able to explain such anticorrelation. We simulate the orbital evolution of dSphs subhaloes around the MW assuming an analytical form for the gravitational potential, adopting the proper motions from the Gaia mission and including a consistent characterization of gravitational tidal stripping. The evolution of subhalo density profiles is modelled using the gravothermal fluid formalism, where DM particle collisions induce thermal conduction that depends on σ/mχ. We find that models of dSphs, such as Carina and Fornax, reproduce the observed central DM densities with fixed σ/mχ ranging between 30 and 50 cm2 g−1, whereas other dSphs prefer larger values ranging between 70 and 100 cm2 g−1. These cross-sections correlate with the average collision velocity of DM particles within each subhalo's core, so that systems modelled with large cross-sections have lower collision velocities. We fit the cross-section–velocity correlation with a SIDM particle model, where a DM particle of mass mχ = 53.93 ± 9.81 GeV interacts under the exchange of a light mediator of mass mϕ = 6.6 ± 0.43 MeV, with the self-interactions being described by a Yukawa potential. The outcome is a cross-section–velocity relation that explains the diverse DM profiles of MW dSph satellites and is consistent with observational constraints on larger scales.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9480753","methods: numerical;galaxies: haloes;dark matter;cosmology: theory","","","","","","","12 Jul 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Turbulence is induced by stochastic compressive forcing which is delta-correlated in time. By considering the nearly Jeans-unstable case, where the scaling of the simulation is such that a statistical steady state without any irreversible collapses is obtained, we obtain a randomly varying potential, acting as a second stochastic forcing. We show that, in this setting, low-inertia grains follow the gas flow and cluster in much the same way as in a case of statistical steady-state turbulence without self-gravity. Large, high-inertia grains, however, are accelerated to much higher mean velocities in the presence of self-gravity. Grains of intermediate size also show an increased degree of clustering. We conclude that self-gravity effects can play an important role for aggregation/coagulation of dust even in a turbulent system which is not Jeans-unstable. In particular, the collision rate of large grains in the interstellar medium can be much higher than predicted by previous work.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab3216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9691080","hydrodynamics;turbulence;ISM: clouds;ISM: dust;extinction","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Due to synchronization effects, we find that maintaining a slower epidemic growth behaviour for the high-risk group is unstable against any finite coupling between the two groups. More precisely, the density of infected individuals in the two groups qualitatively evolves very similarly, apart from a small time delay and an overall scaling factor quantifying the coupling between the groups. Hence, selective containment of the epidemic in a targeted (high-risk) group is practically impossible whenever the surrounding society implements a mitigated community-spreading.

This study focuses on the coma of 8P/Tuttle using visible spectra and images to derive gas and dust production rates. The production rates obtained suggest that this comet can be considered as ‘typical’ concerning the C2/CN and C3/CN ratios, although, depending on the criteria adopted, it could be defined as C3 depleted. NH2 production rates suggest an enrichment of this molecule. Visible and infrared images have been analysed using a Monte Carlo dust tail model. At comparatively large heliocentric distances, the coma is characterized by a dust-to-water ratio around or less than 1. Nevertheless, when the comet approaches perihelion, and the subsolar latitude crosses the equator, the coma dust-to-water ratio increases significantly, reaching values larger than six.

Five different approaches – namely the HLL, HLLC, HLLD, HLLEM, and GFORCE schemes – are compared in terms of accuracy and robustness against one – and multidimensional standard numerical benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that – for weak or moderate magnetizations – the HLLD Riemann solver yields the most accurate results, followed by HLLC solver(s). The GFORCE approach provides a valid alternative to the HLL solver being less dissipative and equally robust for strongly magnetized environments. Finally, our tests show that the HLLEM Riemann solver is not cost-effective in improving the accuracy of the solution and reducing the numerical dissipation.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab3373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9690988","MHD;relativistic processes;shock waves;methods: numerical","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Solutions for these flows are calculated using quasi-analytical techniques that utilise the method of characteristics and the hodograph transformation of the governing equations, and the results are validated by comparison with direct numerical integration of the shallow water equations. The analytical solutions enable the precise identification of dynamical features in the flow, including the onset and development of discontinuous solutions that are manifest as bores, as well as their long term behaviour, the rate at which energy is dissipated, and for flows generated from the release of a finite reservoir, the maximum depth of the fluid layer at the barrier.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbab010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9690916","","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The method is introduced using spectra predicted for independent samples of stars from a 10 Gyr population using a simple stochastic spectral synthesis model. A principal components analysis shows that >99 per cent of the spectral variation in the red-optical can be attributed to just three ‘fluctuation eigenspectra’, which can be related to the number of giant stars present in each sample, and their distribution along the isochrone. The first eigenspectrum effectively encodes the spectrum of the coolest giant branch stars, and is equivalent to the ratio between high- and low-flux pixels discussed in previous literature. The second and third eigenspectra carry higher-order information from which the giant-star spectral sequence can in principle be reconstructed. I demonstrate the method in practice using observations of part of NGC 5128, obtained with the MUSE narrow-field adaptive optics mode. The expected first eigenspectrum is easily recovered from the data, and closely matches the model results except for small differences around the Ca II triplet. The second eigenspectrum is below the noise level of the present observations. A future application of the method would be to the cores of giant ellipticals to probe the spectra of cool giant stars at high metallicity and with element abundance patterns not accessible in the Milky Way.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab3415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9691222","methods: data analysis;galaxies: individual: NGC 5128;galaxies: stellar content","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our knowledge of SNe in the Milky Way is based mostly on the study of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), providing an (incomplete) record to SN activity over the last ∼100 000 yr. Here, we report on an investigation of the spatial distribution of Galactic SNRs. Given the limited number of SNRs, it is common to assume a functional form for the Galactocentric distribution of SNRs. However, several functional forms have been used in the past, without much justification for the radial distribution. For example, one often used functional form implies that no SN activity is present in the Galactic Centre region. However, the presence of a magnetar and an SNR near the Galactic Centre suggests that a spatial distribution with zero SNRs at the Galactic Centre is not realistic. In light of these concerns, we re-evaluate the Galactic SNR distribution. We provide a brief outline of the main detection biases in finding SNRs and we investigate whether or not the use of the most common functional form is justified and how it compares to other models for the SNR distribution. We do this by analysing the longitudinal distribution of SNRs. We find that a simple exponential distribution is the most consistent and simplest model for describing the radial SNR distribution in the Galaxy and draw comparisons with the massive star formation and metallicity distributions.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9466611","supernovae: general;ISM: supernova remnants;Galaxy: structure","","","","","","","28 Jun 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The pandemic picture was generally one of the significant and sustained negative impacts, though over the course of the study, respondents reported progress in addressing early limitations in the harnessing of digital platforms for learning. A small number of participating students reported home-based study beneficial for their mathematics learning, and a bigger group identified some wider benefits that partly offset the challenges. Most participating 16–18-year-old students, though, reported finding remote learning of mathematics both demanding and limiting. Pandemic constraints impacted most strongly on opportunities to engage with newer emphases within A Level courses: problem solving, reasoning, modelling, statistics and mechanics. Receiving academics reported that mathematical preparedness, and confidence, for mathematics-intense university courses has also been widely affected, with a bigger range of preparedness and confidence than usual. The study draws attention to the importance of studying subject-specific impact and drawing on student as well as teacher perceptions. It exposes a range of consequences of the cancellation of examinations and a need to develop and share effective pedagogies for working remotely with pre-university students.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hrab025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9690922","","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We fabricated adiabatic mode-selective photonic lanterns (PLs) at each end of the MCF to create a fibre link with multimode ports, the PLs coupling each spatial mode of the multimode ports to a specific core of the MCF and vice versa. The PL-MCF-PL link exhibits superior FRD behaviour compared to a conventional multimode fibre that also supports six modes, because it inhibits the transfer of light from lower order modes to higher order modes.

However, comet sublimation is insufficient to sustain the quantity of dust presently in the inner Solar system, suggesting that spontaneous disruptions of JFCs may supply the zodiacal cloud. We present a model for the dust produced in comet fragmentations and its evolution. Using results from dynamical simulations, the model follows individual comets drawn from a size distribution as they evolve and undergo recurrent splitting events. The resulting dust is followed with a kinetic model which accounts for the effects of collisional evolution, Poynting–Robertson drag, and radiation pressure. This allows to model the evolution of both the size distribution and radial profile of dust, and we demonstrate the importance of including collisions (both as a source and sink of dust) in zodiacal cloud models. With physically motivated free parameters this model provides a good fit to zodiacal cloud observables, supporting comet fragmentation as the plausibly dominant dust source. The model implies that dust in the present zodiacal cloud likely originated primarily from disruptions of ∼50-km comets, since larger comets are ejected before losing all their mass. Thus much of the dust seen today was likely deposited as larger grains ∼0.1 Myr in the past. The model also finds the dust level to vary stochastically; e.g. every ∼50 Myr large (>100 km) comets with long dynamical lifetimes inside Jupiter cause dust spikes with order of magnitude increases in zodiacal light brightness lasting ∼1 Myr. If exozodiacal dust is cometary in origin, our model suggests it should be similarly variable.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab3482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9691012","methods: numerical;comets: general;zodiacal dust;circumstellar matter","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This results in a corrective term that is added to the usual two-halo term. We measure this correction using data from N-body simulations and demonstrate that it can boost power in the two-halo term by a factor of ∼2 at scales $k\sim 0.7\, h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, with the exact magnitude of the boost determined by the specific pair of fields in the two-point function. How this translates to the full power spectrum depends on the relative strength of the one-halo term, which can mask the importance of this correction to a greater or lesser degree, again depending on the fields. Generally, we find that our correction is more important for signals that arise from lower mass haloes. When comparing our calculation to simulated data, we find that the underprediction of power in the transition region between the two- and one-halo terms, which typically plagues halo-model calculations, is almost completely eliminated when including the full non-linear halo bias. We show improved results for the autospectra and cross-spectra of galaxies, haloes, and matter. In the specific case of matter–matter or matter–halo power, we note that a large fraction of the improvement comes from the non-linear biasing between low- and high-mass haloes.

We show that this framework accurately captures the (quasi-)self-similar evolution of the wave properties expressed in terms of properly rescaled variables, provided that certain theoretical inputs are calibrated using numerical simulations (an approximate, first principles calculation of the wave evolution based on the inviscid Burgers equation is in qualitative agreement with simulations but overpredicts wave damping at the quantitative level). We provide fitting formulae for such inputs, in particular, the strength and global shape of the planet-driven shock accounting for non-linear effects. We use this non-linear framework to theoretically compute vortensity production in the disc by the global spiral shock and numerically verify the accuracy of this calculation. Our results can be used for interpreting observations of spiral features in discs, kinematic signatures of embedded planets in CO line emission (‘kinks’), and for understanding the emergence of planet-driven vortices in protoplanetary discs.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624112","accretion;accretion discs;hydrodynamics;shock waves;methods: analytical;methods: numerical;planets and satellites: formation","","","","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It considers four sports with varying scoring rates, from soccer with typically three goals per match to netball with one hundred goals per match. Within a general modelling framework for a two-competitor contest, we argue that outcome uncertainty, the extent to which the outcome of a contest is unpredictable, depends on scoring rate, on strength variation and on score dependence. Score dependence is essentially the tendency for scores to alternate because possession alternates and possession is advantageous. We regard competitive balance as lack of variation in strength or skill, so that when strength variation is large competitive balance is low and vice versa. Thus, we argue that the outcome of a contest depends on skill, scoring rate, score dependence and chance. This description of outcome is useful because it informs policy-making in sport about the design of scoring systems and the control of competitive imbalance. Broadly, we find that: soccer is relatively competitively unbalanced but outcomes are uncertain because the scoring rate is low; the Australian football league is competitively balanced and so outcomes are uncertain in spite of the high scoring rate in this sport; international rugby matches are relatively neither competitive nor uncertain so that little is left to chance; and netball matches have uncertain outcomes because scores are positively dependent.","1471-6798","","10.1093/imaman/dpab026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623702","competitive balance;bivariate Poisson;football;netball;Australian rules football","","","","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These representations are independent of heading direction and allow us to know where we are regardless of our direction of travel. However, we know little about how these location-based representations are formed. Using fMRI representational similarity analysis and linear mixed models, we tracked the emergence of location-based representations in scene-selective brain regions. We estimated patterns of activity for two distinct scenes, taken before and after participants learnt they were from the same location. During a learning phase, we presented participants with two types of panoramic videos: (1) an overlap video condition displaying two distinct scenes (0° and 180°) from the same location and (2) a no-overlap video displaying two distinct scenes from different locations (which served as a control condition). In the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), representations of scenes from the same location became more similar to each other only after they had been shown in the overlap condition, suggesting the emergence of viewpoint-independent location-based representations. Whereas these representations emerged in the PHC regardless of task performance, RSC representations only emerged for locations where participants could behaviorally identify the two scenes as belonging to the same location. The results suggest that we can track the emergence of location-based representations in the PHC and RSC in a single fMRI experiment. Further, they support computational models that propose the RSC plays a key role in transforming viewpoint-independent representations into behaviorally relevant representations of specific viewpoints.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_01654","Wellcome Trust(grant numbers:204277/Z/16/Z); Economic and Social Research Council(grant numbers:ES/R007454/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345566","","","","","","","Open Access","2 Feb 2021","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

The survey comprised three sections: teaching and learning, assessment and personal experience, with a focus on how the changes in teaching and assessment were viewed by students. A total of 263 students from six universities responded to the survey. The corresponding data are described, as are various trends that were identified through open-response questions. The data offer a window into the student experience during the tertiary level closures and show the effect that the sudden shifts (e.g., in delivery and support) had on learning, assessment and student well-being. The survey responses show that most students dealt with the rapid changes in a resilient and mature manner, particularly when confronted with adversity. Numerous insights can be gleaned from the students’ perspectives that have the potential to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics at tertiary level in Ireland in the future.

"Radiation by the superluminally moving current sheet in the magnetosphere of a neutron star","H.

In contrast, considerable progress has recently been made in determining the structure of the magnetosphere that surrounds these objects: numerical computations based on the force-free, magnetohydrodynamic, and particle-in-cell formalisms have now firmly established that the magnetosphere of an oblique rotator entails a current sheet outside its light cylinder whose rotating distribution pattern moves with linear speeds exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. However, the role played by the superluminal motion of this current sheet in generating the multiwavelength, focused pulses of radiation that we receive from neutron stars is unknown. Here, we insert the description of the current sheet provided by the numerical simulations in the classical expression for the retarded potential and thereby calculate the radiation field generated by this source in the time domain. We find a radiation consisting of highly focused pulses whose salient features (brightness temperature, polarization, spectrum and profile with microstructure and with a phase lag between the radio and gamma-ray peaks) are strikingly similar to those of the emission received from pulsars. In addition, the flux density of this radiation diminishes with the distance D from the star as D−3/2 (rather than D−2) in certain latitudinal directions: a result that suggests that the high energetic requirements normally attributed to magnetars and the sources of fast radio bursts and gamma-ray bursts could be artefacts of the assumption that the radiation fields of all sources necessarily decay as predicted by the inverse-square law.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584329","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal;pulsars: general;stars: neutron;stars: magnetars;fast radio bursts;gamma-ray bursts","","","","","","","21 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This generalizes the trace from linear algebra that assigns a scalar $\operatorname{Tr}(\,f\,) \in k$ to any endomorphism f : V → V of a finite-dimensional k-vector space. Our main theorem computes the moduli space of tracelike transformations using the one-dimensional cobordism hypothesis with singularities. As a consequence, we show that the trace $\operatorname{Tr}$ can be uniquely extended to a tracelike transformation up to a contractible space of choices. This allows us to give several model-independent characterizations of the $\infty$-categorical trace.By restricting the aforementioned notion of tracelike transformations from endomorphisms to automorphisms one can in particular recover a theorem of Toën and Vezzosi. Other examples of tracelike transformations are for instance given by $f \mapsto \operatorname{Tr}(\,f^{\,n})$. Unlike for $\operatorname{Tr}$, the relevant connected component of the moduli space is not contractible, but rather equivalent to $B\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ or BS1 for n = 0. As a result, we obtain a $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$-action on $\operatorname{Tr}(\,f^{\,n})$ as well as a circle action on $\operatorname{Tr}(\operatorname{id}_x)$.","1464-3847","","10.1093/qmath/haab013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9690934","","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The number density of sources as a function of their neutral hydrogen masses – the H I mass function (H I MF) – has previously been reported to have a significantly different low-mass slope and ‘knee mass’ in the two sky regions surveyed during ALFALFA. In contrast with this, we find that the shape of the H I WF in the same two sky regions is remarkably similar, consistent with being identical within the confidence intervals implied by the data (but the overall normalization differs). The spatial uniformity of the H I WF implies that it is likely a stable tracer of the mass function of dark matter haloes, in spite of the environmental processes to which the measured variation in the H I MF are attributed, at least for galaxies containing enough neutral hydrogen to be detected. This insensitivity of the H I WF to galaxy formation and evolution can be exploited to turn it into a powerful constraint on cosmological models as future surveys yield increasingly precise measurements. We also report on the possible influence of a previously overlooked systematic error affecting the H I WF, which may plausibly see its low-velocity slope steepen by ∼40 per cent in analyses of future, deeper surveys.

Here, we investigate the thermodynamic evolution of an on-disc sigmoid observed during 2015 December 24–28. For this purpose, we have employed Emission Measure (EM) and filter-ratio techniques on the observations recorded by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-ray Telescope (XRT) on-board Hinode. The EM analysis showed multithermal plasma along the sigmoid and provided a peak temperature of ∼10–12.5 MK for all observed flares. The sigmoidal structure showed emission from Fe xviii (93.93 Å) and Fe xxi (128.75 Å) lines in the AIA 94 and 131 Å channels, respectively. Our results show that the hot plasma is often confined to very hot strands. The temperature obtained from the EM analysis was found to be in good agreement with that obtained using the XRT, AIA, and GOES filter-ratio methods. These results provide important constraints for the thermodynamic modelling of sigmoidal structures in the core of active regions. Moreover, this study also benchmarks different techniques available for temperature estimation in solar coronal structures.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9466587","Sun: activity;Sun: atmosphere;Sun: chromosphere;Sun: flares;Sun: transition region;Sun: UV radiation","","","","","","","28 Jun 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, we show that even with large degrees of freedom in the allowed thermal, structural, and chemical properties of the galaxy, large regions of parameter space are in strong tension with the data. In particular, whilst we are able to find models in which neutron star mergers produce the majority of r-process material, the data rule out all models with dominant collapsar yields.

We find that direct scintillation effects and Cherenkov generation are two possible ways to cause these molecules’ excitation. To distinguish the contributions of each excitation mechanism, we exploited the dependency of Cherenkov radiation yield on X-ray energy. The probes were irradiated by constant dose of 6 MV and 18 MV X-ray radiation, and their relative emission intensities and spectra were quantified for each X-ray energy pair. From the ratios of XML, yield for 6 MV and 18 MV irradiation we found that the Cherenkov radiation dominated as an excitation mechanism, except for aluminum phthalocyanine, which exhibited substantial scintillation. The highest emission yields were detected from fluorescein, proflavin and aluminum phthalocyanine, in that order. XML yield was found to be affected by the emission quantum yield, overlap of the fluorescence excitation and Cherenkov emission spectra, scintillation yield. Considering all these factors and XML emission spectrum respective to tissue optical window, aluminum phthalocyanine offers the best XML yield for deep tissue use, while fluorescein and proflavine are most useful for subcutaneous or superficial use.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrab055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579177","X-ray induced molecular luminescence (XML);Cherenkov radiation;scintillation;therapeutic megavoltage X-rays;organic fluorophores","","","","","","","18 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In the case of ionized winds, the disc and wind are sharply delineated by a narrow ionization front where the gas density and temperature vary by more than an order of magnitude. Using a novel method that is able to model the transport of dust across the ionization front in the presence of disc turbulence, we revisit the problem of dust delivery. Our results show that the delivery of dust to the wind is determined by the vertical gas flow through the disc induced by the mass-loss, rather than turbulent diffusion (unless the turbulence is strong, i.e. α ≳ 0.01). Using these results, we provide a simple relation between the maximum size of particle that can be delivered to the wind and the local mass-loss rate per unit area from the wind. This relation is independent of the physical origin of the wind and predicts typical sizes in the 0.01–$1\, \rm{\mu m}$ range for extreme-ultraviolet- or X-ray-driven winds. These values are a factor of ∼10 smaller than those obtained when considering only whether the wind is able to carry away the grains.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9479942","planetary systems;protoplanetary discs;stars: pre-main sequence;(ISM:) dust, extinction","","","","","","","12 Jul 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, it remains unclear how neutron stars can be brighter than the Eddington luminosity, and no unified view exists on the magnetic field of neutron stars and the degree of beaming. Recent observations suggest that some X-ray pulsating ULXs have Be-type donors, and some of them occupy the same region as Be-type high-mass X-ray binaries (Be-HMXBs) on the Corbet diagram, which reveals the relation between spin and orbital periods. This suggests that at least some ULXs are special cases of Be-HMXBs. In this study, we use the framework of mass accretion models for Be-HMXBs to investigate the conditions under which neutron stars achieve mass accretion rates beyond the Eddington limit and become observable as ULXs. We show that a Be-HMXB may become a ULX if the magnetic field of the neutron star and the density of the Be disc meet certain conditions. We also show that, although a stronger magnetic field increases the brightness of a neutron star ULX with a Be donor, its brightness cannot exceed the Eddington limit by a more than a factor of ≈50. Finally, we propose a scenario whereby some normal Be-HMXBs may evolve into ULXs as the donor evolves into a giant.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584089","accretion, accretion discs;stars: neutron;stars: winds, outflows;X-rays: binaries","","","","","","","21 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Consequently, it triggered increasing industry demand to drive technological transformation. By implication, this propelled transformation in the requirements of Higher Education (HE) during the process of training engineers, towards more blended or online modes of delivery. A common concern from commentators has been “What are the ethical implications of using technology when teaching engineering students”. The objective of this paper is to expand on a previously published literature study which theoretically examined the extent to which ethics has been considered during the process of training engineers in contemporary times. In this follow-up study, a survey research instrument (n=68) which included eight likert scale questions and ten open-ended questions, was used to empirically explore three ethical dilemmas which emerged during the precursor study. The ethical dilemmas are (1) the unintended negative consequences of using technology; (2) discrimination as a result of the use of technology and (3) educator agency in the Engineering Education 4.0, at a University of Technology (UoT) in South Africa. Ethical clearance to do this research was secured through institutional channels. The findings of this study were consistent with findings of the precursor study and the recommendation of this study is that a series of workshops be held to develop ethics guidelines and establish ethical best practices to assist engineering educators to assure the quality of online engineering education, avoid discrimination, protect the privacy of both students and educators and reinforce the integrity of online engineering assessments.","1991-1696","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580771","Engineering Education;Industry 4.0;Blended Learning;e-Learning;Online Education","Ethics;Electronic learning;Engineering education;Training;Privacy;Industries;Security","","","","","","1 Nov 2021","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

These estimates are inferred from triangulated isodensity surfaces that are constructed from the Delaunay tessellation of the input point sample. medusa can account for periodic boundary conditions, which is crucial for the analysis of N-body simulations. We validate our code against several test samples with known MFs, including Gaussian random fields with a ΛCDM power spectrum, and find excellent agreement with the theory predictions. We use medusa to measure the MFs of synthetic galaxy catalogues constructed from N-body simulations. Our results show clearly non-Gaussian signatures that arise from the non-linear gravitational evolution of the density field. We find that, although redshift-space distortions change our MFs estimates, their impact is considerably reduced if these measurements are expressed as a function of the volume-filling fraction. We also show that the effect of Alcock–Paczynski (AP) distortions on the MFs can be described by scaling them with different powers of the isotropic AP parameter q defined in terms of the volume-averaged distance DV(z). Thus the MFs estimates by medusa are useful probes of non-linearities in the density field, and the expansion and growth of structure histories of the Universe.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646711","methods: statistical;large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","10 Dec 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The chromosphere is known for its 3-min signals, which are strong over sunspot umbrae, and have periods determined by the chromosphere's acoustic cut-off frequency. A small number of observations have shown the chromospheric signals to be affected by energetic events such as solar flares, however the link between flare activity and these oscillations remains unclear. In this work, we present evidence of changes to the oscillatory structure of the chromosphere over a sunspot which occurs during the impulsive phase of an M1 flare. Using imaging data from the CRISP instrument across the H α and Ca ii 8542  Å spectral lines, we employed a method of fitting models to power spectra to produce maps of where there is evidence of oscillatory signals above a red-noise background. Comparing results taken before and after the impulsive phase of the flare, we found that the oscillatory signals taken after the start of the flare differ in two ways: the locations of oscillatory signals had changed and the typical periods of the oscillations had tended to increase (in some cases increasing from <100 s to ∼200 s). Both of these results can be explained by a restructuring of the magnetic field in the chromosphere during the flare activity, which is backed up by images of coronal loops showing clear changes to magnetic connectivity. These results represent one of the many ways that active regions can be affected by solar flares.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9480852","Sun: chromosphere;Sun: flares;Sun: oscillations","","","","","","","12 Jul 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Since most post-processing analysis within the field is based on these parameter estimation products, interpolation accuracy of the marginals is essential. In this work, we propose a new method combining histograms and Gaussian processes (GPs) as an alternative technique to fit arbitrary combinations of samples from the source parameters. This method comes with several advantages such as flexible interpolation of non-Gaussian correlations, Bayesian estimate of uncertainty, and efficient resampling with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624094","gravitational waves;methods: data analysis","","","","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Four groups were formed using academic performance as a sampling criterion. The findings are presented using selected emergent themes and rich, narrative descriptions. A range of expected and unexpected student responses to assessment practices is highlighted. These are discussed in the context of the assessment literature to provide insight into the relationship between assessment and learning. The study confirms the importance of constructive alignment in assessment design, and includes specific findings related to tutorials, assignments, feedback, and group work. The study reveals that assessment is a powerful driver of learning, and highlights the need for a more collaborative teaching and learning environment to shift learning in a positive direction.","1991-1696","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580769","constructive alignment;focus groups;learning-oriented assessment;student learning;student voice","Task analysis;Tutorials;Shape;Engineering students;Writing;Interviews;Focusing","","","","","","1 Nov 2021","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Chemical engineering (ChE) is one of these engineering disciplines. In this study, gender differences in enrollment and persistence in ChE, the quality of degree obtained on completion and the job placement of female graduates were investigated. A survey was used to obtain qualitative information on factors that influence females to study ChE, and their gender-related experiences as students and STEM employees. The main findings revealed that females represented 41% of ChE intake, had higher rates of degree completion, were motivated by male role models to pursue engineering, and few females experienced some forms of gender-based discrimination in STEM employment.

Using these data, we create the python program planetsynth that generates synthetic cooling tracks by interpolation. Given the planetary mass, bulk and atmospheric metallicity, and incident stellar irradiation, the program calculates how the planetary radius, luminosity, effective temperature, and surface gravity evolve with time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our models by inferring time-dependent mass–radius diagrams, estimating the metallicities from mass–radius measurements, and by showing how atmospheric measurements can further constrain the planetary bulk composition. We also estimate the mass and metallicity of the young giant planet 51 Eri b from its observed luminosity. Synthetic evolution tracks have many applications, and we suggest that they are valuable for both theoretical and observational investigations into the nature of giant planets.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584166","methods: numerical;planets and satellites: composition;planets and satellites: gaseous planets;planets and satellites: interiors","","","","","","","21 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Moreover, all the entropies have the same maximum value: the maximum entropy of X. As X is scaled up, the maximum entropy grows, and its asymptotics determine geometric information about X, including the volume and dimension. And the large-scale limit of the maximizing measure itself provides an answer to the question: what is the canonical measure on a metric space? Primarily, we work not with entropy itself but its exponential, which in its finite form is already in use as a measure of biodiversity.

Special attention is devoted to the interaction between flexural and torsional waves in a square lattice of Euler–Bernoulli beams, which is shown to yield a range of novel effects, including extreme dynamic anisotropy, asymmetric wave propagation, wave-guiding, filtering and the ability to create localised defect modes, all without the need for additional resonant elements or interfaces. The analytical study is complimented by numerical computations and finite element simulations, both of which are used to illustrate the effects predicted. A general algorithm is provided for constructing Green's functions as well as defect modes. This algorithm allows the tuning of the lattice to produce pass bands, band gaps, resonant modes, wave-guides and defect modes, over any desired frequency range.","1464-3855","","10.1093/qjmam/hbab006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579152","","Lattices;Green's function methods;Propagation;Bending;Metamaterials;Junctions;Dynamics","","","","","","15 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These results are often explained using the theory of propagating fluctuations in which fluctuations in the viscosity create perturbations in the accretion rate at all radii, propagate inwards, and combine multiplicatively. While this idea has been extensively studied analytically in a linear regime, there has been relatively little numerical work investigating the non-linear behaviour. In this paper, we present a suite of stochastically driven 1D α-disc simulations, exploring the behaviour of these discs. We find that the eponymous propagating fluctuations are present in all simulations across a wide range of model parameters, in contradiction to previous work. Of the model parameters, we find by far the most important to be the time-scale on which the viscosity fluctuations occur. Physically, this time-scale will depend on the underlying physical mechanism, thought to be the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We find a close relationship between this fluctuation time-scale and the break frequency in the power spectral density of the luminosity, a fact which could allow observational probes of the behaviour of the MRI dynamo. We report a fitting formula for the break frequency as a function of the fluctuation time-scale, the disc thickness, and the mass of the central object.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9466531","accretion;accretion discs;black hole physics;galaxies: active","","","","","","","28 Jun 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We recently designed an experiment using novel immersive virtual-reality technology, which allowed us to tightly control the availability of body-based cues to determine how these cues influence human spatial memory [Huffman, D. J., & Ekstrom, A. D. A modality-independent network underlies the retrieval of large-scale spatial environments in the human brain. Neuron, 104, 611–622, 2019]. Our analysis of behavior and fMRI data revealed a similar pattern of results across a range of body-based cues conditions, thus suggesting that participants likely relied primarily on vision to form and retrieve abstract, holistic representations of the large-scale environments in our experiment. We ended our paper by discussing a number of caveats and future directions for research on the role of body-based cues in human spatial memory. Here, we reiterate and expand on this discussion, and we use a commentary in this issue by A. Steel, C. E. Robertson, and J. S. Taube (Current promises and limitations of combined virtual reality and functional magnetic resonance imaging research in humans: A commentary on Huffman and Ekstrom (2019).

We highlight the exciting possibility of taking a more naturalistic approach to study the behavior, cognition, and neuroscience of navigation.

The basic premise of this model is that each sub-dictionary possesses discriminative information about its corresponding source, and this information can be used to recover almost every sample from that source. However, in a more general sense, the samples from a source are composed not only of discriminative information but also common information shared with other sources. This paper proposes learning a discriminative high-fidelity dictionary to improve the separation performance. The innovations are threefold. Firstly, an extra sub-dictionary was combined into a conventional union dictionary to ensure that the source-specific sub-dictionaries can capture only the purely discriminative information for their corresponding sources because the common information is collected in the additional sub-dictionary. Secondly, a task-driven learning algorithm is designed to optimize the new union dictionary and a set of weights that indicate how much of the common information should be allocated to each source. Thirdly, a source separation scheme based on the learned dictionary is presented. Experimental results on a human speech dataset yield evidence that our algorithm can achieve better separation performance than either state-of-the-art or traditional algorithms.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612133","single channel source separation;sparse representation;dictionary learning;discrimination;high-fidelity","Dictionaries;Source separation;Hidden Markov models;Estimation;Technological innovation;Task analysis;Signal denoising","","","","","","11 Nov 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

As propaganda minister for the Nazis, Joseph Goebbels understood the power of radio. But radios in the early 1930s were expensive. Goebbels turned to electrical engineer Otto Griessing to design a cheap, technically simple, and easy-to-mass-produce device. Industrial designer Walter Maria Kersting fabricated the housing out of Bakelite, a plastic that could be molded and had a modern flair. The resulting Volksempfänger (""people's radio"") debuted on 18 August 1933 at the 10th International Radio Show, in Berlin. At 76 Reichsmarks (about US$250), it was about half the price of the cheapest radios then on the market. More than 100,000 units sold during the two-day show; by 1941, nearly two-thirds of German households owned one. The radio carried state-sanctioned music and entertainment. And Hitler gained a direct conduit into people's homes.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2021.9394560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9394560","","Plastics;History;Entertainment industry","","","","","IEEE","2 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Here, the opinions of non-mathematics Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) undergraduate students (all of whom had previously studied A-level Mathematics) were accessed via a survey and individual interviews. The study found that Further Mathematics qualifications are perceived as advantageous for non-mathematics STEM degrees by students once they are at university but not when making A-level choices. While the students often perceived mathematics positively, this appears to influence the choice of A-level Mathematics but not Further Mathematics. The lack of support from teachers and parents, the lack of perceived utility of Further Mathematics qualifications and a perception that Further Mathematics is only useful for studying a mathematics degree could all be factors affecting the uptake of Further Mathematics. The identified perceived impact of Further Mathematics on the university transition is linked to studying more pure mathematics which may give students a better understanding of how to apply mathematics in the context of their degree. Some comparisons between the findings in Parts 1 and 2 of the study are included which suggests that the Further Mathematics qualification is better serving students intending to study a non-mathematics STEM degree rather than mathematics itself.","1471-6976","","10.1093/teamat/hrab004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579160","","Mathematics;Qualifications;STEM;Physics;Education;Chemistry;Problem-solving","","","","","","15 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, the literature reveals that beyond neutral and singly ionized systems, there is an incompleteness of atomic data for the remaining ion stages of importance for mergers. In this work, we report on relativistic atomic structure calculations for Au I–Au III using the GRASP0 codes. Comparisons to calculations using the Flexible Atomic Code suggest uncertainties on average of 9.2 per cent, 5.7 per cent, and 3.8 per cent for Au I–Au III level energies. Agreement around ∼50 per cent is achieved between our computed A-values and those in the literature, where available. Using the GRASP0 structure of Au I, we calculated electron-impact excitation rate coefficients and use a collisional-radiative model to explore the excitation dynamics and line ratio diagnostics possible in neutron star merger environments. We find that proper accounting of metastable populations is critical for extracting useful information from ultraviolet–visible line ratio diagnostics of Au I. As a test of our data, we applied our electron-impact data to study a gold hollow cathode spectrum in the literature and diagnosed the plasma conditions as Te = 3.1 ± 1.2 eV and $n_\textrm {e} = 2.7^{+1.3}_{-0.9}\times 10^{13}$ cm−3.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab3285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9691152","atomic data;neutron star mergers;line: identification;plasmas;scattering;techniques: spectroscopic","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We assume that there are two types of failure, namely type I failure (repairable failure) and type II failure (irrepairable failure). As long as the type I failure occurs, the system will be repaired immediately, which is failure repair (FR). Between the (n-1)th and the nth FR, the system is supposed to be preventively repaired (PR) as the consecutive working time of the system reaches λn-1T, where λ and T are specified values. Further, we assume that the system will go on working when the repair is finished and will be replaced at the occurrence of the Nth type I failure or the occurrence of the first type II failure, whichever occurs first. In practice, the system will degrade with the increasing number of repairs. That is, the consecutive working time of the system forms a decreasing generalized geometric process (GGP) whereas the successive repair time forms an increasing GGP. A simple bivariate policy (T,N) repairable model is introduced based on GGP. The alternative searching method is used to minimize the cost rate function C(N,T), and the optimal (T,N)∗ is obtained.

This study analyzed changes to WBAC in mice after either localized irradiation (irradiation of the left hind leg only) or chronic TBI using the i-STrap method. Leg-localized irradiation exerted limited effects on WBAC, while WBAC decreased in a dose rate-dependent manner after TBI. Further, the WBAC reached the minimum value in a shorter period at a smaller dose rate. Our results suggest that changes in WBAC do not directly reflect absorbed dose, but may reflect radiation-induced biological damage at the systemic level. This study will contribute to the understanding of radiation-induced injuries and diseases, and will facilitate the establishment of biomarkers for radiation exposure.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrab099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716991","antioxidant;chronic irradiation;partial body irradiation;radiation disaster;emergency medicine","","","","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

One of the main problems is how to decide which model out of a large pool of trial models based on different assumed mass distributions represents the true structure of an observed galaxy best. We show that the traditional approach to judge models solely by their goodness-of-fit can lead to substantial biases in estimated galaxy properties caused by varying model flexibilities. We demonstrate how the flexibility of the models can be estimated using bootstrap iterations and present a model selection framework that removes these biases by taking the variable flexibility into account in the model evaluation. We extend the model selection approach to optimize the degree of regularization directly from the data. Altogether, this leads to a significant improvement of the constraining power of the modelling technique. We show with simulations that one can reconstruct the mass, anisotropy, and viewing angle of an axisymmetric galaxy with a few per cent accuracy from realistic observational data with fully resolved line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs). In a first application, we reproduce a photometric estimate of the inclination of the disc galaxy NGC 3368 to within 5° accuracy from kinematic data that cover only a few sphere-of-influence radii around the galaxy's SMBH. This demonstrates the constraining power that can be achieved with orbit models based on fully resolved LOSVDs and a model selection framework.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab1092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9466824","methods: statistical;galaxies: individual (NGC 3368);galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","28 Jun 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To quantify the baseline drift $\Delta$ during irradiation, it was defined as the inclination between the detected expiration point and the expiration point in the next cycle in the anterior–posterior (AP), cranial–caudal (CC) and left–right (LR) directions obtained using an in-house programme. The baseline drift value reached up to 0.74 mm/s in the CC direction as per the respiratory motion data of 10 patients. The homogeneity index (HI) of the phase-gating method tended to increase because the target was irradiated even when the amplitude position of the target differed from period to period. In contrast, the amplitude-gating method enabled irradiation considering the amplitude position of the target because the gating window was set considering the amplitude position of the respiratory motion.

The ensuing hydrodynamical activity may reshape the radial thermal structure of the disc while mixing solid material radially and vertically or, alternatively, concentrating it in vortical structures. We perform local axisymmetric simulations of the COS using the code snoopy, showing first how parasites halt the instability's exponential growth, and secondly, the different saturation routes it takes subsequently. As the Reynolds and (pseudo-) Richardson numbers increase, the system moves successively from (i) a weakly non-linear state characterized by relatively ordered non-linear waves, to (ii) wave turbulence, and finally to (iii) the formation of intermittent and then persistent zonal flows. In three dimensions, we expect the latter flows to spawn vortices in the orbital plane. Given the very high Reynolds numbers in protoplanetary discs, the third regime should be the most prevalent. As a consequence, we argue that the COS is an important dynamical process in planet formation, especially near features such as dead zone edges, ice lines, gaps, and dust rings.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584396","accretion;accretion discs;convection;instabilities;turbulence;protoplanetary discs","","","","","","","21 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

As a preliminary step, a growth function g is defined, which quantifies the differential change in half-mass radius per unit increase in stellar mass (g = d log R1/2/d log M⋆) due to star formation. A general derivation shows that g = KΔ(sSFR)/sSFR, meaning that g is proportional to the relative difference in specific star formation rate between the outer and the inner half of a galaxy, with K a dimensionless structural factor for which handy expressions are provided. As an application, it is shown that galaxies obeying a fundamentally local main sequence also obey, to a good approximation, g ≃ γn, where γ is the slope of the normalized local main sequence ($\mathrm{sSFR} \,\, \propto \,\, \Sigma _\star ^{-\gamma}$) and n is the Sersic index. An exact expression is also provided. Quantitatively, a fundamentally local main sequence is consistent with SFGs growing along a stationary mass–size relation, but inconsistent with the continuation at z = 0 of evolutionary laws derived at higher z. This demonstrates that either the main sequence is not fundamentally local, or the mass–size relation of SFGs has converged to an equilibrium state at some finite time in the past, or both.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646835","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: star formation;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","10 Dec 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Based on these data, and by the means of semi-analytic models and Bayesian inference, we provide here a physical description of the origin and dynamics of the cool CGM of M31. We investigate two competing scenarios, in which (i) the cool gas is mostly produced by supernova(SN)-driven galactic outflows or (ii) it mostly originates from infall of gas from the intergalactic medium. In both cases, we take into account the effect of gravity and hydrodynamical interactions with a hot corona, which has a cosmologically motivated angular momentum. We compare the outputs of our models to the observed covering factor, silicon column density and velocity distribution of the AMIGA absorbers. We find that, to explain the observations, the outflow scenario requires an unphysically large (> 100%) efficiency for SN feedback. Our infall models, on the other hand, can consistently account for the AMIGA observations and the predicted accretion rate, angular momentum and metallicity are consistent with a cosmological infall from the intergalactic medium.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab3237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9691160","hydrodynamics;methods: analytical;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: haloes","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To efficiently reduce the dose in the bilateral parotid glands, directional block (DB) mode was set. The DB is a function of a treatment planning system for the dose reduction in organs at risk. The standard HA-WBRT plan which did not reduce the parotid gland dose was also designed to compare the plan quality. Compared with the standard HA-WBRT plan, the parotid gland dose could be reduced by approximately 70% without extending the delivery time by adding the parotid gland on the DB mode to the dose constraint. In addition, the differences in dosimetric parameters observed between the plans employing the 1.0 cm fixed jaw and 2.5 cm dynamic jaw were almost negligible.

It is especially challenging in Antarctica, where almost all the bedrock is covered with a thick layer of ice, and seismic data cannot provide a sufficient spatial resolution for geological and geophysical applications. As an alternative, we determine the MDC in Antarctica and its surrounding seas with a resolution of 1° × 1° by the Vening Meinesz-Moritz gravimetric-isostatic technique using the XGM2019e Earth Gravitational Model and Earth2014 topographic/bathymetric information along with CRUST1.0 and CRUST19 seismic crustal models. The numerical results show that our model, named HVMDC20, varies from 81 kg m−3 in the Pacific Antarctic mid-oceanic ridge to 579 kg m−3 in the Gamburtsev Mountain Range in the central continent with a general average of 403 kg m−3. To assess our computations, we compare our estimates with those of some other gravimetric as well as seismic models (KTH11, GEMMA12C, KTH15C and CRUST1.0), illustrating that our estimates agree fairly well with KTH15C and CRUST1.0 but rather poor with the other models. In addition, we compare the geological signatures with HVMDC20, showing how the main geological structures contribute to the MDC. Finally, we study the remaining glacial isostatic adjustment effect on gravity to figure out how much it affects the MDC recovery, yielding a correlation of the optimum spectral window (7≤ n ≤12) between XGM2019e and W12a GIA models of the order of ∼0.6 contributing within a negligible $ \pm 14$ kg m−3 to the MDC.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624718","Antarctica;Gravity;Isostasy;Moho density contrast;uncertainty","","","","","","","23 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Although close and well observed, some key properties of 3C 84 remain unknown. One of these properties is the inclination angle between the jet and the line of sight, for which a wide range of values can be found in publications. Previous studies have indicated a precessing behaviour of 3C 84's jet that could explain these discrepancies. In this work, we analyse this behaviour at parsec scales using VLBA-BU-BLAZAR Program 43-GHz data. To obtain the position angles necessary to deduce the precessing motion, we use a primary component analysis to extract angles from the available images. The model parameters are estimated through Bayesian Inference. A clear change in the position angle is visible in our data, consistent with a precession. For a pure, non-relativistic precession model, we find a precession frequency of (12.5 ± 1.8)° yr−1. We further test the possibility of an additional nutation but can, so far, not obtain conclusive results.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9491536","galaxies: individual: 3C 84;galaxies: jets;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","","","","","","","20 Jul 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The analysis is successful in finding both short (e.g. solar flares) and long (e.g. transitional pulsars) high flux states. Our search reveals two new γ-ray transient signals occurred in 2019 in the directions of optical transients that are SN candidates, AT2019bvr and AT2018iwp, with their flux increases within 6 months after the dates of SN's discoveries. These signals are bright and their variability is at a higher statistical level than that of iPTF14hls. An exploration of archival multiwavelength observations towards their positions is necessary to establish their association with SNe or other classes of sources. Our analysis, in addition, shows a bright transient γ-ray signal at low Galactic latitudes in the direction of PSR J0205+6449.

Using two-point correlation functions, we have investigated the clustering properties of different classes of objects from the Fermi–LAT(Large Area Telescope) 4FGL catalogue. We wanted to test the idea based on optical polarization observations that there might be large volumes of space in which AGN axes are aligned. To do this, we needed a clean sample of blazars as these are objects with their jet axes pointing towards the observer and Fermi sources provide such a sample. We find that high latitude Fermi sources taken as a whole show a significant clustering signal on scales up to 30°. To investigate if all blazars behave in the same way we used he machine learning classifications from the literature, which are based only on gamma-ray information, to separate BL Lac-like objects from FSRQ-like objects. A possible explanation for the clustering signal we find amongst the BL Lac-like objects is that there are indeed large volumes of space in which AGN axes are aligned. This signal might be washed out in FSRQs since they occupy a much larger volume of space. Thus, our results support the idea that large scale polarization alignments could originate from coherent alignments of AGN axes. We speculate that these axis alignments may be related to the well-known intrinsic alignments of galaxy optical position angles.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab1872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584114","galaxies: active;Gamma-rays: galaxies: clusters;Cosmology: large-scale structure of Universe","","","","","","","21 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In addition to constraining shear and compressional wave velocities, they are the only seismic data sensitive to density perturbations. Density is particularly difficult to determine, and previous studies have found contradicting results, hence the method chosen to invert normal mode data for 3-D structure becomes important. In the problem of inverting the measured frequency spectra for an earth model, we can take two approaches: (i) a one-step full-spectrum inversion, where normal mode spectra are directly inverted for a mantle model and (ii) a two-step splitting function inversion, where first the spectra are inverted for splitting functions, which are then inverted for a mantle model. Here we compare the methodology and results of both approaches, continuing the work done by Li et al. and Durek & Romanowicz, and extending it to higher spherical harmonic degrees. Using exactly the same normal mode data set, we use both inversion approaches to make 3-D shear wave velocity mantle models. Both approaches give models consistent with previous tomographic studies, although spectral misfits are consistently lower for the one-step full-spectrum inversion. We also show that we cannot draw any conclusions on odd-degree structure in the lower mantle with the currently available normal mode data sets.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623781","Structure of the Earth;Inverse theory;Seismic tomography;Surface waves and free oscillations","","","","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This pipeline makes use of a detailed modelling of the halo mass function in f(R) gravity, which is based on the spherical collapse model and calibrated by simulations, and fully accounts for the effects of the fifth force on the dynamical mass, the halo concentration, and the observable–mass scaling relations. Using a set of mock cluster catalogues observed through the thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect, we demonstrate that this pipeline, which constrains the present-day background scalar field fR0, performs very well for both Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) and f(R) fiducial cosmologies. We find that using an incomplete treatment of the scaling relation, which could deviate from the usual power-law behaviour in f(R) gravity, can lead to imprecise and biased constraints. We also find that various degeneracies between the modified gravity, cosmological, and scaling relation parameters can significantly affect the constraints, and show how this can be rectified by using tighter priors and better knowledge of the cosmological and scaling relation parameters. Our pipeline can be easily extended to other modified gravity models, to test gravity on large scales using galaxy cluster catalogues from ongoing and upcoming surveys.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646735","methods: numerical;galaxies: clusters: general;cosmology: theory, dark energy","","","","","","","10 Dec 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The idea that dark energy originates from quantum vacuum fluctuations has circulated since the late '60s, but theoretical estimations of vacuum energy have disagreed with the measured value by many orders of magnitude, until recently. Lifshitz theory applied to cosmology has produced the correct order of magnitude for dark energy. Furthermore, the theory is based on well-established and experimentally well-tested grounds in atomic, molecular and optical physics. In this paper, we confront Lifshitz cosmology with astronomical data. We find that the dark–energy dynamics predicted by the theory is able to resolve the Hubble tension, the discrepancy between the observed and predicted Hubble constant within the standard cosmological model. The theory is consistent with supernovae data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and the Cosmic Microwave Background. Our findings indicate that Lifshitz cosmology is a serious candidate for explaining dark energy.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584259","dark energy","","","","","","","21 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A formal analysis complements user evaluations. This approach enriches user-centred design that typically focuses understanding on context and producing sketch designs. These sketches are often non-functional (e.g. paper) prototypes. They provide a means of exploring candidate design possibilities using techniques such as cooperative evaluation. This paper describes a further step in the process using formal analysis techniques. The use of formal methods provides a systematic approach to checking plausibility and consistency during early design stages, while at the same time enabling the generation of executable prototypes.

It has even been suggested that JWST could provide the first opportunity to search for biosignatures in an alien atmosphere using transmission spectroscopy. This claim is investigated, specifically for the proposed anoxic biosignature pair CH4–CO2. The most favourable known target is adopted (TRAPPIST-1e), with an assumed atmospheric composition similar to the Archean Earth. Compared to previous studies, a more systematic investigation of the effect that cloud/haze layers have on the detectability of CH4 and CO2 is performed. In addition to a clear atmosphere scenario, cloud/haze layers are considered at eight pressure levels between 600 and 1 mbar. These pressures cover a plausible range for H2O cloud and photochemical haze, based on observations of solar system atmospheres and physical models of tidally locked planets such as TRAPPIST-1e, although no assumptions regarding the cloud/haze-layer composition are made in this study. For the clear atmosphere and cloud/haze-layer pressures of 600–100 mbar, strong (5σ) detections of both CH4 and CO2 are found to be possible with approximately 5–10 co-added transits measured using the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) prism, assuming a dry stratosphere. However, approximately 30 co-added transits would be required to achieve the same result if a cloud/haze layer is present at 10 mbar. A cloud/haze layer at 1 mbar would prevent the detection of either molecule with the NIRSpec prism for observing programmes up to 50 transits (>200 h of JWST time), the maximum considered.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab3383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9691019","planets and satellites: atmospheres;planets and satellites: general","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We present a novel method that leverages optimal decision theory to address this problem. As a preliminary step, we develop an analysis that uses an assumed prevalence and conditional probability models of diagnostic measurement outcomes to define optimal (in the sense of minimizing rates of false positives and false negatives) classification domains. Critically, we demonstrate how this strategy can be generalized to a setting in which the prevalence is unknown by either (i) defining a third class of hold-out samples that require further testing or (ii) using an adaptive algorithm to estimate prevalence prior to defining classification domains. We also provide examples for a recently published SARS-CoV-2 serology test and discuss how measurement uncertainty (e.g. associated with instrumentation) can be incorporated into the analysis. We find that our new strategy decreases classification error by up to a decade relative to more traditional methods based on confidence intervals. Moreover, it establishes a theoretical foundation for generalizing techniques such as receiver operating characteristics by connecting them to the broader field of optimization.","1477-8602","","10.1093/imammb/dqab007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579102","classification;SARS-CoV-2;serology;antibody;optimal decision theory","","","","","","","18 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We derive a quadrupole-level secular Hamiltonian of this system, which involves a dimensionless parameter η that is used to characterize the flattening of MN disc. (The smaller η, the flatter disc; and η = 0 gives the infinitely thin Kuzmin disc.) We find that, in the quadrupole approximation, the perturbation of the MN disc can give rise to the von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai (ZLK)-like dynamics and depending on the value of η the dynamics has two different manifestations: (i) when η < 1/3, the test particle's behaviour is similar to that described in the classical ZLK problem. In particular, as η increases from 0 to 1/3, the critical inclination for the large eccentricity oscillations decreases from $26{_{.}^{\circ}}56$ to 0°, ; (ii) when η > 1/3, the orbital evolution of the test particle and the phase-space morphology are opposite to the classical ZLK case. This leads to a striking result that the test particle cannot remain on a near-coplanar orbit if its eccentricity is sufficiently large. However, as η increases further the ZLK-like dynamics would be gradually suppressed by the spherical term in the Hamiltonian. We also survey the global secular dynamics numerically in which the quadrupole approximation is no longer valid.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584230","gravitation;celestial mechanics;galaxies: disc","","","","","","","21 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The left ears of C3H mice were subjected to 2 and 15 Gy of radiation in a single exposure. At 24 h after irradiation, the ears were excised and tissue sections were stained with toluidine blue to assess mast cell degranulation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was assessed via immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Approximately 5% (3%–14%) (mean [95% CI]) of mast cells in the skin of control mice were degranulated; moreover, at 24 h after 2 Gy irradiation, this value increased to approximately 20% (17%–28%). Mast cell degranulation by 15 Gy irradiation (32% [24%–40%]) was greater than that by 2 Gy irradiation. Significant differences were observed in mast cell degranulation among the control, 2 Gy and 15 Gy groups (p = 0.012). Furthermore, VEGF-positive reactions were observed in the cytoplasm of scattered fibroblasts in the dermis. In immunohistochemistry tests, VEGF expression at 24 h after irradiation increased slightly in the 2 Gy group compared to that in the control group, whereas no difference in VEGF expression was observed in the 15 Gy group compared to that in the control group. Expression of VEGF in western blots was consistent with that in immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, mast cell degranulation was increased in mouse skin at 24 h after irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, VEGF expression was slightly increased following only low-dose (2 Gy) irradiation.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrab067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579180","","","","","","","","18 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Together with Neumann boundary conditions based on a multipole expansion of the right-hand side this minimizes the number of additional elements needed. Initial conditions for the iterative solution of the Poisson equation based on temporal extrapolation from previous time steps together with a polynomial multigrid method reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence. In summary, this approach reduces the extra cost for simulating full gravity to a similar order as the elastic forces.

The geometric cross-section of these aggregates is a crucial parameter characterizing aerodynamical friction, collision rates, and opacities. However, numerical measurements of the cross-section are often time consuming as aggregates exhibit complex shapes. In this study, we derive a novel analytic expression for geometric cross-sections of fractal aggregates. If an aggregate consists of N monomers of radius R0, its geometric cross-section G is expressed as $G=AN\pi R_0^2/[1+(N-1)\tilde{\sigma }]$, where $\tilde{\sigma }$ is an overlapping efficiency, and A is a numerical factor connecting the analytic expression to the small non-fractal cluster limit. The overlapping efficiency depends on the fractal dimension, fractal prefactor, and N of the aggregate, and its analytic expression is derived as well. The analytic expressions successfully reproduce numerically measured cross-sections of aggregates. We also find that our expressions are compatible with the mean-field light scattering theory of aggregates in the geometrical optics limit. The analytic expressions greatly simplify an otherwise tedious calculation and will be useful in model calculations of fractal grain growth in protoplanetary discs and planetary atmospheres.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab1069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9466698","methods: analytical;planets and satellites: atmospheres;protoplanetary discs","","","","","","","28 Jun 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We do this in order to determine why there is a discrepancy between theoretical models that predict that winds should play a secondary role to photoionization in the dynamics of H IIregions, and observations of young H IIregions that seem to suggest a driving role for winds. In particular, regions such as M42 in Orion have neutral hydrogen shells, suggesting that the ionizing radiation is trapped closer to the star. We first derive formulae for wind bubble evolution in non-uniform density fields, focusing on singular isothermal sphere density fields with a power-law index of -2. We find that a classical ‘Weaver’-like expansion velocity becomes constant in such a density distribution. We then calculate the structure of the photoionized shell around such wind bubbles, and determine at what point the mass in the shell cannot absorb all of the ionizing photons emitted by the star, causing an ‘overflow’ of ionizing radiation. We also estimate perturbations from cooling, gravity, magnetic fields and instabilities, all of which we argue are secondary effects for the conditions studied here. Our wind-driven model provides a consistent explanation for the behaviour of M42 to within the errors given by observational studies. We find that in relatively denser molecular cloud environments around single young stellar sources, champagne flows are unlikely until the wind shell breaks up due to turbulence or clumping in the cloud.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab3245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9691135","stars: massive;stars: formation < Stars;ISM: H ii regions;ISM: clouds < Interstellar Medium (ISM), Nebulae;methods: analytical < Astronomical instrumentation, methods, and techniques","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

During Southern Hemisphere winter, the dominant sources are largely confined to the Southern Hemisphere, the most prominent exception being the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc, which is the most active source region between 12 and 20 mHz.

However, in order to provide solid answers and resolve controversies, the accuracy of the predictions is essential. Ionic electrodiffusion models typically comprise non-trivial systems of non-linear and highly coupled partial and ordinary differential equations that govern phenomena on disparate time scales. Here, we study numerical challenges related to approximating these systems. We consider a homogenized model for electrodiffusion and osmosis in brain tissue and present and evaluate different associated finite element-based splitting schemes in terms of their numerical properties, including accuracy, convergence and computational efficiency for both idealized scenarios and for the physiologically relevant setting of cortical spreading depression (CSD). We find that the schemes display optimal convergence rates in space for problems with smooth manufactured solutions. However, the physiological CSD setting is challenging: we find that the accurate computation of CSD wave characteristics (wave speed and wave width) requires a very fine spatial and fine temporal resolution.","1477-8602","","10.1093/imammb/dqab016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686655","electrodiffusion;osmosis;brain electrophysiology and mechanics;finite element method;splitting scheme;numerical convergence","","","","","","","19 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In the model, a reverse fault is assumed in a 2-D uniform elastic half-space, and relative plate motion is imposed with a constant velocity. Simulated earthquakes occur repeatedly at a shallower seismogenic plate interface with a velocity-weakening frictional property, while stable sliding occurs in the deeper part, in which a velocity-strengthening frictional property is assumed. During interseismic periods, deep stable sliding causes shear stress to concentrate at the deeper edge of the locked plate interface, and a partial drop in stress occurs, resulting in plate detachment. The resulting detachment front propagates upwards along the seismogenic plate interface until an earthquake occurs, causing aseismic sliding with a sliding velocity significantly lower than the imposed relative plate velocity. The propagation velocity of the detachment front is almost constant in each case, and it is proportional to the relative plate velocity and inversely proportional to the effective normal stress. Episodic events of increased slip velocity occur in the latter half of an interseismic period when the characteristic slip distance is small. Updip propagation of episodic slip is arrested by a low stress barrier, and episodic slips backpropagate downdip. During the final few years of the simulation cycle, the average sliding velocity is approximately inversely proportional to the time to occurrence for a large interplate earthquake.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579249","Earthquake dynamics;Earthquake interaction, forecasting, and prediction;Rheology and friction of fault zones;Dynamics and mechanics of faulting","","","","","","","18 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We place binary hypothesis tests on theoretical models of such radiation patterns to screen cylindrically symmetric sources (like explosions) from non-symmetric sources (like non-vertical dip-slip or non-VDS faults). These models for data include sources with several unknown parameters, contaminated by Gaussian noise and embedded in a layered half-space. The generalized maximum likelihood ratio tests that we derive from these data models produce screening statistics and decision rules that depend on measured, noisy ground motion at discrete sensor locations. We explicitly quantify how the screening power of these statistics increase with the size of any dip-slip and strike-slip components of the source, relative to noise (faulting signal strength) and how they vary with network geometry. As applications of our theory, we apply these tests to (1) find optimal sensor locations that maximize the probability of screening non-circular radiation patterns and (2) invert for the largest non-VDS faulting signal that could be mistakenly attributed to an explosion with damage, at a particular attribution probability. Finally, we quantify how certain errors that are sourced by opening cracks increase screening rate errors. While such theoretical solutions are ideal and require future validation, they remain important in underground explosion monitoring scenarios because they provide fundamental physical limits on the discrimination power of tests that screen explosive from non-VDS faulting sources.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624701","Theoretical seismology;Surface waves and free oscillations;Earthquake monitoring and test-ban treaty verification;Probability distributions","","","","","","","23 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Our observations of NML Cyg were combined with complementary archival data to enable a search for signatures of morphological complexity in the circumstellar environment, using emission lines from 15 molecular species. The recovered parameters imply the presence of three distinct, coherent, and persistent components, comprised of blue-shifted and red-shifted components, in addition to an underlying outflow centred at the stellar systemic velocity. Furthermore, to reproduce 12CO emission with 3D radiative transfer models required a spherical outflow with three superposed conical outflows, one towards and one away from the observer, and one in the plane of the sky. These components are higher in density than the spherical outflow by up to an order of magnitude. We hence propose that NML Cyg's circumstellar environment consists of a small number of high-density large-scale coherent outflows embedded in a spherical wind. This would make the mass-loss history similar to that of VY CMa, and distinct from μ Cep, where the outflow contains many randomly distributed smaller clumps. A possible correlation between stellar properties, outflow structures, and content is critical in understanding the evolution of massive stars and their environmental impact.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab3244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9690982","stars: massive;stars: mass-loss;supergiants;stars: wind;outflows;radio lines: stars","","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Real-world scenes are defined by typical part–whole relationships, where the meaning of the whole scene emerges from configurations of localized information present in individual parts of the scene. Such typical part–whole relationships suggest that information from individual scene parts is not processed independently, but that there are mutual influences between the parts and the whole during scene analysis. Here, we review recent research that used a straightforward, but effective approach to study such mutual influences: By dissecting scenes into multiple arbitrary pieces, these studies provide new insights into how the processing of whole scenes is shaped by their constituent parts and, conversely, how the processing of individual parts is determined by their role within the whole scene. We highlight three facets of this research: First, we discuss studies demonstrating that the spatial configuration of multiple scene parts has a profound impact on the neural processing of the whole scene. Second, we review work showing that cortical responses to individual scene parts are shaped by the context in which these parts typically appear within the environment. Third, we discuss studies demonstrating that missing scene parts are interpolated from the surrounding scene context. Bridging these findings, we argue that efficient scene processing relies on an active use of the scene's part–whole structure, where the visual brain matches scene inputs with internal models of what the world should look like.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_01788","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:KA4683/2-1,CI241/1-1,CI241/3-1,CI241/7-1); H2020 European Research Council(grant numbers:ERC-2018-StG 803370); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9655663","","","","","","","CCBY","17 Dec 2021","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In the dynamical maps provided, the Shannon entropy is utilized to explore the general structure of the phase space, while, based on the time evolution of the entropy, we also determine the extent and rate of the chaotic diffusion as well as the characteristic times of stability for the planets. Two cases are considered: (i) the pure Laplace resonance when the critical angles of the two-body resonances circulate and that of the three-body resonance librates; and (ii) the chain of two two-body resonances when all the critical angles librate. Our results suggest that case (ii) is the more favourable configuration, but we state too that, in either case, the relevant resonance plays an important role in stabilizing the system. The derived stability times are no shorter than 108 yr in the central parts of the resonances.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9648104","chaos;diffusion;celestial mechanics;planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability","","","","","","","13 Dec 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

After graduating MIT in 1974 with a B.S. in mechanical engineering, Adrian Gropper spent a few years doing medical research at Harvard Medical School, going on to get his M.D. there. But, says Gropper, after three years of med school, ""I knew I didn't want to practice medicine - I wanted the M.D. in order to do things to control my own destiny [and do] the jobs and projects where only the M.D.s control the funds. What I didn’t know then was that instead of becoming an academic researcher, I was going to be an entrepreneur."" Today Gropper is the volunteer chief technology officer of Patient Privacy Rights, a nonprofit founded in 2006 to advocate for patient control over medical records. He is also the cofounder and principal of HIE of One, an early-stage startup that is developing open-source software to allow patients direct, centralized control over records that might otherwise be scattered across multiple doctors’ offices or hospitals. Additionally, Gropper contributes to projects in W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) self-sovereign identity, and to the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) and GNAP (Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol) work groups.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2021.9394551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9394551","","Biomedical imaging;Privacy;Task analysis;Point of care;Engineering profession;Windings;W3C","","","","","IEEE","2 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a ""global view"" of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework. The experimental results on a real dataset with various response plans validate our proposed solution and demonstrate its superior performance.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409764","COVID-19;Digital Twin (DT);Federated Learning (FL);deep learning","Urban areas;COVID-19;Data models;Collaboration;Predictive models;Pandemics;Training","","128","","","","20 Apr 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Among these architectures, the short-term implementation of hybrid and all-electric architectures is limited, particularly for large-capacity aircraft due to the low energy/power density levels achievable by state-of-the-art electrical energy storage systems. Conversely, turboelectric architectures with advanced distributed propulsion and boundary layer ingestion are set to lead the efforts toward more electric powertrains. At the center of this transition, power converters and high-power density electric machines, i.e., electric motors and generators, and their corresponding thermal management systems are analyzed as the key devices enabling the more electric powertrain. Moreover, to further increase the fuel efficiency and power density of the aircraft, the benefits and challenges of implementing higher voltage powertrains are described. Lastly, based on the findings collected in this article, the projected roadmap toward more electric aircraft powertrains is presented.

These vehicles differ from traditional fossil-fuel-based vehicles especially in the time consumed to keep them running. Electric-Vehicle-charging Service Providers (EVSPs) must arrange reasonable charging times for users in advance. Most EVSP services are based on third-party platforms, but reliance on third-party platforms creates a lack of security, leaving users vulnerable to attacks and user-privacy leakages. In this paper, we propose an anonymous blockchain-based system for charging-connected electric vehicles that eliminates third-party platforms through blockchain technology and the establishment of a multi-party security system between electric vehicles and EVSPs. In our proposed system, digital certificates are obtained by completing distributed Public Key Infrastructure (distributed-PKI) identity registration, with the user registration kept separate from the verification process, which eliminates dependence on the EVSP for information security. In the verification process, we adopt smart contracts to solve problems associated with centralized verification and opaque services. Furthermore, we utilize zero-knowledge proof and ring-signature superposition to realize completely anonymous verification, which ensures undeniability and unforgeability with no detriment to anonymity. The evaluation results show that the user anonymity, information authenticity, and system security of our system fulfill the necessary requirements.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9449329","blockchain;Electric Vehicles (EV);zero knowledge proof;distributed Public Key Infrastructure (distributed-PKI);ring signature;smart contract","Blockchain;Privacy;Security;Encryption;Smart contracts;Standards;Electric vehicle charging","","87","","","","9 Jun 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The utilization of transfer learning under the modification of the existing residual CNN structure guarantees the detection of unknown attacks. One-dimensional ICS flow data are converted into two-dimensional grayscale images to take full advantage of the features of CNN. Results show that the proposed method achieves a high score and solves the time problem associated with deep learning model training.

Moreover, a cooperative search is designed to produce new solutions based on different types of relationship between any solution and its neighbors. To enhance the quality of solutions, two local intensification operators are implemented according to the problem characteristics. In addition, a dynamic adjustment strategy for weight vectors is designed to balance the diversity and convergence, which can adaptively modify weight vectors according to the distribution of the non-dominated front.

We monitored the behavior of I–V characteristics of the PV cell based on monocrystalline silicon in temperature range with extreme limits from −170 °C to +100 °C. We have not yet found a similar measurement in this temperature interval. The temperature of PV modules without radiation concentration can reach values of −100 °C to +100 °C on the Earth's surface. The temperature range may be few wider in space. Changes of I–V characteristics and P–V characteristics are discussed in terms of the theory of solids. The open-circuit voltage dependence is approximately linear over a wide temperature range, but saturation occurs at temperatures around −150 °C, which is also explained in accordance with the theory of semiconductors. The decrease in energy conversion efficiency with increasing temperature has a value of about 0.5%/°C throughout the whole temperature range possible on the Earth's surface. If there are large changes in the temperature of the PV modules during operation of the PV system, the electrical voltage of the PV modules will also change considerably. In space applications, these fluctuations may be greater. This must be taken into account when designing PV systems (especially for deep space missions).

An important difference between these two approaches is that BDM solutions enable data transmission over unused spectral bands of already-deployed optical fibers, whereas SDM solutions require the availability of additional fibers to replicate C-band WDM transmission. On the other hand, to properly design a multiband optical line system (OLS), the following fiber propagation effects have been taken into account in the analysis: (i) stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), which induces considerable power transfer among bands; (ii) frequency dependence of fiber parameters such as attenuation, dispersion, and nonlinear coefficients; and (iii) utilization of optical amplifiers with different doping materials, thus leading to different characteristics, e.g., in terms of noise figures. This work follows a two-step approach: First, we aim at maximizing and flattening the quality of transmission (QoT) when adding L- and ${\rm L} {+} {\rm S}$-bands to a traditional WDM OLS where only the C-band is deployed. This is achieved by applying a multiband optimized optical power control for BDM upgrades, which consists of setting a pre-tilt and power offset in the line amplifiers, thus achieving a considerable increase in QoT, both in average value and flatness. Second, the SDM approach is used as a benchmark for the BDM approach by assessing network performance on three network topologies with different geographical footprints. We show that, with optical power properly optimized, BDM may enable an increase in network traffic, slightly less than an SDM upgrade but still comparable, without requiring additional fiber cables.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.419293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402935","","Nonlinear optics;Optical scattering;Wavelength division multiplexing;Power control;Optical fiber networks;Optical noise;Optimization","","56","","","","13 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The metasurface is composed of a parallel plate waveguide (PPW) loaded with quasi-periodic inclusions in both conductors. The inclusions are square holes printed on a substrate, with vias placed around the holes. The vias connect the printed layer of the substrate to the ground. This configuration is named substrate-integrated hole (SIH). It is demonstrated that the SIH metasurface can obtain a higher effective refractive index, compared to the conventional holey metasurface. To further increase the effective refractive index, the SIHs in the two conductors of the PPW are glide-symmetrically arranged. The refractive index distribution of the Luneburg lens is realized by locally tuning the dimensions of the SIHs. The lens is fed with 11 waveguide feeds with an angular separation of 10$^{\circ }$. Thus, the antenna can steer its radiation in a 100° angular range. A flare is integrated with the PPW to match the antenna to the free-space impedance. Since the wave propagates mainly in the PPW air gap, the dielectric losses are low. The measured radiation efficiency of the antenna is roughly 80%.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2021.3060283","Strategic Innovation Program Smarter Electronics System; venture of Vinnova, Formas, and the Swedish Energy Agency(grant numbers:2019-02103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357913","Glide symmetry;Luneburg lens antenna;substrate-integrated hole (SIH)","Lenses;Refractive index;Metasurfaces;Antennas;Antenna measurements;Substrates;Gain","","48","","37","CCBY","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel method to infer transportation modes from GPS trajectory data and Geographic Information System (GIS) information. This method is based on feature extraction and machine learning classification algorithms. While using GIS information to improve inference accuracy, we ensure that the algorithm is simple and easy to use on mobile devices. Applied to GeoLife GPS trajectory dataset, our method achieves 91.1% accuracy while inferring transportation modes, such as walking, bike, bus, car, and subway, with random forest classification algorithm. GIS features in our method improved the overall accuracy by 2.5% while raising the recall of the bus and subway transportation mode categories by 3.4% and 18.5%.

Based on the research of the 1v1 autonomous air combat maneuver decision, this paper builds a multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Firstly, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to achieve communication between UAV individuals, and the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model under the actor-critic architecture is established. Secondly, through combining with target allocation and air combat situation assessment, the tactical goal of the formation is merged with the reinforcement learning goal of every UAV, and a cooperative tactical maneuver policy is generated.

To address these issues, an MPPT solution for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems is proposed that combines the golden section search (GSS), P&O, and INC methods to simultaneously achieve faster convergence and smaller oscillation, converging to the MPP by repeatedly narrowing the width of the interval at the rate of the golden ratio. The proposed MPPT technique was applied to a PV system consisting of a PV array, boost chopper, and inverter.

To extent Ethernet with real-time service for future E/E architecture, a time-sensitive networking (TSN) profile for automotive Ethernet has been created. This paper evaluates the implementation of multiple traffic scheduling and shaping mechanisms in the automotive Ethernet, respectively. And we especially focus on two solutions, namely the time-aware shaping (TAS) and asynchronous traffic shaping (ATS). To investigate the performance, we introduce a TSN-based automotive gateway testing model in a simulation environment. Further-more, another two methods, i.e., strict-priority and credit-based shaper (CBS), as well as TAS and ATS are implemented in the model and tested within a domain-based IVN scenario. The results show that TAS guarantees the shortest worst-case latency of high-priority streams, whereas it has a longer transmission latency for low-priority streams. ATS provides less determinism for high-priority streams than TAS, but ensures a better average latency of all streams.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377694","Automotive electronics;Ethernet networks;scheduling algorithms;simulation;time-sensitive networking","Logic gates;Ethernet;Automotive engineering;Job shop scheduling;Synchronization;Testing;Topology","","38","","","","12 Mar 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

The proposed network consists of three modules. A lightweight and stable feature extraction module is used to reduce the computational load and stably extract more low-level feature, an enhanced feature processing module significantly improves the feature extraction ability of the model, and an accurate detection module integrates low-level and advanced features to improve the multiscale detection accuracy in complex environments, particularly for small objects. The proposed method achieves a detection speed of 147 frames per second (FPS) and a mean average precision (mAP) of 90.97% for a dataset composed of flying objects, indicating its potential for low-altitude object detection.

However, the current implementation of network slicing in 5G has several limitations, especially regarding management and orchestration: The isolation of slice management is not appropriately addressed, the slice tenant management capabilities are limited, and the management and orchestration centralization raises serious scalability and reliability issues. Moreover, the slice-level operations are not well-separated from other processes due to a lack of proper separation of concerns. As a result, the overall network slicing architecture has complex interactions with many components of the 5G network. In this paper, we describe a new framework that uses an approach to sustain self-managed and self-orchestrated slices. To that end, we propose a modular architecture in which slices have embedded (in-slice) management and orchestration support, and multi-domain slices rely on multiple slice-agnostic orchestrators.

Thus, efficient algorithms to extract keywords from the text are important to obtain information quickly. However, the precision and recall of mature keyword extraction algorithms need improvement. TextRank, which is derived from the PageRank algorithm, uses word graphs to spread the weight of words. The keyword weight propagation in TextRank focuses only on word frequency. To improve the performance of the algorithm, we propose Semantic Clustering TextRank (SCTR), a semantic clustering news keyword extraction algorithm based on TextRank. Firstly, the word vectors generated by the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model are used to perform k-means clustering to represent semantic clustering. Then, the clustering results are used to construct a TextRank weight transfer probability matrix. Finally, iterative calculation of word graphs and extraction of keywords are performed. The test target of this experiment is a Chinese news library. The results of the experiment conducted on this text set show that the SCTR algorithm has greater precision, recall, and F1 value than the traditional TextRank and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithms.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9449333","keyword extraction;TextRank;semantics;word vector","Semantics;Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Probability;Bit error rate;Data mining;Deep learning","","32","","","","9 Jun 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, the well-developed emerging technologies in 5G are hardly applied to the maritime communications, resulting from the lack of communication infrastructure deployed on the vast ocean, as well as different characteristics of wireless propagation environment over the sea and maritime user distribution. To satisfy the expected plethora of broadband communications and multimedia applications on the ocean, a brand-new maritime information network with a comprehensive coverage capacity in terms of all-hour, all-weather, and all-sea-area has been expected as a revolutionary paradigm to extend the terrestrial capacity of enhanced broadband, massive access, ultra-reliable, and low-latency to the vast ocean. Further considering the limited available resource of maritime communication infrastructure, the convergence of broadband and broadcast/multicast can be regarded as a possible yet practical solution for realizing an efficient and flexible resource configuration with high quality of services. Moreover, according to such multi-functionality and all-coverage maritime information network, the monitoring and sensing of vast ocean area relying on massive Ocean of Things and advanced radar techniques can be also supported. Concerning these issues above, this study proposes a Software Defined Networking (SDN) based Maritime Giant Cellular Network (MagicNet) architecture for broadband and multimedia services.

In quantum annealers, this noise introduces additional fluctuations to the parameters defining the original problem Hamiltonian, such that they find the ground states of problems perturbed from those originally programmed. Here, we describe a method to benchmark the amount of noise affecting the programmed Hamiltonian of a quantum annealer. We show that a sequence of degenerate runs with the coefficients of the programmed Hamiltonian set to zero leads to an estimate of the noise spectral density affecting Hamiltonian parameters “in situ” during the quantum annealing protocol. The method is demonstrated in D-Wave's lower noise 2000 qubit device (DW_2000Q_6) and in its recently released 5000 qubit device (Advantage_system1.1). Our benchmarking of DW_2000Q_6 shows Hamiltonian noise dominated by the $1/f^{0.7}$ frequency dependence characteristic of flux noise intrinsic to the materials forming flux qubits.

A fast and accurate magnetic field calculation model for interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM) is proposed in this article. Based on the traditional magnetic potential permeance method, the stator cogging effect and complex boundary conditions of the IPMSM can be fully considered in this model, so as to realize the rapid calculation of equivalent magnetomotive force (MMF), air gap permeance, and other key electromagnetic properties. In this article, a 6-pole 36-slot IPMSM is taken as an example to establish its equivalent solution model, thereby the cogging torque is accurately calculated. And the validity of this model is verified by a variety of different magnetic pole structures, pole slot combinations machines, and prototype experiments. In addition, the improvement measure of the machine with different combination of pole arc coefficient is also studied based on this model. Cogging torque and electromagnetic vibration can be effectively weakened. Combined with the finite element model and multi-physics coupling model, the electromagnetic characteristics and vibration performance of this machine are comprehensively compared and analyzed. The analysis results have well verified its effectiveness.

One of the critical steps in cellular heterogeneity analysis is the cell type identification. Diverse scRNA-seq clustering methods have been proposed to partition cells into clusters. Among all the methods, hierarchical clustering and spectral clustering are the most popular approaches in the downstream clustering analysis with different preprocessing strategies such as similarity learning, dropout imputation, and dimensionality reduction. In this study, we carry out a comprehensive analysis by combining different strategies with these two categories of clustering methods on scRNA-seq datasets under different biological conditions. The analysis results show that the methods with spectral clustering tend to perform better on datasets with continuous shapes in two-dimension, while those with hierarchical clustering achieve better results on datasets with obvious boundaries between clusters in two-dimension. Motivated by this finding, a new strategy, called QRS, is developed to quantitatively evaluate the latent representative shape of a dataset to distinguish whether it has clear boundaries or not. Finally, a data-driven clustering recommendation method, called DDCR, is proposed to recommend hierarchical clustering or spectral clustering for scRNA-seq data. We perform DDCR on two typical single cell clustering methods, SC3 and RAFSIL, and the results show that DDCR recommends a more suitable downstream clustering method for different scRNA-seq datasets and obtains more robust and accurate results.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409765","single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq);cellular heterogeneity;cell type identification;data latent shape;clustering","Clustering methods;Correlation;Clustering algorithms;Biology;Shape;Dimensionality reduction;Gold","","28","","","","20 Apr 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper, we propose HTDet, a novel HT detection method using information entropy-based clustering. To maintain high concealment, HTs are usually inserted in the regions with low controllability and low observability, which will result in that Trojan logics have extremely low transitions during the simulation. This implies that the regions with the low transitions will provide much more abundant and more important information for HT detection. The HTDet applies information theory technology and a density-based clustering algorithm called Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to detect all suspicious Trojan logics in the circuit under detection. The DBSCAN is an unsupervised learning algorithm, that can improve the applicability of HTDet. In addition, we develop a heuristic test pattern generation method using mutual information to increase the transitions of suspicious Trojan logics.

A linear to circular polarization conversion metasurface (MS) is employed as the superstrate of the FP resonator antenna. The working principle of the unit cell adopted by the MS enables it to independently control the transmission and reflection characteristics. Firstly, the MS is designed to present high reflectivity to ensure the high gain of the FP resonator antenna. Then the capability of polarization conversion is endowed to it. The square patch of the unit cell can receive two orthogonal LP waves, and the cross slot on the ground plane can also make them get through. Meanwhile, the circular patch with 45° tilted etched slot can radiate different CP waves when excited by different LP waves. Therefore, the proposed MS can combine the function of partial reflection and transmission polarization conversion. And for different LP waves, the MS can convert them into different CP waves. A dual LP microstrip patch antenna is designed to act as the feed of the resonator antenna. When the antenna is fed at different ports, different LP waves are excited in the resonant cavity and are converted into different CP waves by the MS, thus the antenna obtains dual CP radiation. The measured results indicate that the antenna can exhibit excellent dual CP radiation characteristic. Compared with other reported dual CP resonator antennas, the proposed antenna can obtain well performance with simple structure and low profile.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3062460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9363868","Dual circularly polarized;Fabry–Perot resonator antenna;polarization conversion metasurface;high gain","Antennas;Polarization;Antenna feeds;Reflection;Dipole antennas;Dielectric resonator antennas;Slot antennas","","27","","27","CCBY","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, its grid integration deteriorates frequency stability because of insufficient rotating masses and inertial response. Hence, a synchronverter, which is an inverter that mimics the operation of a synchronous generator, is crucial to interface solar power in a power grid. It stabilizes the power grid by emulating a virtual inertia. However, a conventional proportional-integral (PI)-based synchronverter is not equipped with an adaptive damping factor (Dp) or a digitalized smart controller to manage fast-responding solar inputs. Hence, a novel fuzzy logic controller (FLC) framework is proposed such that the synchronverter can operate in a grid-connected solar power system. In this study, Dp is controlled in real time using an FLC to achieve balance between speed and stability for frequency error correction based on frequency difference. Results of four case studies performed in Matlab/Simulink show that the proposed FLC-based synchronverter can stabilize the grid frequency by reducing the frequency deviation by at least 0.2 Hz (0.4%), as compared with the conventional PI-based synchronverter.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2021.000014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9479930","Fuzzy logic controller (FLC);synchronverter;renewable energy system (RES);grid stability;solar power system","Power system stability;Frequency synchronization;Frequency control;Fuzzy logic;Voltage measurement;Voltage control;Inverters","","25","","","","9 Jul 2021","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

In the both policies, the system (i.e., the waiting queue and the server) can contain at most two packets, one packet of each source; when the server is busy and a new packet arrives, the possible packet of the same source in the waiting queue is replaced by the fresh packet. The main difference between the policies is that in the self-preemptive policy, the packet under service is replaced upon the arrival of a new packet from the same source, whereas in the non-preemptive policy, this new arriving packet is blocked and cleared.

The transmitarray antenna is composed of aperiodic transmitarray units arranged periodically. The TA unit is mainly composed of three layers, which are composed of metals and substrates. Square patches are printed on the substrate of the top and bottom layers, and the middle layer is a Jerusalem slot in the ground. The overall thickness of TA unit is 0.165λ0 (λ0 is the free space wavelength at 15GHz). In Ku-band, the insertion of the TA unit is less than 0.5dB, which reduces the backward radiation of the transmitarray antenna. The 360° phase is achieved by changing the length of the patch and slot, and the proposed transmitarray unit has a flat phase curve and great transmission characteristics.

Generally, a CPT system transfers the power based on electric fields. The complex resonant compensation networks are used to make the CPT system work in the resonant condition. The resonant voltage is always very high. It will be a big challenge to the human safety. In this paper, a virtual electrons periodic reciprocating flow theory is proposed for the CPT system. In one switching cycle, the electrons firstly flow in the forward direction through the forward path and then flow in the inverse direction through the inverse path. The CPT system has been deeply studied with the vacuum dielectric or the air dielectric. However, for the CPT system, there are few papers to show the underwater application. In this paper, an undersea four-plate CPT system is designed and studied in the underwater condition. The two coupling capacitors and other elements of the CPT system could build a closed-loop path. A small value inductor is adapted as a resonant compensation network for the four-plate CPT system. The DC voltage is inverted to the AC voltage in the primary side with the single-phase full-bridge inverter. The resonant voltage is rectified to the DC voltage in the secondary side with the single-phase full-bridge diode rectifier.

The proposed method predicts the reference voltage vector in the α-β subspace by employing the deadbeat control principle on the machine predictive model; thus, the exhaustive exploration procedure is avoided to relieve the computational load. To perform the constant switching frequency operation and achieve better steady-state performance, a modified SVPWM strategy is developed with the same conventional structure, which modulates the reference voltage vector. This new approach is based on a redesigned and adjusted post-fault virtual voltage vector space distribution that eliminates the y-axis harmonic components in the x-y subspace and ensures the generation of symmetrical PWM pulses. Meanwhile, the combined merits of the DB, MPCC, and SVPWM methods are realized.

To minimize data delivery and data storage costs, we design an algorithm to jointly optimize data routing and storage node deployment. The problem can be formulated as a binary nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem, and dueto its NP-hardness, designing approximation algorithms is highly nontrivial. By leveraging the Markov approximation framework, we elaborately design an efficient algorithm driven by a continuous-time Markov chain to schedule the deployment of the storage node and corresponding routing strategy.

With technological advancements, several mechanisms and mobile applications have been developed that attempt to trace the physical contact made by a person with someone who has been tested COVID-19 positive. While designing these apps, user's privacy has been an afterthought and has resulted in mass violations of privacy of the public and the patients. A total of 32 countries have designed apps and rely on them as a strategy to flatten the pandemic curve. Along with lack of privacy, these methodologies are centralized, where they are fully controlled by the government and the healthcare providers. Owing to these and many other concerns, people are hesitant in the adoption of these technologies. This paper presents a detailed analysis of user tracking apps belonging to 32 countries, thus demonstrating that they collect personal data and are a gross violation of user privacy. This paper presents a novel architecture for the efficient, effective and privacy-preserving contact tracing of COVID-19 patients using blockchain. The proposed architecture preserves the privacy of individuals and their contact history by encrypting all the data specific to an individual using a privacy-preserving Homomorphic encryption scheme and storing it on a permissioned blockchain network. The contacts made with a COVID-19 positive patient are identified by performing search queries directly over the Homomorphic encrypted data stored in the blocks. Therefore, only those contacts that are suspected to be COVID-19 positive may be decrypted by the healthcare professional or government for further contact tracing/diagnosis and COVID-19 testing; thereby leading to enhanced privacy.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9541339","Coronavirus;Hyperledger Fabric;pandemic;searchable encryption","COVID-19;Medical services;Data privacy;Security;Blockchains;Privacy;Regulation","","22","","","","20 Sep 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

The measurement data was processed using the Matlab R2018b Simulink program. Two methods of bolt tightening were tested: in one pass (in which the bolts were tightened in a specific sequence and each bolt was tightened immediately to the full preload value) and in several passes (in which the bolts were also tightened sequentially but the full preload value was applied to the bolts in three tightening cycles). The influence of the method and sequence of bolt tightening on the distribution of force values in bolts during and at the end of the preloading state was investigated. The results were statistically processed and summarized in the form of diagrams showing the distributions of normalized force values in the bolts for all the considered tightening cases. The tests were carried out for the selected connection and an assembly method was proposed which would make it possible to achieve the most even distribution of the force values in the bolts at its end, and thus before the connection exploitation state.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3067956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382992","Bolt tightening sequence;multi-bolted connection assembly;preload monitoring;resistance strain gauges","Fasteners;Force;Strain measurement;Force measurement;Electrical resistance measurement;Resistance;Monitoring","","21","","45","CCBY","22 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To provide an effective response and to mitigate wildfires impact, firefighters require a real-time monitoring of the fire front. This paper proposes a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) framework that allows a team of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to learn how to monitor a fire front. In the literature, independent Q-learners were proposed to solve a wildfire monitoring task with two UAVs. Here we propose a framework that can be easily extended to a larger number of UAVs. Our framework builds on two methods: multiple single trained Q-learning agents (MSTA) and value decomposition networks (VDN). MSTA trains a single UAV controller, which is then ""copied"" to each of the UAVs in the team. In contrast, VDN trains agents to learn how to cooperate. We benchmarked in simulations our two considered methods – MSTA and VDN – against two state-of-the-art approaches: independent Q-learners and a joint Q-learner. Simulation results show that our considered methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches in a wildfire front monitoring task with up to 9 fixed-wing and multi-copter UAVs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055651","H2020 HEIMDALL(grant numbers:740689); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340340","Robot learning;Multi-robot systems;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Intelligent robots;Mobile robots;Robot control","Monitoring;Task analysis;Fuels;Stochastic processes;Satellites;Drones;Scalability","","21","","","CCBY","29 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The spiral-loop winding is studied in detail as an example to show the generalized workflow that can also be used to analyze other short-circuited rotor winding types, such as nested-loop and multiphase double-layer windings. Magnetic field conversion factors are introduced to characterize the modulation behavior of special rotor windings and facilitate their comparison in terms of cross-coupling capability, average torque, and harmonic content of the air-gap flux density waveforms. The stator magnetomotive force (MMF), rotor MMF, and resultant air-gap MMF are considered, based on which the closed-form inductance formulas are derived, and the torque equation is obtained along with the optimal current angle for maximum torque operation by using the virtual work principle. The design equations are then developed for the initial sizing and geometry scaling of the BDFIMs. Transient finite element analysis and experimental measurements are performed to validate the analysis.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2021.000021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9540613","AC machines;air gap;magnetic field;spatial harmonic;frequency domain;modulation;rotor windings","Rotors;Windings;Air gaps;Stator windings;Torque;Modulation;Mathematical model","","20","","","","16 Sep 2021","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

The super high frequency (SHF) and the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands are the candidates for the deployment of the 5G cellular system and for satisfying future needs due to their massively available blocks of contiguous raw bandwidth that is capable of supporting additional data traffic for multimedia services. This research paper presents propagation measurements at three frequencies above 6 GHz, which are 14, 18, and 22 GHz frequency bands. The measurements were carried out or both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communication scenarios in an indoor corridor environment to present frequency- and distance-dependent wireless channel models. Moreover, this study presents, investigates, and compares the performance of two well-known path loss prediction models; the single frequency close-in (CI) free space reference distance model and the single frequency floating intercept (FI) model. The LOS comparison study shows that the CI and FI models provide comparable and accurate estimates that fit the real measured data for the frequency bands selected. Furthermore, the study investigates the behavior of the path loss exponent (PLE) and the FI model parameters as a function of the reception angle of arrival (AoA) in the NLOS scenario. It is observed from this work that the path loss models' parameters exhibit symmetrical behavior around 180° AoA. The FI model provides the same standard deviation values as the CI model in the LOS scenario. In contrast, the FI model offers a notable reduction(up to 2.84 dB) compared to the CI model in the NLOS scenario. Finally, the LOS and NLOS results reveal that the CI and FI models can be trusted as good path loss models for corridor environments and exhibit stable behavior over measured distances and frequencies.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2021.9340535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340535","SHF;mmWave;channel sounder;directional antennas;angle of arrival;indoor corridor environment;path loss models;propagation measurements;14 GHz;18 GHz;22 GHz","Predictive models;Loss measurement;Frequency measurement;Data models;Propagation losses;Semiconductor device measurement;Reliability","","20","","78","","29 Jan 2021","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

One of the most powerful and cost-effective monitoring methods is a neural network-based monitoring system that analyzes time series data from inertial sensors attached to cows. However, while deep learning has achieved many successes in pattern recognition, large-scale datasets are often required. When given a limited number of data, data augmentation is an extremely useful and low-cost preprocessing step for neural network-based systems. Data augmentation for inertial sensor data, however, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This letter proposes several inertial sensor data augmentation methods in a manner that fits the characteristics of cattle behavioral data. The proposed approaches are applied to the task of cattle behavior classification with convolutional neural networks, which is challenging given limited data. The classification performance increases from 83.07 to 94.43% with appropriate augmentation steps.

As a result, the volume, cost and complexity of the CMI topology are increased and the efficiency is deteriorated. This paper thus proposes a switched-capacitor-based multilevel inverter topology with half-bridge cells and only one dc source. Compared to the conventional CMI, the proposed inverter uses almost half the number of switches, while maintaining a boosting capability. Additionally, the main drawback of switched-capacitor multilevel inverters is the capacitor inrush current. This problem is also averted in the proposed topology by using a charging inductor or quasi-resonant capacitor charging with a front-end boost converter.

Thus, the on/off transition is significantly improved since the corner tunneling is the main cause of the degradation of the switching characteristics. To maximize the performance enhancement, the concentration of the pocket doping ( ${N} _{\mathrm {POC}}$ ) is optimized. As a result, the averaged subthreshold swing ( $SS_{\mathrm {AVE}}$ ) gets reduced from 60 to 26 mV/dec and the on-current ( ${I} _{\mathrm {ON}}$ ) becomes ~ 2.0 times increased as compared to the conventional L-shaped TFETs.

Accordingly, several supercapacitor models have been proposed in previous researches. Nevertheless, most of them require an intensive test to obtain the model parameters. These may not be suitable for an initial simulation study, where a simple model based on the datasheet is required to evaluate the system performance before building the hardware prototype. A simplified electrical circuit model for a supercapacitor (SC) based on the voltage-current equation is proposed in this paper to address this issue. This model doesn't need an intensive test for accuracy. The structural simplicity and decent modelling accuracy make the equivalent electrical circuit model very suitable for power electronic applications and real-time energy management simulations. The parameters of the proposed model can be obtained from the datasheets value with a minimum test requirement. The experimental method to provide the parameters of the supercapacitor equivalent circuit is described. Based on the proposed method, the supercapacitor model is built in Matlab/ Simulink, and the characteristics of equivalent series resistance (ESR) measurement and cycle life are compared with datasheets. The simulation results have verified that the proposed model can be applied to simulate the behaviour of the supercapacitor in most energy and power applications for a short time of energy storage. A supercapacitor test circuit is given to test the charge and discharge of supercapacitor modules.

This paper focuses on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of high-speed motor drives, supplied by a DC source. In order to protect the nearby equipment from the EMI noise of the WBG inverter, a filter that complies with conducted EMI regulations is placed at the inverter DC input-side. However, there is no clear mandate requiring from inverters to comply with conducted EMI regulations at the AC output-side, where only the motor is placed. For this reason, there is no full consensus whether it is necessary to use an output filter, and if so, what type of output filter would be suitable, i.e., if differential-mode (DM), common-mode (CM) or both DM/CM output filter would fit best. A full sine-wave output filter (FSF) is proposed in this paper, that features both DM and CM attenuation, and capacitors connected to the DC link. Besides the several well established benefits of a FSF, such as purely sinusoidal motor currents and the protection of the motor against high dw/dt originating from the fast switching of the semiconductor devices, a FSF at the inverter output-side, also reduces the CM EMI emissions at the inverter input-side. Namely, since the inverter housing, the motor housing and the interconnecting shielded cable are all grounded, CM emissions generated at the inverter output-side are directly mapped to the inverter input-side, i.e., there is an input-to-output CM noise interrelation. A FSF reduces the output-side CM EMI emissions and thus mitigates the input-to-output CM noise mutual influence. Two types of FSF (c-FSF and d-FSF) are comparatively evaluated, in terms of volume, losses and EMI performance. The theoretical consideration are tested within the context of a high-speed 280 krpm, 1 kW motor drive, with 80 V DC supply. The experimental results validate the good performance of the proposed filter concept.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2021.00007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9399337","DC source;Electromagnetic compatibility;EMI filter;high-speed;motor drive","Inverters;Electromagnetic interference;Switches;Motor drives;Attenuation;Power harmonic filters;Frequency modulation","","19","","","","8 Apr 2021","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

However, tradeoffs in switching performance and converter efficiency when substituting GaN devices for Si and SiC counterparts are not well-defined, especially in a cascode configuration. Additional research with further detailed investigation and analysis is necessitated for medium-voltage GaN devices in power converter applications. Therefore, the aim of this research is to experimentally investigate the impact of emerging 650/900 V cascode GaN devices on bidirectional dc-dc converters that are suitable for energy storage and distributed renewable energy systems. Dynamic characteristics of Si, SiC, and cascode GaN power devices are examined through the double-pulse test (DPT) circuit at different gate resistance values, device currents, and DC bus voltages. Furthermore, the switching behavior and energy loss as well as the rate of voltage and current changes over the time are studied and analyzed at various operating conditions. A 500 W experimental converter prototype is implemented to validate the benefits of cascode GaN devices on the converter operation and performance. Comprehensive analysis of the power losses and efficiency improvements for Si-based, SiC-based, and GaN-based converters are performed and evaluated as the switching frequency, working temperature, and output power level are in-creased.

Using the idea of clustering, after clustering tasks according to spatio-temporal attributes, the clustered groups are linked into task sub-chains according to similarity. Then, based on the correlation between clusters, the child chains are connected to form a task chain. Therefore, the limitation is solved that the task chain in the bee colony algorithm can only be connected according to one dimension. When a sudden task occurs, a method of inserting a small number of tasks into the original task chain and a task chain reconstruction method are designed according to the relative relationship between the number of sudden tasks and the number of remaining tasks. Through the above improvements, the algorithm can be used to process tasks with spatio-temporal coupling and burst tasks.

Without the benefit of having observed the entire data distribution, incremental face clustering is more challenging than static dataset clustering. Conventional methods rely on the statistical information of previous clusters to improve the efficiency of incremental clustering; thus, error accumulation may occur. Therefore, this study proposes to predict the summaries of previous data directly from data distribution via supervised learning. Moreover, an efficient framework to cluster previous summaries with new data is explored. Although learning summaries from original data costs more than those from previous clusters, the entire framework consumes just a little bit more time because clustering current data and generating summaries for new data share most of the calculations. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing incremental face clustering methods, as evidenced by the improvement of average F-score from 0.644 to 0.762. Compared with state-of-the-art static face clustering methods, our method can yield comparable accuracy while consuming much less time.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312781","incremental face clustering;supervised learning;Graph Convolutional Network (GCN);optimal summary learning","Faces;Face recognition;Clustering methods;Task analysis;Clustering algorithms;Videos;Shape","","17","","","","4 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Although several studies have evaluated stress levels in controlled settings, objective stress assessment in everyday settings is still largely under-explored due to challenges arising from confounding contextual factors and limited adherence for self-reports. In this paper, we explore the objective prediction of stress levels in everyday settings based on heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) captured via low-cost and easy-to-wear photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors that are widely available on newer smart wearable devices. We present a layered system architecture for personalized stress monitoring that supports a tunable collection of data samples for labeling, and present a method for selecting informative samples from the stream of real-time data for labeling. We captured the stress levels of fourteen volunteers through self-reported questionnaires over periods of between 1-3 months, and explored binary stress detection based on HR and HRV using Machine Learning methods. We observe promising preliminary results given that the dataset is collected in the challenging environments of everyday settings. The binary stress detector is fairly accurate and can detect stressful vs non-stressful samples with a macroF1 score of up to %76. Our study lays the groundwork for more sophisticated labeling strategies that generate context-aware, personalized models that will empower health professionals to provide personalized interventions.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630224","","Wearable computers;Systems architecture;Machine learning;Photoplethysmography;Real-time systems;Labeling;Heart rate variability","Heart Rate;Humans;Machine Learning;Photoplethysmography;Self Report;Wearable Electronic Devices","17","","6","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the tracking error between the agent and the virtual leader, and the tracking errors between the agent and neighboring agents during the last iteration (for open-loop scheme) or the current running (for closed-loop scheme), each controller continuously corrects the last control law by a combination of communication weights in the topology to obtain the ideal control law. Through the rigorous analysis, sufficient conditions for both control schemes are established to ensure that all agents can achieve the asymptotically consistent output along the iteration axis within a finite-time interval.

However, UWSNs are still subject to various limitations and challenges: ocean interferences and noises are high, bandwidths are narrow, and propagation delays are high. Sensor batteries have limited energy and are difficult to be replaced or recharged. Accordingly, the design of routing protocols is one of the solutions to these problems. Aiming at reducing and balancing network energy consumption and effectively extending the life cycle of UWSNs, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Adaptive Energy-efficient Clustering Routing (HAECR) strategy. First, this strategy divides hierarchical regions based on the depth of the sensor node in a three dimensional (3D) space. Second, sensor nodes form different competition radii based on their own relevant attributes and remaining energy. Nodes in the same layer compete freely to form clusters of different sizes. Finally, the transmission path between clusters is determined according to comprehensive factors, such as link quality, and then the optimal route is planned. The simulation experiment is conducted in the monitoring range of the 3D space. The simulation results prove that the HAECR clustering strategy is superior to LEACH and UCUBB in terms of balancing and reducing energy consumption, extending the network lifetime, and increasing the number of data transmissions.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2021.0012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9622200","underwater sensor network;balanced energy consumption;clustering scheme;energy efficiency","Energy consumption;Routing;Clustering algorithms;Wireless sensor networks;Three-dimensional displays;Underwater acoustics;Monitoring","","16","","","","19 Nov 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Due to the energy constraint, the source UAV cannot blindly enlarge the transmit power, along with the complex network topology with high mobility, which makes the destination UAV unable to evade the jammer by flying at will. To maintain communication with a limited battery capacity in the UAV networks in the presence of a greedy jammer, in this paper, we propose a distributed reinforcement learning (RL) based energy-efficient framework for the UAV networks with constrained energy under jamming attacks to improve the communication quality while minimizing the total energy consumption of the network. This framework enables each relay UAV to independently select its transmit power based on historical state-related information without knowing the moving trajectory of other UAVs as well as the jammer. The location and battery level of each UAV need not be shared with other UAVs. We also propose a deep RL based anti-jamming relay approach for UAVs with portable computation equipment like Raspberry Pi to achieve higher and faster performance. We study the Nash equilibrium (NE) and the performance bounds based on the formulated power control game.

The theoretical derivation verifies that the two eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the communication network matrix and the sampling period have an important effect on achieving consensus. Then we construct and verify sufficient conditions to achieve consensus under the condition of input saturation constraints.

This method is applicable in both military and civilian fields such as penetration and rescue. The autonomous motion control problem is addressed through motion planning, action interpretation, trajectory tracking, and vehicle movement within the DRL framework. Novel DRL algorithms are presented by combining two difference-amplifying approaches with traditional DRL methods and are used for solving the motion planning problem. An improved Lyapunov guidance vector field (LGVF) method is used to handle the trajectory-tracking problem and provide guidance control commands for the UAV. In contrast to conventional motion-control approaches, the proposed methods directly map the sensorbased detections and measurements into control signals for the inner loop of the UAV, i.e., an end-to-end control. The training experiment results show that the novel DRL algorithms provide more than a 20% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. The testing experiment results demonstrate that the controller based on the novel DRL and LGVF, which is only trained once in a static environment, enables the UAV to fly autonomously in various dynamic unknown environments.

The FeFET exhibits a considerably high  ${I}_{on}$ – ${I}_{off}$  ratio exceeding 107. The IMG serves as a potential equalizer and the ferroelectric material is arranged in a more symmetrical electric field. This results in a lower subthreshold (sub- ${V}_{TH}$ ) swing ( $S.S._{min}=$  49.3mV/decade) with a wide range ( $10^{3}$ ) of drain currentcompared to that without an IMG.

Traditional fault monitoring relies on line communication, which cannot guarantee the rapidity and reliability of protection; moreover, it may even cause device damage. A fault identification scheme based on a single-terminal transient is presented in this paper. This scheme calculates the line inductance by using the rise rate of fault current at the initial stage of the fault, and determines the occurrence of the fault by comparing the observed line inductance with the set value, which lays a foundation for calculating the location of the fault point using distance protection. A simulation model on the PSCAD/EMTDC platform is built; the simulation example verifies that the proposed scheme can identify faults under dissimilar conditions while maintaining a low error level on the premise of no communication lines so as to meet the protection requirements of the MT-HVDC grid.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2021.000018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9479934","Multi-terminal high voltage DC (MT-HVDC) grid;modular multilevel converter (MMC);DC circuit breaker (DCCB);bipolar short-circuit;fault identification","Circuit faults;HVDC transmission;Power grids;Inductance;Power transmission lines;Inductors;Fault protection","","14","","","","9 Jul 2021","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

The current challenges of GNSS meteorology are real-time performance and the inclusion of emerging GNSS, such as Galileo. We demonstrate that real-time GPS-only, Galileo-only, and GPS+Galileo solutions are consistent among each other. However, our results show that the Galileo-only solutions tend to underestimate Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) with respect to GPS. The Galileo-only real-time ZTD is less accurate as the one from GPS. The combination of both GNSS leads to a superior product. The daily solution availability increases by up to 50%, and the overall gain is 0.7% over the entire year. The accuracy improves by 3.7% to 8.5% and uncertainty is reduced by a factor of 1.5–2.

Due to the complexity of mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, imperialistic competition algorithm (ICA) as a powerful evolutionary algorithm is used to solve the coordination problem of DOCRs.

Particularly, indoors, wireless propagation channels are characterized by multipath propagation, i.e., received signals comprise multipath components due to reflection and scattering. Given prior information about the surrounding environment, e.g., a floor plan, the individual propagation paths of multipath components can be derived geometrically. Inherently, these propagation paths differ spatially from the line-of-sight propagation path and can be considered as additional links in the wireless network.

The recently updated circuit topology is such that the protection of each magnet can be studied from a single magnet point-of-view. To limit the hot-spot temperature and the peak voltage-to-ground, a protection system was designed that quickly and reliably transfers voluminous parts of the coil to the normal-conducting state, hence distributing more homogeneously the magnets stored energy in the windings. This system is based on two elements: quench heaters attached to the outer layers of the magnet coils and CLIQ (Coupling-Loss Induced Quench). The performance of the protection system is investigated by simulating the electro-magnetic and thermal transients occurring after a quench with the program STEAM-LEDET, and by conducting dedicated experiments at the CERN and FNAL magnet test facilities. The effectiveness of the quench protection system is assessed at all representative operating current levels. Furthermore, the coils hot-spot temperature and peak voltage to ground are analyzed for various failure cases, conductor parameters, and parameter distribution among the four coils.

In this paper, a Long Short-Term Memory-based Property and Quantity Dependent Optimization (LSTM.PQDO) method is proposed. This method takes advantage of LSTM to automatically mine the comprehensive features of DGA domain names. It iterates the resampling proportion with the optimal solution based on a comprehensive consideration of the original number and characteristics of the samples to heuristically search for a better solution around the initial solution in the right direction; thus, dynamic optimization of the resampling proportion is realized. The experimental results show that the LSTM.PQDO method can achieve better performance compared with existing models to overcome the difficulties of unbalanced datasets; moreover, it can function as a reference for sample resampling tasks in similar scenarios.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312769","botnet;Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA);multiclass imbalance;resampling","Feature extraction;Optimization;Botnet;Deep learning;Optimization methods;Complexity theory;Clustering algorithms","","13","","","","4 Jan 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Video watermarking technology can solve the problem of copyright protection, and thus, it has been extensively researched. The robustness of the video watermarking algorithm in the bitstream domain is poor, especially the anti-recompression ability, since the watermarked video may be compressed again before transmitting. Considering this, this paper proposes a video watermarking algorithm in the bitstream domain based on moving object detection. To increase the robustness of the watermarking scheme, the moving macroblocks that belong to the moving object in each P frame can be identified via the moving object detection algorithm. Then, watermark embedding in the moving macroblocks is performed using codeword substitution to ensure the consistency of the bitstream. Moving object detection and watermark embedding are independent and are both carried out in the bitstream domain by partially decoding the bitstream; this avoids the complete decoding and reconstruction of the video, making the method to be highly efficient. The simulation results confirm that the proposed method is robust against recompression and has little impact on the video visual quality and no influence on the bit rate.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9147153","video watermarking;recompression;moving object detection","Watermarking;Object detection;Encoding;Robustness;Sun;Fans;Decoding","","13","","","","24 Jul 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel level-set-based segmentation method with an unsupervised denoising mechanism. First, a denoising filter is acquired under the unsupervised learning paradigm. Second, the denoising filter is integrated into the level-set framework to separate noise from the noisy image input.

The sensor was fabricated by splicing a segment of hollow-core silica capillary between a single mode fiber (SMF) and a hollow-core PCF. A Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity configuration is thus formed with the capillary tube as the sensing cavity, while the PCF acts as gas passage to the external environment. External pressure change would lead to the variation in the refractive index of air in the sensing cavity, resulting in a wavelength shift of the interference dips. The pressure sensitivity is measured to be around 4 nm/MPa, with a high linearity of 99.7% or above, regardless of the type of the PCFs we used as gas inlet. Among the four different PCFs, the large-mode-area (LMA) PCF shows the highest fringe contrast in the reflection spectrum. Modal analysis reveals that this is due to the high reflectivity caused by the solid core of LMA-PCF. Our experimental results also indicate that the length of the sensing cavity, as well as the offset fusion splice will influence the fringe contrast. The sensor has potential application in gas pressure sensing for advantages of high sensitivity, compact size and ease of fabrication.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3059925","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61805182); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356464","Gas pressure sensor;hollow-core photonic crystal fiber","Optical fiber sensors;Interference;Sensitivity;Pressure sensors;Silicon compounds;Reflection;Electron tubes","","13","","26","CCBY","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using ab initio approaches to investigate Si dangling bonds, known as  ${P}_{b}$  centers, within a realistic Si/a-SiO2 environment together with the more complete nonradiative multiphonon (NMP) theory, we explore why the SRH model provides an excellent approximation for interface traps but not for bulk oxide defects.

The values calculated by the system include three clinical indicators: eyelid distance, sclera distance, and palpebra superior fatigability test time. For the first two indicators, the semantic segmentation method was used to extract the pathological features of the patient's eye image and a semantic segmentation model was constructed. The patient eye image was divided into three regions: iris, sclera, and background. The indicators were calculated based on the position of the pixels in the segmentation mask. For the last indicator, a calculation method based on the Eyelid Aspect Ratio (EAR) is proposed; this method can better reflect the change of eyelid distance overtime. The system was evaluated based on the collected patient data. The results show that the segmentation model achieves a mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value of 86.05%. The paired-sample T-test was used to compare the results obtained by the system and doctors, and the p values were all greater than 0.05.

In this paper, we perform a technoeconomic analysis of SCNs comprising different HOXC architectures employing different planning policies on how the degree of spectral grooming by WXCs and spatial bypassing by SXCs in an SCN affects the total required number of spatial lanes (SLs), whose physical entity is the core in parallel single-mode fibers or a multicore fiber and the total node cost in the SCN. Toward this end, we develop a routing and SDM/WDM multilayer resource assignment (RSWA) heuristic in which spatial bypassing and spectral grooming are performed such that the required number of SLs is minimized. Using RSWA with four planning policies, i.e., express-only, express/local-hybrid (spatial-bypass-oriented), express/local-hybrid (spectral-grooming-oriented), and local-only, we compare the performance levels of a high-port-count matrix-switch-based HOXC and core selective switch (CSS) based HOXC with those of the baseline-stacked conventional WXCs as the network traffic load increases. Here, a CSS is a new type of spatial switch, which is the counterpart to a wavelength selective switch in a current WDM network. We clearly show that hierarchical spatial bypassing and spectral grooming are beneficial in terms of the required number of SLs and network-total node cost when the required number of SLs between optical nodes in an SCN is equal to or greater than roughly 10.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.403968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9296417","","Optical switches;Wavelength division multiplexing;Space division multiplexing;WDM networks;Telecommunication network management;Optical fiber networks","","12","","","","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The long-term mission profile and aging of power semiconductor devices (PSDs) and capacitors are considered in the reliability evaluation. Based on the result that the capacitor reliability dominates the system reliability, a simplified system reliability model is proposed. Besides, IGBT power loss considering the long-term mission profile is obtained, which dominates the system power loss.

The prediction equation requires two consecutive source node voltages to consider the mobility variation, and only takes hundreds of microseconds to predict  $V_{th}$  shift. It is short enough to monitor the real-time  $V_{th}$  degradation, since the prediction can be carried out during the vertical blank time.

By analyzing existing caching placement strategies, a new caching strategy is proposed, which represents the preference list of DUEs as the ratio of content popularity to cached probability. There are two distinct features in the proposed caching strategy. (1) It can cache other contents besides high popularity contents. (2) It can improve the cache hit ratio and reduce the latency compared with three caching placement strategies: Least Recently Used (LRU), Equal Probability Random Cache (EPRC), and the Most Popular Content Cache (MPC). Meanwhile, we analyze the effect of caching on the system performance in terms of different content popularity factors and cache capacity.

This paper proposes that an optimal balance between time delay and energy consumption be achieved by optimizing the transmission power and bandwidth allocation based on user quality of experience (QoE) in a multi-server intelligent edge network. Given the limited computing capability of devices involved in FEL local training, the transmission power is modeled as a quasi-convex uplink power allocation (UPA) problem, and a lower energy consumption bandwidth allocation algorithm is proposed for solution-seeking. The proposed algorithm allocates appropriate power to the device by adapting the computing power and channel state of the device, thereby reducing energy consumption. As the theoretical deduction result suggests that additional bandwidth should be allocated to those devices with weak computing capabilities and poor channel conditions to realize minimal energy consumption within the restraint time. The simulation result indicates that, the maximum gain of the proposed algorithm can be optimized by 31% compared with the baseline.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684774","Bandwidth optimization;federated edge learning;QoE;uplink power allocation","Servers;Computational modeling;Training;Wireless communication;Uplink;Energy consumption;Task analysis","","11","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Within the field of neuroscience, specifically in electrophysiological neuroimaging, researchers are starting to explore leveraging deep learning to make predictions on EEG data. Research remains open on the network architecture and the feature space that is most effective for EEG decoding. This paper compares deep learning using minimally processed EEG raw data versus deep learning using EEG spectral features using two different deep convolutional neural architectures. One of them from Putten et al. (2018) is tailored to process raw data; the other was derived from the VGG16 vision network (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015) which is designed to process EEG spectral features. We apply them to classify sex on 24-channel EEG from a large corpus of 1,574 participants. Not only do we improve on state-of-the-art classification performance for this type of classification problem, but we also show that in all cases, raw data classification leads to superior performance as compared to spectral EEG features. Interestingly we show that the neural network tailored to process EEG spectral features has increased performance when applied to raw data classification. Our approach suggests that the same convolutional networks used to process EEG spectral features yield superior performance when applied to EEG raw data.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630708","","Deep learning;Neuroimaging;Computer vision;Neuroscience;Computer architecture;Network architecture;Electrophysiology","Electroencephalography;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer","11","","8","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This sensor uses giant magnetoresistance (GMR) elements which have symmetric field response. An ac magnetic field with frequency  $f$  is applied to the GMR elements in order to modulate a small detecting magnetic field. Due to the symmetric response of the MR element, a carrier signal of the ac magnetic field is converted to  $2f$  and the detecting signal is converted to  $f$ . By using a full bridge circuit, where two pairs of GMR elements have opposite phase of the applied ac field, the  $2f$  components can be eliminated at the differential output terminal of the bridge. Since this system converts the frequency range of the detecting magnetic field to higher one, its noise level, which is dominated by the 1/ $f$  noise, can be decreased. In this study, the SRMR sensor with the antiphase ac modulation bridge was fabricated and investigated. The effect of noise reduction and carrier signal suppression were confirmed by a circuit simulation based on the fabricated GMR element. A full-bridge circuit using four dual-spin-valve GMR elements was fabricated. It was confirmed that the carrier signal ( $2f$  components) was reduced to less than the signal level ( $f$  components). An increase in the noise level was found at the frequency range near  $f$ , which may be due to slight asymmetry shown in the magnetoresistance (MR) response.","1941-0069","","10.1109/TMAG.2020.3012655","Cabinet Office (CAO), Crossministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion (SIP) Program through “An Intelligent Knowledge Processing Infrastructure, Integrating Physical, and Virtual Domains” (Funding Agency: NEDO); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151968","1/f noise;antiphase ac modulation bridge;magnetoresistance (MR) sensor;symmetric response MR (SRMR)","Magnetic fields;Bridge circuits;Frequency modulation;Noise level;Magnetic field measurement;1/f noise","","11","","26","CCBY","29 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This noise modeling is crucial to the development of the optimal sampling pattern design for a given number of sensors. We obtain a closed form expression for the whitening filter and consequently, for the Kullback-Leibler divergence at the whitening filter output, which is the detection index. The optimum sampling pattern is obtained by evaluating the detection index at Nyquist sampling rate, rank ordering the samples, and selecting the maximum values. We present some examples to illustrate the proposed procedure. We also extend our method to two-dimensional sampling. The advantage of our approach is its low computational complexity for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases and that optimality is guaranteed.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3112343","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-20-1-2820); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9537693","AR process;deflection coefficient;signal detection;KLD;sparse array","Detectors;Gaussian noise;Frequency response;Bandwidth;Measurement;Indexes;Sensors","","11","","19","CCBY","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Incremental TTS is generally subject to a trade-off between latency and synthetic speech quality. It is challenging to produce high-quality speech with a low-latency setup that does not make much use of an unobserved future sentence (hereafter, “lookahead”). To resolve this issue, we propose an incremental TTS method that uses a pseudo lookahead generated with a language model to take the future contextual information into account without increasing latency. Our method can be regarded as imitating a human's incremental reading and uses pretrained GPT2, which accounts for the large-scale linguistic knowledge, for the lookahead generation.

The results suggested that the Tco of low temperature programmed high temperature read is larger than high temperature programmed low temperature read and this difference is about 2-3mv/°C, which makes against the temperature compensation of reading voltage and lead to irreparable data errors even there is error correction codes.

Since the core saturation takes place, magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) is used to find the permeability depending on the flux density of stator yoke. Furthermore, since the core is not infinitely permeable in the subdomain analysis, the solution is obtained in the whole subdomain regions: shaft, PM, air gap, coil, and stator yoke. The results of hybrid analysis are compared with those of finite-element analysis (FEA). Very close matching results are obtained in the flux density and torque even under yoke saturation.

Multiple reflections and resonances exist in the MCK and they cannot be readily eliminated by calibration. To minimize these effects on extracting dielectric constant and loss tangent from the measured S-parameters, data filtering techniques (e.g., Savitzky-Golay filter and time-gating) can be adopted. A comparison of the measurement results using these two techniques was carried out on five common dielectric materials. Generally, the results obtained using these two filtering techniques are consistent with each other, and the Savitzky-Golay filter offers better performance in the scenario where the specimen quality is not ideal.

To save filter inductances, a neutral inductor is proposed to insert in the neutral wire. Meanwhile, a complete design methodology is put forward to design the filter inductors and the neutral inductor. With low- frequency zero-sequence currents flowing through the neutral wire, the three-phase load voltages might become unbalanced and/or distorted. To improve the voltage quality, a resonant controller, with the resonant frequency at fundamental output frequency (f0), is presented to add into the zero-sequence voltage loop for balancing load voltages; concurrently, the other resonant controller, with the resonant frequency at 3fo, is presented to insert in the zero-sequence voltage loop or neutral current loop for mitigating voltage distortion.

However, the precondition for maintaining the orthogonality among different OAM modes is perfect alignment of the transmit and receive uniform circular arrays (UCAs), which is difficult to be satisfied in practical wireless communication scenarios. Therefore, to achieve available multi-mode OAM broadband wireless communication, we first investigate the effect of oblique angles on the transmission performance of the multi-mode OAM broadband system in the non-parallel misalignment case. Then, we compare the UCA-based RF analog and baseband digital transceiver structures and corresponding beam steering schemes. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations validate that the SE of the misaligned multi-mode OAM broadband system is quite low, while analog and digital beam steering (DBS) both can significantly improve the SE of the system. However, DBS can obtain higher SE than analog beam steering especially when the bandwidth and the number of array elements are large, which validates that the baseband digital transceiver with DBS is more suitable for multi-mode OAM broadband wireless communication systems in practice.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9574619","orbital angular momentum (OAM);uniform circular array (UCA);broadband wireless communication;misalignment;beam steering","Radio frequency;Beam steering;Broadband communication;Baseband;Wireless communication;Satellite broadcasting;Interference","","10","","","","14 Oct 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Hence, we propose a novel metasurface-based holographic display to realize clearly continuous imaging within the specified position range by superimposing the meta-axilens phase. It can effectively relieve the alignment requirements of the imaging system. Firstly, the parameters and properties of all-dielectric meta-atom is analyzed. Then we compare and demonstrate two sets of metasurface-based optical elements (meta-axicon, meta-lens, and meta-axilens), made by silicon meta-atoms working at 610 nm. Furthermore, we show that the metasurface hologram with the axilens phase can form a series of the relatively clear holographic images away from the focal plane.

To date, an impedance change due to the cell growth has been considered as a solution to detect some changes in a cell’s behavior. The impedance change detection is normally measured via an impedance analyzer which is expensive and also cumbersome. Rapid and definitive diagnosis of viral infections is imperative in patient treatment process. Early detection followed by appropriate lifestyle and treatment may result to a longer, healthier life. Certain patients require continues monitoring that may require regular visits to hospitals which is not practical. Therefore, a continuous home healthcare device is needed to monitor and detect any change in a patient’s health condition. Methods & Results: In this research, a novel sensor and healthcare monitoring system is modeled, simulated, developed, and tested to detect viruses by detecting the change in the impedance due to antibodies and antigens binding. First, COMSOL simulation tool is used to develop a model to prove the concept. The model predicts increasing impedance during functionalization of electrodes with antibodies and after antigen binding steps. Second, to understand how nanoscale electrode size and spacing would affect biosensing assay (antibody-based affinity binding of a protein antigen), a model using COMSOL is developed. Third, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) based signal processing system is developed as well to be connected to analog to digital converter (ADC) to acquire the current and voltage readings of the sensors over time. This healthcare monitoring system is used to continuously monitoring a patient’s condition and reports any changes in the impedance readings which represents virus detection or at least change in the cell’s behavior. Conclusions: The proposed sensor model is simulated, tested and verified via COMSOL and the FPGA prototype is tested and it verified the COMSOL model.

This rounding is created by the isotropic etching of the SiGe layer after anisotropic etching of the SiGe/Si stack, which degrades device characteristics. The etch-time dependence of the rounding amount during isotropic SiGe etching with nitrogen trifluoride plasma indicates that rounding is mainly formed in an initial stage of SiGe etching, namely, etch time less than 15 s. Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (STEM EDX) measurement indicated that a Ge-containing layer formed on the sidewall of SiGe/Si patterns before isotropic SiGe etching. From these results, we propose a formation model of SiGe rounding below. The Ge composition in the Ge-containing layer has a gradient due to ion-assisted Ge diffusion during anisotropic etching of the SiGe/Si stack. This gradient induces rounding during isotropic SiGe etching because the etch rate of the SiGe layer decreases as the Ge composition decreases. To validate our model, the Ge-containing layer after anisotropic etching was removed by post-etch treatment and the Ge spectra on the sidewall was reduced to the detection limit of STEM EDX. As a result, the rounding amount after isotropic SiGe etching improved from 2.7 to 1.8 nm. This reduction indicates that the formation of the Ge-containing layer during anisotropic etching of the SiGe/Si stack is one of the main causes of rounding after isotropic SiGe etching.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2021.3130916","Hitachi; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627731","Etch front;GAA-FET;isotropic etch;dry etch;selective SiGe etch","Silicon germanium;Etching;Plasmas;Logic gates;Manufacturing","","9","","24","CCBY","26 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in practice, harmonics should be continuously assessed with a long duration, e.g., a day. A trade-off between accuracy and time efficiency thus exists. To address this issue, a multi-time scale modeling framework of fast-charging stations (FCSs) is proposed. In the presented framework, the DCFCs' input impedance and harmonic current emission in the ideal grid condition, that is, zero grid impedance and no background harmonic voltage, are obtained based on a converter switching model with a small timescale simulation. Since a DCFC's input impedance and harmonic current source are functions of the DCFC's load, the input impedance and harmonic emission at different loads are obtained. Thereafter, they are used in the fast-charging charging station modeling, where the DCFCs are simplified as Norton equivalent circuits. In the station level simulation, a large time step, i.e., one minute, is used because the DCFCs' operating power can be assumed as a constant over a minute. With this co-simulation, the FCSs' long-term power quality performance can be assessed time-efficiently, without losing much accuracy.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2021.000034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9675057","Power quality;harmonic modeling;charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs)","Harmonic analysis;Load modeling;Impedance;Integrated circuit modeling;Power harmonic filters;Switches;Voltage measurement","","9","","","","7 Jan 2022","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Accurate description of the protective property of GDT is critical for its practical applications. However, under the excitation of high-power microwave (HPM), how the GDT will respond and whether the GDT can still exhibit protective performance remain unclear. Herein, the response characteristics of GDT to HPM were studied in this article. With the increment of excitation voltage, the response time of GDT decreases exponentially, and eventually reaching about 10 ns. The suppression ratio to HPM energy can attain 90%. The dynamic breakdown voltage and arc-mode voltage continuously increase as the excitation voltage is increased. Specifically, the arc-mode voltage nearly exhibits a linearly increasing trend. Moreover, the response property of GDT to HPM was simulated by using a PSpice model. The simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results, indicating the model can be used for predicting the behaviors of GDT under the excitation of HPM.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3103421","80909010302; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9508955","Response characteristics;gas discharge tube;high-power microwave;PSpice simulation","Breakdown voltage;Time factors;Electric breakdown;Integrated circuit modeling;Discharges (electric);Electromagnetics;Load modeling","","9","","31","CCBY","9 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the mechanism of the thermal effect of the cable was described, and a two-dimensional axisymmetric electromagnetic-fluid-temperature multiphysics coupling model of the cable reel was established regarding the 900m cable reel as independent system. Considering the structure of the drum, the number of cable winding layers, the factors of heat conduction, heat radiation and convective heat transfer in the actual working process, the steady state analysis of the multi-physical field coupling was carried out. The sum of the losses of each part of the cable was obtained through the calculation of electromagnetic field, which was used as a heat source to calculate and analyze the temperature distribution of different layers of cable winding, as well as the temperature distribution and heat dissipation characteristics of different structures of the drum. The results show that three layers of cable winding is the best design. The lowest temperature of closed cylindrical drum is 70°C after heat dissipation, which has obvious advantages compared with the lowest temperature of 85° after heat dissipation of squirrel-cage cylindrical drum. The results provide a reliable theoretical basis for the research and development of a new type of mine cable winding truck with 900 m cable capacity.","2096-3564","","10.30941/CESTEMS.2021.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473192","Heat dissipation characteristics;mine cable winding truck;multiphysics coupling;temperature distribution","Power cables;Windings;Temperature;Conductors;Cable shielding;Mathematical model;Couplings","","9","","","","2 Jul 2021","","","CES","CES Journals"

Such knowledge is developed through empirical observations of operating conditions using wireless transceivers that measure the impulse response through channel sounding. Today, cutting-edge channel sounders rely on several bulky RF hardware components with complicated interconnections, large parasitics, and sub-GHz RF bandwidth. This brief presents a compact sliding correlation-based channel sounder baseband built on a monolithic integrated circuit (IC) using 65 nm CMOS, implemented as an evaluation board achieving a 2 GHz RF bandwidth. The IC is the world's first gigabit-per-second channel sounder baseband implemented in low-cost CMOS. The presented single-board system can be employed at both the transmit and receive baseband to study multipath characteristics and path loss.

We proposed ORD detection method with parameter separation: by introducing complex coupling strength and dimensionless parameter “intensitiy contrast ratio” pointer, the ORD is only associated with the imaginary part of the weak value while circular dichroism (CD) is only associated with the real part. By designing a suitable WVA scheme, the ORD and CD can be measured separately.

Our systematic study reveals that the inverse design of the n-type and p-type layer shall build an opposite polarization-induced field to suppress electron overflow as well as simultaneously enhance hole injection. To design this p-side down UV LED and improve the hole injection, we adopt the n-AlGaN/i-InGaN/p-AlGaN buried tunneling junction (BTJ) instead of the bottom p-layer. The tunneling probability and output power of the LED are further investigated by optimizing the composition and thickness of the InGaN layer.

In this context, the reference angle is obtained from measuring the angle between the motor terminal voltage and current vectors using a double-structure Phase Locked Loop (PLL). The tunable angle is instantaneously calculated using the per-phase motor equivalent circuit. Having the impedance angle as the only candidate for the proposed scheme inherently decouples the reference and the adaptive models. This decoupling resulted in obtaining a superior performance at low, high, and zero speeds. The simplicity of the reference and the adaptive schemes ease the analysis, design, and implementation.

The analysis of triangular defects with 3C-SiC down-falls on the films revealed that the most of the down-falls which were peeled from the hot-wall adhered to the wafers before the epitaxial growth. By increasing the wafer rotation speed to 300 rpm just after wafer loading into the reactor, the down-falls dropped towards the wafer surface were effectively eliminated, and the maintenance period of the reactor could be increased more than 4 times compared to the case of maintaining the wafer rotation speed of 50 rpm until just before epitaxial growth step. Additionally, the relationship between Si deposit formed on the gas nozzles in the gas inlet and fluctuation of thickness and doping concentration of the films suggested that Si deposit formed on the gas nozzles acts as a trap site of Si source gas. By suppression of the Si deposit using optimizing gas flow condition, no significant fluctuation of thickness and doping concentration of the films were observed and the maintenance period of the gas nozzles could be increased more than 3 times compared to the epitaxial growth using the nozzles on which Si deposit was formed.","1558-2345","","10.1109/TSM.2021.3077627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424190","4H-SiC;epitaxial growth;by-product;down-fall;repeatability;growth rate;doping concentration","Films;Epitaxial growth;Inductors;Heating systems;Substrates;Silicon;Semiconductor device measurement","","9","","17","CCBYNCND","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important building block of recommendation systems consists of what is known as the embedding layers, which exhibit a highly memory-intensive characteristics. Fundamental primitives of embedding layers are the embedding vector gathers followed by vector reductions, which exhibit low arithmetic intensity and becomes bottlenecked by the memory throughput. To address this issue, recent proposals in this research space employ a near-data processing (NDP) solution at the DRAM rank-level, achieving a significant performance speedup. We observe that prior NDP solutions based on rank-level parallelism leave significant performance left on the table, as they do not fully reap the abundant data transfer throughput inherent in DRAM datapaths. Based on the observation that the datapath of the DRAM has a hierarchical tree structure, we propose a novel, fine-grained NDP architecture for recommendation systems, which augments the DRAM datapath with an “in-DRAM” reduction unit at the DDR4/5 rank/bank-group/bank level, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.

Our method is based on a time-frequency concatenation of a Costas sequence with shifted parts of itself. It allows the user to design a low sidelobe region in the range-Doppler domain. Moreover, it approximately preserves the desirable uniform sidelobe level and thumbtack behavior of the Costas ambiguity function.

The predictions are made without any previous knowledge concerning the earthquake location and magnitude. This approach differs significantly from the standard procedure adopted by earthquake early warning systems that rely on location and magnitude information. In the previous study, we used 10 s, raw, multistation (39 stations) waveforms for the 2016 earthquake sequence in central Italy for 915 M ≥ 3.0 events (CI data set). The CI data set has a large number of spatially concentrated earthquakes and a dense network of stations. In this work, we applied the same CNN model to an area of central western Italy. In our initial application of the technique, we used a data set consisting of 266 M ≥ 3.0 earthquakes recorded by 39 stations. We found that the CNN model trained using this smaller-sized data set performed worse compared to the results presented in the previously published study. To counter the lack of data, we explored the adoption of ‘transfer learning’ (TL) methodologies using two approaches: first, by using a pre-trained model built on the CI data set and, next, by using a pre-trained model built on a different (seismological) problem that has a larger data set available for training. We show that the use of TL improves the results in terms of outliers, bias and variability of the residuals between predicted and true IM values. We also demonstrate that adding knowledge of station relative positions as an additional layer in the neural network improves the results. The improvements achieved through the experiments were demonstrated by the reduction of the number of outliers by 5 per cent, the residuals R median by 39 per cent and their standard deviation by 11 per cent.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9717186","Europe;Waveform inversion;Neural networks;fuzzy logic;Time-series analysis;Earthquake early warning;Earthquake ground motions","","","8","","","","18 Feb 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Here, we investigate the phase shift requirement of OPA for single-pixel imaging and demonstrate, for the first time, that full 2π phase shifts are not mandatory to generate a set of illumination patterns with a sufficient degree of randomness required to reconstruct the image. Using a silicon photonic OPA chip with 128 carrier-depletion-based phase shifters, we experimentally confirm this property by successfully retrieving an image under a maximum phase shift of only ∼1.5π without affecting the quality of the image. Consequently, the input voltage can be reduced significantly. Since the carrier-depletion phase shifters generally require high driving voltages, this finding paves the way to high-speed OPA-based imaging with a minimum device requirement.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3113925","Grant-in-Aid of JSPS(grant numbers:19H00757,18H03769); MbSC2030; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9543580","Optical imaging;optical phased array;photonic integrated circuits;single-pixel imaging","Imaging;Lighting;Phase shifters;Optical imaging;Voltage;Optical amplifiers;Optical fibers","","8","","44","CCBY","21 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We conduct a detailed experimental study to gain insight on the impacts of the fiber index profiles and launch conditions on the system performance of single-mode VCSELs transmitting over multimode fibers. Experimentally, our results show that a launch spot roughly matching the fiber LP01 mode field leads to very high bandwidth and robust performance, largely independent of the imperfection of the index profiles and therefore can perform well in very high data rates. For a restricted launch without mode matching, the performance highly depends on the quality of the fiber, in line with EMB. We found that the center offset tolerance is around  $2~\mu \text{m}$  for a mode matched launch.

The impact of delay constraints may lead to rejection of demands, resulting in low resource utilization of network resources. This is especially severe when dynamic traffic is considered. Therefore, intelligent resource allocation algorithms are required to use the network resources in delay constrained scenario efficiently. Moreover, these algorithms should guarantee quality of service (QoS) between different priority slices during congestion case. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of delay constraint on the performance of an online resource allocation algorithm based on an intelligent efficient squatting and kicking model (SKM), proved in other works to be the most effective up to the present time yet. SKM incorporates kicking and squatting of resources as innovative techniques enabling it to achieve 100% resource utilization and acceptance ratio for higher priority slices in scenarios where the other state of art algorithms not able to reach by far in some scenarios. Simulation results showed that incorporating delay constraints has a significant impact on the performance, resulting in up to 10% and 4% reduction in terms of average resource utilization and acceptance ratios respectively.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9541328","5G;delay;network slicing;resource allocation;SKM;quality of service","Delays;Resource management;Quality of service;Bandwidth;Routing;5G mobile communication;Substrates","","8","","","","20 Sep 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Then, the electron mobility of Ge FinFET was improved by 1.65 times compared with that of a PE etched FinFET sample. For the subthreshold swing, the defect density of the interface between the Ge and gate dielectric film was improved by NBE. Ioff average currents of NBE and PE were around 18.1 and 57.6 nA/μm, respectively. As a result, NBE reduces the off-leakage current to 1/3 times less than PE.

"Long-Range Spoof Surface Plasmons(LRSSP) on the Asymmetric Double Metal Gratings","Y. -Q. Liu; L. Li; H.

Previous studies show that SSP mode on the metal grating suffers from high dissipative losses in high THz band especially near asymptotic frequency which may limit its real applications. The issue can be addressed by utilizing long-range SSP mode (LRSSP). LRSSP is a special low-loss symmetric propagating surface wave mode along double-layer corrugated metallic waveguides. In this paper, the asymmetric double metal gratings are proposed to support LRSSP which can significantly reduce the damping losses of the other short-range SSP mode (SRSSP) on the conventional doubly-corrugated metallic surfaces, thus enabling new possibilities to utilizing this SRSSP mode within long-range manner. According to our dispersion theory and the numerical calculations, the propagation loss of LRSSP is still lower than that of SRSSP within asymmetric regime, which demonstrates good tolerance to the asymmetry of the double-layer corrugated structure. However, its long-range propagation superiority of LRSSP vanishes gradually as the degree of asymmetry is enlarged. This work provides an alternative approach to increase the propagation length of SRSSP mode on the doubly-corrugated metallic surfaces and can open up new avenues to develop some novel LRSSP-based plasmonic devices such as waveguides, filters, sensors and active powerful radiation sources induced by energy beam below optical spectrum.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3070880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395204","Spoof surface plasmons;long-range;asymmetric double metal gratings;dispersion;propagation loss;Terahertz applications","Metals;Gratings;Dispersion;Optical surface waves;Optical filters;Corrugated surfaces;Propagation losses","","8","","33","CCBY","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An efficient and accurate online risk assessment tool is very necessary to provide timely warning information for emergency dispatch of resilient distribution systems. However, conventional analytical risk assessment methods are subject to known network information, while emerging datadriven methods rarely incorporate resilient resources into the risk assessment procedures, limiting their accuracies when applied to extreme events. To solve the problems, this paper proposes an improved online data-driven risk assessment method adaptive for resilient distribution systems. Twenty-five basic operational indexes from practical experience are chosen to indirectly reflect the system risk, and the complicated relationship between the indexes and risk is characterized by entropy weights and gray correlation degrees. The proposed method is validated on a modified 33-node system, and the results show that it has better accuracy compared with similar approaches in online risk assessment during extreme events.

In a passive radar, only the RCS multiplied by a coefficient is available due to the unknown transmitting parameters. For different transmitter-receiver (bistatic) pairs, the coefficients are different. Thus, the recovered RCS in different transmitter-receiver (bistatic) pairs cannot be fused for further use. In this paper, we propose a quantity named quasi-echo-power (QEP) as well as a method for eliminating differences of this quantity among different transmitter-receiver (bistatic) pairs. The QEP is defined as the target echo power after being compensated for distance and pattern propagation factor. The proposed method estimates the station difference coefficients (SDCs) of transmitter-receiver (bistatic) pairs relative to the reference transmitter-receiver (bistatic) pair first. Then, it compensates the QEP and gets the compensated QEP. The compensated QEP possesses a linear relationship with the target RCS. Statistical analyses on the simulated and real-life QEP data show that the proposed method can effectively estimate the SDC between different stations, and the compensated QEP from different receiving stations has the same distribution characteristics for the same target.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9574642","data fusion;multistatic passive radar;radar cross section (RCS);target characteristic","Passive radar;Three-dimensional displays;Signal to noise ratio;Radar cross-sections;Antenna arrays;Systems engineering and theory;Statistical analysis","","8","","","","14 Oct 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

However, the large data volume from the PAM process is better analyzed using an automated technique such as the hidden Markovmodels (HMM). In this paper, the HMM is used as a detection and classification technique due to its robustness and low time complexity. Nonetheless, certain parameters, such as the choice of features to be extracted from the signal, the frame duration, and the number of states affect the performance of the model. Theresults show that HMM exhibits best performances as the number of states increases with short frame duration. However, increasing the number of states creates more computational complexity in the model. The inshore Bryde's whales produce short pulse calls with distinct signal features, which are observable in the time-domain. Hence, a time-domain feature vector is utilized to reduce the complexity of the HMM. Simulation results also show that average power as a time-domain feature vector provides the best performance compared to other feature vectors for detecting the short pulse call of inshore Bryde's whales based on the HMM technique. More so, the extracted features such as the average power, mean, and zero-crossing rate, are combined to form a single 3-dimensional vector (PaMZ). The PaMZ-HMM shows improved performance and reduced complexity over existing feature extraction techniques such as Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and linear predictive coding (LPC). Thus, making the PaMZ-HMM suitable for real-time detection.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2021.9340533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340533","Acoustic signal;Bryde's whales;hidden Markovmodels;passive acoustic monitoring;time-domain features","Whales;Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Time-domain analysis;Sociology;Monitoring;Detectors","","7","","54","","29 Jan 2021","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

The response surface method is first adopted to establish the optimization objective equation. Afterward, the sample points are obtained via Monte Carlo simulation considering the design-variable uncertainty. The Design for Six Sigma approach is adopted to ensure the robustness of the design model. Furthermore, the barebones multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to obtain a compromise solution.

A 16-position rotational simulation experiment proves the G-sensitive drift will affect the long-term navigation error for the rotational INS quantitatively. The vibration coupling and asymmetric structure of the DRLG are the main errors. A new dithered mechanism and optimized DRLG is designed. The validity and efficiency of the optimized design are conformed by 1 g sinusoidal vibration experiments. An optimized inertial measurement unit (IMU) is formulated and measured experimentally. Laboratory and vehicle experimental results show that the divergence speed of longitude errors can be effectively slowed down in the optimized IMU. In long term independent navigation, the position accuracy of dual-axis rotational INS is improved close to 50%, and the G-sensitive drifts of laser gyro in the optimized IMU are less than 0.000 2 °/h.

This process first requires cytogeneticists to arrange each chromosome from the metaphase image to generate the karyogram. In this process, chromosome segmentation plays an important role and it is directly related to whether the karyotyping can be achieved. The key to achieving accurate chromosome segmentation is to effectively segment the multiple touching and overlapping chromosomes at the same time identify the isolated chromosomes. This paper proposes a method named Enhanced Rotated Mask R-CNN for automatic chromosome segmentation and classification. The Enhanced Rotated Mask R-CNN method can not only accurately segment and classify the isolated chromosomes in metaphase images but also effectively alleviate the problem of inaccurate segmentation for touching and overlapping chromosomes.

This study investigated four different work function metal (WFM) stacks in the gate of fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) on the same substrate. These devices not only successfully produced distinct levels of threshold voltages (|Vt|) but also converted n- to p-type features merely by adding p-type WFM in the gate of the MOSFETs. All of the devices satisfied short-channel effects with shrinking channel length. The gate-to-body electric field induced drain leakage due to the nature of bulk FinFETs. However, the n- and p-type gate stacks presented different gate current leakage. For reliability, hot carrier injection (HCI) could have a higher reliability impact than the negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI) for p-MOSFET, although the stress voltage of HCI was roughly half that of the NBTI test.

However, the FPGA system's design is quite different from that of a traditional microprocessor or a digital signal processor (DSP). Instead of sequential programming using high-level languages, such as C/C++, FPGA controller implementation requires a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog and VHDL, which requires extensive verification and optimization during the design process. This paper proposes a systematic FPGA design methodology with optimum resource utilization for rapid prototyping of high-performance power electronics applications to facilitate the widespread adoption of FPGA technology in power electronics. The FPGA controller design is concurrent with the power stage and utilizes high-level synthesis (HLS) tools and Simulink code generation toolbox. This paper covers the detailed design, implementation, and experimental validation of two specific applications, i.e., an active power filter (APF) and a motor emulator (ME), demonstrating the generalized features of the methodology. Employing fundamentally different control structures, both application examples achieve ultra-high current control bandwidth leveraging SiC MOSFETs switching at no less than 100 kHz.","2475-742X","","10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2021.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9675071","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA);model predictive control;voltage source inverter;wide band gap device","Field programmable gate arrays;Power electronics;Rapid prototyping;Hardware;Codes;Resource management;Silicon carbide","","7","","","","7 Jan 2022","","","CPSS","CPSS Journals"

In this paper, we report feasibility demonstrations of an evolution scenario regarding the SCN architecture to enhance the flexibility and functionality of spatial channel networking from a simple fixed-core-access and directional spatial channel ring network to a multidegree, any-core-access, nondirectional, and core-contentionless mesh SCN. As key building blocks of SXCs, we introduce what we believe to be novel optical devices: a ${1} \times {2}$1×2 multicore fiber (MCF) splitter, a core selector (CS), and a core and port selector (CPS). We construct free-space optics-based prototypes of these devices using five-core MCFs. Detailed performance evaluations of the prototypes in terms of the insertion loss (IL), polarization-dependent loss (PDL), and intercore cross talk (XT) are conducted. The results show that the prototypes provide satisfactorily low levels of IL, PDL, and XT. We construct a wide variety of reconfigurable spatial add/drop multiplexers (RSADMs) and SXCs in terms of node degree, interport cross-connection architecture, and add/drop port connectivity flexibilities. Such RSADMs/SXCs include a fixed-core-access and directional RSADM using a ${1} \times {2}$1×2 MCF splitter; an any-core-access, nondirectional SXC with core-contention using a CS; and an any-core-access, nondirectional SXC without core-contention using a CPS. Bit error rate performance measurements for SDM signals that traverse the RSADMs/SXCs confirm that there is no or a very slight optical signal-to-noise-ratio penalty from back-to-back performance. We also experimentally show that the flexibilities in the add/drop port of the SXCs allow us to recover from a single or concurrent double link failure with a wide variety of options in terms of availability and cost-effectiveness.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.423997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9476073","","Optical polarization;Adaptive optics;Prototypes;Optical network units;Lenses;Multicore processing;Optical switches","","7","","","","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is a lack of research on the electro-thermally coupled modelling and evaluation of the thermal performance of HVAC systems. This paper proposes electro-thermally coupled models for the electrical machine and inverter by modelling the key electromagnetic quantities as functions of the torque and speed based on offline parameter extraction from two-dimensional electromagnetic finite element analysis. The proposed electro-thermally coupled models, which are computationally efficient, are integrated into HVAC thermofluid simulation.

In this paper, a dynamic model of the three-level (TL) boost power factor correction (PFC) converter is developed using the Brayton-Moser formulation. Then, the Brayton-Moser based control technique is designed by injecting a virtual resistor in series with the input inductor. Further, the stability analysis of the proposed controller is also carried out using energy balance approach. To improve the dynamic performance and reduce the steady state error, a PI controller is integrated with the aforesaid controller. Therefore, the controller comprises of BM-PBC and the PI controller is implemented for the TL boost PFC converter as a battery charger and its performances are investigated under various operating modes with the help of MATLAB/Simulink. Furthermore, power quality of charger is assessed by monitoring source current total harmonic distortion (THD) under different operating conditions. It is also observed that the proposed system provides THD less than 5% in source current which satisfies IEC 61000-3-2 Class C standard. The performance of the aforesaid controller is also compared with the conventional PI controller.

It uses single mode fiber (SMF), few mode fiber (FMF), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to form the SMF-air microcavity-FMF-PDMS-FMF structure. It is to slot the glass capillary tube, place the two FMFs in the slot at a suitable distance, and fill the slot with PDMS multiple times and seal it. The PDMS is used as a sensing microcavity. We insert the SMF from the other end of the glass capillary tube, adjust the distance, fix the SMF and seal the connection. Two end faces of the SMF and the first FMF form an air reference microcavity. Since the refractive index of each medium is different, multiple reflective surfaces are formed to reflect. Because the second FMF is infinitely long, whose right end is beveled, it is considered that the sensor has four reflected beams. When the temperature changes, the length and refractive index of the PDMS microcavity will change, which will cause a change in the interference spectrum of the sensor. And because the vernier effect is formed by the superposition of the two microcavities, the temperature sensitivity can be amplified and the temperature can be measured with high sensitivity. The experimental results show that in the range of 40–56°C, the transmission spectrum of the sensor appears red shift with the increase of temperature, and the temperature sensitivity can reach 3.89nm/°C.

In addition, the LO drive power required for mixing operation is reduced by bias optimization and large-signal LO matching. The balanced distributed drain mixer exhibits measured conversion gain of −4.0 to −7.4 dB from 5.4 to 21.8 GHz. The LO drive power of the mixer is as low as 2 dBm.

The power allocation problem is formulated as maximizing the time-averaged data transmission rate by optimizing pilot and data power allocation subject to the queue stability and the maximum transmit power constraints. The data transmission rate is defined in terms of the pilot transmit power, the data transmit power and the channel estimation error, which is non-concave. To solve the non-concave and stochastic optimization problem, a dynamic pilot and data power allocation (DPDPA) algorithm is proposed with the aids of approximate transformation, Lyapunov optimization and Lagrange dual formulation.

In this paper, a search-free near-field source localization method is proposed with the exact signal model. Firstly, the approximative estimates of the direction of arrival (DOA) and range are obtained by using the approximated signal model based method through parameter separation and polynomial rooting operations. Then, the approximative estimates are corrected with the exact signal model according to the exact expressions of phase difference in near-field observations.

To cope with the nonstationary characteristic of sea clutter, an easily-implemented Bayesian TBD filter with adaptive detection threshold is proposed and a new parameter estimation method is devised which is integrated into the detection process. The detection threshold is set according to the parameter estimation result under the framework of information theory.

This paper presents an effective DOA estimation approach based on a deep residual network (DRN) for the underdetermined case. We first extract an input feature from a new matrix calculated by stacking several covariance matrices corresponding to different time delays. We then provide the input feature to the trained DRN to construct the super resolution spectrum. The DRN learns the mapping relationship between the input feature and the spatial spectrum by training. The proposed approach is superior to existing model-based estimation methods in terms of calculation efficiency, independence of source sparseness and adaptive capacity to non-ideal conditions (e.g., low signal to noise ratio, short bit sequence).

When an error is detected in the data transmission process, this mechanism works to feed back the fault information to the source node in real time via fault signal lines. In the source node, the highest transmission priority is assigned to the backup retransmitted data, and the corresponding direct link is positioned to enable the data packet for its efficient retransmission to the destination node, thereby ensuring efficiency in fault tolerance. Additionally, we have improved the receiving port of the wireless router, added the corresponding redundant buffers and mux, and dynamically selected the retransmitted non-faulty data packets to be written to the local router in order to avoid the disorderly retransmission of the data packets. The evaluation results of this paper demonstrate that compared with the methods which are under different fault conditions, this fault-tolerant method drastically improves the data throughput rate, reduces the delay, effectively guarantees the reliability of the network, and improves the system performance.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9121658","wireless network-on-chip;retransmission;fault-tolerant;reliability","Wireless communication;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;System-on-chip;Routing;Circuit faults","","7","","","","19 Jun 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The SDK provides access to 3-dimensional skeleton joint positions to software developers, which significantly reduces the challenges in developing accurate motion tracking systems, especially for use at home. However, the Kinect sensor is not well-equipped to track foot orientation and its subtle movements. To overcome this issue, we augment the system with a commercial off-the-shelf Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).

The AFPMSM is usually analyzed based on the three-dimensional finite element method (3D FEM) due to its three-dimensional magnetic field distribution. However, the 3D FEM suffers large amount of calculation, time-consuming and is not suitable for the optimization of AFPMSM. Addressing this issue, a multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model of the AFPMSM is investigated in this paper, which could take the end leakage into consideration. Firstly, the multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model of the AFPMSM with single stator and single rotor is derived in details, including the equivalent processes and conversions of structure dimensions, motion conditions and electromagnetic parameters. Then, to consider the influence of end leakage on the performance, a correction factor is introduced in the multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model. Finally, the proposed multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model is verified by the 3D FEM based on an AFPMSM under different structure parameters. It demonstrates that the errors of flux linkage and average torque obtained by the multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model and 3D FEM are only around 2% although the structure parameters of the AFPMSM are varied. Besides, the computation time of one case based on the multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model is only 6 min, which is much less than that of the 3D FEM, 1.8 h, under the same conditions. Thus, the proposed multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model could be used to optimize the AFPMSM and much time could be saved by this method compared with the 3D FEM.","2096-3564","","10.30941/CESTEMS.2021.00002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9393746","Axial flux;equivalent model;end leakage;permanent magnet machine","Solid modeling;Stator windings;Finite element analysis;Torque;Rotors;Three-dimensional displays;Stator cores","","6","","","","1 Apr 2021","","","CES","CES Journals"

As a result, the Brillouin phase shift response is superimposed to further realize a flexible and adjustable measurement bandwidth. Meanwhile, thanks to the relationship between the OFC pump and the unknown signal, the frequency measurement can be achieved by the property of monotonous frequency-to-phase-slope mapping. A proof-of-concept experiment is performed to verify the feasibility of the approach.

Two factors affect computing efficiency: the number of nonzero element fillings and the length of elimination tree. This article constructs mapping correspondence between eliminated tree nodes and quotient graph nodes through graph and quotient graph theories. The Approximate Minimum Degree (AMD) of quotient graph nodes and the length of the elimination tree nodes are composed to build an Approximate Minimum Degree and Minimum Length (AMDML) model. The quotient graph node with the minimum degree, which is also the minimum length of elimination tree node, is selected as the next ordering vector. Compared with AMD ordering method and other common methods, the proposed method further reduces the length of elimination tree without increasing the number of nonzero fillings; the length was decreased by about 10% compared with the AMD method.

This mechanism satisfies the need of different containers to share the same image. However, when a single container performs operations such as modification of an image file, a duplicate is created in the upper read-write layer, which contributes to the runtime overhead. When the accessed image file is fairly large, this additional overhead becomes non-negligible. Here we present the concept of Dynamic Prefetching Strategy Optimization (DPSO), which optimizes the CoW mechanism for a Docker container on the basis of the dynamic prefetching strategy. At the beginning of the container life cycle, DPSO pre-copies up the image files that are most likely to be copied up later to eliminate the overhead caused by performing this operation during application runtime. The experimental results show that DPSO has an average prefetch accuracy of greater than 78% in complex scenarios and could effectively eliminate the overhead caused by the CoW mechanism.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9220753","Docker;container;Copy-on-Write (CoW);storage driver;prefetch strategy","Containers;Prefetching;Metadata;Cows;Runtime;Optimization;Predictive models","","6","","","","12 Oct 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Non-functional requirements are significant to describe the properties and constraints of the system. Early identification of Non-functional requirement has direct impact on the system architecture and initial design decision. Practically, non-functional requirements are extracted manually from the document. This makes it tedious, time-consuming task and prone to various errors. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to identify and classify non-functional requirements using semantic and syntactic analysis with machine learning approaches from unconstrained documents. We used A dataset of public requirements documents (PURE) that consists of 79 unconstrained requirements documents in different forms. In our approach, features were extracted from the requirement sentences using four different natural language processing methods including statistical and state-of-the-art semantic analysis presented by Google word2vec and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers models. The adopted approach can efficiently classify non-functional requirements with an accuracy between 84% and 87% using statistical vectorization method and 88% to 92% using word embedding semantic methods. Furthermore, by fusing different models trained on different features, the accuracy improves by 2.4% compared with the best individual classifier.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3052921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328431","Software requirement;Machine learning;Natural language processing","Software;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Semantics;Syntactics;Natural language processing;Support vector machines","","6","","","CCBY","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Hence, cloud coverage, high dynamics, and cloud uncertainties are important issues in the scheduling of EOSs. The proactive-reactive scheduling framework has been proven to be effective and efficient for the uncertain scheduling problem and has been extensively employed. Numerous studies have been conducted on methods for the proactive scheduling of EOSs, including expectation, chance-constrained, and robust optimization models and the relevant solution algorithms. This study focuses on the reactive scheduling of EOSs under cloud uncertainties. First, using an example, we describe the reactive scheduling problem in detail, clarifying its significance and key issues. Considering the two key objectives of observation profits and scheduling stability, we construct a multi-objective optimization mathematical model. Then, we obtain the possible disruptions of EOS scheduling during execution under cloud uncertainties, adopting an event-driven policy for the reactive scheduling. For the different disruptions, different reactive scheduling algorithms are designed. Finally, numerous simulation experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed reactive scheduling algorithms.

The transit time difference between the waves traveling in opposite directions can be used to calculate the flow rate through the pipe, by applying suitable mathematical correction factors. The approach is non-disruptive and noninvasive and can be retrospectively fit to pipes and easily relocated to different positions. When ultrasonic clamp-on transducers are attached to pipes with diameters of less than 30 mm and a wall thickness of less than a few millimeters, the resulting guided waves can appear confusing and produce very different signals to those observed on larger diameter pipes. The experimentally observed behavior of these guided waves in fluid-filled, small-diameter pipes is analyzed, modeled, and explained. Experiments are performed in copper pipes of sizes that are commonly used in buildings, and accurate measurements of water flow rates are taken down to a few milliliters per second. This technique presents new possibilities for smart metering of water supplies, where the positioning of the small clamp-on transducers is not sensitive to the variations in water temperature, and low-power electronics can be used.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3120142","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) U.K.(grant numbers:EP/R511808/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9570329","Clamp-on;transit time difference;ultrasonic flow measurement","Acoustics;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Fluid flow measurement;Transducers;Liquids;Time measurement;Metals","","6","","10","CCBY","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both assume three-phase faults for calculations since three-phase power distribution is predominant in utility and industrial applications; however, arc flash in single-phase systems is excluded. Single-phase faults to neutral or ground or single phase-to-phase faults can occur in a variety of circumstances. Such events may have the potential to produce arc flash and blast that would pose a significant safety concern. This paper describes a recent doctoral research investigation of arc flash in one single-phase configuration. Experiments were sponsored by UL and performed at the Schneider Electric High-Power Laboratory in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This facility provided a test article; a full suite of voltage, current, and temperature instrumentation; and high-speed video recording. Experimental work revealed incident energy values less than 0.2 cal/cm2 for 240-volt single-phase arc fault events though there was still significant flash and splatter of molten wire residue. 480 V single-phase events produced an order of magnitude greater heat energy, and at 22 kA sustained arcing until interrupted by the test cell controller. Results suggest that 240 V single-phase panels and equipment common in residential and light commercial applications may be at very low risk of yielding arc flash burn-related injuries. However, 480 V single-phase faults can produce levels of incident heat energy known to cause burns, flash, and blast pressure at available fault currents between 10 and 22 kA.","2644-1241","","10.1109/OJIA.2021.3069435","UL Corporate Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9388870","240 V distribution;arc flash;arc flash hazard;incident energy;single-phase","Arc discharges;Heating systems;Electrodes;Wires;Temperature measurement;Fuses;Current measurement","","6","","25","CCBYNCND","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the external humidity environment changes, the refractive index of the GO changes, and the light in the SMF is modulated by humidity. External humidity is measured by detecting the changes in the wavelength of the transmission spectrum of the sensing structure.

In addition, the linear relationship between the light intensity and the RH of the sensor at a single wavelength at 1571 nm is analyzed, and the linearity is 97.45%. According to this finding, photoelectric conversion is used to convert the light intensity signal into a voltage signal.

Most current LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems operate on the assumption that the observed environment is static. However, the overall accuracy and robustness of a SLAM system can be compromised by dynamic objects in the environment. Aiming at the problem of inaccurate odometry estimation and wrong mapping caused by the existing LiDAR SLAM method which cannot detect the dynamic objects, we study the SLAM problem of robots and unmanned vehicles equipped with LiDAR traveling in the dynamic urban scenes. We propose a fast LiDAR-only model-free dynamic objects detection method, which uses the spatial and temporal information of point cloud through a convolutional neural network (CNN), and the detection accuracy is improved by 35 use spatial information. We further integrate it into a state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM framework to improve the SLAM performance. Firstly, the range image constructed by LiDAR point cloud is used for ground extraction and non-ground point clustering. Then, the motion of objects in the scene is estimated by the difference between adjacent frames, and the segmented objects are further divided into dynamic objects and static objects by their motion features. After that, the stable feature points are extracted from the static objects. Finally, the pose transformation of adjacent frames is solved by matching feature point pairs. We evaluated the accuracy and robustness of our system on datasets with different challenging dynamic environments, and the results show our system has significant improvements in accuracy and robustness of odometry and mapping, while still maintain real-time performance, which is sufficient for autonomous robot systems and intelligent transportation applications in urban scenarios.","2687-7813","","10.1109/OJITS.2021.3109423","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671356); Science and Technology Program of Shannxi Province(grant numbers:2019ZDLGY14-02-03,2020GY-136); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9526756","SLAM;CNN;LiDAR odometry;Point cloud registration;Dynamic object detection;Range image segmentation.","Vehicle dynamics;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Aerodynamics;Laser radar;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Real-time systems","","6","","","CCBY","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the coexistence of Primary Users (PUs) and SUs may cause interference which leads to wastage of spectrum resources. This study investigates the impact of interferences between PUs and SUs. To ensure higher detection of PU signal, a cooperative rule was used to decide which SU to share and makea final decision about the availability of the spectrum band. To maximize the throughput of SU, a maximum likelihood function was designed to reduce delays in searching for the next available channel for data transmission. To discover more transmission opportunities and ensuring that a good number of free channels are detected, a parallel sensing technique was employed.

As memory capacity increases, the overheads of the row buffer conflict are increasingly worse as increasing bitline length, which results in high row activation and precharge latencies. In this work, we propose a practical approach called Row Buffer Cache (RBC) to mitigate row buffer conflict overheads efficiently. At the core of our proposed RBC architecture, the rows with good spatial locality are cached and protected, which are exempted from being interrupted by the accesses for rows with poor locality. Such an RBC architecture significantly reduces the overheads of performance and energy caused by row activation and precharge, and thus improves overall system performance and energy efficiency. We evaluate RBC architecture using SPEC CPU2006 on a DDR4 memory compared to a commodity baseline memory system. Results show that RBC improves the overall performance by up to 2.24× (16.1% on average) and reduces the memory energy by up to 68.2% (23.6% on average) for single-core simulations. For multi-core simulations, RBC increases the overall performance by up to 1.55× (17% on average) and reduces memory energy consumption by up to 35.4% (21.3% on average).","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9220760","memory system;Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM);row buffer conflict","Random access memory;Interference;System performance;Buffer storage;Memory management;Energy consumption","","6","","","","12 Oct 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper, the reliability of a k-out-of-n system is analyzed considering load-sharing effect and failure mechanism (FM) propagation. Three types of FMs are considered and an accumulative damage model is proposed to illustrate the system behavior of the k-out-of-n system and the coupling effect between load-sharing effect and FM propagation effect. A combinational algorithm based on Binary decision diagram (BDD) and Monte-Carlo simulation is presented to evaluate the complex system behavior and reliability of the k-out-of-n system. A current stabilizing system that consists of a 3-out-of-6 subsystem with FM propagation effect is presented as a case to illustrate the complex behavior and to verify the applicability of the proposed method. Due to the coupling effect change, the main mechanism and failure mode will be changed, and the system lifetime is shortened. Reasons are analyzed and results show that different sensitivity factors of three different FMs lead to the change of the development rate, thus changing the failure scenario. Neglecting the coupling effect may lead to an incomplete and ineffective measuring and monitoring plan. Design strategies must be adopted to make the FM propagation insensitive to load-sharing effect.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612143","k-out-of-n system;load-sharing effect;failure mechanism propagation;damage factor model;combinational algorithm","Frequency modulation;Load modeling;Reliability;Couplings;Complex systems;Sensitivity;Monte Carlo methods","","6","","","","11 Nov 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The magnetic fields with 3 ms width were applied at the point 3 ms before current through zero. Comparing with no axial magnetic field, the voltage distribution unbalances deceased both in synchronous and asynchronous opening processes. Under the condition that the arcing time of high-voltage break remained at 6.6 ms and the magnitude of axial magnetic fields was 60 mT, voltage distributions of high-voltage break were approximately proportional to the arcing times of the low-voltage break from 3.4 ms to 6.6 ms.

These requirements can be met by sophisticated integrated circuits developed in CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology. Embedding such fabricated dice into flexible polymeric substrates greatly enhances the adaption to the mechanical environment in the body. With the process developed here, 100 % of individual dice (n = 34, 390 x 390 μm2) could be transferred simultaneously into polyimide (PI) substrates with simple and exact positioning (0.2° rotational and 5 μm translational error). Levelled layer build-up and standard microfabrication technologies could be used for CMOS-post-processing in order to manufacture metal interconnections between contact pads of 100 μm thin dice and PI insulation as selectively patterned device substrate. The process allows for individual positioning according to desired shape of the final chip-in-foil-system and for upscaling the number of dice to be transferred. Furthermore, final distribution and embedding of dice on the flexible substrate is independent from their distribution on the CMOS fabrication wafer the and does not require additional adhesion promoters. During fabrication the transfer method is insensitive to high temperatures (450 °C in this study) and hence enables a wide range of post-processes. Shear strength between dice and PI substrate was characterized by shear tests and results (58.1 ± 13.7 MPa) are in the range achieved with the adhesive benzocyclobutene (BCB).","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630832","","Temperature distribution;Shape;Microfabrication;Metals;Integrated circuit interconnections;Polyimides;Silicon","Metals;Oxides;Polymers;Semiconductors;Silicon","6","","21","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contrast trials are carried out on four time series data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that with the number of integration increasing, the performance of three types of EGB-RNN models tend to converge and the best EGB-RNN model and the best degree of ensemble vary with data sets.

XB-SIM* can be flexibly configured to simulate the accelerator's structure and clock-driven behaviors at the architecture level. This framework also includes an ReRAM-aware Neural Network (NN) training algorithm and a CNN-oriented mapper to train an NN and map it onto the simulated design efficiently. Behavior of the simulator has been verified by the corresponding circuit simulation of a real chip. Furthermore, a batch processing mode of the massive calculations that are required to mimic the behavior of ReRAM-crossbar circuits is proposed to fully apply the computational concurrency of the mapping strategy. On CPU/GPGPU, this batch processing mode can improve the simulation speed by up to 5.02× or 34.29×. Within this framework, comprehensive architectural exploration and end-to-end evaluation have been achieved, which provide some insights for systemic optimization.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9220758","deep neural network;Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM);simulation;accelerator;processing in memory","Computational modeling;Artificial neural networks;RNA;Computer architecture;Training;Hardware","","6","","","","12 Oct 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

This letter thus analyzes the GMI of BICM systems using 8-ary quadrature-amplitude-modulations (QAM) in the presence of both RPN and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). We will use the maximum-likelihood receiver derived in our earlier work to calculate the GMI of Star-8QAM, Circular-8QAM, Rect-8QAM and 8PSK. The explicit symbol and bit log-likelihood ratios are specifically expressed in amplitude-phase form with RPN considered. Numerical results are given in details to show the GMI comparison in phase noise and the GMI loss compared to the pure AWGN case. It is shown that Star-8QAM is much more tolerant to large RPN. Moreover, the ratio parameters of Rect-8QAM and Star-8QAM are optimized to maximize the GMI as the RPN variance increases.

Hence, there arises a need for signal reconstruction methods that exploit multiple trains of samples. If the starting times of the trains are known, then stroboscopic techniques can be used for signal reconstruction. If these times are not given, i.e., in the case of asynchronous trains of samples, it is still possible to profit from multiple trains provided that the starting times are uniformly random when considered modulo the period of the signal. For such a scenario, it is known that an infinite set of sample trains allows for reconstruction of the signal up to a time shift provided that the sampling period is small enough and that the derivative of the signal satisfies some regularity conditions. In this paper, we generalize that discovery by showing that the regularity conditions concerning the derivative of the signal can be dropped. The reconstruction of the signal is still possible even if the derivative of the signal does not exist. We also show how to estimate the signal from a finite set of asynchronous trains of samples. Eventually, we prove that the proposed signal estimator is consistent.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2021.3051847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9324972","Nonuniform sampling;period estimation;quantile function;signal estimation;signal sampling","Random variables;Signal reconstruction;Signal processing algorithms;Sensors;Probabilistic logic;Shape;Nonuniform sampling","","6","","21","CCBY","14 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The end of the emitting fiber is made into a spherical tip for focusing the Gaussian beam to improve sensitivity. When the accelerometer is in operation, the emitting fiber acts as a cantilever beam, the acceleration can be measured by detecting the transmission power. Further, our experimental results show that the spherical fiber tip can improve the acceleration sensitivity by 67% over 10 Hz–1000 Hz without reducing the working bandwidth. In addition, it is found that the fiber accelerometer has a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to 60 dB, and a low harmonic distortion of better than -30 dB, rendering a quasi-8-shaped directionality at the working frequency ranging from 10 Hz to 1200 Hz.

It has seen promise in identifying security vulnerabilities resulting from design flaws, timing channels, and hardware Trojans for secure hardware design. However, existing IFT methods tend to take a qualitative approach and only enforce binary security properties, requiring strict non-interference for the properties to hold while real systems usually allow a small amount of information flows to enable desirable interactions. Consequently, existing methods are inadequate for reasoning about quantitative security properties or measuring the security of a design in order to assess the severity of a security vulnerability. In this work, we propose two multi-flow solutions - multiple verifications for replicating existing IFT model and multi-flow IFT method. The proposed multi-flow IFT method provides more insight into simultaneous information flow behaviors and allows for proof of quantitative information flow security properties, such as diffusion, randomization, and boundaries on the amount of simultaneous information flows. Experimental results show that our method can be used to prove a new type of information flow security property with verification performance benefits.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9121656","hardware security;Information Flow Tracking (IFT);multi-flow IFT;security property","Security;Hardware;Timing;Tools;Data models;Lattices;Logic gates","","6","","","","19 Jun 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

This includes low latency applications, scalable machine-to-machine communication, and enhanced mobile broadband connectivity. In order to satisfy these requirements, the concept of network slicing has been introduced to generate slices of the network with specific characteristics. In order to meet the requirements of network slices, routers and switches must be effectively configured to provide priority queue provisioning, resource contention management and adaptation. Configuring routers from vendors, such as Ericsson, Cisco, and Juniper, have traditionally been an expert-driven process with static rules for individual flows, which are prone to sub optimal configurations with varying traffic conditions. In this paper, we model the internal ingress and egress queues within routers via a queuing model. The effects of changing queue configuration with respect to priority, weights, flow limits, and packet drops are studied in detail. This is used to train a model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to generate optimal policies for flow prioritization, fairness, and congestion control. The efficacy of the RL policy output is demonstrated over scenarios involving ingress queue traffic policing, egress queue traffic shaping, and one-hop router coordinated traffic conditioning. This is evaluated over a real application use case, wherein a statically configured router proved sub optimal toward desired QoS requirements. Such automated configuration of routers and switches will be critical for multiple 5G deployments with varying flow requirements and traffic patterns.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2021.0016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9622201","router port queues;model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL);network slicing","Routing;Quality of service;Routing protocols;Hidden Markov models;Ports (computers);Queueing analysis;Diffserv networks","","6","","","","19 Nov 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The central frequencies of two passbands of the MPF in 20 GHz range have been tuned linearly from 7.67 GHz to 9.04 GHz, and 15.34 GHz to 18.03 GHz, respectively by changing the frequency of the driving microwave signal onto the I/Q modulator from 20 GHz to 17 GHz. When the frequency of the driving microwave signal is decreased, OFC with smaller tone spacing is generated, and then the MPF's passbands move to higher frequency. So that, the proposed MPF's passbands with high frequencies can be achieved by applying driving microwave signal with low frequency to generate the OFC. By varying the bandwidth of the CFBG, the number of comb lines can be changed, which results in different bandwidth of the MPF's passband. Furthermore, in our experiment by carefully adjusting bias voltage of the Mach-Zenhder modulator, when the frequencies of driving microwave signal onto the I/Q modulator is 20 GHz and 18 GHz, one passband in the 20 GHz range can be suppressed at the frequency of 15.34 GHz, and 8.52 GHz, respectively.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3069104","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61975167); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9387540","I/Q modulator;microwave photonics filters;optical frequency comb;chirped fiber Bragg grating","Frequency modulation;Microwave filters;Bandwidth;Modulation;Passband;Microwave photonics;Radio frequency","","5","","27","CCBYNCND","26 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reducing the detection threshold can generate a large number of false alarms while increasing the detection rate, and how to suppress a large number of false alarms is the key to improve the performance of weak target detection. Then, the detection result of the low threshold is operated to construct the target matrix suitable for the size of fully convolutional networks and the convolution operator form. Finally, the M-FCN architecture is designed to learn the different accumulation characteristics of the target and the sea clutter between different frames. For improving the detection performance, the historical multi-frame information is memorized by the network, and the end-to-end structure is established to detect sea-surface weak target automatically.

Neuroimaging techniques can be used to map the functioning of the cortex to capture brain activation patterns. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging technique increasingly used for task classification based on brain activation patterns. fNIRS can be widely used in population studies due to the technology’s economic,non-invasive, and portable nature. The multidimensional and complex nature of fNIRS data makes it ideal for deep learning algorithms for classification. Most deep learning algorithms need a large amount of data to be appropriately trained. Generative networks can be used in such cases where a substantial amount of data is required. Still, the collection is complex due to various constraints. Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) can generate artificial samples of a specific category to improve the deep learning classifier’s accuracy when the sample size is insufficient. The proposed system uses an LSTM based CGAN with an LSTM classifier to enhance the accuracy through data augmentation. The system can determine whether the subject’s task is a Left Finger Tap, Right Finger Tap, or Foot Tap based on the fNIRS data patterns. The authors obtained a task classification accuracy of 90.2% for the LSTM based GAN combination.Clinical relevance— Acquiring medical data present practical difficulties due to time, money, labor, and economic cost. The deep learning-based model can better perform medical image classification than hand-crafted features when dealing with many data. GAN-based networks can be valuable in the medical field where collecting extensive data is not feasible. GAN-generated synthetic data can be used to improve the classification accuracy of classification systems.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630000","","Deep learning;Neuroimaging;Measurement;Training data;Generative adversarial networks;Data models;Classification algorithms","Algorithms;Fingers;Hand","5","","9","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates different sensor attachment methods for acoustic emission monitoring of the knee, which could lead to reduced motion and skin movement artefacts and improve the quality of sensory data sets. As a proof-of-concept study, several methods were tested over a range of exercises to evaluate noise resistance and signal quality. The signals least affected by motion artefacts were recorded when using high-density ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) foam holders, attached to the skin with double-sided biocompatible adhesive tape. Securing and isolating the connecting cable with foam is also recommended to avoid noise due to the cable movement.Clinical Relevance— The results of this study will be useful in joint AE monitoring, as well as in other methods of body sound recording that involve the mounting of relatively heavy sensors, such as phonocardiography and respiratory monitoring.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629954","Science Foundation Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629954","acoustic emission;on-body sensor monitoring;motion artifacts;sensor attachment;joint sounds","Adhesives;Acoustic emission;Skin;Biology;Sensors;Frequency measurement;Biosensors","Acoustics;Artifacts;Humans;Knee Joint;Motion;Sound Recordings","5","","15","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hoffstein, J.Pipher and J.H. Silverman in 1996, whose security is related to the hardness of finding sufficient short vectors in NTRU lattice with dimension  $2N$ . Many researchers conjecture that the private key vector is indeed the shortest vector in the lattice in most cases. However, no formal proof has been provided in the literature before to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we revisit the lattice attack on NTRU and present a new dimension reduction attack on NTRU without considering the pattern of private polynomials. More precisely, we show that one can recover a group of equivalent private keys by solving shortest vector problem in a new dimension-reduced lattice with dimension  $N+k, k < N$ , where  $k$  is related to the specific parameters selected. As a corollary of our attack, we prove that the private key vector and its rotations are the shortest vectors of the original NTRU lattice with an overwhelming probability, which confirms the conjecture of the length of the shortest vector of the original NTRU lattice.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3076598","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2021RC29); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702153,61972050); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9418990","Dimension reduction;key-recovery attack;lattice attack;NTRU;short vector","Lattices;Cryptography;Security;Heuristic algorithms;Dimensionality reduction;Standards;Prediction algorithms","","5","","21","CCBY","29 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the device is theoretically a great way to protect grids, the inherent inhomogeneity of critical current along the superconductor length can lead to localized heating, called hotspots, and ultimately destruction of the SFCL device. At EPFL under the European Union project Fastgrid, an extremely efficient Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based optical fiber sensing technique has been developed and patented that can detect even singular hotspots within 15 ms to protect SFCLs. The MZI response is characterized by a strain sensitive as well as a temperature sensitive contribution. This paper outlines an investigation by means of FEM modeling into the response sensitivity. A 2-D thermal model of the superconducting tape and optical fiber was made to study thermal transfer to the optical fiber from the REBCO tape. The simulation results showed that temperature rise observed in the optical fiber is slower than the MZI response time, proving a strain sensitive response in the experiment measurements. Sound mechanical coupling between the optical fiber and the superconductor tape can enhance strain transfer to the optical fiber and hence reduce hotspot detection time. With this improved performance, the health monitoring for SFCLs can be much more efficient and reliable.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2021.3061346","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:721019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9361319","HTS;SFCL;hotpot detection;quench detection;optical fiber sensing;Mach-Zehnder interferometer","Superconducting magnets;Strain;Temperature sensors;Superconducting transmission lines;Superconducting films;Optical fibers;HVDC transmission","","5","","17","CCBYNCND","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Skin deformation reflects the activities of body tissues that are related to motion ability. We measured skin deformations on the upper arm in active and passive movements during elbow flexion and extension and extracted features from these deformations. For practical rehabilitation applications, we developed a novel flexible distance sensor array to reduce the time needed for attaching sensors to patients. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the skin deformation could be decomposed into joint movements and activeness of movements as the first two components (PC1 and PC2). The joint angle and PC1 exhibited a high correlation, and the standard deviation (SD) of PC2 indicated a significant difference in the types of movements.

In handwriting assessment, Archimedes spiral drawing is one of the most proposed tasks, due to its peculiar shape and ease of execution. In the last decades, digitizing tablets had been widely employed for the evaluation of the spiral performance, providing a cheap and non-invasive way to gather quantitative information, to be combined with the classical clinical examination. Despite this advantage, such approach cannot easily be adopted in an unsupervised scenario and lacks the natural feel of the traditional pen-and-paper approach. This work aims at overcoming these limitations by employing a smart ink pen, designed to write on paper and instrumented with inertial and force sensors, to automatically collect data related to spiral drawing execution of PD patients (n=30) and age-matched healthy controls (n=30). From the raw data, several time and frequency domains features were extracted and compared between the groups. The statistical analysis revealed some significant differences, showing less smooth acceleration and force profiles for PD patients. However, given the heterogeneous symptoms presented by the PD cohort, a detailed analysis of exemplifying PD patients was conducted, showing the ability of Archimedes spiral drawing to capture and quantify PD characteristic features.Clinical Relevance— Among the first clinical manifestations of the pathology, handwriting impairment appears in PD patients. It is often underestimated and not investigated properly. This easy-to-use tool could be very useful as a large-scale screening, but also for treatment efficacy evaluation and for the identification of PD subgroups.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629681","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629681","","Spirals;Statistical analysis;Shape;Sociology;Ink;Tools;Feature extraction","Acceleration;Handwriting;Humans;Ink;Parkinson Disease;Physical Examination","5","","18","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, a highly reliable VNE algorithm based on the transmission rate for ATN virtualization (TR-ATVNE) is proposed to adapt well to the specific electromagnetic environment of ATN. Our algorithm coordinates node and link mapping. In the node mapping, transmission-rate resource is firstly defined to effectively evaluate the ranking value of substrate nodes under the interference of both environmental noises and enemy attacks. Meanwhile, a feasible splitting rule is proposed for path splitting in the link mapping, considering the interference between wireless links.

The proposed model is applied to compute the response of a resonant tunneling diode from 10 GHz up to 5 THz. We show that tunneling electron devices are intrinsically nonlinear at such high frequencies, even under small-signal conditions, due to memory effects related to the displacement current.

"Quality-Oriented Statistical Process Control Utilizing Bayesian Modeling","K. Date; Y.

Statistical process control (SPC) is known as a powerful method for accomplishing process stability and reducing variability. In this paper, we adopt the quality-oriented statistical process control (QOSPC) method. In QOSPC, product quality test data, such as electrical performance and product reliability, are incorporated into the process control procedure. QOSPC has two major challenges: extracting process variables that affect product quality, and determining quality control limits (QCLs) for each variable. In this work, we fully exploit a Bayesian approach to resolve both of these challenges simultaneously. We introduced a linear bathtub model that contains parameters corresponding to QCLs as obvious change points and fit the model to the observed data by Bayesian inference (BI).

This method modifies the traditional beam forming algorithm by calculating and fusing the beam forming results at multi-frequency band and multi-azimuth interval, showing an excellent way to extract the line spectrum when the interference and the target are not in the same azimuth interval simultaneously. Statistical efficiency of the estimated azimuth variance and corresponding power of the line spectrum band depends on the line spectra ratio (LSR) of the line spectrum. The change laws of the output signal to noise ratio (SNR) with the LSR, the input SNR, the integration time and the filtering bandwidth of different algorithms bring the selection principle of the critical LSR. As the basis, the detection gain of wideband energy integration and the narrowband line spectrum algorithm are theoretically analyzed. The simulation detection gain demonstrates a good match with the theoretical model. The application conditions of all methods are verified by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and experimental data from Qiandao Lake. In fact, combining the two methods for target detection reduces the missed detection rate. The proposed post-processing method in 2-dimension with the Kalman filter in the time dimension and the background equalization algorithm in the azimuth dimension makes use of the strong correlation between adjacent frames, could further remove background fluctuation and improve the display effect.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679708","towed linear array sonar;target radiated noise spectrum;line spectra level ratio (LSR);receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve;post-processing","Azimuth;Signal to noise ratio;Feature extraction;Wideband;Receivers;Modeling;Interference","","5","","","","12 Jan 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The demands placed on the resource allocation are diverse. These factors could lead to load imbalances, which affect scheduling efficiency and resource utilization. A scheduling method called Dynamic Resource Allocation for Load Balancing (DRALB) is proposed. The proposed solution constitutes two steps: First, the load manager analyzes the resource requirements such as CPU, Memory, Energy and Bandwidth usage and allocates an appropriate number of VMs for each application. Second, the resource information is collected and updated where resources are sorted into four queues according to the loads of resources i.e. CPU intensive, Memory intensive, Energy intensive and Bandwidth intensive. We demonstarate that SLA-aware scheduling not only facilitates the cloud consumers by resources availability and improves throughput, response time etc. but also maximizes the cloud profits with less resource utilization and SLA (Service Level Agreement) violation penalties. This method is based on diversity of client's applications and searching the optimal resources for the particular deployment. Experiments were carried out based on following parameters i.e. average response time; resource utilization, SLA violation rate and load balancing. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can reduce the wastage of resources and reduces the traffic upto 44.89% and 58.49% in the network.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2083","DeitY; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10246901","Cloud computing;resource configuration;dynamic allocation;optimization","Performance evaluation;Data centers;Bandwidth;Dynamic scheduling;Load management;Throughput;Resource management","","5","","12","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

From the perspective of experimental safety and feasibility, Molecular Dynamics (MD) in the materials field is an ideal method for simulating the radiation damage of structural materials. The Crystal-MD represents a massive parallel MD simulation software based on the key material characteristics of reactors. Compared with the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) and ITAP Molecular Dynamics (IMD) software, the Crystal-MD reduces the memory required for software operation to a certain extent, but it is very time-consuming. Moreover, the calculation results of the Crystal-MD have large deviations, and there are also some problems, such as memory limitation and frequent communication during its migration and optimization.

We propose polarized intensity rotational frequency shift keying (PIR-FSK) as a novel modulation technique in change of SOP and RSOP-tolerant optical transmissions. The proposed PIR-FSK signal does not affect the entire intensity of the optical carrier by modulating the sinusoidal signals on each X and Y-polarized optical carrier. Therefore, the proposed PIR-FSK modulation and optical carrier intensity modulation can operate at the same time. Moreover, since the proposed technique does not modulate the signal using the SOP unlike the PolSK, PIR-FSK is not affected by SOP changes that occur during transmission, and the signal does not be degraded even with RSOP. We demonstrated that the signals modulated using the proposed PIR-FSK modulation have higher signal capacity and efficiency compared to the signal modulated using PolSK modulation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106904","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean Government, Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019R1A2C3007934); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521211","Frequency shift keying;multi-dimensional optical transmission;polarization shift keying;rotation of state of polarization (RSOP)","Optical polarization;Optical modulation;Optical distortion;Optical receivers;Modulation;Frequency shift keying;Optical transmitters","","5","","18","CCBYNCND","24 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For non-linear and/or time invariant systems the superposition of continuous wave signals of multiple frequencies might not be equal to an impulsive current, which is representative for the actual measured signals, and is therefore of interest. In this letter the electrical response of current transducers is determined using impulsive signals, and compared to continuous wave tests. Time domain parameters such as rise time and peak amplitude are extracted, and the frequency response is analyzed using a Fourier transform. The experiments show that the impulsive test is in agreement with the continuous wave method and provides a good alternative method.

Specifically, the proposed method consists of a signal preprocessing based on the proposed angle estimation with degree of polarization (DoP), and a filtering criterion based on the proposed linear constraint. The signal preprocessing provides the accurate estimated parameters of the interference, which contributes to the criterion for null-decoupling in the space-polarization domain of mainlobe.

The clutter ridges can be effectively compensated by the space-time separation interpolation (STS-INT) method, which costs less computation than the space-time interpolation (STINT) method, but the performance of interpolation algorithms is seriously affected by the short-range clutter, especially near the platform height. Location distributions of CFA are free, which yields serious impact that range spaces of steering vector matrices are non-orthogonal complement and even no longer disjoint. Further, a new method is proposed that the short-range clutter is pre-processed by oblique projection with the intersected range spaces (OPIRS), and then clutter data after being pre-processed are compensated to the desired range bin through the STSINT method. The OPIRS also has good compatibility and can be used in combination with many existing methods. At the same time, oblique projectors of OPIRS can be obtained in advance, so the proposed method has almost the same computational load as the traditional compensation method. In addition, the proposed method can perform well when the channel error exists.

Evaluation of the degree of the stenosis and status of posterior and anterior communicating arteries to supply enough blood flow to the distal arteries is very critical, which requires accurate evaluation of arteries. Recently, deep-learning methods have been firmly established as a robust tool in medical image segmentation, which has been resulted in developing multiple customized algorithms. For instance, BRAVE-NET, a context-based successor of U-Net—has shown promising results in MRA cerebrovascular segmentation. Another widely used context-based 3D CNN—DeepMedic—has been shown to outperform U-Net in cerebrovascular segmentation of 3D digital subtraction angiography. In this study, we aim to train and compare the two state-of-the-art deep-learning networks, BRAVE-NET and DeepMedic, for automated and reliable brain vessel segmentation from TOF-MRA images in ICAD patients. Using specially labeled data—labeled on TOF MRA and corrected on high-resolution black-blood MRI, of 51 patients with ICAD due to severe stenosis, we trained and tested both models. On an independent test dataset of 11 cases, DeepMedic slightly outperformed BRAVE-NET in terms of DSC (0.905±0.012 vs 0.893±0.015, p: 0.539) and 95HD (0.754±0.223 vs 1.768±0.609, p: 0.134), and significantly outperformed BRAVE-NET in terms of Recall (0.940±0.023 vs 0.855±0.030, p: 0.036). Qualitative assessment confirmed the superiority of DeepMedic in capturing the small and distal arteries. While BRAVE-NET consistently reported higher precision, DeepMedic generally overpredicted and could better visualize the smaller and distal arteries. In future studies, ensemble models that can leverage best of both should be developed and tested on larger datasets.Clinical Relevance— This study helps elevate the state-of-the-art for brain vessel segmentation from non-invasive MRA, which could accelerate the translation of vessel status-based biomarkers into the clinical setting.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630626","","Image segmentation;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Magnetic resonance imaging;Angiography;Atherosclerosis;Tools","Angiography, Digital Subtraction;Arteries;Humans;Intracranial Arteriosclerosis;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging","5","","13","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, conventional PMFSMs uses excessive rare earth PM volumes which ultimately increases machine the machine weight and PM cost. Moreover, the PMs extended at the stator yoke results in stator leakage flux which degrades the performance. To suppress the leakage flux and diminish the PM volume, the consequent pole PMFSM (CPPMFSM) with flux bridges and barriers encompassing partitioned circumferential and radial magnetized PMs is proposed, thereby ensuring an alternate magnetic path for the working harmonics which improves the modulation effect and flux distribution. Moreover, the influence of the rotor pole number on seven different rotor structures namely, curved rotor, trapezoidal rotor, wide rotor tooth tip, wide rotor base width, rectangular segmented and eccentric rotors are investigated based on the electromagnetic performance and stress distribution. Finite element analysis (FEA) reveals that the 12S-13P CPPMFSM with a wider rotor base offers comparatively better electromagnetic performance. Compare to the conventional PMFSM, the proposed CPPMFSM reduces the PM volume which minimizes the overall machine cost and weight, suppresses the torque ripples by 16.49%, diminishes total harmonic distortion (THD) by 35.24% and decreases cogging torque by 32.88%.

Recognizing motor intention is crucial for realizing BCI rehabilitation training. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) is a kind of electroencephalogram (EEG) inherent characteristics associated with motor intention. However, due to brain deficits poststroke, some patients are not able to generate ERD, which discourages them to be involved in BCI rehabilitation training. To boost ERD during motor imagery (MI), this paper investigates the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on BCI classification performance. Eleven subjects participated in this study. The experiment consisted of two conditions: rTMS + MI versus sham rTMS + MI, which were arranged on different days. MI tests with 64-channel EEG recording were arranged immediately before and after rTMS and sham rTMS. Time-frequency analysis were utilized to measure ERD changes. Common spatial pattern was used to extract features and linear discriminant analysis was used to calculate offline classification accuracies. Paired-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank tests with post-hoc analysis were used to compare performance before and after stimulation. Statistically stronger ERD (-13.93±12.99%) was found after real rTMS compared with ERD (-5.71±21.25%) before real rTMS (p<0.05). Classification accuracy after real rTMS (70.71±10.32%) tended to be higher than that before real rTMS (66.50±8.48%) (p<0.1). However, no statistical differences were found after sham stimulation. This research provides an effective method in improving BCI performance by utilizing neural modulation.Clinical Relevance— This study offers a promising treatment for patients who cannot be recruited in BCI rehabilitation training due to poor BCI classification performance.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630102","National Natural Science Foundation of China; China Association for Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630102","","Training;Time-frequency analysis;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;Modulation;Feature extraction;Particle measurements;Electroencephalography","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagery, Psychotherapy;Imagination;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","4","","21","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A commonly known method of improving HTRB is by increasing phosphorus concentration in the PMD layer to enhance device gettering capability against H+. However, this is usually achieved at the expense of THB reliability as excessive phosphorus on the PMD surface gives rise to moisture accumulation and caused THB failure. In this paper, we performed a series of experiments to uncover two elements in PMD that are responsible to getter H+, which are Phosphorus-Oxygen-Hole-Center (POHC) and dangling bonds. We also discussed 2 possible ways to boost these H+ gettering elements to improve HTRB reliability without the adverse impact on THB reliability: Utilization of Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) Phospho-Tetraethyl-Orthosilicate (PTEOS) in PMD layer to replace the commonly used Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (APCVD) or Sub Atmospheric Chemical Vapor Deposition (SACVD) Boro-Phospho-Tetraethyl-Orthosilicate (BPTEOS) and the introduction of Tetraethyl-Orthosilicate (TEOS) capping layer on PMD layer.

Using two optical paths with different incident angles of laser beams, the CCD sensors capture the spot signal for image processing binarization and data sampling. After the obtained laser spots' spacing is substituted into the equations, the thicknesses and refractive indexes of the multilayered samples can be calculated and measured.

This method is based on an isolated scatterer model assumption, thus the scatterers in the beam can be extracted individually. The radial range of each scatterer is estimated by the maximal likelihood estimation. Then, the horizontal and vertical wave path difference is derived by using the phase comparison technology for each scatterer, respectively. Finally, by utilizing the relationship among the 3D coordinates, the radial range, the horizontal and vertical wave path difference, the 3D image of the target can be reconstructed. The reconstructed image is free from the limitation in InISAR that the image plane depends on the target's own motions and on its relative position with respect to the radar. Furthermore, a phase ambiguity resolution method is adopted to ensure the success of the 3D imaging when phase ambiguity occurs. It can be noted that the proposed phase ambiguity resolution method only uses one antenna pair and does not require a priori knowledge, whereas the existing phase ambiguity methods may require two or more antenna pairs or a priori knowledge for phase unwarping. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the theoretical analyses on estimation accuracy are presented and the simulations in various scenarios are also carried out.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9369152","cross-correlation operation;phase ambiguity resolution;wave path difference estimation;monopulse three-dimensional (3D) imaging","Three-dimensional displays;Radar imaging;Imaging;Radar antennas;Radar;Image resolution;Estimation","","4","","","","3 Mar 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

NR-U has a listen-before-talk (LBT) operation similar to the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) operation of Wi-Fi. It allows nodes to transmit only after LBT success. NR-U suffers from the collision issue because its channel access mechanism is similar to that of Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi solves the collision problem through the request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) mechanism. However, NR-U has no way of solving the collision problem. As a result, NR-U suffers severe performance degradation due to collisions as the number of contending nodes increases. In this paper, we propose to use an extended and split reservation signal (RS) for reservation in NR-U that consists of front RS and rear RS and design a new collision minimization scheme, termed R-SplitC, that contains two components: new RS structure and contention window size (CWS) control. The new RS structure helps to minimize collisions in NR-U transmissions, and CWS control works to protect the performance of other communication technologies such as Wi-Fi. We mathematically analyze and evaluate the performance of our scheme and confirm that R-SplitC improves network throughput by up to 99.3% compared to the baseline RS scheme without degrading Wi-Fi performance.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519579","Collision;LTE-LAA;NR-U;reservation signal;unlicensed spectrum","Wireless fidelity;OFDM;3GPP;Throughput;Minimization;Standardization;Receivers","","4","","","","19 Aug 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

First, we manufacture three different groups of cells with different rear contact pitches, where the metallization fraction fmet varies between 0 and 54%. Second, the reflectance of the cells is measured. Subsequently, we fit the model parameters Rf and Rb (internal reflection on the front and back surface, respectively) to the measured reflectance. While we confirm a nonlinear relation between fmet and the measurable spectra found in previous works, our results reveal linear relations between fmet and Rb with the adjusted coefficients of determination of Radj2 > 0.97, as well as between fmet and the charge carrier generation rates with Radj2 > 0.94.

The mechanisms of IVS improvement by re-program scheme in 3D NAND are investigated. Both vertical de-trapping in the BE-tunneling oxide and charge lateral migration (LM) in the charge-trap layer are suppressed in re-program. Re-program is effective in vertical de-trapping suppression both in checker-board pattern (C/P) and solid-board pattern (S/P) cases, and is effective in LM suppression only in C/P case.

We exploit the difference in drain current activation energy, which arises with contact doping in polysilicon n-type contact-controlled transistors, to demonstrate output current with either a PTD or negative temperature dependence (NTD). The range over which output current varies linearly with temperature, as well as the sensitivity, can be tailored by the choice of reference current magnitude and relative source contact properties within the current mirror. The sensing scheme simplifies the circuit design because it relies solely on thin-film transistors and it has inherent immunity to output voltage variation. This ability to tune the sign of temperature dependence allows facile integration in applications requiring homeostasis via feedback, e.g., electronic skin, in a minimal layout area and potentially with convenient reduction of patterning steps during fabrication.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2021.3106276","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/R028559/1,EP/V002759/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524323","Activation energy;analog circuits;Schottky barrier;temperature dependence;temperature sensor;thin-film transistor (TFT)","Temperature sensors;Temperature dependence;Transistors;Sensors;Doping;Current mirrors;Logic gates","","4","","34","CCBY","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, square-wave drive, which is employed for permanent magnet brushless (BLDC) motors, is employed for the SynRM, in order to economically reduce the cost of rotor position sensor. It is revealed that the torque density and efficiency are slightly sacrificed, whereas torque ripple is deteriorated, proving the SynRM with square-wave drive still promising for the cost-sensitive application if torque ripple is not considered as a critical issue. To further investigate the additional pulsating torque under square-wave drive, mathematical model based on a-b-c phase inductance and d-q axis inductance are established, together with the time-stepping FE calculated currents. It is concluded that the harmonics in the currents tend to cause non-sinusoidal variation of the magnetic reluctance, which can be represented as additional inductance harmonics. The harmonics of the current and inductance interact with each other, thus undesirable torque ripple components are produced.","2096-3564","","10.30941/CESTEMS.2021.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666797","Synchronous reluctance machine;pulsating torque;square-wave drive;inductance;magnetic saturation","Torque;Rotors;Inductance;Torque measurement;Harmonic analysis;Magnetic flux;Saturation magnetization","","4","","","","30 Dec 2021","","","CES","CES Journals"

The proposed idea, called Gradual Extrapolation, can supplement any method that generates a heatmap picture by sharpening the output. Instead of producing a coarse localization map that highlights the important predictive regions in the image, the proposed method outputs the specific shape that most contributes to the model output. Thus, the proposed method improves the accuracy of saliency maps. The effect has been achieved by the gradual propagation of the crude map obtained in the deep layer through all preceding layers with respect to their activations. In validation tests conducted on a selected set of images, the faithfulness, interpretability, and applicability of the method are evaluated. The proposed technique significantly improves the localization detection of the neural networks' attention at low additional computational costs.

The same advantages occur at 20 kV, the TSM-JTE proving to have the best tradeoff between maximum breakdown voltage and implantation window, compared with other single implant termination designs, achieving this in 500 μm of termination length. At 3.3 kV, a 110-μm TSM-JTE retains its advantages over the other JTE designs, but floating field rings are expected to consume less area, though this is not the case at the higher voltages.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2020.3047348","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/R00448X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9325044","10 kV;20 kV;junction termination extension (JTE);power device;silicon carbide (SiC)","Implants;Electric breakdown;Silicon carbide;Optimization;Modulation;Junctions;Benchmark testing","","4","","14","CCBY","14 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The constellation reconfiguration problem faces the difficulties of high dimensionality of design variables and extremely large decision space due to the great and continuously growing constellation size. To solve such real-world problems that can be hardly solved by traditional algorithms, the evolutionary operators should be promoted with available domain knowledge to guide the algorithm to explore the promising regions of the trade space. An adaptive innovationdriven multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA-AI) employing automated innovation (AI) and adaptive operator selection (AOS) is proposed to extract and apply domain knowledge. The available knowledge is extracted from the final or intermediate solution sets and integrated into an operator by the automated innovation mechanism. To prevent the overuse of knowledge-dependent operators, AOS provides top-level management between the knowledge-dependent operators and conventional evolutionary operators. It evaluates and selects operators according to their actual performance, which helps to identify useful operators from the candidate set. The efficacy of the MOEA-AI framework is demonstrated by the simulation of emergency missions. It was verified that the proposed algorithm can discover a non-dominant solution set with better quality, more homogeneous distribution, and better adaptation to practical situations.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679718","constellation reconfiguration;emergency observations;rapid response;multi-objective optimization","Satellites;Orbits;Optimization;Technological innovation;Evolutionary computation;Heuristic algorithms;Fuels","","4","","","","12 Jan 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Some efforts have been made in the past to mitigate those potentials through decreasing ground resistance and/or increasing the spacing between the pipelines (PLs) and the substation grid. Such solution may prove in some cases to be impractical, inefficient, and costly. This paper proposes a novel method to reduce those conductive potentials down to safe values during those faults in the power network. A combination of a grounding passive grid (PGG) that passes under the PL together with a shielding wall would achieve this goal. The paper examines the relative effectiveness of the PGG and the wall by properly simulating them using finite-elements algorithms. The effects of the dimensions of the grid and wall on mitigating the produced potentials are investigated.

The TDC precision affects the ranging accuracy and, hence, the quality of the reconstructed 3D image. This brief studies the jitter of ring-oscillator-based TDCs as a function of their full-scale-range and derives an expression for the TDC total jitter. The introduced behavioral model describes three different regions of the SNR for TDCs. A peak-SNR design-point is identified. Increasing the full-scale-range of the TDC beyond this point entails increased jitter and, thus, ultimately a declining SNR. The analysis is validated using post-layout simulations of a ring-oscillator-based TDC designed in 65nm CMOS. A TDC resolution degradation factor defines the TDC jitter behavioral model. It is consistent with FOMs that have been used in the past to evaluate TDCs and clarifies their underlying assumptions.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2020.3023631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195173","Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC);LiDAR;single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD);time-to-digital converter (TDC);time-of-flight (TOF);ring oscillator;frequency divider;jitter;SNR;CMOS;figure-of-merit","Jitter;Phase noise;Ring oscillators;Photonics;Three-dimensional displays;Imaging","","4","","19","CCBY","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the SAK-AKA scheme, UE authentication is performed through an initial authentication processes session (IAPS) and subsequent authentication processes session (SAPS) phases to ensure that the UE is authorized to use the network services. In IAPS, the MME accesses the HSS to obtain the authentication parameters and takes the delegation from the HSS to execute the authentication process with the UE mutually. Since accessing the HSS is expensive, the HSS generates a number  $\left ({k }\right)$  of authentication vectors (AVs) and then sends them back to the MME as one unit at a time. SAPS is then executed  $\left ({k }\right)$  times to authenticate the UE without going back to the HSS. Therefore, it is useful to choose a specific value of  $\left ({k }\right)$  that would reduce the traffic cost. In this paper, we proposed an analytical cost function model to examine the effect of the  $\left ({k }\right)$  value on the transmission cost of authentication processes. The proposed model assumes that the signaling traffic of the SAK-AKA scheme is represented by a Poisson process where the authentication request time has an exponential distribution. This model was analyzed numerically to identify appropriate values of the ( $k$ -AVs) that can minimize the overhead messages cost of the SAK-AKA scheme.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3094045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9469738","3GPP;4G/5G mobile communication;LTE networks;SAK-AKA scheme;mutual authentication;Poisson process","Authentication;Cost function;Analytical models;Numerical models;Long Term Evolution;Servers","","4","","20","CCBYNCND","1 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When merged with the horizontal surface velocity and the numerical models, layer velocity can support the 3-D analysis of the ice flow and structure. Our aim is to provide the proof-of-concept demonstration that, similar to the side-looking synthetic aperture radar for imaging, the airborne radar sounder data can be used to estimate the subwavelength displacement of the englacial radio-stratigraphic layers. To achieve this, we use the phase and magnitude acquired repeatedly over the same region of interest. After the extraction of the crossing points, two acquisitions are finely registered. Then, we compute the interferometric phase for the englacial layers (which are shown to behave as PSs in the nadir sounding geometry), to estimate a vertical displacement and a velocity profile.

It is estimated that 50-75% of patients with conductive implants will need magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in their lifetime. A major risk of performing MRI in patients with elongated conductive implants is the radiofrequency (RF) heating of the tissue surrounding the implant’s tip due to the antenna effect. Currently, applying full-wave electromagnetic simulation is the standard way to predict the interaction of MRI RF fields with the human body in the presence of conductive implants; however, these simulations are notoriously extensive in terms of memory requirement and computational time. Here we present a proof-of-concept simulation study to demonstrate the feasibility of applying machine learning to predict MRI-induced power deposition in the tissue surrounding conductive wires. We generated 600 clinically relevant trajectories of leads as observed in patients with cardiac conductive implants and trained a feedforward neural network to predict the 1g-averaged SAR at the lead tips knowing only the background field of MRI RF coil and coordinates of points along the lead trajectory. Training of the network was completed in 11.54 seconds and predictions were made within a second with R2 = 0.87 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 14.5 W/kg. Our results suggest that machine learning could provide a promising approach for safety assessment of MRI in patients with conductive leads.Clinical Relevance— Machine learning can potentially allow real-time assessment of MRI RF safety in patients with conductive leads when only the knowledge of lead’s trajectory (image-based) and MRI RF coil features (vendor-specific) are in hand.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630718","Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630718","","Radio frequency;Heating systems;Training;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computational modeling;Wires;Machine learning","Heating;Hot Temperature;Humans;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging","4","","24","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When an inspection detects a minor defect, a second phase inspection is initiated and a regular order is placed. Product quality begins to deteriorate when the system undergoes a severe defect. To counter this, an advanced replacement of the minor defective system is carried out at the 7th second phase inspection. If a severe defect is recognized prior to the Jth inspection, or if system failure occurs, preventive or corrective replacement is executed. The timeliness of replacement depends on the availability of spare. We adopt two modes of ordering: a regular order and an emergency order. Meanwhile, a threshold level is introduced to determine whether an emergency order is preferred even when the regular order is already ordered but has not yet arrived. The optimal joint inspection-based maintenance and spare ordering policy is formulated by minimizing the expected cost per unit time. A simulation algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal two-phase inspection interval, threshold level and advanced replacement interval. Results from several numerical examples demonstrate that, in terms of the expected cost per unit time, our proposed model is superior to some existing models.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612139","maintenance;two-phase inspection;spare ordering;three-stage failure process;delay-time model","Inspection;Numerical models;Optimization;Costs;Quality control;Quality assessment;Product design","","4","","","","11 Nov 2021","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Its critical current density has strong anisotropy, particularly at 77 K. Because the single tape has limited capacity of carrying current, the cable or strand making of multi-tapes, stacked in parallel, is necessary. Within recent years, several cables, such as the Roebel cable, CORC cable, TSTC cable, TS cable, and the HTS-CroCo cable, were proposed. This paper presents a status and progress on a type of HTS strand made from REBCO tapes. Its quasi-isotropic critical current is experimentally confirmed for liquid nitrogen temperature, mechanical characteristics, AC losses, thermal stability, and quench characterizations are also researched.

As a new time service method, time transmission using FM broadcasting additional channel will not occupy new frequency resources, nor will it interfere with the original audio broadcasting A very useful technique. In this paper, we propose a new method for transmitting time information through an additional frequency modulation (FM) broadcasting channel, based on the existing FM broadcasting technology. As a result, the transmission and reception technology required is mature and readily available, which makes this approach accessible as well as affordable. A field test was conducted, which demonstrated that the proposed method is feasible and accurate.

Recently, nociceptive nerve function was observed by nociceptive detection thresholds (NDTs) and brain evoked potentials (EPs) during intra-epidermal electrical stimulation (IES) targeting Aδ-fibers. In this proof of principle, we studied whether it is possible to measure NDTs combined with EPs in DM patients with and without neuropathic pain. Furthermore, we explored the sensitivity of NDTs and EPs for polyneuropathy in these patients. Five DM patients diagnosed with painful neuropathy (DMp), five DM patients without painful neuropathy (DM), and five healthy controls (HC) were analyzed. These preliminary results showed that we can accurately measure NDTs and EPs in patients with diabetes. Strikingly, increased NDTs were found in DM and DMp compared to HC, of which the DMp showed the largest NDTs. This suggests that NDTs during IES could be a powerful biomarker for monitoring peripheral dysfunctions. Current EEG data of patients did not show any significant differences. The population needs to be enlarged before we can investigate the sensitivity of these NDTs and EPs to diabetic polyneuropathy and associated changes in nociceptive processing in more detail.Clinical Relevance— This proof of principle in a small group of patients with diabetes mellitus potentially treats the observation of the loss of nociceptive function occurring with small fiber neuropathy.

We begin by deriving the expected signal and interference powers, demonstrating that the signal-to-interference ratio decreases with correlation when users have the same correlation matrices, while it increases when their correlation matrices are different. These finite system results are then extended by deriving asymptotic signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio expressions for both analog and digital MRC for the benchmark scenarios of uncorrelated and perfectly correlated Rayleigh channels.

Considering that graph theory helps reveal the topological information in FC, in this paper, we propose a graph kernel-based clustering method to explore transdiagnostic biotypes using FC estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In our method, frequent subnetworks are identified from the whole-brain FCs of all subjects, and then the graph kernel similarity is computed to measure the relationship between subjects for clustering. Based on fMRI data of 137 SZ and 150 ASD subjects, we obtained meaningful biotypes using our method, which shows significant differences between the identified biotypes in FC. In brief, our graph kernel-based clustering method is promising for transdiagnostic biotype detection.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629618","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Institutes of Health; National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629618","Biotype;Transdiagnostic;Graph kernel;Schizophrenia;Autism spectrum disorder","Neuroimaging;Gold;Autism;Mental disorders;Clustering methods;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Thalamus","Autism Spectrum Disorder;Brain;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neuroimaging;Schizophrenia","3","","22","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike traditional methods which focus on building a 3D plane by Poisson distribution function, our method illustrates the key processes of 3D reconstruction: locating the camera based on global feature, estimating the scene’s relative depth from monocular panoramic images, and obtaining a high-quality 3D surface reconstruction. In the camera locating part, we use a global descriptor augmentation model to build a labeled panorama dataset GDAP, in which the images are captured by our designed spherical cameras; In the depth estimation part, we propose a new network UMDE that can estimate the depth of both indoor and outdoor scenes; Finally, in the 3D surface reconstruction section, we turn the reconstruction problem to a graph optimization problem, called GraphFit, in which, we optimize the point clouds with s-t graph and smoothing method successively. We conduct experiments on our own dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 3DMAP framework.

However, this approach does not capture the notion of device clustering. In this regard, this paper proposes a joint communication and caching optimization framework for clustered D2D networks. Devices are spatially distributed into disjoint clusters and are assumed to have a surplus memory that is utilized to proactively cache files, following a random probabilistic caching scheme. The cache offloading gain is maximized by jointly optimizing channel access and caching scheme. A closed-form caching solution is obtained and bisection search method is adopted to heuristically obtain the optimal channel access probability. Results show significant improvement in the offloading gain reaching up to 10% compared to the Zipf caching baseline.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623654","Caching;channel access;D2D communication;offloading gain","Device-to-device communication;Interference;Probabilistic logic;Transmitters;Performance evaluation;Optimization;Mobile handsets","","3","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Through the analysis and demonstration of above impedance models, CCF has the advantages of excellent stability and excellent power quality. Then, a direct harmonic suppression strategy based on CCF is proposed. The strategy takes the converter side current which contains richer low harmonic content as harmonic information source, and the control effect is more effective than the traditional strategy which uses capacitor current as harmonic information source.

By now, dual one-way ranging (DOWR) and two-way time transfer (TWTT) are generally integrated in the same software and hardware system to meet the limitations of small satellites in terms of size, weight and power (SWaP) consumption. However, studies show that pseudo-noise regenerative ranging (PNRR) performs better than DOWR if some advanced implementation technologies are employed. Besides, PNRR has no requirement on time synchronization. To apply PNRR to small satellites, and meanwhile, meet the demand for time difference measurement, we propose the round-way time difference measurement, which can be combined with PNRR to form a new integrated system without exceeding the limits of SWaP. The new integrated system can provide distributed small satellite systems with on-orbit high-accuracy and high-precision distance measurement and time difference measurement in real time.

This paper presents a hybrid finite element approach of magnetic field analysis for magnetic harmonic gears. The eccentric air gap region has been divided into three parts: two uniform layers, adjoining the stator and the rotor respectively, are treated as air gap elements; one non-uniform middle layer, as a variable air gap permeance, is discretized by FE meshes similar to the stator and the rotor. Mesh reconstruction can be avoided because the annular cylindrical rings of the two air gap elements are introduced. The mixed eccentric motion of the rotor can be easily treated. In order to save the computational time an equivalent motion mode is introduced and the sliding surface technique is applied by which the coefficient calculation of the air gap elements only needs to be done once wherever the rotor moves. The torques are calculated from the flux densities of the air gap elements. A prototype test confirms the validity of the prediction, and the accuracy of the obtained results is evaluated with FEM.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3071916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9399154","Hybrid finite element method;double air-gap element;eccentric magnetic harmonic gear","Rotors;Air gaps;Gears;Iron;Torque;Stators;Saturation magnetization","","3","","22","CCBY","8 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we present an open-source, 3D printable prosthetic bypass socket for below-elbow (transradial) amputations.

Human engineering activities may damage the permafrost growing environment, which in turn impact these engineering activities. Thus high spatial-temporal resolution monitoring over the QTEC in the permafrost region is very necessary. This paper presents a method for monitoring the frozen soil area using the intermittent coherence-based small baseline subset (ICSBAS). The method can improve the point density of the results and enhance the interpretability of deformation results by identifying the discontinuous coherent points according to the coherent value of time series. Using the periodic function that models the seasonal variation of permafrost, we separate the long wavelength atmospheric delay and establish an estimation model for the frozen soil deformation. Doing this can raise the monitoring accuracy and improve the understanding of the surface deformation of the frozen soil. In this study, we process 21 PALSAR data acquired by the Alos satellite with the proposed ICSBAS technique. The results show that the frozen soil far from the QTR in the study area experiences frost heave and thaw settlement (4.7 cm to 8.4 cm) alternatively, while the maximum settlement along the QTR reaches 12 cm. The interferomatric syntnetic aperture radar (In-SAR)-derived results are validated using the ground leveling data nearby the Beiluhe basin. The validation results show the InSAR results have good consistency with the leveling data in displacement rates as well as time series. We also find that the deformation in the permafrost area is correlated with temperature, human activities and topography. Based on the interfering degree of human engineering activities on the permafrost environment, we divide the QTEC along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway into engineering damage zone, transition zone and natural permafrost.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2021.000109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679699","permafrost;Qinghai-Tibet Plateau;small baseline subset interferomatric syntnetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR);deformation model","Strain;Monitoring;Soil;Ergonomics;Deformable models;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement","","3","","","","12 Jan 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

To address the existing problems of current tracking algorithms, as manifested by the time consumption of subgroup separation and the uneven group size of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for target tracking, a multitarget tracking control algorithm under local information selection interaction is proposed. First, on the basis of location, number, and perceived target information of neighboring UAVs, a temporary leader selection strategy is designed to realize the local follow-up movement of UAVs when the UAVs cannot fully perceive the target. Second, in combination with the basic rules of cluster movement and target information perception factors, distributed control equations are designed to achieve a rapid gathering of UAVs and consistent tracking of multiple targets. Lastly, the simulation experiments are conducted in two- and three-dimensional spaces. Under a certain number of UAVs, clustering speed of the proposed algorithm is less than 3s, and the equal probability of the UAV subgroup size after group separation is over 78%.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2021.0011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9475111","multitarget tracking;time-consuming grouping;local information selection interaction;temporary leader selection strategy;subgroup size","Target tracking;Mathematical model;Heuristic algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Task analysis;Aerodynamics","","3","","","","5 Jul 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

And since all individuals are involved his/her(a) health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted balance, not overruling one aspect with another one. Privacy remains key. The solution of the current pandemic's data collection can be based on a fully privacy-preserving application, which can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such as smartphones, while maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic and can be achieved in a democratic and very open, but still and especially privacy-protecting manner. Therefore, the WeTrace approach and application designed utilizes the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where public-key cryptography is being applied to allow for deciphering of messages for that destination it had been intended for.

This research paper aims to identify the filter method that will improve the performance of our previously proposed FF-SVM algorithm to find the minimum number of accurate genes that achieves high accuracy performance. Therefore, an experiment was conducted using four different filter methods: Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (mRMR), Joint Mutual Information (JMI), F-score, and Double Input Symmetrical Relevance (DISR). This experiment was undertaken in two phases: the first phase was filter to SVM, to identify the minimum number of features (genes) which served to maximize the SVM classifier; the second phase was filter to FF-SVM, to ascertain the best suite filter method to our previously proposed FF-SVM algorithm.

To reduce the burden on radiation oncologists, an automatic segmentation of the tumor contours would prove useful. To the best of our knowledge, automatic tumor contour segmentation has rarely been applied to cervical cancer treatment. In this study, diffusion-weighted images (DWI) of 98 patients with cervical cancer were acquired. We trained an automatic tumor contour segmentation model using 2D U-Net and 3D U-Net to investigate the possibility of applying such a model to clinical practice. A total of 98 cases were employed for the training, and they were then predicted by swapping the training and test images. To predict tumor contours, six prediction images were obtained after six training sessions for one case. The six images were then summed and binarized to output a final image through automatic contour segmentation. For the evaluation, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD) was applied to analyze the difference between tumor contour delineation by radiation oncologists and the output image. The DSC ranged from 0.13 to 0.93 (median 0.83, mean 0.77). The cases with DSC <0.65 included tumors with a maximum diameter < 40 mm and heterogeneous intracavitary concentration due to necrosis. The HD ranged from 2.7 to 9.6 mm (median 4.7 mm). Thus, the study confirmed that the tumor contours of cervical cancer can be automatically segmented with high accuracy.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrab070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579191","cervical cancer;automatic tumor contour segmentation;radiation therapy;diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI);Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)","","","3","","","","18 Oct 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this paper, a new sufficient criterion for the stability of two-dimensional linear shift-invariant discrete systems is presented. The new criterion is based on the sufficient condition for stable polynomials with complex coefficients and the stability criterion for 2-D discrete systems proposed by Murray and Delsarte et al..

To validate the app with participants we generated temporal intervals, using either sounds or vibratory stimuli, by implementing two versions of a Two-Alternative Forced-Choice (2AFC) task. Auditory and tactile temporal sensitivity of 12 participants was evaluated using this procedure. To investigate whether temporal abilities could be enhanced using the app, participants were then divided into two groups: one group was trained for four days on the auditory temporal task, while the other was trained for four days on the tactile temporal task. Results suggest that the app can i) effectively measure auditory and tactile temporal thresholds and ii) be used to enhance temporal abilities through perceptual learning. The accessibility of the experimental protocols, combined with our findings, fosters the app’s involvement in rehabilitation programs, for example, with a specific focus on sensory disabilities that are associated with temporal deficits (e.g., deafness and Parkinson).Clinical Relevance— The current work introduces a novel app that can be used to monitor and improve temporal abilities, in both the auditory and the tactile modalities.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630028","","Deafness;Sensitivity;Protocols;Hospitals;Tools;Particle measurements;Reliability","Deafness;Humans;Mobile Applications;Reproducibility of Results;Touch;Touch Perception","3","","13","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eventually most people living with dementia will need to reside in assisted living facilities as they become unable to care for themselves. Understanding the effects dementia has on ability to self-care and extending the length of time people living with dementia can remain living independently are key goals of dementia research and care. The networked radar system proposed in this paper is designed to provide high quality behavioural and health data from domestic environments. This is achieved using multiple radar sensors networked together with their data outputs integrated and processed to produce high confidence measures of position and movement.

Here, we propose a novel method that estimates critical features of these propagations for different epilepsy biomarkers (spikes, ripples, and fast ripples), and assess their common onset as a reliable biomarker of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). For each biomarker, an automatic algorithm ranked the icEEG electrodes according to their timing occurrence in propagations and finally dichotomized them as onset or spread. We validated our algorithm on icEEG recordings of 8 children with DRE having a good surgical outcome (Engel score = 1). We estimated the overlap of the onset, spread, and entire zone of propagation with the resection (RZ) and the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Spike and ripple propagations were seen in all patients, whereas fast ripple propagations were seen in 6 patients. Spike, ripple, and fast ripple propagations had a mean duration of 28.3 ± 24.3 ms, 38.7 ± 37 ms, and 25 ± 14 ms respectively. Onset electrodes predicted the RZ and SOZ with higher specificity compared to the entire zone for all three biomarkers (p<0.05). Overlap of spike and ripple onsets presented a higher specificity than each separate biomarker onset: for the SOZ, the onsets overlap was more specific (97.89 ± 2.36) than the ripple onset (p=0.031); for the RZ, the onsets overlap was more specific (98.48 ± 1.5) than the spike onset (p=0.016). Yet, the entire zone for spike and ripple propagations predicted the RZ with higher sensitivity compared to each biomarker’s onset (or spread) (p<0.05). We present, for the first time, preliminary evidence from icEEG data that fast ripples propagate in time across large areas of the brain. The onsets overlap of spike and ripple propagations constitutes an extremely specific (but not sensitive) biomarker of the EZ, compared to areas of spread (and entire areas) in propagation.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630250","","Electrodes;Pediatrics;Sensitivity;Epilepsy;Biomarkers;Electroencephalography;Timing","Child;Drug Resistant Epilepsy;Electrocorticography;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Humans;Seizures","3","","8","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulating the magnetization of these films using a temperature-dependent Stoner–Wohlfarth (SW) model indicates that the films have a very narrow angular distribution of anisotropy axis orientations. Here, we report a direct measurement of the angular distribution of anisotropy orientation by measuring the angular remanence after magnetic saturation. When magnetized to saturation in any direction away from the hard axis, these samples remain nearly uniformly magnetized, with the easy axis remnant magnetization very close to the saturation magnetization (> $0.97M_{S}$ ). When the angle ( $\alpha$ ) between the saturating field and the hard axis is  $\vert \alpha \vert < 1$ °, the easy axis remanence drops dramatically, indicating that the sample is no longer uniformly magnetized and has broken up into domains. When magnetized on the hard axis, the easy axis remanence approaches zero. The angular range over which the easy axis remanence drops significantly is a measure of the angular distribution of the anisotropy axes. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the easy axis remanence as a function of angle  $(\alpha)$  is approximately 0.44° for annealed nickel thin films on  $128^{\circ } Y$ -cut: LiNbO3.

Accurate and precise event locations are vital for the characterization of the microseismicity to help understand the reservoir response to the CO2 injection, whilst enabling the identification of minor faults and fractures below the resolution of conventional active seismic imaging. However, microseismic monitoring of fluid injection sites, such as Decatur, is often performed using a network of borehole sensors often from a single well. While these downhole sensors have excellent detection capabilities, their poor azimuthal coverage limits the ability to precisely determine event locations. We have developed a modified double-difference relocation algorithm suitable for both 1-D and 3-D velocity models, and which incorporates differential back azimuth observations to allow the benefits of the original double-difference algorithm to be applicable to a downhole microseismic monitoring setting. Applying the modified double-difference algorithm to the microseismicity at Decatur, we have successfully relocated 4293 events. The relocation included over 59 million observations for 757 285 event pairs, split across seven geographic regions. Despite the majority of observations being recorded in only two boreholes, with an almost identical azimuthal coverage, the results have shown to be reliable with significantly reduced residuals and low uncertainties associated with the final locations. We have analysed the residuals in terms of their association with each geographic region, data type, station and individual events, to fully appreciate their influence in the inversion and the fit of the data to the final set of event locations.

The optical path difference (OPD) leads to interference fringes, while the birefringence of the HBF results in a visibility envelop. It is possible to detect measurands associated with birefringence through measuring the visibility, which is attributed to a flexible use of the fundamental principle of interferometry. As one of the potential applications, temperature sensing employing the MI configuration is performed. Moreover, the technique has the advantage of being immune to element instabilities, such as power fluctuation of the light source, phase shift of the reference arm, noise of the photo detector, and wavelength shift of the optical spectrum analyzer (OSA).

This is enabled by the parallel read of the entire array in a single time step. However, parallel writing is prohibitive in such arrays due to limitations on the current that could be accumulated along the wires. Hence, loading the matrix elements into such an array still incurs significant time penalty. Another key challenge is the achievable computational precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unit-cell array design where each unit-cell comprises four memristive devices each attached to a selection transistor. Moreover, the array is organized in such a way that the selection transistors can be turned on in a diagonal fashion. We experimentally demonstrated this concept by fabricating a  $2\times 2$  unit-cell array based on projected phase-change memory (PCM) devices in 90 nm CMOS technology. It is shown that using the diagonal connections, the write operations can be parallelized while maintaining the current limit of the back-end-of-the-line metallization. Moreover, the increase in write time due to having more devices per unit-cell is minimized through a combination of single-shot and iterative programming schemes. Finally, we present experimental results on MVM operations that demonstrate improved computational precision exceeding that of a 4-bit fixed-point implementation.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2021.3078614","IBM Research AI Hardware Center (ibm.co/ai-hardware-center); European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:682675); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426955","In-memory computing;phase-change memory;analog computation","Programming;Phase change memory;Transistors;Performance evaluation","","3","","23","CCBY","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During the manufacturing and usage stages of planetary reducers, uncertainties are ubiquitous and wear is inevitable, which affect the transmission characteristics and the reliability of planetary reducers. In this paper, belief reliability modeling and analysis considering multi-uncertainties and wear are proposed for planetary reducers. Firstly, based on the functional principle and the influence of wear, the performance margin degradation model is established using the hysteresis error as the key performance parameter, where the degradation is mainly caused by the accumulated wear. After that, multi-source uncertainties are analyzed and quantified separately, including manufacturing errors, uncertainties in operational and environmental conditions, and uncertainties in performance thresholds. Finally, the belief reliability model is established based on the performance margin degradation model. A case study of a planetary reducer is applied and the reliability sensitivity analysis is implemented to show the practicability of the proposed method.

For this purpose, we developed modified broadband Wilkinson power dividers, which enable the operation of two or four Josephson junction series arrays per RF channel of the pulse pattern generator and thus the generation of increased output voltages. In detail, we designed and investigated two different Wilkinson power dividers: the one-stage three-section Wilkinson power divider with extended bandwidth and the two-stage single-section Wilkinson divider with more outputs to combine four parallel series arrays. They were both integrated with triple-stacked Josephson junction series arrays. Additionally, a new modulator pulse amplifier was introduced into the JAWS set-up to provide sufficient power for all the junction arrays. Our measurement results show that spectrally pure sinusoidal waveforms were successfully generated with both types of power dividers.

Generally, such speckles can be modulated by feedback-based wavefront shaping, as exemplified by the generation of a bright focal spot. However, it is more challenging to generate a specific focal pattern with uniform intensity distribution. In this study, the Hadamard–Genetic algorithm (HGA), namely a hybrid phase modulation scheme of Hadamard encoding algorithm (HEA) and genetic algorithm (GA), is proposed to face these challenges. This algorithm takes advantages of the high intensity of HEA and the high uniformity of GA and outperforms traditional optimization schemes, especially in suppressing intensity fluctuations of the focal pattern.

To extend the monitoring capability in the salt desert area, we select a vast basin of saline soil around Howz-e-Soltan Salt Lake of Iran as the study area and present an improved MT-InSAR for experimental research. Based on 131 C-band Sentinel-1A images collected between October 2014 to July 2020,1896 refined interferograms in total are selected from all interfero-gram candidates. Interferometric coherence analysis shows that the coherence in the saline soil area has an apparent seasonal variation, and the soil moisture affected by the precipitation may be the main factor that leads to the seasonal variation. Subsequently, the deformation characteristics of saline soil under different environmental conditions and human activity factors are compared and analyzed in detail. Related deformation mechanisms of different saline soil types are initially revealed by combining interferometric coherence, meteorological data, and engineering geological characteristics of saline soil.

By flexibly adjusting the controlled switch's contact states based on the system operational conditions, the coupling transformer's primary inductance as well as the YBCO coil's normal-state resistance are incorporated into the main system for current limitation. Because the modified SFCL has the advantages of resistive and inductive SFCLs, it may improve the power system's transient behavior. Hence, the SFCL's effect on the transient stability of a multi-machine power system was also theoretically investigated. Further, simulations were conducted for accessing the SFCL's performance characteristics under different fault conditions.

The AC voltage output of the inverter bridge is superimposed on both ends of the soft-start resistor along with the grid. The open-loop control method is adopted to gradually reduce the modulation ratio of the sinusoidal PWM wave until the capacitor voltage on the DC side reaches the rated voltage value, then the soft-start resistor is removed, which means the shock-free soft-start process is completed.

However, due to coverage limitations of millimeter wave cells and lack of coverage data in UDHNs, discovering coverage lapses in such 5G networks may become a major challenge. Recently, numerous studies have explored machine learning-based techniques to detect coverage holes and cell outages in legacy networks. Majority of these techniques are susceptible to noise in the coverage data and only characterize outages in the spatial domain. Thus, the temporal impact of an outage, i.e., the duration of its presence remains unidentified. In this paper, for the first time, we present an outage detection solution that characterizes outages in both space and time while also being robust to noise in the coverage data. We do so by employing entropy field decomposition (EFD) which is a combination of information field theory and entropy spectrum pathways theory. We demonstrate that compared to other techniques such as independent component analysis and k-means clustering, EFD returns accurate detection results for outage detection even in the presence of heavy shadowing in received signal strength data which makes it ideal for practical implementation in emerging mobile cellular networks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056551","Qatar National Research Fund(grant numbers:NPRP12-S0311-190302); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1559483,1619346,1730650); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9344593","Heterogeneous Network;Self Healing;Outage Detection;Millimeter Wave;Information Field Theory;Entropy Spectrum Pathways","Shadow mapping;Cellular networks;Support vector machines;Data models;Quality of experience;Predictive models;Planning","","3","","","CCBY","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, there are still a limited number of studies on bathroom activities monitoring using a wrist-mounted accelerometer. To fill this gap, in this study, researchers collected data from 15 older adults wearing a wrist-mounted accelerometer. Six bathroom activities, i.e., dressing, undressing, brushing teeth, using toilet, washing face, and washing hands, were investigated. In total, 49.4-hour data for bathroom activities were collected. A hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced for bathroom activity recognition. This hybrid CNN model is developed using both hand-crafted and CNN-based features as input. The proposed hybrid CNN model is compared to four machine learning models, i.e., Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees (DT), and a conventional CNN model. Based on the classification results of leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO), the hybrid CNN model outperformed the other models. The hybrid CNN model is also tested based on a transfer learning method. As a calibration step based on LOSO, the transfer learning method additionally trains the model with an example of each activity from the test subject. The transfer learning method obtained better classification performance than LOSO. With transfer learning, the f1-score for using toilet was improved from 0.7784 to 0.8437. This study proposes a deep learning model fusing hand-crafted features and CNN-based features. Besides, the transfer learning method offers a way to build subject-dependent models to improve the classification performance.Clinical relevance –This provides a model that helps monitoring older adults' bathroom activities using a single wrist-mounted accelerometer.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630659","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630659","","Accelerometers;Deep learning;Support vector machines;Biological system modeling;Face recognition;Transfer learning;Multilayer perceptrons","Accelerometry;Aged;Deep Learning;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer;Toilet Facilities;Wrist","3","","13","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A fundamental parameter for operations of TES detectors for the desired application is the superconducting critical temperature TC. We are developing TES based bolometers made of metallic Ti films, with an operating temperature of 500 mK, to be used for cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. We have observed that electron-beam evaporation grown Ti films can reach critical temperatures higher than 500 mK when the substrate temperature is kept below some temperature threshold. Discordant critical temperatures of Titanium TES are found in literature and very little information is available about the various TC and relative fabrication process. Critical temperature of Ti films is generally known to be affected by deposition methods, substrates, processing conditions and heating. In the past we tried to tune the critical temperature of titanium thin films by means of post-annealing and we found a regular decrease of TC from 540 mK to 360 mK, in this work we confirm this effect. Further, we have found that titanium film grows with a most stable hcp structure. The annealing process until 260 °C, does not modify the morphological features of the film. We find also evidences of a shift in XRD peaks that indicate structural changes of the lattice parameters, which could play a role in the TC modification.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2021.3071997","INFN; LSPE; ASI; COSMOS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9399281","Critical temperature;morphological and structural analysis;Superconducting transitions;TES;Thin Film","Annealing;Films;Temperature measurement;Grain size;X-ray scattering;Titanium;Substrates","","3","","17","CCBY","8 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, face masks act as filters to the human voice. This work focuses on the automatic detection of face masks from speech signals, emphasising on a previous work claiming that face masks attenuate frequencies above 1 kHz. We compare a paralinguistics-based and a spectrograms-based approach for the task at hand. While the former extracts paralinguistic features from filtered versions of the original speech samples, the latter exploits the spectrogram representations of the speech samples containing specific ranges of frequencies. The machine learning techniques investigated for the paralinguistics-based approach include Support Vector Machines (SVM), and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). For the spectrograms-based approach, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our experiments are conducted on the Mask Augsburg Speech Corpus (MASC), released for the Interspeech 2020 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge (COMPARE). The best performances on the test set from the paralinguistic analysis are obtained using the high-pass filtered versions of the original speech samples.

The MVB processor is an eigen-processor that is based on the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. It is multi-valued in the sense that an ambiguity surface is constructed for each member of a subset of the eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues. The motivation for the approach is the fact that energy from different sources tends to partition into different eigenvectors. One of the advantages of the MVB processor on a rectangular array is that it is possible to determine if the partitioning is favorable without computing replica fields, which is often the most time-consuming task of matched-field processing computations.

Specifically, the default TMO leads to a reduced dynamic range of the tone-mapped LDR images. Very often, the reduction can be severe. The mechanism of causing the dynamic range reduction stems from an implementation bug. To resolve the issue, the correction of adding the missed final normalization step to linearly stretch the dynamic range needs to be made. The second imperfection is the highlights clipping in the LDR images from the default TMO of profile B. The clipping could lead to unusable LDR images.

Unpowered ankle-foot exoskeletons are the current development trend due to their lightweight, wearable, and energy-free features, but the huge recognition and energy control system still affects their practicability. To refine the recognition and control system, we designed an unpowered soft ankle-foot exoskeleton with a purely mechanical self-adaptiveness clutch, which can realize the collection and release of energy according to different gait stage. Through switching and closing of this clutch, energy is collected when the ankle is doing negative work and released when the ankle is doing positive work. Results shows the unpowered ankle-foot exoskeleton at the stiffness of 12000 N/m could relieve muscles’ load, with reduction of force by 52.3 % and 5.2%, and of power by 44.2% and 7.0%, respectively for soleus and gastrocnemius in simulation.Clinical Relevance—The proposed Unpowered Ankle-Foot Exoskeleton can both reduce muscle forces and powers. Hence, it can be used to assist walking of the elderly, others with neurocognitive disorders or leg diseases.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630707","Science and Technology Development Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630707","","Legged locomotion;Exoskeletons;Senior citizens;Force;Prototypes;Switches;Muscles","Aged;Ankle;Ankle Joint;Exoskeleton Device;Gait;Humans;Walking","2","","15","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The hemisphere reflector is not only used for photon recycling to increase the energy efficiency but also to keep the energy efficiency nearly unchanged when the number of the multiplexing laser increases. The experimental measurement shows that the photon recycling with the hemisphere reflector can increase the energy efficiency from 36.2% to 53.3% for on-axis incidence, and 35.2% to 55.7% for off-axis incidence. Besides, the efficiency keeps the same up to three-laser multiplexing in the experiment, and potentially can be extended to more than 10 in the simulation for various hole structures. The result is not only on the efficiency enhancement but also on the enhanced exitance of the laser white light and the unchanged etendue of the light source.

However, modern BCIs often take large setup times and are physically restrictive, making them impractical for everyday use. In this paper, we use a mobile and easy-to-setup EEG device to investigate whether an erroneously functioning 1-DOF exoskeleton in different conditions, namely, visually observing and wearing the exoskeleton, elicits a brain response that can be classified. We develop a pipeline that can be applied to these two conditions and observe from our experiments that there is evidence for neural responses from electrodes near regions associated with ErrPs in an environment that resembles the real world.

The night-time dip or rise in BP (10-20% decrease or increase compared to daytime BP), for example, has been shown to be a strong indicator for cardiovascular disease. However, current methods for assessing the circadian rhythms of BP can be disruptive to sleep, work, and daily activities. Pulse arrival time (PAT) has been suggested as a surrogate measure of BP. This work investigates the presence of a circadian rhythm in PAT and evaluates its application to classify nocturnal BP dip or rise. 769 patients who were discharged home from the ICU were selected from the MIMIC database. Our results show a clear and observable circadian rhythm of PAT that is strongly inversely correlated with BP (r = −0.89). The ratios between nocturnal and diurnal changes in PAT accurately classifies an individual as a nocturnal BP dipper (AUC = 0.72) or a riser (AUC = 0.71).Clinical Relevance—This work shows that you can accurately assess an individuals’s circadian rhythm of BP using PAT.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629883","","Hypertension;Minimally invasive surgery;Pulse measurements;Databases;Wearable computers;MIMICs;Blood pressure","Blood Pressure;Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory;Circadian Rhythm;Heart Rate;Humans;Hypertension","2","","11","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Phenomenological Model of Gate-Dependent Kink in I-V Characteristics of MoS2 Double-Gate FETs","M. A. Rodder; A.

The effect is studied in double-gate FETs by varying top-gate voltage (VTG) and bottom-gate voltage (VBG), with the MoS2 semiconductor layer overlying source/drain (S/D) metal contacts in contact regions. The kink in ID-VTG characteristics is observed for small negative VBG but not for large negative VBG. The model divides the FET into S/D and channel regions, with bias-dependent S/D resistance (RSD) and channel resistance (RCHAN), and with S/D regions having an additional interface state distribution (additional to any interface states associated with semiconductor/dielectric interfaces in the channel region) due to an imperfect metal-semiconductor interface where MoS2 overlies S/D metal. The additional interface states are modeled as a Gaussian distribution of acceptor-like states in the upper region of the semiconductor bandgap. When RSD ≥ RCHAN (VBG less negative), filling of these acceptor-like states as VTG increases creates a kink in ID-VTG characteristics since RSD is a major component of overall resistance limiting drain current, ID. Conversely, when RSD << RCHAN (VBG more negative), filling of these acceptor-like states as VTG increases does not create an ID-VTG kink since RSD is not the major component of resistance limiting ID. The model highlights 1) metal-semiconductor interface states need to be accounted for when modeling MoS2 FETs, and 2) importance of forming metal-semiconductor interfaces with low interface state density to avoid I-V kinks which are detrimental for analog applications.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2021.3073129","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-1938179); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9404298","MoS₂;double-gate FET;I-V kink;interface states;phenomenological model","Interface states;Dielectrics;Molybdenum compounds;Resistance;Double-gate FETs","","2","","22","CCBY","14 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the theories of biology and cognition, the trial solutions based on emotional memory are established. Three search strategies are designed for realizing the random search of trial solutions and for avoiding becoming trapped in a local minimum. The states of the trial solutions are determined according to the rules of memory enhancement and forgetting. As the iterations proceed, the trial solutions with poor quality will gradually be forgotten. Therefore, the number of trial solutions is decreased, and the convergence of the algorithm is accelerated.

The overall goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a myoelectric-powered wearable orthosis (MPWO) manufactured by MyoMo, Inc. (Boston, MA) for UE movement assistance on ameliorating UE motor function in order to improve ADL and quality of life in people with SCI.

Handgrip strength, active range of motion (AROM) of the hand, response time to initiate a movement, and muscles activations were examined before and after the rehabilitation training using the MPWO. The response time to initiate UE movements decreased, and handgrip strength and AROM improved after training with the MPWO. These preliminary data suggest that rehabilitation with the use of the UE-MPWO device could enhance the participants’ UE activities that led to improved function.Clinical Relevance— These preliminary results from two individuals with iSCI suggest that training with UE-MPWO assistive devices may improve UE utilization during ADL for individuals with muscle weakness or paralysis but still possessing residual voluntary muscle activation capabilities.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630972","Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630972","","Training;Muscles;Electromyography;Biology;Paralysis;Time factors;Spinal cord injury","Activities of Daily Living;Adult;Hand Strength;Humans;Male;Orthotic Devices;Quality of Life;Spinal Cord Injuries;Upper Extremity;Wearable Electronic Devices","2","","24","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is largely due to methodological reasons. On the one hand, machine learning methods have shown their potential in maximizing performance for user mental states classification. On the other hand, the issues related to the necessary and frequent calibration of algorithms and to the temporal resolution of the measurement (i.e. how long it takes to have a reliable state measure) are still unsolved. This work explores the performances of a passive BCI system for mental effort monitoring consisting of three frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) channels. In particular, three calibration approaches have been tested: an intra-subject approach, a cross-subject approach, and a free-calibration procedure based on the simple average of theta activity over the three employed channels. A Random Forest model has been employed in the first two cases. The results obtained during multi-tasking have shown that the cross-subject approach allows the classification of low and high mental effort with an AUC higher than 0.9, with a related time resolution of 45 seconds. Moreover, these performances are not significantly different from the intra-subject approach although they are significantly higher than the calibration-free approach. In conclusion, these results suggest that a light (three EEG channels) passive BCI system based on a Random Forest algorithm and cross-subject calibration could be a simple and reliable tool for out-of-the-lab employment.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630613","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630613","","Employment;Tools;Particle measurements;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Calibration","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Calibration;Electroencephalography","2","","17","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The major challenge of automatic 3D segmentation of COVID-19 from CT volumes lies in the inadequacy of datasets and the wide variations of pneumonia lesions in their appearance, shape, and location. In this paper, we introduce a novel network called Comprehensive 3D UNet (C3D-UNet). Compared to 3D-UNet, an intact encoding (IE) strategy designed as residual dilated convolutional blocks with increased dilation rates is proposed to extract features from wider receptive fields. Moreover, a local attention (LA) mechanism is applied in skip connections for more robust and effective information fusion.

Although this topic may include a large set of methodologies based on varied digital features (MFCC, Centroid, Harmonicity, VOT, etc., cf. [1]), this work approaches the theme from a phonetic perspective, taking into consideration the vowel formants, and focusing on their variability and difficulty of measurement. Formants correspond to the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract and are, therefore, sensible to specific speaker-related variations such as age and sex. In this respect, formants' variation contributes to characterizing the subjective timbre of the person. For this reason, formants' values are largely used in forensics [2], with all the practical problems that come with them, and in particular when dealing with speaker recognition or discrimination [3], [4]. Indeed, formants' values correspond to specific frequencies of the sound signal and are usually reported in Hertz. They are, however, affected by numerous internal and external variables, so that although on average they are characteristic of the individual speaker, they always vary within frequency bands that cannot be defined in absolute terms [5]. How, then, is it possible to provide reliable answers to forensic questions? In essence, it is up to the specialist to determine if there are the conditions to carry out an analysis, and to understand, for example, whether the differences between formants' values could be ascribed to two different speakers or the difference is too subtle to justify this claim. What should be measurable today, and must be defined at the level of jurisprudence, is therefore the professionalism of the expert. However, this is still heterogeneous in different countries, although several codes of practice such as the International Association for Forensic Phonetics or engineering society ones have been validated.","1941-0123","","10.1109/MIM.2021.9345600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345600","","Speech analysis;Forensics;Phonetics;Speaker Recognition;Timbre;Resonant frequency","","2","","12","IEEE","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, optimizing the Helmholtz equation solution for better performance and higher efficiency has been an urgent task. An optimization scheme for the parallel solution of the Helmholtz equation is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the geometrical multigrid optimization strategy is designed by taking advantage of the data anisotropy of grid points near the pole and the isotropy of those near memory equator in the Helmholtz equation, and the Incomplete LU (ILU) decomposition preconditioner is adopted to speed up the convergence of the improved Generalized Conjugate Residual (GCR), which effectively reduces the number of iterations and the computation time. The overall solving performance of the Helmholtz equation is improved by thread-level parallelism, vectorization, and reuse of data in the cache. The experimental results show that the proposed optimization scheme can effectively eliminate the bottleneck of the Helmholtz equation as regards the solving speed. Considering the test results on a 10-node two-way server, the solution of the Helmholtz equation, compared with the original serial version, is accelerated by 100×, with one-third of iterations reduced.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2019.9010057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9220759","Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES);Helmholtz equation;Generalized Conjugate Residual (GCR);performance optimization;Incomplete LU (ILU)","Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Parallel processing;Pipelines;Numerical models;Optimization;Atmospheric modeling","","2","","","","12 Oct 2020","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

This system, based on a rotating-coil magnetometer, has been developed to meet the accuracy requirements imposed by the inner-triplet quadrupoles for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project at CERN. The main field strength of the magnet must be measured with an accuracy of 100 ppm, and the required accuracy for the angle and the axis are 0.1 mrad and 0.1 mm, respectively. All these parameters must be measured both locally and integrated over the entire magnet length at various stages of production. In this way, it is possible to intercept the manufacturing errors at an early stage of production. Moreover, these measurements are used for the alignment of the magnet assembly in its cryostat. The measurements are performed at an ambient temperature, with low excitation currents. The presented system provides a full set of data for the characterization of the magnet in a single measurement run, including the field quality (multipole field errors) and the magnetic axis location at several longitudinal positions in the magnet bore. The system is able to achieve the required accuracy by using induction coils based on the printed circuit board (PCB) technology, a high-resolution encoder, and retro-reflectors for the laser tracker positioned directly on the PCB.

The coupling efficiency of the POF liquid leakage sensor varies with the depth and angle of the VDCS. Experimental results show that the coupling efficiency of the POF leakage sensor is high when the VDCS depth is 0.5 mm and the inclination angle is 60°.

It has been widely used in natural languages processing tasks such as event detection and sentiment classification. The existing multimodal neural network machine translation is mostly based on the autoencoder framework of the attention mechanism, which further integrates spatial-visual features. However, due to the ubiquitous lack of corpus and the semantic interaction between multimodalities, the quality of machine translation is difficult to guarantee. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-modal machine translation model that integrates external linguistic knowledge. Specifically, on the encoder side, we adopt the pre-trained Bert model to be used as an additional encoder to integrate with the original text encoder and picture encoder. Under the cooperation of the three encoders, a better text representation and picture representation at the source end is generated. Besides, the decoder decodes and generates a translation based on the image and text representation of the source. To sum up, this paper studies the visual-text semantic interaction on the encoder side and the visual-text semantic interaction on the decoder side, and further improves the quality of translation by introducing external linguistic knowledge. We compared the performance of the multimodal neural network machine translation model with pre-trained Bert and other baseline models in English German translation tasks on the multi30k data sets. The results show that the model can significantly improve the quality of multimodal neural network machine translation, which also verifies the importance of integrating external knowledge and visual text semantic interaction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115135","Industry University Research Collaboration Project between Ningde city and Xiamen university(grant numbers:2020C001); Science and Technology Guiding Project of Fujian Province China(grant numbers:2019Y0046); External Cooperation Project of Fujian Province China(grant numbers:2019I0001); Key Project of National Key R and D Project(grant numbers:2017YFC1703303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9547270","Multi-domain;Machine Translation;Semantic Interaction;External Knowledge","Machine translation;Semantics;Neural networks;Bit error rate;Visualization;Task analysis;Data models","","2","","","CCBY","23 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In that context, a cluster layout of prototype internal tin Nb3Sn wires, developed by TVEL and the Bochvar Institute (Russia), was analyzed and compared to a standard layout produced by the same manufacturer. The main reason for dividing the sub-element into clusters is reducing the effective sub-element size (deff). The microstructural characterization of such a wire layout can provide fundamental contributions to steer the manufacturing processes towards higher performing wires. In particular, since the homogeneity in Sn concentration influences the superconducting properties, the effect of cluster and standard layouts on the Sn concentration gradient over the wire cross-section was evaluated. For this purpose, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was employed with both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finally, scanning Hall probe microscopy (SHPM) measurements were performed to understand how these cluster wire sub-elements, with their specific geometry, influence the local currents flowing through the wire cross-section on a microscopic scale.

Experimentally, DNIC is often induced by conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigms such as a Cold Pressor Test (CPT). Recently, a method called the NDT-EP method has been developed with the aim to evaluate the nociceptive function, which it does via simultaneous tracking of nociceptive detection thresholds (NDT) and evoked potentials (EP). It remains to be investigated whether we can evaluate DNIC via the NDT-EP method. In this study, we take the first step to investigate this by evaluating the feasibility to combine the NDT-EP method with a 7 minutes CPT. In total 20 participants of a wide age-range were measured before, during, and after a CPT. All except 1 participant were able to complete the protocol, and enough stimulus-response pairs could be obtained for psychophysical as well as electrophysiological evaluation. Preliminary analysis of the NDT’s and EP’s showed results in line with earlier research such as a higher threshold for nociceptive stimuli and a lower EP amplitudes. Several NDT’s of mostly elderly people (59±16 years), however, exceeded the maximum applicable stimulus strength during (7/20) or after (9/20) CPT and consequently had to be excluded from the analysis. To what extent this is a consequence of the CPT or other factors such as strong habituation associated more with elderly people, is subject to further investigation. In conclusion, the results of this study show that with the present protocol, it is feasible to combine the NDT-EP method with a CPM paradigm in almost all subjects, but that the NDT data of mostly older subjects could not be properly analyzed.

In the literature, phase distortion issues are generally circumvented by means of a background wave velocity model. However, it requires a prior tomography of the wave velocity distribution in the medium, which is often not possible, especially in depth. In this paper, a matrix approach of seismic imaging is developed to retrieve a 3-D image of the subsoil, despite a rough knowledge of the background wave velocity. To do so, passive noise cross-correlations between geophones of a seismic array are investigated under a matrix formalism. They form a reflection matrix that contains all the information available on the medium. A set of matrix operations can then be applied in order to extract the relevant information as a function of the problem considered. On the one hand, the background seismic wave velocity can be estimated and its fluctuations quantified by projecting the reflection matrix in a focused basis. It consists in investigating the response between virtual sources and detectors synthesized at any point in the medium. The minimization of their cross-talk can then be used as a guide star for approaching the actual wave velocity distribution. On the other hand, the detrimental effect of wave velocity fluctuations on imaging is overcome by introducing a novel mathematical object: The distortion matrix. This operator essentially connects any virtual source inside the medium with the distortion that a wavefront, emitted from that point, experiences due to heterogeneities. A time reversal analysis of the distortion matrix enables the estimation of the transmission matrix that links each real geophone at the surface and each virtual geophone in depth. Phase distortions can then be compensated for any point of the underground. Applied to passive seismic data recorded along the Clark branch of the San Jacinto fault zone (SJFZ), the present method is shown to provide an image of the fault until a depth of 4 km over the frequency range 10–20Hz with an horizontal resolution of 80 m. Strikingly, this resolution is almost one eighth below the diffraction limit imposed by the geophone array aperture. The heterogeneities of the subsoil play the role of a scattering lens and of a transverse waveguide which increase drastically the array aperture. The contrast is also optimized since most of the incoherent noise is eliminated by the iterative time reversal process. Beyond the specific case of the SJFZ, the reported approach can be applied to any scales and areas for which a reflection matrix is available at a spatial sampling satisfying the Nyquist criterion.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623930","Body waves;Crustal imaging;Seismic noise;Wave scattering and diffraction","","","2","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This paper has carried out experimental research on the flow pattern in the liquid box of the surface-mounted evaporative cooling system and establish a mathematical prediction model of flow pattern transition. The experimental results show that the flow patterns are mainly bubble flow, churn flow, and misty flow in the liquid box of the surface-mounted evaporative cooling system under different thermal loads. By comparing observed flow patterns with existing flow pattern diagrams, it can be found that the existing flow pattern diagrams are not suitable for the flow pattern division of surface-mounted evaporative cooling system. A new flow pattern diagram is proposed based on the change of interfacial area concentration in the liquid box. The prediction results of the new flow pattern diagram are in good agreement with the experimental data, which provides valuable insights into the flow pattern and paves the way for further boiling heat transfer calculation of surface-mounted evaporative cooling system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3050240","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51777201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317813","Evaporative cooling;flow pattern;visualization;transition correlation","Liquids;Mathematical model;Heat transfer;Heating systems;Thermal loading;Predictive models;Coolants","","2","","24","CCBY","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna consists of three exponentially tapered slots excited by a single microstrip line. The three slots are series fed simultaneously with a radial stub on the microstrip feed line for impedance matching. The proposed antenna covers a frequency of 7.8-11.8 GHz at −10 dB impedance bandwidth. The antenna gain varies from 7.5 dB at the lowest operating frequency and increases to around 9.5 dB at the center frequency of 10 GHz. A key versatility of the proposed design is the ability to modify the ground plane size without affecting the antenna impedance and gain. This makes the antenna suitable to incorporate RADAR transceiver components without modifying the existing antenna design. The proposed antenna is fabricated and measured results show good agreement with simulated results.","2637-6431","","10.1109/OJAP.2021.3112786","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/R511705/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538818","Vivaldi antenna;RADAR;slot antenna","Slot antennas;Antennas;Gain;Antenna measurements;Bandwidth;Radar antennas;Impedance","","2","","20","CCBY","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, an all-fiber 920-nm femtosecond pulse source is experimentally demonstrated by using Cherenkov radiation. The 4-nJ 150-fs 1550-nm amplified seed pulse source ensures highly efficient 920-nm pulse generation. Cherenkov radiation is stimulated by inputting the high-energy ultrashort pulse to a highly nonlinear fiber. The dispersion values of the highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) are carefully chosen to generate CR pulses at 920 nm. The generated pulse has a 150-pJ single pulse energy and a 232-fs pulse duration. The typical 30-nm bandwidth can support a sub-50-fs transform-limited pulse duration. The pump current can be adjusted to tune the central wavelength of the pulse source over 905-930 nm. This very simple approach can generate 920-nm femtosecond pulses. The wavelength range is useful for a wide range of applications, such as two-photon microscopy (TPM) in bio-imaging and so on.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3058650","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61665002,61675132); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352776","Fiber laser;laser mode locking;nonlinear optics","Optical fiber amplifiers;Optical fiber dispersion;Ultrafast optics;Oscillators;Laser mode locking;Optical pumping;Fiber lasers","","2","","23","CCBY","11 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Starting with a texture boundaries extraction, we obtain the possibility of texture boundary by the statistics of the proportion of the pixels in different colors. The possibility of texture boundary can be obtained by calculating the Bhattacharyya distance of the color proportion on each side of each pixel. Further, we build a filtering scale map to guide the parameters of the filter. This filtering scale map is based on the texture boundary. Finally, to obtain the texture filtering result, we design an adaptive shape edge-preserving filter which is simple and effective. By counting the color information of all pixel neighborhoods the filter can select the pixels in a similar color to filter. Experiments are performed on different color-texture images, and the results show that our proposed method performs much better compared with state-of-the-art methods on texture filtering.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583288","Texture filtering;texture boundary;image smoothing;edge-preserving filter","Image color analysis;Optical filters;Image edge detection;Information filters;Smoothing methods;Detectors;Feature extraction","","2","","34","CCBY","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
